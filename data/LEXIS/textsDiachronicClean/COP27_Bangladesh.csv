The Prime Minister's spokesman previously said participation in the climate talks would depend on progress on a domestic budget statement due on Nov 17, reports Reuters. ""There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables,"" Sunak wrote on Twitter. He said he was attending the summit to ""deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future"" - a reference to an agreement at last year's event that Britain hosted. The deal was meant to keep alive the world's chance of averting the worst impacts of global warming. Climate activists, opposition politicians and even some within his own party criticised Sunak after his office said last week he was not expected to attend the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference . ""The prime minister has been shamed into going to COP27 by the torrent of disbelief that he would fail to turn up,"" the opposition Labour Party's climate policy spokesperson Ed Miliband said. ""He is going to avoid embarrassment not to provide leadership."" Britain's COP26 president Alok Sharma, who had been critical of Sunak's initial decision, said he was delighted the prime minister would attend the conference. Meanwhile, former British prime minister Boris Johnson, who hosted world leaders at last year's COP26 in Glasgow, said he would attend COP27 . ""I was invited by the Egyptians,"" he told Sky News in an interview on Tuesday. ""I want to talk a little bit about how I see things and how we see things in the UK."" Separately Britain, late on Tuesday said it would delay until Dec 8 a decision on a new coal mine in Cumbria, northern England, meaning news on whether the project will go ahead will not emerge until after the climate talks have finished. Britain has a climate target to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and the government's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have said this target would be more difficult if the mine goes ahead. ""The run-up to next week's climate summit was an ideal opportunity for the government to rebuild its battered green credentials by rejecting this damaging and unnecessary coal mine. It's a shame they didn't seize it,"" Friends of the Earth (FoE) energy campaigner Tony Bosworth said. The Cumbria mine is being developed by privately owned West Cumbria Mining, which has said the project to extract coking coal for the steel industry would create around 500 jobs.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh4","COP27: Developed countries keen to fund vulnerable countries, says Hasan Mahmud","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Information and Broadcasting Minister Hasan Mahmud has said that developed countries have decided to fund climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh under a 'loss and damage' programme at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of The Parties, popularly called COP27 . 'Bangladesh is incurring huge losses and damages due to frequent natural disasters like floods and cyclones, which are direct results of climate change. The good news is that the world has recognised these problems of ours. These issues are being widely discussed at this year's conference, and countries like Denmark and Belgium have promised to provide money to tackle these crises,' Hasan said. Hasan added that the topic of Climate Finance has become a burning issue at this year's climate conference. Adapting to climate change is the main focus of COP27 : Info Minister 'The issue of Climate Finance is being debated at COP27 , especially by the developed countries. They're trying to find out who gave $82 billion to whom last year. Despite providing additional funding, rich countries have provided this money as bilateral assistance, which is kind of wrong,' Hasan added. Replying to a question, Hasan said that the Russia-Ukraine war is standing in the way of saving the planet from climate change. 'The sanctions and counter sanctions which are being imposed on Russia and the Western countries are hurting the people severely. Climate financing is facing great risk due to the Russia-Ukraine war as developed countries are busy financing the war. To protect the people from climate-induced dangers, first we need to stop the war,' said Hasan.

'At COP27 Replying to another question, Hasan added that it creates extra burden for poor countries like Bangladesh when the developed countries tell them to reduce the emission of carbon and methane gas from the agricultural sector. 'We need to make our agricultural sector climate tolerant while ensuring food for all. We can't do anything that hampers the food security of the people,' Hasan concluded. \"

""I will try my very best to try to keep that topic on the agenda and keep reminding the countries that we should ramp (our efforts) up,"" said Ms Fu at the National Youth Dialogue on Moving Towards a Net Zero Future at Bugis+ on Wednesday. ""But I suspect that COP27 is not going to be so easy."" Despite this, the minister said that Singapore remains fully committed to the goals set out in the Singapore Green Plan, the national road map towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said: ""We are a country that usually delivers what we promise and if we are not able to promise, we won't... And once we make that promise, we will work very hard to deliver it."" Ms Fu was responding to a question from the 160-strong audience  which comprised mostly of environmentally conscious people  at the forum about the possibility of expanding Singapore's positive global climate influence. The two-hour dialogue, organised by the National Youth Council (NYC), revolved around questions like whether Singapore's decarbonisation efforts are progressing fast enough and how far the trade off should be between economic considerations and climate priorities, among other things. Besides Ms Fu, the panel comprised DBS' chief sustainability officer Helge Muenkel, Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, and Ms Woo Qiyun, a sustainability consultant and prominent Singaporean science communicator and environmentalist. The panellists were also asked how Singapore could avoid making a negative environmental impact on other countries while the nation transitions to cleaner forms of energy. Citing Singapore's present import of hydropower from dams in Laos, Ms Low acknowledged that such dams could negatively impact the environment, like the destruction of forests near dams. In response, Ms Fu said that all human activities come with an environmental cost and that trade-offs can sometimes be difficult to manage. She cited the example of electric vehicles, which are touted to be environmentally friendly. But materials used in these batteries, like cobalt and lithium, can be collected only through mining, which is a high-carbon activity, and are fraught with human rights issues. ""Human beings will always have an impact on the environment, so the question is, how can we lower and minimise it?"" said Ms Fu. She cited suggestions such as changing one's personal habits, like reducing unnecessary purchases and using environmentally friendly products. Earlier on Wednesday, the minister also gave an update at the International Solid Waste Association World Congress on the first Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme rolled out last July to cover e-waste. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh7","What can COP27 do for climate vulnerable countries?","United News of Bangladesh"," ","As a result of continuous and rapid changes in climate, natural disasters - such as sea level rise, floods, droughts, river erosion, cyclones, and salinity - are becoming more extreme and destructive with time. It is affecting all the continents of the world. The impacts of climate change are causing loss of crops, and agricultural productions challenging the food security of the world today. In simple words, climate change is threatening the safety of life and property of people and animals around the world. To fight these issues, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) comes in. This 27th edition of the climate conference known as COP27 will take place in November, 2022. Let's focus on what COP27 can achieve for the climate change affected countries. What is COP27 ? 'Cop' means 'Conference of the Parties. It is a United Nations initiative. In 1995, the first conference of COP was held in Berlin, Germany, which took place in a different country every year. These conventions serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC (Conference of the Parties, COP) parties to discuss progress in attempting to alleviate the effects of climate change, and they began attending discussions beginning roughly in the mid-1990s. The conference also negotiated the Kyoto Protocol with an aim to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to decrease their greenhouse gas emissions. Read Huge work ahead of COP27 ; commitments need to turn into action: Robert Dickson This year COP27 COP 27 was initially expected to occur from November 8-20, 2021. But, due to covid 19 pandemic, COP 26 was rescheduled from November 2020 to November 2021. That led to COP 27 from November 2021 to November 2022. As of 2019, 197 countries have become UNFCCC members. So, this year it is expected that all the member countries will meet with their valuable proposal for the sake of the environment. UNFCCC COP27 is going to be an important event regarding environmental pollution and climate change. The conference discusses the risks and solutions to climate change. This event is promising because it will help to create a consensus on how to prevent global climate change. Read Bangladesh-UK Partnership: Experts to discuss priority climate actions Friday What Should COP27 Achieve for the Vulnerable Countries? The COP conference should aim to provide a space for vulnerable countries to share their experiences, learn from each other, and create new ideas on how to prevent climate issues. This would help reduce the risk of another devastating conflict in the future. Mitigation COP26 was the very first test of the Paris Agreement's goal-raising function for mitigating climate change. In other words, preventing and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet it fell short of reaching its objectives. COP27 is more significant than the previous COPs. So, COP27 Read How Can One Person Reduce Environmental Pollution? Adaptation The COP26 urges the developed countries to double the adaptation financing along with the launch of a two-year work program towards the Global Goal Adaption (GGA). The GGA conducts international support to lessen the vulnerability of countries to climate change and adapt to the environment through holistic, sustainable development. Vulnerable countries have been seeking assistance for decades. And it is expected that COP27 will bring out a proper adaptation plan for the affected countries. Finance The COP26 summit was a major point of frustration and anger for many developing nations. In particular, they expressed frustration and anger at the failure to deliver on promises of regular financing to assist them in adaptation and mitigation efforts. There should be a move toward fulfilling historic pledges to provide annual climate financing of $100 billion from 2020 to 2025 every year, but those commitments are yet to be met. So, COP27 can be a milestone for vulnerable countries in getting their expected financing for mitigation and adaptation plans. Read Effects of Air Pollution on Unborn Children, Neonates, Infants Global Stocktake COP 27 will host a Technical Dialogue as part of the 2021-23 global stocktake (GST). The GST will assess progress towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement, happening every five years in sync with the ratchet mechanism. COP27 will be a crucial moment for scrutinizing the results of such deals. Hence, this can bring adequate outcomes for the susceptible countries. Compensation for Loss and Damage Loss of or damage to the environment refers to violations of the constraints of the natural environment that cannot be prevented by preventive measures or adaptation. Developing countries that are least responsible for climate change seek financial support for that irreparable loss and damages from the countries that are highly responsible for the climate crisis. So, COP27 Read E-Waste Crisis: Effects of Electronic Waste on Environment and Human Health Final Words The COP27 should make progress on agreement signings and declarations, which can help secure more financial support for vulnerable countries. The conference should provide them with new ideas on how to fight climate change, help them build resilience to climate shocks, and give them access to mitigation and adaptation plans. So far, we have discussed what COP27 should achieve for the climate vulnerable countries. Stay with us to know the updates of the COP27 conference in 2022. \"

As one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh also should strongly support the legally binding commitment to a ""zero emission"" target followed by a ""maximum 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature"" goal.

The seminar was jointly organised by COAST foundation, An Organization for Socio-Economic Development (AOSED), Centre for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD) Coastal Development Partnership (CDP), Centre for Sustainable Rural Livelihood (CSRL), Equity and Justice Working Group, and Bangladesh (EquityBD). Loss and damage mainly refers to the impacts of climate change that cannot be (or have not been) avoided through mitigation or adaptation. In addition to economic losses and damages to households, communities, infrastructure, and industries like agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, it also encompasses noneconomic losses to lives, cultures, and territories. Syed Aminul Hoque of EquityBD said COP27 is crucial as the developed countries are trying to breach all of their previous commitments and tend to bypass the basic principles of the Paris Agreement. ""They have put forward new concepts like net zero emission, New Collective and Quantified Goal on Finance. These vague or elusive concepts proposed by the developed countries are deeply inequitable and do not commensurate with meaningful reductions of global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius under the Paris Agreement,"" he added. Sharif Jamil, general secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (Bapa), suggested the government take a clear stance against net zero compliance in COP27 as Bangladesh has no commitment to this concept except zero emission by 2050. Ziaul Hoque Mukta of CSRL demanded a separate regime for climate-induced displacement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in COP negotiation, he said. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh10","Has COP 27 been able to resolve outstanding issues?","November 20, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 20 -- The whole world has been left with the question-- have we achieved too little in terms of collective action and is it too late? Recently some analysts and environmentalists have drawn attention to a report prepared by a group of scientists entitled ""The Limits to Growth"" ahead of the first United Nations environmental summit that was convened in Stockholm, Sweden in 1972. This report apparently used integrated computer modelling to investigate twelve planetary scenarios of economic growth and their long-term consequences for the environment and natural resources. This report also emphasised the effect climate change could ostensibly have-- on population in different regions of the world, on food production, industrialisation, pollution and prospective renewable resources, till 2100. The 1972 study was however not accepted by a large number of climatologists as a neo-Malthusian prophecy of doom, underestimating the potential for human adaptation through technological progress. This report also received particular attention in 1992 when the UNCED Earth Summit was convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992 to evaluate the forthcoming effects of environmental degradation emerging out of human activity. It was underlined by all participating nations that failure to pursue the right path associated with mitigation and adaptation could lead to major resource threats that could cast shadows resulting in less food and energy supplies, more pollution, and lower living standards. It was also underlined that the world needs to find common denominators associated with radical transformation related to accelerating resource depletion. Some countries also reiterated the need for identifying a sustainable state of global equilibrium through a positive socioeconomic dynamics. Others drew attention to the need for some developed nations to avoid environmental crises that could result from unacceptable technological and environmental transformations only directed towards wealth accumulation and profit-prioritizing systems. In this context we need to remember that over the past decade the nuances of technologies have changed further through resource efficiency innovation. Analyst Adnan and Sundaram's comments have assumed particular significance at a time when the world has been monitoring carefully what and how COP 27 intends to tackle this difficult scenario through ""realistic transformations"" within the planet's resource boundaries. Such an evolving scenario has attracted the attention of those participating in the COP 27 meeting this month, November, 2022, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. They have also shared views on the scenario drawn through - the Club of Rome's Transformational Economics Commission's 2022 report- Earth for All which not only emphasises the urgency of climate variability threat, scale and scope but also assures that ensuring the wellbeing of all is still possible, through urgent fundamental changes. In this regard it has been emphasised that such a positive development will need common efforts towards eradication of poverty, reduction of inequality, empowerment of women, and transformation of food and energy systems. To succeed, affected countries will also need specific strategies related to significant investments, including much public spending and curbing wasteful consumption. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has not been able to attend the COP27 meeting in Egypt but has conveyed her concerns on November 10 from Dhaka by pointing out that the rich countries responsible for global warming have not been keeping their promises made earlier to help developing nations deal with the consequences of climate change and variability through financial assistance. She has also reminded the world that despite this lack of financing mitigation and adaptation measures Bangladesh on its own has taken positive measures linked with renewable energy and also through the conservation of the environment by planting trees throughout the country. This has been done because Bangladesh believes that renewables help combat climate variability and also provides required security. For Bangladesh, climate finance has been one of the major topics that was broached by their delegates at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). The Bangladesh delegation through their efforts tried to convince the developed countries to deliver on the US Dollar 100 billion financial support per annum support that they had promised to provide to the countries hit by climate change earlier. They recalled in this regard the guideline that had been agreed upon during the Paris Climate Accord in 2015 and was also subsequently approved at COP26 in Scotland's Glasgow last year. They also noted that over the last one year the developed countries had been long on promises but woefully short on deliveries. Climate change has been severely compromising development prospects. Consequently, failure to act effectively could considerably reduce the size of the world economy by mid-century despite continuing population growth. COP 27 has reiterated that addressing climate change will be costly, but not as costly as inaction. We need to remember that recent climate events- cyclones, floods and forest fires- indicate that we appear to have waited too long to take serious action, and the delay - the slow pace at which carbon-based energy is being replaced by renewable energy - is beginning to demonstrate that it has been costly in terms of comparative adverse impacts. Such a scenario is revealing that to address climate change, the international community needs to make simultaneous progress on inclusive sustainable development and climate change. This is the only ethically defensible and politically feasible approach. In the short term, participants in the COP 27 meeting have underlined once again that for low carbon development and for developing countries to meet their people's basic energy needs, renewable energy generation will need to be subsidised by the developed world at large. Effectively addressing climate change and development will require a big investment push, particularly for renewable energy, with a strong public sector role, supported by international financial and technology transfers. Analysts have also remarked that public investments and technology support need to be ""front-loaded"" to shape vulnerable and developing countries' long-term energy infrastructure and development- if possible through public-private partnership. A case in point is China which has been trying to not only implement domestic policies to slow emissions growth in the coming years, but also has been investing heavily in renewable energy and other low-carbon energy sources. Within the overall paradigm of discussion, rich countries were urged to agree to a new global climate finance target - a new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG) -- which they said should be in trillions as the costs of addressing and adapting to climate change have grown. This proposed initiative was however carefully monitored by more than 600 lobbyists from some of the world's biggest polluters, up 25 per cent from last year. In a high-level ministerial dialogue on NCQG at COP27 on 9 November it was highlighted that climate actions to meet the Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDC) targets require financial, technological, and capacity-building support from developed countries. It was also underlined that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had already observed that rich countries were the major contributors to the carbon stock in the atmosphere, clearly underlying the importance of the core principles of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement -- equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). Now, it is clear that there needs to be substantive enhancement in climate finance from the floor of US Dollar 100 billion per year. This mobilization of the resources also needs to be led by the developed countries and should be long-term, concessional, and climate-specific with equitable allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects. Climatologists attending the COP 27 have however suggested that there has been a very modest tally so far this year in terms of financial support for adaptation and mitigation projects. In fact, since Glasgow there appears to have been a serious lack of responsibility and climate financing has been nowhere near the hundreds of billions of Dollars that experts predicted would be needed each year by 2030 to help communities repair and rebuild when disasters hit. The modest commitments have been reflected in the symbolic pledges made so far according to the media. This includes-- Scotland, offering another loss and damage funding of 2 million Pounds after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged 5 million Pounds at last year's UN climate summit in November. Denmark has committed 100 million Danish crowns in September directed towards helping the Sahel region in Africa. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remarked that Germany would provide 170 million Euros for a ""Global Shield"" initiative launched by the Group of Seven rich countries and finance ministers from the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of 58 developing countries on the frontline of climate impacts. Austria has indicated that they will provide about 50 million Euros to tackle loss and damage over the next four years. It is understood that Ireland and Belgium have also underlined during their participation that Ireland would make contributions of 10 million Euros to the ""Global Shield"" initiative for 2023 and that Belgium would contribute 2.5 million Euros as part of a 25-million-Euro package of climate-related support for African country of Mozambique from 2023 to 2028. President Joe Biden has also vowed at COP 27 that the United States was on track to slash its carbon emissions, urging all nations to ramp up their own efforts to avert catastrophic global warming. In this context he observed that ""the climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security and the very life of the planet."" Biden has also indicated that the United States ""will meet"" its goal of cutting emissions 50-52 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 by stepping up efforts to cut methane emissions -- a major contributor to global warming -- by plugging fossil fuel leaks and requiring companies to act on leaks reported by credible third parties. However new research has shown that it will be hard to meet the ambitious goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels as this will require slashing emissions nearly by half by 2030. This leads one to conclude by agreeing with the UN Secretary General's observation that ""We are on a highway to climate hell and our foot continues to press on the accelerator"".

Speaking at the COP27 climate conference alongside United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the premier said that Pakistan's escalating public debt was hampering its recovery. ""Millions of people are going into winter without shelter or livelihood,"" PM Shehbaz said. ""Women and children are still looking to us to protect their basic needs."" At the climate talks this year in Egypt, Pakistan and other climate-vulnerable countries are demanding that the UN take steps to mobilize ""loss and damage"" funds for disaster-hit nations, and some say rich nations have a duty to pay these costs because their historical emissions are mostly responsible for global warming today. ""We have mobilized every available resource toward the national relief effort,"" but it is not enough, PM Shehbaz said  describing hundreds of broken bridges across the country, as well as stagnant lake water now fouling Pakistan's southern agricultural landscape. Meanwhile, Guterres urged international financial institutions like the World Bank and leaders at the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia to reform policies that govern debt relief and concessional loan decisions so as to help middle-income countries like Pakistan focus on rebuilding rather than repayment. ""There should be a way to have a (debt) swap exchanging the payments of the debt to investments in the rehabilitation and recovery and reconstruction from natural disasters,"" the secretary general added. PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt on Sunday where he was received by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Guterres at the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Centre. In his meetings, the premier drew the attention of the international community to help Pakistan overcome the risks of climate change. The heads of several governments  in their interaction with Shehbaz on the sidelines of the mega climate change summit  termed his continued presence in the flood-affected areas as an ""extraordinary gesture"", according to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The premier highlighted the damage suffered by Pakistan in wake of the recent flash floods and emphasised transforming key climate-related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans. While thanking the international community for helping the flood-struck people in Pakistan, the prime minister stressed that as a developing country most affected by the phenomenon, Pakistan needed urgency of climate solidarity and climate justice. Meeting with UNSG Earlier, PM Shehbaz also had a meeting with UNSG Guterres at the summit's sidelines. He informed Guterres that according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), the total estimated damage caused by the floods in Pakistan was over $32 billion. The enormous task of rehabilitation and reconstruction would require substantial international support for Pakistan to build back greener, based on the model of sustainable development, Shehbaz added. Appreciating the UNSG for his solidarity with and call for massive support to Pakistan in the wake of devastating floods in the country, PM Shehbaz reiterated that the unprecedented flood disaster in the country was a ""clear manifestation of the challenge posed by climate change"". He also endorsed the UNSG's call for climate justice and climate solidarity. Referring to last month's adoption of an UN General Assembly resolution expressing solidarity with Pakistan, Shehbaz said that the country was looking forward to convening an international pledging conference bringing together all development partners. PM Shehbaz also expressed appreciation for the creation of an UN inter-agency team, led by the deputy secretary general, to help Pakistan prepare a comprehensive rehabilitation and reconstruction plan to be presented to the conference. The prime minister said the climate summit was a ""timely opportunity for the international community to catalyse concerted international action to mitigate the impact of climate change and promote climate justice based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities."" He emphasised that addressing ""loss and damage"" would be a key ""deliverable"" at COP27 . Interaction with world leaders The prime minister met with the Arab League's Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit, UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Indonesia Vice President Maruf Amin, Iraq President Abdul Rasheed Rashid, Lebanon Prime Minister Najib Mikati, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. In his meeting with the UAE president, Shehbaz thanked the leadership and people of the UAE for their generous assistance to flood victims. He thanked the Indonesian vice president for the immediate delivery of edible oil while the latter called Pakistan ""a brother country"" and expressed his delight at ""helping whenever possible"", according to the PMO. The PMO also announced that Tajikistan's president will visit Pakistan in December. In his meeting with the European Commission's president, Shehbaz appreciated the spirit of the European Union's (EU) members to help flood victims and termed the EU and Pakistan as ""important partners in achieving common goals"". He added that the whole world would have to bear the consequences of climate change's effects that developing countries are facing today. He also appreciated European countries for cooperating in removing Pakistan from the Financial Action Task Force's grey list while advocating for the possibilities of bilateral trade between the EU and Pakistan. Talking to the IMF managing director, Shehbaz told her that changes have been brought in budget estimates for the immediate relief and rehabilitation of flood victims. He also expressed hope that the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) would prove to be a milestone in bringing climate justice. The prime minister also met the Iraqi president, Lebanese prime minister and EU President Charles Michel. Egypt's government is hosting COP27 with a view to effectively tackling the global challenge of climate change. COP27 is taking place at a time when millions of people in Pakistan, and millions more in other parts of the world, are facing severe adverse impacts of climate change. We're on a highway to climate hell: UNSG Meanwhile, UNSG Guterres told countries gathered at the summit that they face a stark choice: work together now to cut emissions or condemn future generations to climate catastrophe. The speech set an urgent tone as governments sit down for two weeks of talks on how to avert the worst of climate change, even as they are distracted by Russia's war in Ukraine, rampant consumer inflation and energy shortages. ""Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish,"" Guterres told delegates gathered in the seaside resort town of Sharm el Sheikh. He called for a pact between the world's richest and poorest countries to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels and funding to ensure poorer countries can reduce emissions and cope with the climate impacts that have already occurred. ""The two largest economies  the United States and China  have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality,"" he said. Despite decades of climate talks, progress has been insufficient to save the planet from excessive warming as countries are too slow or reluctant to act, he noted. ""Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible,"" he said. ""We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator."" Former US vice president Al Gore, also speaking at the event, said global leaders have a credibility problem when it comes to climate change. He criticised developed nations' ongoing pursuit of gas resources in Africa, which he described as ""fossil fuel colonialism"". ""We have a credibility problem all of us: We're talking and we're starting to act, but we're not doing enough,"" Gore said. ""We must see the so-called 'dash for gas' for what it really is: a dash down a bridge to nowhere, leaving the countries of the world facing climate chaos and billions in stranded assets, especially here in Africa,"" he said. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh12","Placing small-scale farmers at heart of climate discussions: IFAD at COP 27","November 4, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is organising and will be active in over twenty events at COP27 to highlight the challenges and solutions that small-scale farmers need to feed a growing population while adapting to the escalating impacts of climate change. Through these events, IFAD wants to ensure small-scale farmers and rural populations from developing countries receive the attention and funding they urgently need, reports UNB. Small-scale farmers are essential to global food security and stability, IFAD said on Friday. They produce one third of the world's food (as much as 80 per cent in many developing countries) yet their livelihoods and capacity to feed the planet are threatened by ever-increasing extreme weather events, erratic and changing rain patterns and the deterioration of ecosystems. Solutions to help small-scale farmers adapt exist and provide multiple benefits, but significant investments are urgently required to implement change at a global scale.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh13","Can COP27 Achieve Targets?","Energy & Power"," ","The world leaders will meet at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in November 2022 at the 27th Conference of Parties with the strapline, 'Together for Implementation'. The COP27 This year will mark 30 years since the UNFCCC was adopted and seven years since the Paris Agreement was agreed upon at the COP21. The essence of the Paris Agreement concluded at COP21 held in Paris in 2015 was: Keeping the rise in global average temperature well below 2\'b0C, and ideally 1.5\'b0C, above the pre-industrial levels. Strengthening the ability to adapt to climate change and build resilience. Aligning finance flows with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. Hopefully, COP27 is going to help one of the most climate-vulnerable regions achieve some new milestones. Let the mission get momentum in the right direction. COP is hosted by different governments every year. COP27 taking place this year in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Unfortunately, the reality is way off the track to limit climate change to the agreed levels. The world's leading scientific authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stated that in all scenarios in line with these goals, global emissions must fall between 2020 and 2025, while in reality emissions are still rising. To have a chance of limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C, global emissions must be halved by 2030 and reach 'net zero' by 2050. According to the IPCC report 'Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, around half of the world's population is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with those in highly vulnerable regions already 15 times more likely to die due to floods, droughts, and storms compared to regions with very low vulnerability. COP27 is a rare opportunity for parties and observers to come together and grapple with a challenge that is impacting all of humanity. The IPCC has made it clear that the world is now in extraordinarily dangerous territory. With every small delay to proportionate action, the world moves closer to irredeemable damage to the climate and its ability to sustain the human population. This urgency is recognized. The convening of countries at COP27 and the call for countries to revise their NDCs ahead of the conference duly recognize the urgency. What COP27 Targets to Achieve? Mitigation, adaptation, Finance, Loss and Damage, and Global Stocktaking are the major targets that COP27 aspires to achieve. Mitigation COP26 was the test of the Paris Agreement's ambition-raising function for the mitigation of climate change, and in other words, avoiding and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But it fell far short of success. Over 120 parties submitted new or updated NDCs ahead of COP26. Even if the new targets are fully implemented, this would still mean estimated warming of 2.4\'b0C by the end of the century. Every fractional degree of warming translates into escalating climate impacts for vulnerable communities across the world. The formal outcome of COP26, The Glasgow Climate Pact, requested that parties strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs to align with the Paris goal by the end of 2022. COP27 , therefore, has more significance than previous COPs. Though a revision of NDCs is not 'timetabled' for 2022 under the Paris Agreement, the unfinished business of Glasgow means it will be a critical test of whether the international process can respond to the increasing urgency of the situation. At the close of COP26, President Alok Sharma concluded that though 1.5\'b0C remains alive, its 'pulse is weak'. With COP27 knocking at the door, only a handful of countries have submitted new or revised NDCs. The vast majority of revised NDCs have come from developing countries, which make smaller contributions to climate change and, therefore, have lesser emissions to cut. The exceptions to this are Australia and Switzerland. Adaptation COP27 Adaptation - adjusting to current and future climate change impacts - has long received less attention and less finance than mitigation. At COP26, efforts to change this included the Glasgow Climate Pact, urging developed countries to at least double adaptation financing as well as the launch of a two-year work program on the global goal of adaptation (GGA). The GGA seeks to help countries to adapt, increase resilience to climate change and reduce their vulnerability through, and complementary with, sustainable development. Vulnerable countries have long been calling for support to adapt to climate impacts. Following another summer of extreme weather, including in the Global North, the urgency of adaptation to climate change is increasingly obvious to those who have the most finances and technological capacity to implement change. First-hand experiences of failed harvests and heat stress due to climate change may have pushed the climate crisis up the public and political agenda in developed countries and we can expect to see a keener understanding of the need for adaptation from a wider array of countries at COP27 . Finance At COP27 , there could be a push for the fulfillment of historic promises such as the $100 billion annual climate finance. Developed countries were meant to deliver this each year, from 2020 to 2025. Unfortunately, the target has not been met so far. COP26 also witnessed the launch of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Comprising organizations responsible for financial assets worth $130 trillion, GFANZ hopes to provide a forum for leading financial institutions to accelerate the transition to a net-zero global economy' and enable financial institutions to bring their activities in line with the 1.5\'b0C commitment. GFANZ is due to publish a report detailing measures and best practices ahead of COP27 . Loss and Damage Despite resistance from developed countries, COP26 saw some breakthroughs on loss and damage, including the establishment of the three-year 'Glasgow Dialogue' on the issue, and symbolic pledges of \£32 million and pound 1 million respectively from Scotland and Wallonia - a region of Belgium - to address loss and damage. Developing countries have called for loss and damage to be formally added to the COP27 agenda and some hope to see concrete decisions on funding arrangements at the conference. Global Stocktaking COP27 will host one of the three 'Technical Dialogues' as part of the 2021-23 'global stocktake' (GST). The GST will assess the world's collective progress towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement, happening in a five yearly cycle in sync with the ratchet mechanism. It will assess progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation and support. It also considers the social and economic consequences of measures taken and efforts to address loss and damage. The UK COP26 presidency focused on specific sectoral issues - framed as 'coal, cars, cash and trees' - and one outcome at the conference was a flurry of plurilateral deals on issues from the fossil fuel phaseout to reducing methane emissions and ending deforestation. COP27 will be an important moment for assessing progress on such deals. Success to Depend on Meeting of Minds of Developed, Developing World The sustainable success of COP27 will largely depend on the meeting of minds of the developed and developing world. COP26 failed to reach a consensus on phasing out coal for strong resistance of developing economies - China and India. The COVID pandemic and Ukraine war underlined the necessity for relying on coal - available cheap and in abundance around the world. That means more money and resources must be committed to limiting emissions. Climate-vulnerable countries had their voice strongly heard last time. COP27 should not be much different. Developed countries must oblige to their commitments to contributions to Green Climate Fund. Vulnerable countries must get desired assistance in cash and transfer of technologies for limiting emissions while keeping their march towards industrial development. China and Russia virtually dodged COP26. Hopefully, COP27 will bring the world together. It must rise above global geopolitics.Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world order. The Ukraine-Russia war has added to rocking the world economy. An economic meltdown is being predicted. The energy crisis and inflation have pushed a significant section of the population below the poverty level. All these have created huge challenges to the SDGs. COP27 will be one of the last opportunities for the world community to reach a meeting of minds for saving one planet. Hope it does not turn out as yet another global picnic with marginal achievements. \"

The first recipients of Global Shield packages - called 'Pathfinder Countries' - include Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines and Senegal, according to a message UNB received from COP27 being held in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh. COP27 . Initial contributions include around EUR 170 million from Germany and more than EUR 40 million from other countries. Also read: Climate Change: IOM DDG calls for redoubling efforts ahead of COP 27 In addition, a broad coalition of countries, multilateral institutions, non-state and private sector partners has underlined their full institutional commitment to the Global Shield. Ghana Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, V20 Chair, called this is a path-breaking effort and hoped the funding window will benefit equally compared to the pre-existing structures whose performance remain to be proven. Ken said the Global Shield is long overdue. 'It has never been a question of who pays for loss and damage because we are paying for it - our economies pay for it in lost growth prospects, our enterprises pay for it in business disruption, and our communities pay for it in lives and livelihoods lost.' Also read: D-8 PTA likely to be operational this year to boost intra-trade Svenja Schulze, Federal Development Minister of Germany, said that under the German presidency, the G7 have committed to scale-up action and support on loss and damage and to work towards a 'Global Shield against Climate Risks', responding to the V20's call. 'Germany stands by its responsibility to support poor and vulnerable people and countries in dealing with loss and damage. This launch sends a signal: We have heard the urgency and we are acting. We aim at overcoming differences even in challenging circumstances. Germany wants to be a bridge-builder.' Henry Kokofu, Special Envoy of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Ghana Presidency, said: 'This is definitely the start we need, but the more effective we are in innovations like the Shield, the more we have to emphasize that scale matters.' Recent V20 research found that 98% of the nearly 1.5 billion people in V20 countries do not have financial protection - a massive sinkhole for these countries whose workforce is mainly employed by small and medium enterprises. According to this research, V20 countries have lost a total of USD 525 billion to climate impacts since 2000. As risks of losses and damages from climate change escalate further, the cost of capital and debt have risen to unsustainable levels, especially across climate vulnerable economies. The Global Shield addresses current weaknesses in the financial protection structure in climate vulnerable economies via pre-arranged finance which disburses quickly and reliably before or just after disasters happen. Germany is providing some EUR 170 million as seed contribution, of which EUR 84 million are core funding to the Global Shield and EUR 85.5 million for related climate risk finance instruments. Further pledges of core funding to the Global Shield include DKK 35 million (about EUR 4.7 million) from Denmark, EUR 10 million from Ireland, USD 7 million from Canada, and EUR 20 million from France. Further contributions by donors are expected to materialize soon. The V20 and G7 have decided that it will be steered by the Global Shield High-Level Consultative Group, which includes representatives of the V20, G7, G20, think tanks, civil society, multilateral organizations and the private sector. A financing structure with three complementary funds forms the foundation of the Global Shield against Climate Risks: the Global Shield Solutions Platform, which builds on InsuResilience Solutions Fund, the Global Shield Financing Facility at the World Bank, and the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V20 Joint Multi-Donor Fund. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh17","COP27: What Would be the Agenda for Bangladesh","Energy & Power"," ","The world is having a tough time.Our life becomes challenging due to the adverse effects of climate change along with COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war. The world is in an unprecedented situation to tackle energy, food and health security amid a worldwide political crisis. In addition, both developed and developing countries are devastated by frequent disasters. On November 6-18, 2022, the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt will host the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) of the UNFCCC to discuss and decide on pending and new agendas of climate actions to address the adverse effects of climate change under the UNFCCC negotiation process. It is expected that COP27 will build further on previous successes and develop agreed innovative approaches to act on the commitment of the parties to tackle the global challenge of climate change effectively. COP27 could be instrumental in deciding on many pending issues and achieving the global goal of a temperature rise of 1.5 C degree. The provisional agenda has a long list of issues to be negotiated at COP27 . Looking at the provisional agenda will clarify the issues to be discussed during COP27 that will cover matters related to the organization, adaptation and mitigation measures, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, etc. Also, the agenda included Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts. These are important agendas to address the adverse effects of climate change within the scope of the common but differentiated responsibility of the parties. The UNFCCC process arranges negotiations on adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building to deal with climate change challenges and resolve differences of opinion among the parties. Both groups have a strong position to secure their benefits from global negotiations. As a result, many issues can not be resolved or decided in one COP; instead, it carries over to subsequent COPs. Though its contribution to global warming is negligible (Less than O. 47% of global emissions), all the adversities of climate change impact the country. Sea Level Rise (SLR) is the biggest threat for Bangladesh among all the external drivers. A recent study by the Department of Environment on the projection of SLR using satellite altimetry data shows that the average sea-level rise in the coastal zone of Bangladesh is 3.8-5.8 mm/gear over the last 30 years. The study illustrates that about 12.34%-17.95% of the coastal area will be submerged due to SLR by this century. The findings also show that SLR alone will be responsible for the country's 5.8%-9.1% decline in rice production. This is not the situation that Bangladesh is facing due to climate change. All vulnerable countries are in a similar situation and severely suffer from climate change impacts. The adverse effects of climate change create challenges in the development sector and impose economic burdens. Since the UNFCCC was founded 30 years ago, climate action has been excruciatingly slow, leading to a steady increase in global greenhouse gas emissions that has significantly increased the need for and cost of adaptation as well as resulted in irreparable loss and damage. At COP27 For obvious reasons, the developed country parties would be creating pressure to implement NDCs. However, Bangladesh and its allies LDCs and Climate vulnerable country parties must focus on the following agendas during COP27 to address the adverse effects of climate change by taking urgent and immediate actions. The LDCs group already endorses these agendas and will be instrumental in extending their support to Bangladesh during the negotiation. Addressing Loss and Damage Loss and Damage are part of the adverse impacts of human-induced climate change, some of which are irreversible. It will continue along with global warming and there is no immediate hope that it will be stopped soon. Adaptation has a limit to minimizing Loss and Damage; therefore, they are no longer enough, and there is an additionalneed to address loss and damage. Bangladesh needs to support and pursue three key outcomes that the LDC Group expects to see at COP27 But this continues to be a highly contentious issue. COP26 failed to establish a financial facility for Loss and Damage due to pushback by the developed countries. Therefore, COP27 must decide on the financial facility for Loss and Damage. Operationalization of the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage: COP25 established the Santiago Network for averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage in developing countries without details of its functions. COP27 , Parties must agree on how the network will deliver its functions. Dual governance of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM): Bangladesh can push this dual governance of the WIM under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned agendas, Bangladesh must strongly negotiate the following agendas. Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA): Adaptation is an urgent and immediate need for LDCs and climate-vulnerable countries. The Paris Agreement established the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability associated with climate change. The GGA was established to guarantee an adequate response to climate change and to advance sustainable development, especially in climate-vulnerable developing nations. Therefore, the adaptation agenda must include 1) Advancing the adaptation agenda with adequate support from developed countries, 2) Ensuring that the GGA is not a burden on developing countries, and 3) Ensuring that outcomes inform the GGA at COP28. Climate finance: Among all these agendas, negotiation on finance would be critical to implement the decisions of the COPs. Mobilizing committed climate finance of $100 billion per year by 2020 is critical to realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, Bangladesh and LDCs must demand: 1) delivery of historical commitments and pledges and 2) the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) that reflects the real needs of developing countries. Finally, achieving the objectives of the Convention and the Paris Agreement COP27 must act seriously to resolve all contentious issues. It has been 30 years since the UNFCCC signed. But emissions are continuously rising and worsening the lives of hundreds of millions of people, especially in the most vulnerable countries. Therefore, both developed and developing country parties must deliver their responsibility at COP27 We want to see the success of COP27 , which relies on addressing the needs of the Least Developed Countries. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh19","A deal is reached at COP27 but with what prospect?","November 21, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 21 -- As is customary, almost de rigueur, the conference of parties (COP) on climate change held in Sherm el Sheik, Egypt, went into overtime and reached a deal late into the Sunday (November 20) night. Another milestone was passed under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCC), holding annual meeting of COP numbering 27. The opening event was attended by all heads of states or governments except those of China and Russia, both major actors in climate change, the former as the second greatest user of fossil fuels and polluter and the latter fourth largest producer of fossil fuels, the main factor behind global warming. It was not an auspicious beginning for collective agreement on climate change, to say the least. At the end of the extended session of COP27 , the night ended into dawn but daylight did not usher in heightened confidence and hope for the future. On the contrary, there was a good deal of disappointment and dismay. Surprisingly these sentiments voiced by developed countries, whether genuinely or pretentiously, were not clear. The European Union (EU) lamented the slow pace of achieving the carbon emission target of 1.5 degree celsius reached unanimously at Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 and its delegate opined that 'no climate deal' was better than a bad one. Germany's delegate termed the outcome as one of 'hope and frustration' while France regretted the absence of £mbition' in tackling the crisis of climate change, especially curbing carbon emissions. The UN, the sponsor of COP, simply said a political deal has been reached, which was not only cryptic, but ambivalent. Among the developing countries Pakistan was effusive about the agreement to establish a fund for 'loss and damage', terming it as a 'pivotal' turning of the page in climate talks and a significant step towards justice. It was not surprising because they used to making snide remarks about floods and cyclones in former East Pakistan as nature's wrath. Unlike previous COP summit, COP27 discussed 'loss and damage' at length, from the beginning to the end, almost to the exclusion of other exigent issues. In all previous COP summits the issues discussed were in order of priority :mitigation (curbing carbon emission to keep rise in global temperature within 1.5 degree celsius above pre-industrial level, adaptation (making adjustments to present and future climate change) and climate finance (payment to developing countries ravaged by extreme weather conditions for mitigation and adaptation). A greater part of the discussions held in past COP summits centred on the first issue, climate change through rise in the level of carbon emission caused by use of fossil fuel, a phenomenon backed by painstaking research and findings of climate scientists across the world. After remaining a contentious issue (about the authenticity and reliability of scientific findings) the fact of increasing carbon emission ( CO2) leading to global warming has now become a conventional wisdom. COP21 summit in Paris in 2015 was a watershed event because there all countries (196) agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, preferably to 1.5 degree celsius, compared to pre-industrial level. According to the landmark Agreement all signatory countries would strive to achieve net zero emission by 2050, enabling land, sea, and forest to absorb carbon emitted, annually. The Paris Climate Agreement also restated a commitment made in 2009 that the world's richer countries should provide US dollar 100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy (mitigation). Their contribution to this Climate Finance would increase after 2025. Till 2019, only US$79.6 billion was contributed under climate finance agreed upon long before Paris Agreement, in 2009. According to a recent UN Report the US$100 billion goal set in Paris Agreement would not be reached until 2023 even though a new and more ambitious target is to be set for 2025. In addition to the climate finance for mitigation and adaptation, developing countries had demanded that 'loss and damage' be included in climate finance as an agenda item as specific compensation to cover losses they are incurring from the effects of climate change. But developed countries sidestepped this issue apprehending any agreement would suggest they accept liability for global warming and would be tied into decades of repayment as compensation. The Paris Climate Agreement recognised loss and damages that are not amenable to £daptation' measures because in spite of optimal adaptation, severe damages may still occur. But this recognition did not merit a separate consideration and was treated as a subset of ' adaptation'. The 'Warsaw mechanism', two years before Paris COP19, categorised loss and damage as included under £daptation' which did not satisfy the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Alliance of Small Islands States. In the face of opposition by developed countries led by America, the Paris Agreement of 2015 called for £verting, minimising and addressing loss and damage' but specified that it cannot be used as the basis for liability. In the event, the Paris Agreement adopted the Warsaw Mechanism, an instrument that attempts to address questions about how to classify and share responsibility for loss and damage. The issue was put into mothball, not even in the backburner. The agreement to establish a fund for' loss and damage' in COP 27 has upended the agreement made in the Paris Climate of 2015.In the, COP27 summit this almost became a make or break issue, with least developed and small island countries up in arms, so to speak. What made it a hot button issue is the series of unprecedented natural disasters like flood, drought and severe storms that devastated a number of developing countries immediately before the COP27 summit. In the face of recent memory and in view of the insistence by the affected countries to have compensation from major polluters, developed countries relented. But this political deal, as the UN has billed it, may be a hollow promise without substance as it comes with a catch. Following tense negotiations that ran through the last night of negotiations, a draft was released for the Plenary Session in the morning of 20 November. The Plenary Session approved the draft document that included the provision for establishment of a fund for 'loss and damage' to help countries to bear the costs of climate- fuelled events like floods and storms. However, the most contentious issues of who will contribute and how much were pushed to the talks to be held in the next summit in 2023. COP27 passed the deal for establishment of a fund for loss and damage as a declaration of intent to save the conference from a deadlock. It simply passed the buck to the next COP. A Transitional Committee will now make recommendations to the COP28 next year for approval and adoption of the proposals regarding the donor countries and their contributions. So, as the old English saying goes, it is a long way to Tipperary. The attitude of developed and emerging countries like China and India to this fund remains problematic. Not by coincidence, America and China, two major polluters (40 per cent of the total CO2 emission) were reticent and non-committal on the issue during COP27 . The American chief negotiator, John Kerry all on a sudden fell sick raising suspicion among sceptics. The EU made it plain that its contribution to the fund is contingent upon similar and proportionate contributions by all developed and emerging countries that should include not only China but also India. Under the circumstances, it is nothing short of a pipe dream to hope that concerned countries will own up their responsibility for causing damage, far less to agree payment of compensation. Their record in contributing to the Climate Finance that was supposed to meet the target of US$100 billion by 2020 does not engender hope that they will be generous with their purse strings and not at a time when they are facing economic crisis of their own. Though a fund has been established to placate the climate battered countries, it is most likely to be a still born child. Under the most optimistic scenario, developed countries may contribute to this new fund but that will be at the cost of decreasing the amount contributed to climate finance fund for adaptation. The result will be a sort of zero sum game. Instead of waiting for the pie in the sky, it is better and pragmatic to press on with the main tasks laid down in the Paris Climate Agreement that enjoins all signatory countries to annually fix nationally determined contributions (NDC) for carbon emissions to ensure that the threshold of 1.5 degree celsius of pre-industrial level is not exceeded. Secondly, the progress towards the target of net- zero emission of CO2 ( absorbable by trees, land and ocean) being made by signatory countries for whom the targets are legally binding in terms of preparation of NDCs should be rigorously reviewed collectively in the annual climate summits. Unlike Kyoto Protocol of 1997, the Paris Climate Agreement makes it mandatory for all signatories, (196 countries) developing and developed, to prepare their annual plan of actions for mitigation and adaptation. This Agreement is as comprehensive as a pragmatic response to the gargantuan problem of climate change crisis requires. At the front and centre of Paris Agreement is anchored the task of cutting carbon emissions that has exacerbated global warming. That implies reducing dependence on use of fossil fuel for energy generation. The definitive and lasting relief from the damages of global warming lies in curbing carbon emissions which cannot be superseded by other issues, however urgent. All measures relating to climate related other issues are nothing more than palliatives, and that too uncertain of forthcoming. Unfortunately, in the midst of the intense debate over the fund for loss and damage the increasing use of fossil fuel like coal following the Ukraine war went almost unnoticed. The euphoria over the deal to have a loss and damage fund has been exaggerated and premature. Instead of running after the will-o'-the wisp of loss and damage fund, developing countries should concentrate their bargaining power with developed countries on meeting their obligations to meet carbon emission targets and contribute to Climate Finance to help them for mitigation and adaptation. Enhanced and regular contributions to Climate Finance by developed countries, to which they are committed, should take care of loss and damage under the £daptation' component. In addressing the issues of climate change, there is no need to re-invent the wheels now.

At COP26 last year in Glasgow, high-income nations blocked a proposal for a loss and damage financing body, instead supporting a new three-year dialogue for funding discussions. The loss and damage discussions now on the agenda at COP27 will not involve liability or binding compensation, but they are intended to lead to a conclusive decision ""no later than 2024,"" Shoukry said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh22","COP27: Priorities on Climate Adaptation and Mitigation","Energy & Power"," ","COP27 is already at a fever pitch with multiple challenges. The world climate leaders gathered this year at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 in Sharm-ElSheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. It is the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC. The government of Egypt is the host of this conference, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, climate action, climate finance, fossil fuel emissions, fossil fuel subsidies, loss and damage, and climate solutions adaptation and mitigation are the major agenda of COP27 . The present situation has happened a lot with extreme weather, economic inflation, the Ukraine-Russia war and the energy crisis, gripping rich and emerging countries alike. With all else happening in the world, climate change may be taking a backseat. This, however, hasn't stopped several developing nations from banding together to call-upon rich countries to cough-up loss and damage payments for climate change impacts. The rich countries have failed to provide a promised US$100 billion annually from 2010 to 2021 for poorer nations to help them adapt to climate change, trying to squeeze, which become challenging now to COP27 . The social and financial impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided are referred to as 'loss and damage', the consequences of climate that go beyond what people can adapt to, or alternative options exist, resulting from the present disasters phenomenon in the affected nations (e.g.Bangladesh). Climate Plans Remain Insufficient Need for More Ambitious Actions: A new report from UN Climate Change shows countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward but underlines that these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C. The combined climate pledges of 193 Parties under the Paris Agreement could put the world on track for around 2.5\'b0C of warming, where current commitments will increase emissions by 10.6% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, and CO2 emissions needed to be cut 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. The Second UN Climate Change report on long-term low-emission development strategies looked at countries\'b0 plans to transition to Net-zero emissions by or around mid-century, indicating that these countries\'b0 greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 68% lower in 2050 than in 2020, a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for Netzero emissions. The report notes that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone the future critical action that needs to take place now. Ambitious climate action before 2030 is urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. The Global NDC Situation: UN Climate Change analyzed the climate action plans- known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of 193 Parties to the Paris Agreement, 166 are available, including 24 updated or new NDCs submitted after the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) up-until 23 September 2022. Taken together, the plans cover 94.9% of total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. The available NDCs taken together, a sizable increase of about 13.7%, in global GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 is anticipated. The IPCC has estimated that limiting global average temperature increases to 1.5\'b0C requires a reduction of CO2 emissions of 45% in 2030 or a 25% reduction by 2030 to limit warming to 2.0\'b0C. The Broken $100-billion Promises of Climate Finance: At the UN climate summit in Copenhagen 12 years ago, rich nations made a significant pledge. They promised to provide US$100 bil lion a year to less wealthy nations, to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further temperature rises. The promise was broken and the fund target was out of reach. Frustrations at this failure are rising tensions ahead of the next COP27 . The USA has fallen far short and should contribute 40-47% of the US$100 billion, depending on whether the calculation takes into account wealth, past emissions, or population. But contribution was only around US$7.6 billion in 2016-2018. Australia, Canada and Greece also fell far short of what they should have contributed. Japan and France, on the other hand, have transferred more than their 'fair share'. The UN estimates that developing countries need US$70 billion per year to cover adaptation costs, and will need US$300 billion in 2030, and US$ 500 billion in 2050. The UN IPCC estimates that US$1.6 trillion to US$3.8 trillion is required annually to avoid warming exceeding 1.5\'b0C. COP27 Priorities- Climate Adaptation and Mitigation: Mitigation is critical to minimize the risk of climate change's worst impacts, but failing to fund adaptation will take a toll on the most vulnerable. Both aspects should be priorities for COP27 . In light of the war in Ukraine, the looming economic crisis and the climate disasters worldwide, COP27 However, one of the first things on the agenda of global leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference- COP27 will be climate change adaptation and mitigation- the topic that was in the spotlight at COP26 but, at the same time, one that is still fails to attract the needed attention. COP26 declared the countries\'b0 2030 global emissions reduction targets will cause at least 2.5\'b0C by 2100 and limit the rise to around 1.9\'b0C by 2050. Presently, the IPCC considers a 1.5\'b0C target as being on 'life support'. The IPCC report that was dedicated to assessing the climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerability warned that climate change is impacting the world in a way faster than anticipated. Further- more, it points out that even if we successfully limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C, we won\'b0t be able to avert losses to nature, societies or economies entirely. The best-case scenario is to reduce them substantially. The world is now to increase climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, and governments to take adequate climate adaptation and mitigation measures that can ensure benefits, and cost ratios ranging from 2:1 to 10:1 or even higher. The COP27 Most developing countries, like Bangladesh, can\'b0t fight global warming independently and need international cooperation and financial support. The cost of climate change is natural disasters, incomparable to the cost of ensuring proper adaptation and mitigation measures. Global climate finance is to be used for climate change mitigation purposes, while presently spending on adaptation is much smaller than needed, that is only 4% to 8% of finance goes to adaptation efforts. The most effective adaptation measures cannot prevent all losses, which are a present-day reality, especially for vulnerable regions. Considering financial support for mitigation is much greater than adaptation, nations also agreed to double adaptation funds. Some of the world\'b0s leading banks and asset managers are committed to accelerating the transition to a Net-zero emissions economy. Extreme Weather in Asia Bangladesh Badly Suffers from Disasters: High temperatures, frequent droughts, torrential rains, floods, tropical storms, heat waves, and other extreme weather events have throttled Asia in the last summer, the lives with all business activities forced to shut down, slowed global economic activities, disrupted business production, food supplies. Bangladesh badly suffers from climate change impacts, creating extreme weather, torrential rains, flood, drought, river erosion, sea-level rises with human displacement phenomenon, and severe cyclones almost round the year. Bangladesh was badly affected by the recent cyclone Sitrang which hit on 25 October 2022 across the coast and affected 2.4 million people, 20 people died, around 10,000 houses were damaged, and 1.2 million people took shelter in 6,925 cyclone shelters. Bangladesh Climate Mitigation Plan: Bangladesh has prepared its updated National Determined Contributions (NDC) and submitted it to the UNFCCC last 26 August 2021 undertaking a progressive approach to develop its economy on a low-carbon pathway. In the NDC, Bangladesh committed to reducing GHG emissions in the power, industrial and transport sectors of 12 MTCO2e or 5% below 'business-asusual' with domestic resources by 2030 as unconditional and 36 MTCO2e or 15% below 'business-as-usual' with foreign technology support within 2030 as a conditional contribution. Bangladesh has covered its NDC with the Energy (Power, transport, energy use in industry, residential, commercial, agriculture and brick manufacturing), Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry and other Land-use (AFOLU) and Waste sectors according to IPCC guidelines. The updated NDC tries to represent an economy-wide GHG emission reduction, an implementation Roadmap to manage growing emissions to play its role in global efforts to limit temperature within 1.5\'b0C. Bangladesh contributes only 0.3 tons of annual carbon emissions (0.36% of the global carbon emissions), while developed nations contribute about 20 tonnes. Bangladesh is the 7th most affected country of the world due to adverse impacts of climate change, ranks 152 out of 188 countries in world GHG emission, 33rd most vulnerable country, and 25th least-ready country (meaning that it is highly vulnerable, not ready to prevent or reduce climate change effects). Carbon Emissions Scenario 2022-30: Bangladesh\'b0s total GHG emission is found to be increased from 169.05 MT CO2e in 2012 to 409.4 MT CO2e in 2030 under the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario with an increase of 2.4 times than base year (2012). The sector-wise emissions under the BAU scenario by 2030 are 312.54 MT CO2e (76.34% of total) in Energy, 10.97 MT CO2e (2.68% of total) in IPPU, 55.01 MT CO2e (13.44% of total) in AFOLU and 30.89 MT CO2e (7.55% of total) in Waste Sector. The highest contribution (24.91% of the total) of GHG emission is found in the Industry (energy) sub-sector followed by Power (23.24%) and Transport (8.86%) under the energy sector. Mitigation Action Plan: 2022-30: The mitigation scenario is achievable but ambitious unconditional and conditional GHG mitigation measures by 2030 for the updated NDC have been prepared. In the unconditional part of NDC, only mitigation measures are considered which would be implemented based on current local-level capacity and financed through internal resources. The conditional emission reduction will be implemented through international funding and technological support. The contributions are: Unconditional Contribution: The GHG emissions would be reduced by 27.56 MT CO2e (6.73%) below BAU in 2030, where 26.3 MT CO2e (95.4%) emission reduction will from the energy sector while 0.64 (2.3%) and 0.6 (2.2%) MT CO2e reduction will from AFOLU (agriculture) and waste sector respectively. Conditional Contribution: The GHG emissions would be reduced by 61.9 MT CO2e (15.12%) below BAU in 2030 in the respective sectors. This reduction is proposed in an unconditional scenario. The conditional scenario is 59.7MT CO2e (96.46%), emission reduction from the Energy sector, while 0.4 (0.65%) and 1.84 (2.97%) MT CO2e reduction will be from AFOLU (agriculture) and Waste Sector respectively. Conclusions: The COP27 shouldn\'b0t be another conference for promises and targets since the climate leaders have put humanity on track 'towards an unlivable world\'b0, instead, be the place where countries present the meaningful progress they have achieved over the past year, and needs to focus on climate finance US$100 billion per year for the affected countries. The goal is to help developing countries face the harshest consequences of rising temperatures, something that they are already struggling to do. The issue with climate financing isn\'b0t just the numbers. The problem is more complex, and mitigation and adaptation efforts will remain insufficient without addressing the accompanying challenges. The current commitments are far below the real needs of the most vulnerable nations. Climate Leaders can take the stress of accountability by implementing the Paris Agreement. Developed nations and the international community should lead vulnerable countries on the road to net zero by demonstrating ambition and tangible results in accelerating the energy transition, reducing greenhouse emissions, phasing fossil fuels out, and going beyond their existing, but not fulfilled financial commitments. The world\'b0s 46 least-developed countries produce just 1% of the world\'b0s annual CO2 emissions. COP27 is taking place in a continent where climate change will push 40 million people into extreme poverty by 2030. 'Adaptation saves lives. As climate impacts worsen, they will scale up investments for survival where delay means death (UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres)'. Bangladesh's NDC has an adaptation component that describes what is already done and what are the priorities for the future long-term vision for adaptation keeping collaborations with mitigation actions. The National Adaptation Plan is underway and hopes to communicate adaptation communication inputs from the NAP process in the coming years. Bangladesh has emphasized the 'mitigation' and £daptation' programs for NDC, which co-exist, for the longterm vision. Bangladesh currently spends US$ 2 billion per year, around 6-7% of its annual budget on climate change adaptation, of which 75% money comes from the government, while the rest comes from international development partners including bilateral, multilateral and private funding. It is estimated that the country would need US$ 5.7 billion as adaptation finance by 2050. The decisions of COP27 are important to Bangladesh\'b0s perspective and would be an opportunity to outline how world countries contribute to stronger climate ambition. \"

'We couldn't agree on the primary issue, which is financing for vulnerable countries over climate change-induced losses.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh26","Why Cop27 matters?","November 9, 2022 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- For almost three decades, world governments have met nearly every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), every country is treaty-bound to ""avoid dangerous climate change"" and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for Conference of the Parties under the UNFCCC, and the annual meetings have swung between fractious and soporific, interspersed with moments of high drama and the occasional triumph, the Paris agreement in 2015, and disaster, Copenhagen in 2009. This year is the 27th iteration, and promises to be a difficult follow-up to the landmark summit last year, Cop26 in Glasgow. The Cop27 However, to meet those goals, countries also agreed on non-binding national targets to cut - or in the case of developing countries to curb - the growth of - greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, by 2030 in most cases. Those targets - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - were inadequate to hold the world within the Paris temperature targets. If fulfilled, they would result in 3Cor more of warming, which would be disastrous. Everyone knew at Paris that the NDCs were inadequate, so the French built into the accord a ""ratchet mechanism"" by which countries would have to return to the table every five years with fresh commitments. Those five years ended on December 31, 2020, and at Cop26 in November 2021, countries assembled to set out new targets. The most important development at Cop26 was that countries agreed to focus on the tougher 1.5C aspirational goal of the Paris agreement, acknowledging that the 2C target would allow massive devastation to take place. Research conducted since the Paris agreement was signed has shown a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels would cause changes to the climate system that would be, in many cases, catastrophic, and some of them would be irreversible, so switching the focus to a 1.5C goal represents vital progress. Several countries also updated their NDCs at Cop26, and countries responsible for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions set out long-term targets to reach net zero carbon by about mid-century. That's why at the Glasgow summit, countries also agreed to hasten the ratchet mechanism, decreeing that progress on NDCs should be updated every year, and countries were encouraged to come forward this year, and as often as necessary, with new NDCs until they are adequate. At Glasgow in 2021, none could foresee what a changed world we would live in today. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine was not only brutal but has sent shockwaves around the world. Even before Putin's invasion, energy prices were rising as the world recovered from the Covid-19 shock, but the Ukraine war has sent gas prices soaring. Putin found it convenient to use European dependence on Russian gas as a weapon. In 2021, the International Energy Agency opposed new fossil fuel development if the world was to stay within 1.5C. Food prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as both are massive producers of grain, sunflower oil and other staples, and fertiliser prices increased as Russia and Ukraine are big producers of fertiliser. This has resulted in the possibility of food shortages, particularly for the vulnerable, and to a cost of living crisis in developed as well as developing countries. To add to the geopolitical woes, the ties between the US and China, world's two big emitters, plunged to a new low. In 2021, at Cop26, China and the US surprised diplomatic observers by signing a new bilateral deal to cooperate on tackling the climate crisis. Now, China and the US have virtually stopped discussing the crucial issue.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh27","South Asia desperate for positives from COP27","November 6, 2022 Sunday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 6 -- South Asia is very much on the frontlines when it comes to climate change and COP27 - the UN's annual conference dedicated to the environmental crisis - is taking place at a critical juncture as the region deals with increasingly frequent and intense weather events. By the end of the current decade, South Asian nations will incur costs of about $160 billion per year because of climate change, according to the World Bank. The financial institution also estimates that in the next three decades the region will experience at least 40 million climate migrants. A 2021 study by environmental group German Watch focusing on the first two decades of the century revealed that 3 of the 10 countries in the long-term climate risk index are from South Asia - namely Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. India and Afghanistan fall in the next 10. The impact is worsening in India, which in 2021 alone suffered 19 climate shocks, while Asia suffered 174 in total. Catastrophic deluges in Pakistan this year have affected some 33 million people, while massive floods displaced and destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh and India's northeast. ""Floods were devastating in Pakistan, and I think an estimated $16 billion are needed for the reconstruction,"" Thomas Michael Kerr, lead climate specialist South Asia at the World Bank Group, told DW. ""I would like to contrast it to the terrible Hurricane Ian. Florida also had a devastating impact, but you don't see the impact of that magnitude on the people versus people in Pakistan."" The 'new climate normal' South Asians are living under intensifying heat waves, cyclones, droughts and floods. The scale and frequency of these events are testing the limits of governments, businesses, and citizens to adapt to the new normal. The World Bank says that the changing climate could sharply diminish living conditions for up to 800 million people in a region that already has some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations. ""It is gutting. It upsets me deeply. Floods submerged much of the country and millions of people had nowhere to go,"" Aliza Ayaz, a young Pakistani climate activist and United Nations Goodwill Ambassador, told DW. ""I wish I could do more. I wish I could be on the ground. Such devastating times for people are the only times I wish I was in the highest place of position and influence, so I could dispose of help and money to emergency causes to save lives and rehabilitate homes."" Like Ayaz, climate activists and experts are eyeing this year's UN climate conference, COP27 , to find more sustainable solutions for the affected people. There is particular concern surrounding the pledges from the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""There was a dilution of climate justice in the Paris Agreement itself through the expectation that the emissions reduction burden must be borne equally by all countries, rich or poor,"" Avantika Goswami, a policy researcher from the India-based Center for Science and Environment, told DW. ""This inequity will worsen as poor and vulnerable countries suffer disproportionately from a crisis that they have not caused and are also not receiving adequate financial compensation to recover and rebuild,"" she added. The global climate finance target, set at COP15 by developed nations, is supposed to be $100 billion a year from 2020 onward. So far, the pledge has not been fully met. The British international NGO Oxfam estimates $21-$24.5 billion as the ""true value"" of climate finance provided in 2020, against a reported figure of $68.3 billion in public finance that developed countries said was provided - alongside mobilized private finance bringing the total to $83.3 billion. COP27 will focus on scaling-up adaptation solutions while mobilizing and strengthening access to financing for adaptation. ""Money that goes for mitigation, generally goes for renewable projects, like solar or wind energy projects,"" Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based climate education institute ICCCAD, told DW. ""Those energy projects generate an income. So, these projects can be funded with loans. That is why the developed countries are more interested in mitigation projects. On the other hand, adaptation money should be given as grants, because it will help a flood-affected destitute person in Bangladesh or Pakistan."" Policy researcher Goswami believes the COP15 goal of $100 billion per year was ""an arbitrary figure that grossly underestimated the needs of the developing world for mitigation and adaptation."" ""Discussions at COP27 must advance towards a new figure for climate finance from 2025 onward that accurately captures these needs,"" she continued. ""Developed countries must also answer for the gap in finance so far, and how the current goal will be met till 2025."" Kerr from the World Bank also said that because of revenue generation opportunities, the private sector is more interested in mitigation projects. ""We have to come up with new ways to finance climate resilience across South Asia,"" Kerr said. With an eye on COP27 , Kerr hopes ""we can bring people together to think about what else we can do to bring more finance for resilience in these countries."" In recent years, more vulnerable countries have been talking about creating another fund called Loss and Damage. They say that countries at risk are suffering huge losses from natural disasters caused by man-made climate change. Beyond adaptation or mitigation, rehabilitation of affected people also requires large sums of money. ""The floods in Pakistan were 50% more severe because of human-induced climate change,"" Huq from ICCCAD said. ""This is a new demand to the rich countries to provide additional funds from mitigation and adaptation to help the victims who are suffering from loss and damage now. Adaptation and mitigation have failed for them. They are suffering. They need help now, and for that we need a fund."" File photo: This aerial photograph taken on September 1, 2022 shows a flooded residential area after heavy monsoon rains in Dadu district of Sindh province AFP Loss and Damage is not yet a standing agenda item in the COP27 . It is a provisional agenda. At the beginning of the upcoming conference - which will be held for two weeks from November 6 - it has to be adopted by all the parties. The pressure and expectations for that from the climate vulnerable and developing countries have mounted. ""Even one country can object and stop it from being adopted. If that happens that will be a big fight, and the COP will be declared a failure even before it has started,"" Huq, who is also the chair of the experts of climate vulnerable forum, said. ""We now have evidence that extreme events are happening because of human-induced climate change,"" he added. ""The IPCC sixth amendment report has clearly mentioned that it is attributable to the carbon emissions because of human actions. COP27 is the first COP in this new era, and it has to deal with this problem."" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The award was given to the Rangamati Hill District Council initiative, where it collaborated with five villages in Juraichari Upazila where the residents were combatting worsening droughts, landslides and flash floods. Former UN Secretary-General and GCA Co-Chair Ban Ki Moon said the initiative is a combination of local and traditional techniques and it has been done for climate adaptation in marginalised areas. 'The initiative is not only sustainable, others can also emulate it and efficiently and appropriately negate the adverse impacts of climate change,' he added.

The Council has also established a climate resilience committee and supported local communities in conducting climate vulnerability assessments, which have fed into the creation of local resilience plans. 'Also, half of our members are women. I asked them why they chose to install this water facility, and they said as soon as they were able decide a solution, they chose to end the misery they face in fetching water, to curb their suffering. This gave me great satisfaction,' said Tripura. Jona Chakma, a resident of the remote Choumohani Village of Jurachharhi Upazila, talks about her suffering before the initiative: 'I would walk an hour to fetch water from Bonjogi Chhorha [stream]. That water would be used for drinking, cooking, washing and showering needs.' 'During summer, we needed more water. But the stream would shrink. I spent the whole day just to collect drinking water, bathing was a luxury. I cannot even express the suffering I went through,' she added.

The deep tube-well run by solar power was established in Badalpara and has a 5000-litre water storage facility. The water is piped to the other villages. Badalpara village's Jharna Chakma explains the impact: 'Our life has become easier.

UNDP Assistant Resident Representative Prasenjit Chakma points out that a women-led committee handle the management of the pump. 'The local people, both men and women are part of this committee. The women lead the process. They have developed a fund with which they can do the maintenance and repairs of the facility.'

COP27 will be a crucial opportunity for the world to come together and re-commit to keeping the 1.5 \'b0C Paris Agreement goal alive. Read more: COP27 : UN experts for complete integration of human rights standards, principles into negotiations COP27 participants to join WHO at a series of high-level events and spend time in an innovative health pavilion space. Focus will be placing the health threat from the climate crisis and the huge health gains that would come from stronger climate action at the centre of discussions. Climate change is already affecting people's health and will continue to do so at an accelerating rate unless urgent action is taken, WHO said in a message from Geneva. 'Climate change is making millions of people sick or more vulnerable to disease all over the world and the increasing destructiveness of extreme weather events disproportionately affects poor and marginalized communities,' says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. 'It is crucial that leaders and decision makers come together at COP27 to put health at the heart of the negotiations,' he added. Read more: COP27 : Bangladesh to reiterate call to materialize $100bn pledged for developing countries Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress, according to WHO. The direct damage costs to health (i.e., excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation), is estimated to be between US$ 2-4 billion per year by 2030. The rise in global temperature that has already occurred is leading to extreme weather events that bring intense heat waves and droughts, devastating floods and increasingly powerful hurricanes and tropical storms. The combination of these factors means the impact on human health is increasing and is likely to accelerate. But there is room for hope, particularly if governments take action now to honour the pledges made at Glasgow in November 2021 and to go further in resolving the climate crisis. WHO is calling on governments to lead a just, equitable and fast phase out of fossil fuels and transition to a clean energy future. There has also been encouraging progress on commitments to decarbonization and WHO is calling for the creation of a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty that would see coal and other fossil fuels harmful to the atmosphere phased out in a just and equitable way. This would represent one of the most significant contributions to climate change mitigation. Investment in clean energy will yield health gains that repay those investments twice over. There are proven interventions able to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, for instance applying higher standards for vehicle emissions, which have been calculated to save approximately 2.4 million lives per year, through improved air quality and reduce global warming by about 0.5 \'b0C by 2050. The cost of renewable sources of energy has decreased significantly in the last few years, and solar energy is now cheaper than coal or gas in most major economies. WHO is custodian to 32 Sustainable Development Goal indicators, 17 of which are impacted by climate change or its drivers, and 16 of which specifically impact the health of children. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh31","COP27: UN experts for complete integration of human rights standards, principles into negotiations","United News of Bangladesh"," ","UN independent experts have said the outcomes of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt are of critical importance, and they called on states to make sure that all decisions made, and actions taken, consider their human rights implications. ""This, in turn, will lead to better policy-making in the area of climate change,"" they said in a statement from Geneva on Friday. The experts called on states to fully integrate human rights standards and principles into negotiations during the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) starting in Egypt on Sunday. ""In 2015, states adopted the Paris Agreement, pledging to respect human rights in all climate actions. However, as the parties meet in Sharm el Sheikh for COP27 , little progress has been made in the area of human rights, or climate actions,"" they said. However, human rights, and the financing required to realise these rights, have yet to be mainstreamed in climate change discussions, including the annual COPs. Climate change is negatively impacting the full and effective enjoyment of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. Climate change is having a major impact on a wide range of human rights today, affecting mostly marginalised groups, and could have a cataclysmic impact in the future, unless ambitious actions are undertaken immediately. Among the human rights being threatened and violated are the rights to life, adequate food, safe drinking water and sanitation, the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, adequate housing, self-determination, just and favourable conditions of work, development, the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and livelihoods, as well as the right to education and cultural rights. Climate change is also contributing to human rights violations with specific adverse impacts on women and girls and against groups in marginalised situations, such as migrants, minorities, indigenous peoples, people of African descent, older persons and persons with disabilities including albinism. Read more: Is it too late to prevent climate change? Climate change is exacerbating the risk of other human rights violations, including violence against women and girls, trafficking in persons, especially women and children, excessive use of force in the context of policing climate rallies and protests, racism and discrimination. Systemic racism and contemporary legacies of colonialism negatively impact the right to a healthy environment and continue to have an impact on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the right of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Lawyers and others working to address climate change face abuse, threats to their lives, and other risks. Climate change is also a major driver of forced displacement and renders the search for durable solutions significantly more challenging. States have taken important steps to recognise the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (which includes the right to a safe climate) as a human right, most recently in General Assembly resolution 76/300 of 29 July 2022. ""We are deeply concerned by the lack of commitment by states that have been the primary historical contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. Current nationally determined contributions provided by parties to the Paris Agreement remain seriously inadequate to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement,"" the experts said. The negative effects of failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions are disproportionately suffered by persons and communities who are already in a disadvantageous situation. And not enough financial resources are being allocated to these high-priority concerns. The UN independent experts called on states to urgently step up their mitigation actions (emissions reductions), in line with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities, as inadequate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is creating a human rights catastrophe. This would include ending fossil fuel expansion, and accelerating the phase-out of coal, oil and natural gas in order to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C as required under the Paris Agreement. It would also include regulating the emissions of businesses under their jurisdictions, and ensuring their courts are available to enforce these regulations. Read more: ""Bangladesh should not have to carry the burden of climate change alone"" The experts urged the states to include human rights considerations in their nationally determined contributions and other planning processes and ensure that market-based mechanisms have effective means for protecting human rights and effective compliance and redress mechanisms, including mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence laws and policies. They called on states to establish a loss and damage finance facility, and significantly step up funding to help particularly vulnerable developing countries, especially small island developing states and least developed countries, to cover the costs of loss and damage. The experts urged the states to call for climate finance to address mitigation and adaptation, fulfilling the $100 billion annual pledge and increasing it to meet the needs of climate-vulnerable states. The full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and civil society, including human rights defenders, grassroots organisations and women-led organisations in decision-making processes at all levels of the COP process has to be ensured, they said. ""Indigenous peoples and civil society play an essential role in the advancement of climate action, and their voices must be heard."" To ensure that climate policies, including those on adaptation, mitigation and financing, gender equality, the rights of the child, non-discrimination and racial justice, and ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls with diverse backgrounds in climate change mitigation actions at all levels have to be ensured, the experts added. They called on states to stay attuned to the impacts of climate change, as well as the design and implementation of mitigation and adaption measures on all human beings, so that all peoples are treated humanely and with dignity, and if forced to relocate or migrate because of the effects of climate change, they are able to rebuild their lives and livelihoods with dignity. The experts urged the states to expand opportunities for safe migration, including through a general right of admission and stay for people displaced by climate change, and pathways to citizenship. They also suggested including children and youth representatives in their delegations to COP 27 and future COPs, to ensure that young people have a say in their future. \"

The environment minister made the call while speaking at the two-day high-level segment of COP27 conference in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh on Tuesday. 'The countries that are most responsible for greenhouse gas emission should share responsibility for protecting the people vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We want to see the developed countries keep their commitments, providing 100 billion US dollars each year - major portion of which should come from public funds dedicated to climate change adaptation,' he said. Read: COP27 He also said, 'At COP27 , it's essential that we make progress in addressing the gap that exists between nationally determined contributions and emission reductions required by science to keep 1.5-degree Celsius target alive, including finalising the mitigation work programme as necessary to reduce global carbon emission by 45% by 2030.' 'Bangladesh is an innocent victim of climate change as it contributes less than 0.48% of global emissions,' he added. Bangladesh has always been highly susceptible to climate change and climate-induced disasters due to its unique geographical setting, said the minister. 'Studies show that about 12-17% of the country, an area larger than many small island countries, will be submerged due to sea level rise by this century.' On October 31, 2022, Bangladesh submitted its National Adaptation Plan to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), he said, adding: 'In our NAP, we have identified 113 actions for 8 vulnerable sectors. USD 230 billion will be required to implement the actions over the next 27 years (2023-2050). We need dedicated, additional financial resources for effective implementation of adaptation actions identified in the National Adaptation Plan.' Read: COP27 The country has established a national climate finance mechanism, 'Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund' from its own resources and allocated USD 490 million that supports more than 850 projects for making the country climate resilient, he said. 'Apart from this, the climate-relevant allocation in our Annual Development Plan has increased by two and a half times over the last eight years - from USD 1.4 billion to more than USD 3.1 billion - for climate adaptation and resilience-building through construction of embankments, cyclone shelters, development of stress tolerant crop varieties and coastal afforestation and reforestation,' the environment minister said. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh37","COP27: Bangladesh urges developed countries to double climate financing by 2025","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Climate experts joining this year's COP27 from Bangladesh has said that they have asked the developed countries to double their funds to climate-vulnerable countries within 2025 under a new roadmap. Talking to UNB, experts said that they've demanded an increase in climate financing because the amount that was calculated earlier isn't enough to meet the current challenges. 'We've asked for a roadmap where it'll be clearly stated that which country will provide how much funds to which sector. The developed countries have to reiterate their pledges to provide funds for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change,' said Ziaul Haque, a climate expert and a representative from Bangladesh to COP27 . 'This is why we've urged the rich countries to ramp up their funding,' the expert added. Ziaul informed that discussions are being held to finalize the Global Goal on Adaptation laid out in the Paris Agreement at this year's climate conference. 'The Paris Agreement doesn't explain what has been meant by global goals, what are their targets and how these goals will be met. Countries joining COP27 are giving serious efforts to shape up these goals. We hope that these goals will be made effective by COP28 to be held in Abu Dhabi in 2023,' Ziaul said. Mirza Shawkat Ali, another Bangladeshi representative to the conference, said that developed countries are toying with the idea of climate financing. 'Rich countries are finding various excuses to avoid funding for climate change. They're saying that their economies are in a crisis due to the Russia-Ukraine war and global economic slowdown. Although they had promised to provide funds in the Paris Agreement, in reality they haven't released a single penny till now. This is the reason why climate vulnerable countries like us are very much vocal about climate financing this time,' said Shawkat. Aminul Islam, an observer from Bangladesh, said that US President Joe Biden's statement doesn't comply with the Paris Agreement. 'The United States is a big economy and a top carbon emitter.

But Biden has said that the US will provide funds on an ad-hoc basis, which is against the pledges that his country had made in the Paris Agreement.

Indonesia's Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar had started the meeting by urging countries to cut emissions and prevent the planet from being pushed to a point ""where no future will be sustainable"". But some countries, including China, had objected to previously agreed language in the Glasgow climate pact and past G20 agreements on efforts to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius, said an official with knowledge of the meeting, declining to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media, reports Reuters. China's foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Another diplomatic source told Reuters there had been disagreements about language around climate and also references to the war in Ukraine. Siti had earlier said she hoped a joint communique would be signed by the end of the day, but made no mention of it in her press conference later on Wednesday. A spokesperson for Indonesia's environment ministry was not immediately available for comment on the matter. The G20 climate meeting, hosted by this year's chair Indonesia, comes as extreme weather events - fires, floods and heat waves - pummel several parts of the world, including unprecedented flooding in Pakistan in recent weeks that has killed at least 1,000 people. Scientists say most such extreme weather events are attributable to human-caused climate change and will only increase in severity and frequency as the globe edges closer to the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Environment officials from Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, were among those attending the talks in Bali, with more bilateral meetings expected on Thursday. Indonesia as current G20 chair invited representatives from the African Union to join the talks for the first time, said Siti, adding that voices from all countries, regardless of their wealth and size, must be heard.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh39","COP27: Make loss and damage finance a reality now","November 9, 2022 Wednesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- It is good to know that the representatives of more than 190 countries at the COP27 have agreed to officially discuss the necessity of compensating the poor countries most vulnerable to climate change. The richer and developed countries are mostly responsible for producing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that have triggered global warming resulting in sea level rise and other climate induced vagaries. Before, the wealthy countries denied keeping the compensation issue on the formal agenda, but at this year's climate summit in Egypt that began on November 6 and will continue till November 18, they agreed to discuss 'loss and damage' or funds to help poor countries for meeting the climate change mitigation challenges. Bangladesh is one of the countries that have already suffered hugely the worst consequences of climate change in the form of cyclones, floods and desertification that have caused internal displacement of a huge number of people. As far as the names of the recipient countries of loss and damage fund are concerned Bangladesh should be at the top of this list. Hence at the summit Bangladesh is expected to reiterate its call for a materialisation of the pledge of providing $100 billion funds annually to developing countries at the earliest. We hope the Bangladesh representative at Egypt would bring home its case as strongly as possible. While agreement of countries to formally discuss loss and damage is in the right direction, it is worrying that European countries are increasingly using 'dirty coal' nowadays as Russia has squeezed its gas supply to Europe following its invasion of Ukraine. Sadly, for strategic and economic dominance, competition between wealthy and powerful countries is one of the reasons for the rising temperature and vulnerability of all forms of life on the globe. It is not that these countries do not understand it, but intoxication for power is such that they fail to hold themselves back from endangering the planet. However, considering the high income countries' last year's blocking a proposal for creating a loss and damage finance body at COP26 in Glasgow, this year at the COP27 in Egypt this is a very welcome development. It has now become the duty of the climate change vulnerable countries to push for making finance a reality. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

COP27 President Sameh Shoukry in Sharm El Sheikh on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Momen hoped that the Conference would be able to come up with a concrete deliverable on financing for loss and damage. The Egyptian Foreign Minister expressed his interest in visiting Bangladesh in the near future. The two Ministers agreed to strengthen Parliamentary engagements between the two sides. They had a combined meeting later with other representatives from V20 (Vulnerable Twenty Group of Finance Ministers) currently led by Ghana. The US Special Envoy thanked Bangladesh for joining the Global Methane Pledge and referred to certain financing windows available for taking action on methane reduction. Minister Momen stressed the need for such support in agriculture, livestock and waste management sectors in Bangladesh.

They agreed to work towards making the Global Shield for Climate Risks launched recently a success, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a media release on Wednesday. Minister Momen also met with the Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management Mark Harbers. They discussed the possible role for the Champions Group on Water to address climate change impacts on water at the UN Water Conference to be held next year. The two Ministers also exchanged views on implementing projects under the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Bangladesh Ambassador to Egypt Md.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh42","Amnesty warns COP27 could be dominated by jailed Egyptian-British activist's hunger strike","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Amnesty International's head on Sunday warned that the proceedings of COP27 in Egypt could be stained by the death of one of the country's leading rights activists from a hunger and water strike in prison if Egyptian authorities do not release him within days. Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnes Callamard said Egypt had no more than 72 hours to save the life of jailed dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah, who is also a U.K. citizen. Egypt's hosting of the climate summit, known as COP27 , has trained a spotlight on its human rights record as a wide-reaching crackdown continues under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. The conference is being held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. 'If they do not want to end up with a death they should have and could have prevented, they must act now,' Callamard said at a news briefing in the capital Cairo. Callamard said she will be attending COP27 to push for action on human rights issues related to climate change, including loss and damage or reparations from richer countries to vulnerable nations suffering from climate change. Egypt is a proponent of the issue. But she will also be there to push for immediate action on the case of prominent Egyptian activist and U.K. citizen Alaa Abdel Fattah and that of the tens of thousands of political prisoners estimated to be inside the country's jails, she said. Opposition figure Abdel-Fattah escalated his hunger strike this week, refusing also water, to coincide with the first day of the COP27 , according to his family. His aunt, the writer Ahdaf Soueif, said he stopped drinking water at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday, amid growing concerns about his health. Alaa Abdel-Fattah hails from a family of well-known Egyptian activists and rose to prominence with the 2011 pro-democracy uprisings that swept the Middle East and in Egypt toppled long-time President Hosni Mubarak. The 40-year old activist spent most of the past decade behind bars and his detention has become a symbol of Egypt's return to autocratic rule. For more than six months, he has been on a partial hunger strike, consuming only 100 calories a day. In April, Abdel Fattah's family announced he had obtained British citizenship through his mother, Laila Soueif, a math professor at Cairo University who was born in London. The family has criticized U.K. leaders for failing to push harder for a consular visit to him in the detention facility. On Sunday, his family released a letter they had received from the U.K.'s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who will be attending COP27 . The letter said the global summit is an opportunity to raise Abdel Fattah's case 'with the Egyptian leadership.' Sunak will ""continue to stress to President (el-Sissi) the importance that we attach to the swift resolution of Alaa's case and an end to his unacceptable treatment,"" it added. The prime minister's office confirmed the contents of the letter. Abdel-Fattah's younger sister, Sanaa Seif, meanwhile, landed in Sharm el-Sheikh early Monday, coming on a flight from London through the Turkish city of Istanbul, her family said. 'I'm here to do my best to try and and shed light on my brother's case and to save him,' Seif said upon her arrival. 'Today (Sunday) he took his last glass of water, so it's a matter of hours. I'm really worried. I'm also here to put pressure on world leaders coming.' She is expected to take part along with Callamard in Egypt's human rights situation on the sidelines of the COP27 . Seif, also a rights defender who had been imprisoned for one year over charges of spreading false news and insulting a police officer, will focus on the case of her brother and other jailed activists. Seif, who is also a British citizen, had staged a sit-in at the headquarters of Britain's Foreign Ministry in recent weeks, part of a rallying campaign to push the U.K. to take action in her brother's s case. Amnesty also said Sunday it had documented a new wave in the government's crackdown. There have been 766 Egyptian political prisoners released in the run-up to the conference, Callamard said, according to the group's figures. She added that more than 1,500 people have been arrested since April, including more than 150 in just the past two weeks. The latest sweep came after the Muslim Brotherhood, designated a terrorist group and driven largely into exile, called for anti-government protests on Nov. 11, aiming to take advantage of Egypt's worsening economic hardships and global attention on COP27 . New York-based Human Rights Watch said it had had joined about 1,400 groups from around the world urging Egypt to lift the restrictions on civil society groups, and also expressed concern about the new rounds of arrest. 'It is becoming clear that Egypt's government has no intention of easing its abusive security measures and allowing for free speech and assembly,' Adam Coogle, the group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. \"

After tense negotiations that ran through the night, the Egyptian COP27 presidency released the final text for a deal and simultaneously called a plenary session to quickly gavel it through. According to Reuters, the swift approval for creating a dedicated loss and damage fund still left many of the most controversial decisions on the fund until next year, including who should pay into it. Negotiators made no objections as COP27 President Sameh Shoukry rattled through the final agenda items. And by the time dawn broke over the summit venue in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, the deal was done. Despite having no agreement for tougher emissions reductions, ""we went with what the agreement was here because we want to stand with the most vulnerable,"" said Germany's climate secretary Jennifer Morgan, visibly upset. Delegates praised the breakthrough on setting up the fund as climate justice, for its aim in helping vulnerable countries cope with storms, floods and other disasters being fuelled by rich nations' historic carbon emissions. When asked by Reuters whether the goal of stronger climate-fighting ambition had been compromised for the deal, Mexico's chief climate negotiator Camila Zepeda summed up the mood among exhausted negotiators. ""Probably. You take a win when you can."" FOSSIL FUEL FIZZLE The two-week summit has been seen as a test of global resolve to fight climate change - even as a war in Europe, energy market turmoil and rampant consumer inflation distract international attention. Billed as the ""African COP,"" the summit in Egypt had promised to highlight the plight of poor countries facing the most severe consequences from global warming caused mainly by wealthy, industrialised nations. The United States also supported the loss and damage provision, but climate envoy John Kerry did not attend the session after testing positive for COVID-19 this week. Negotiators from the European Union and other countries had said earlier that they were worried about efforts to block measures to strengthen last year's Glasgow Climate Pact. ""It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement. In line with earlier iterations, the approved deal did not contain a reference requested by India and some other delegations to phasing down use of ""all fossil fuels"". It instead called on countries to take steps toward ""the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,"" as agreed at the COP26 Glasgow summit. ""Too many parties are not ready to make more progress today in the fight against climate crisis,"" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said, describing the deal as ""not enough of a step forward for people and planet."" The text also included a reference to ""low-emissions energy"", raising concern among some that it opened the door to the growing use of natural gas - a fossil fuel that leads to both carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Small island nations facing a climate-driven rise in sea level had pushed for the loss and damage deal, but lamented the lack of ambition on curbing emissions. ""I recognise the progress we made in COP27 "" in terms of establishing the fund, the Maldives climate minister, Aminath Shauna, told the plenary. But ""we have failed on mitigation ... We have to ensure that we increase ambition to peak emissions by 2025. We have to phase out fossil fuel."" The climate envoy from the Marshall Islands said she was ""worn out"" but happy with the fund's approval. ""So many people all this week told us we wouldn't get it. So glad they were wrong,"" Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner said by email. Still, ""I wish we got fossil fuel phase out. The current text is not enough.""

With a long list of demands for COP27 , country delegates said on Sunday there had been little progress so far on the technical details of how to deliver on deals and pledges made in previous years. Those pledges include making steep cuts in climate-warming emissions within this decade and contributing to hundreds of billions of dollars needed each year by developing nations already struggling to cope with the impacts of climate change. One frustrated senior negotiator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the slow pace so far meant the second week of talks, being held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, would be bogged down with too many unresolved agenda items. That could also complicate the talks among government ministers on the so-called cover decisions - which make up the core political deal from the two-week summit. COP27 featured no public events on Sunday, dubbed by organisers as a ""day of rest,"" during which thousands of attendees hit the local beaches and tourist shops. ""There's just a lot to get done in five days,"" said Tom Evans, a policy analyst for the E3G non-profit think tank. ""We haven't seen huge solidarity between the developed and developing countries"" but instead ""disappointing commitments and action this year, which has dented trust."" 'LOSS AND DAMAGE' This year's talks for the first time include the thorny issue of what is known in COP parlance as ""loss and damage"" - financial support for developing countries already being hit by climate-fueled disasters, such as floods or crop-withering drought. For some countries, the outcome on funding will determine whether the summit has been a success. ""A lot needs to be done to ensure that the finance commitment is going to be new, additional, and accessible,"" Rwanda negotiator Ineza Umuhoza Grace said. Developing nations have demanded that COP27 agree to launch a special fund to address loss and damage. The United States and other rich nations are wary of this idea, saying these rapid funds are better channelled through existing programs. ""Developing countries continue to push for the set up of a finance facility for loss and damage to make it fully operational by 2024,"" said one negotiator from Latin America, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks. He said there were worries that the issue was be stonewalled. The United States and European Union have blocked calls for a new fund in previous years, but the 27-country EU has said it is open to discussing the idea.

No visible progress has been achieved in this regard and the United Nations describes this progress 'woefully inadequate' in its recent report. Against this backdrop, representatives from countries are going to meet in Egypt from November 6-18 at the COP27 climate talks in Egypt. This time governments are supposed to agree on pledges to limit warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels and ideally to 1.5C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Decades have passed since mankind first noticed the dreadful increase in global temperature causing the glacier and sea ice to melt down. According to an estimate, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone. The rising sea level is putting countries like Bangladesh at a greater risk to go under water. In summer, not only in countries of Asia but in colder countries of Europe, life is becoming increasingly unbearable. The WHO reported that over 1,700 people were killed in Portugal and Spain alone by the ferocious heat wave in Europe last year and underscored the need for urgent action to effectively face climate change. If the rich countries of Europe now struggle to cope with the rise in temperature, the difficulties facing the poorer countries of Asia are only imaginable. Due to climate change life is at stake everywhere on the planet, but the seriousness of the danger is only in the pages of the book of environmental experts, not at the table of policy makers of governments around the world. The world was greatly surprised when the former US president Donald Trump withdrew his country's commitment from the Paris Agreement. The World Meteorological Organisation in a report Wednesday said that the greenhouse gas concentrations climbed at above average rates to new records last year. The report further pointed out that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, the all three greenhouse gases, are now at their new record levels far beyond the increase over the last decade. The twenty-seventh United Nations' Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) is going to be hosted in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt after a few days at a critical time when countries are reeling under global pandemic, high energy prices, the war in Ukraine, and major disruptions to the food supply. It is expected that nations will not be preoccupied by these problems alone and will give greater attention to climate change, the long term impact of which will make the planet uninhabitable.

'No decision has been made yet regarding the compensation to the vulnerable countries including Bangladesh, though Bangladesh and other countries are still hopeful that a decision about financial assistance from the developing countries will come,' he told UNB. COP27 is taking place in Egypt from 6-18 November where Bangladesh is playing a crucial role as one of the top actors on behalf of the vulnerable countries that are desperate to get funds to tackle the impacts of climate change. Due to climate change, natural disasters are occurring frequently around the globe. Owing to the impact of it, people not only experience the infrastructural damage, but also lose everything including income sources and crops, he said. Because of increasing salinity, access to safe water is becoming difficult in coastal areas. As a result, people have to collect water from remote places, wasting working hours, he added. Besides, the fishermen failed to catch fish during a certain period of time due to frequent depression in the Bay, forcing them to change their profession, said the minister. Meanwhile, people are becoming homeless due to the riverbank erosion while people who depend on forests lose their work due to the heat wave, he said. Replying to a question, the minister said 'Loss and damage financing is on the agenda for discussion at the COP conference, and Bangladesh and other countries have welcomed the initiative. How the financing will be made, will be fixed through a framework, and it will take time.'

'Damaging infrastructure during natural disasters is not a loss and damage, but the impact that natural disasters have on the livelihood of the local community would come under loss and damage by which people are directly affected.' Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), said that the developing countries had promised to provide $100 billion as green fund, but they are now showing the Russia-Ukraine war as an excuse.

""We can now show that a meaningful pipeline of investible opportunities does exist across the economies that need finance most,"" Mahmoud Mohieldin, one of the UN appointed experts, known as UN Climate Change High-Level Champions, said in a statement to accompany the report. In an effort to answer the argument by private sector financiers that it's too risky to invest more in emerging markets, the experts, who help the COP host-governments engage with business, pulled together a list of projects that could be funded more quickly. After a year of meetings with stakeholders around the world, they released the initial list so that banks and others can assess the projects. ""We now need a creative collaboration between project developers and public, private and concessionary finance, to unlock this investment potential and turn assets into flows,"" said Mohieldin, High-Level Champion for COP27 . By contrast, the world's leading development banks lent $51 billion to poorer countries in 2021, with private investors contributing just $13 billion, a recent report from the lenders said. Among a clutch of separate deals announced on Wednesday, Egypt said it had signed partnerships for its Nexus of Water-Food-Energy (NWFE) programme to support the implementation of climate projects with investments worth $15 billion. France and Germany also signed loan agreements to extend 300 million euros ($300.69 million) in concessional financing to South Africa to support its shift away from coal-fired power. Italy, Britain and Sweden were among donors to pledge more than $350 million to finance nature-based solutions to the climate crisis in countries including Egypt, Fiji, Kenya and Malawi. A group of over 85 African insurers also pledged to provide $14 billion of cover to help the continent's most vulnerable communities deal with climate disaster risks such as floods and droughts. US climate envoy John Kerry announced creation of a carbon offset plan, dubbed the Energy Transition Accelerator, that aims to help developing countries raise cash to fund their transition away from fossil fuels. MALPASS CHALLENGE Getting money to low- and middle-income countries so they can build infrastructure such as renewable energy plants has long been a focus for the UN climate talks. But progress has been slow. ""Even though the pipeline of interesting projects is there, they will require technical and financial help to get to a position where they can attract the right kind of finance,"" said Nigel Topping, High-Level Champion for COP26. ""We need all actors in the system to roll up their sleeves to make that happen,"" he said., ""We won't get anywhere near unlocking the scale of finance developing economies need if everyone continues to pass the buck."" Malpass' arrival at COP27 , originally scheduled for Sunday, was delayed when his flight from South Africa was hit by lightning, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. When asked in Wednesday's event about his past comments seen as downplaying climate change, Malpass again dismissed the allegation that he is a climate change denier. ""You know that I'm not. You know that I'm not, so don't misreport it,"" Malpass said in response to a reporter's question as he was leaving the event. Malpass has faced months of criticism from campaign groups and figures including former UN climate agency chief Christiana Figueres after answering a question in September at a New York Times event about whether he believed man-made emissions from the burning of fossil fuels was fuelling global warming. At the time, he had replied: ""I don't even know. I'm not a scientist."" When the comments made international headlines, he clarified his remarks later in September and said it was clear greenhouse gas emissions were causing climate change.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh51","Honour COP26 commitments, double provisions for adaptation by 2025: PM Hasina writes","United News of Bangladesh"," ","'Never has there been more at stake for us on this planet we call home, and for every species we share it with,' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has written in an opinion piece. Published in Politico on November 6, 2022, Sheikh Hasina's write-up calls for urgent action to fulfill the promises made at COP26 - to assist nations like Bangladesh in facing the brutal realities of climate change. Rousing speeches and inspiring language are but hollow sentiments now - just empty rhetoric and fine-spun nothings in the absence of the robust action that scientists have long been urging. For the people of Sylhet in Bangladesh, facing the worst floods in a century, words aren't close to enough. Words didn't prevent flash floods from carrying away their homes, destroying their livelihoods, killing their loved ones. And tweets of support or small aid packages aren't nearly enough for the 33 million affected by the floods in Pakistan last month. Instead, what I am calling for today is action - action to fulfill the promises made last year at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, to assist nations like mine in facing the harshest realities of a warming planet. And as world leaders prepare to gather once again, this time Sharm El-Sheikh, I call upon my esteemed colleagues to find the means to honor the commitments they made, and to at least double the provisions for adaptation as well as finance by 2025. Read: COP27 Bangladesh currently contributes 0.56 percent to global carbon emissions, and yet, the proportion of damage inflicted upon our nation from climate change is overwhelming. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, droughts, heat and flooding will all continue to take a serious toll on our economy. They will wreak havoc on our infrastructure and agricultural industry as we face considerable challenges in averting, minimizing and addressing the loss and damage associated with climate change impact, including extreme and slow onset events. Honour COP26 commitments, double provisions for adaptation by 2025: PM Hasina writes Studies show that our GDP is expected to be significantly reduced due to human-caused warming, and average income is projected to be 90 percent lower in 2100 than it would have otherwise been. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report projects that Bangladesh will experience a net increase in poverty of approximately 15 percent by 2030 due to climate change. It would be easy to become despondent when faced with such bleak forecasts, when the call for urgent action is going unheard by many and progress is so slow. It would be much easier to succumb to the paralysis of anxiety - but we must resist. And in Bangladesh, we're doing just that. In the face of such grave threats, we have so far been able to achieve relatively resilient and consistent growth. We have also unveiled the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan in order to deal with matters of climate change, from decarbonizing our energy network to green investment initiatives - both now and in the future - all in a bid to shift our trajectory from vulnerability to resilience and, in turn, to prosperity. We were the first among developing countries to adopt a comprehensive Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan back in 2009. So far, we have allocated $480 million to implement various adaptation and mitigation programs. Currently, we're also implementing a housing project for climate refugees in our coastal district of Cox's Bazar, aiming to construct 139 multistory buildings to shelter about 5,000 climate refugee families. And during my 18 years of premiership, my government has given homes to about 3.5 million individuals to date. Honour COP26 commitments, double provisions for adaptation by 2025: PM Hasina writes Read: 3 lakh people marooned in Sylhet flood Meanwhile, we've adopted the 'Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100,' which aims to shape a safe, climate-resilient and prosperous delta. And every year, my party plants millions of saplings to increase our country's tree coverage as well. As the former chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the V20, Bangladesh continues to focus on promoting the interests of climate vulnerable countries. It isn't enough to just survive; we intend to succeed, to be a global leader, to show our neighbors and the world that there's still a path to a hopeful future - but we cannot do this alone. The words of the international community must turn to deeds, once and for all. The $40 billion increase in adaptation funding agreed upon in Glasgow must be regarded as an initial investment in our common future. Otherwise, the cost of inaction will be immense: Last year's IPCC Working Group II report already warned that global GDP loss could hit 10 to 23 percent by 2100 - far higher than previously predicted. Read: COP27 Read: COP27 : Bangladesh to reiterate call to materialize $100bn pledged for developing countries Each passing year more powerfully highlights the deeply interconnected nature of our planet in the 21st century, with supply lines and energy reliance casting a long shadow over us all. This year has already brought more record-breaking heat events across the world, with temperatures in the U.K. surpassing 40 degrees Celsius for the first time in recorded history. Climate change, loss and damage are already with us, wherever we care to look. It's playing out across the world in a myriad of ways. And the issues facing climate-vulnerable nations like mine will be at the door of other nations soon enough. If we are to have any hope of surmounting this great challenge, we must recognize that the floods in Bangladesh, the fires in California, the droughts in Europe - all triggered by just a 1.2-degree rise in temperature - are interconnected and must be confronted together. The promises made last year must be fulfilled; words must finally lead to action. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh52","COP27: Bangladesh wants developed countries to deliver on $100 billion promise","United News of Bangladesh"," ","The vital United Nations climate talks, billed as one of the last chances to stave off climate breakdown, are taking place from November 6-18 in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch. Negotiators are spending frantic days discussing whether to formally consider the issue of loss and damage, or reparations, to vulnerable nations suffering from climate change, and the issues, which weighed on the talks for years. For Bangladesh, climate finance is one of the major topics to be broached at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). The Bangladesh delegation has said it will try to convince the developed countries to deliver on the $100 billion finance per annum that they had promised to provide to the countries hit by climate change earlier. ""After the Paris Climate Accord was signed in 2015, a rulebook or guideline was being formulated to implement the agreement all these years. The rulebook was approved at COP26 in Scotland's Glasgow last year,"" Bangladesh delegation member and Department of Environment Director Ziaul Haque told UNB. ""At Glasgow, the developed countries promised to do what it takes to cut carbon emissions by 45 percent in 2030 compared to 2010 to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. However, in the last one year, they were long on promises but woefully short on deliveries,"" Ziaul said. Low- and lower-middle-income nations need financial support to lower their susceptibility to climate shocks and vulnerabilities and adapt to the rapidly changing environment. At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising $100 billion every year by 2020 for the developing countries to help them undertake climate actions. The commitment was later extended to 2025 at COP21 in Paris. The Bangladesh delegation members said: ""Unfortunately, that target has not yet been reached and largely missed."" The developed countries provided and mobilised $83.3 billion in overall climate finance in 2020, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Also, combining both the demand for mitigation and adaptation, the financing amount of $100 billion committed at that time, remains insufficient, to say the least, the Bangladesh delegation members said. So, how developed countries will meet the $100 billion target and how climate finance will be arranged post-2025 is crucial for least developed and developing countries, they added. ""Against this backdrop, the COP27 presidency of Egypt envisions moving from negotiations and planning to implementation,"" Md Shamsuddoha, a climate expert observing the climate conference, said. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh54","COP 27: Call for actions to limit global average temp rise to 1.5degC","November 4, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- Different civil-society organisations called for escalating actions to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius to rescue the earth from a catastrophe. They also underscored the need for a separate funding facility for addressing loss and damage (L&D), and Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM)'s governance under both the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) and the Conference of the Parties (COP). The civil society bodies also demanded a separate board for Santiago Network on Loss and Damage (NELD), new and need-based finances and grants-based adaptation finances, alongside instituting human rights in all aspects of addressing climate change. The organisations made the demands on Thursday at a press conference on climate diplomacy, in order to articulate their stance on and demand from the imminent COP 27 . An alliance of 25 civil society entities coordinated by the Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD) organised the press event at the National Press Club in the capital. Lawmaker Saber Hossain Chowdhury, chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, was present at the press meet as the chief guest. Besides, Shaheen Anam, Executive Director, Manusher Jonno Foundation; and Farah Kabir, Country Director, ActionAid Bangladesh, among others, were also present. CPRD Chief Executive Md Shamsuddoha facilitated the event. In his keynote speech, Mr Shamsuddoha, as the representative of the civil society alliance, demanded that the COP 27 take actionable decisions on massive emission cuts to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial level to rescue the earth from a certain catastrophe. He also demanded a mandatory phase-out of coal by 2030, and all fossil-fuels by 2040. Speaking as the chief guest, Saber Hossain said Bangladesh always regrets its achievement from the climate negotiations. But it must not be forgotten that without having a specific strategy towards COPs, there is no way to achieve something significant from the negotiations, he observed. ""There is adaptation gap, there is mitigation gap, there is finance gap, but the greatest gap is in mutual trust,"" he added. Ms Farah Kabir stated that since the very beginning of climate negotiations they have presented several pieces of evidence and logics about the situations that have been confronted by climate vulnerable countries. COP 27 ; we expect our government to play a significant role in communicating this to the global negotiations."" ""We have often seen that many countries spend trillions of dollars in wars but we hardly get any financial assistance from them for adaptation and mitigation purposes,"" she added.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh55","Flood-hit Pakistan seeks loss and damage 'compensation' at COP27","November 4, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- Pakistan's climate change minister, Sherry Rehman, is heading to Egypt for the UN COP27 climate summit with one goal: finally getting the world to commit to helping countries like hers deal with the growing ""loss and damage"" caused by global warming. As richer nations focus on debating how to slow rising temperatures while still producing the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions, poorer places are already suffering the consequences of a hotter climate and more extreme weather, from worsening floods and droughts to deadly heat and rising sea levels. Pakistan has been battered by back-to-back climate catastrophes in recent years - floods, heatwaves and forest fires - and is struggling to find the funding it needs to recover from unprecedented flooding that started in June, inundating a third of the country. ""We have repeatedly made the moral case for loss and damage compensations at different platforms,"" Rehman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We will deliver the same message at COP27 ."" ""Loss and damage"" refers to the harm and destruction that happens when people and places are not prepared for climate-driven impacts, and have not or cannot adjust the way they live to protect themselves from longer-term shifts, according to Reuters. Nine years ago, UN climate negotiators agreed to set up a formal mechanism to tackle loss and damage - but, apart from a donor-backed effort to boost insurance against weather disasters in developing countries, little has happened since. That was mainly because rich governments did not want to be held financially liable for the impacts of their historically high emissions, although some are now softening their opposition to find funding to address loss and damage, as vulnerable people are being hit hard in all parts of the world. Rehman, alongside other officials and climate experts in Pakistan, are calling for the establishment of a dedicated ""Loss and Damage Finance Facility"". They see COP27 as an opportunity not only for governments to set up such a fund but also to commit an amount to launch it. Pakistan is a ""climate victim"" that has grabbed the world's attention and empathy - and is also currently chairing the G77 and China, an alliance of developing countries that is a key player at the COP summits, noted Malik Amin Aslam, an environmentalist and former Pakistan climate change minister. That puts it in a unique position to ""not only highlight the catastrophic reality of climate change, but also directly influence the COP process to secure some concrete results"", he said. ""Pakistan should not leave the table without securing that (loss and damage fund),"" Aslam added. ""Anything short of that will be a failure."" REBUILDING TRUST Efforts to find more money to help poorer countries grow sustainably, adapt to climate impacts and recover from climate disasters they did little to create are expected to be at the forefront of the negotiations in Egypt. In 2009, wealthy countries promised that from 2020 onwards they would mobilise $100 billion per year to help vulnerable states adapt to climate change and green their energy systems - a pledge that is still unmet. COP27 , UN Secretary-General Ant&#243;nio Guterres called the climate conference a critical ""litmus test"" for rebuilding trust between developed and developing countries, and said he hoped it would be able to secure meaningful outcomes around loss and damage. Guterres singled out the devastation caused by the flooding in Pakistan as an example of how ""the world is failing to invest in protecting the lives and livelihoods of those on the frontline"". A recent assessment led by Pakistan's government has put the cost of recovery from the floods at more than $16 billion, based on impacts to transport and communication infrastructure, agriculture, the food supply and housing, among others. That sum is impossible for Pakistan - with its economy already wracked by spiralling inflation - to cover on its own, said its climate change minister, Rehman. While a national recovery plan is yet to be announced, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the government is first focusing on getting farmers back on their feet. This week, Sharif announced that banks would provide small-scale farmers with interest-free and subsidised loans totalling 1.8 trillion Pakistani rupees ($8.12 million), while interest on money they had borrowed before the flooding would be waived. For Ahmad Rafay Alam, a Pakistani environmental lawyer and activist, the floods have ""crystallized the voice of loss and damage"" - by demonstrating both the devastating impacts of climate change and the lack of support from the West. He pointed to the fire that tore through Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in 2019, recalling how 900 million euros ($877 million) of donations flooded in over just two days. In contrast, in response to the Pakistan floods, the United Nations launched an appeal to raise $160 million, which was later increased to $816 million to provide healthcare, food, shelter and clean drinking water to 9.5 million people. UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan, Julien Harneis, told journalists in October that only $90 million had been received so far. ""Notre-Dame may be iconic, but it was still a brick-and-mortar building,"" Alam said. ""Here we are talking about some 30 million homeless Pakistanis."" 'CLIMATE APOCALYPSE' In Egypt, Rehman is hoping to press upon officials the need for urgent action, instead of ""arguing over which emissions are good and which are not"". The climate summit's consensus-based decision-making and the lack of an enforcement mechanism to ensure nations live up to the commitments they make can often be barriers to concrete, positive change, she said. But, that imperfect system is ""all we have"" to help developing countries survive and adapt to an increasingly hot and dangerous climate, she added. She emphasised that the world is ""hurtling towards"" warming of 3 degrees Celsius - ""and the developed nations will need to move beyond carbon-rich lifestyles and conflict and security interests to avoid a climate apocalypse"". ""What goes on in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan,"" warned Rehman. ""If one ecosystem suffers, soon others will feel the impacts as well.""

The draft, which would need approval from the nearly 200 countries at the COP27 summit in Egypt, would agree to ""establish a fund for responding to loss and damage"". Developing countries' call for a climate damage fund has dominated the UN negotiations over the last two weeks, pushing the summit past its scheduled Friday finish as countries struggled to strike a deal, reports Reuters. The draft proposal would kick many of the most controversial decisions on the fund into next year, when a ""transitional committee"" would make recommendations for countries to then adopt at the COP28 climate summit in November 2023. Those recommendations would cover ""identifying and expanding sources of funding"" - referring to the vexed question of which countries should pay into the new fund. After years of rich countries resisting climate-vulnerable countries' calls for loss and damage funding, the European Union said on Thursday it would back a new fund if high-emitting emerging economies like China also paid into it - rather than just large historical emitters like the EU and United States.

They demanded keeping the increase of average global temperature within 1.5deg C, stopping fossil burning and using renewable energy, and providing compensation for countries affected by climate change. They also spoke about giving climate responsibility to residents of developed countries, ensuring protection funds for women and children affected by climate change and ensuring adequate funding and technical support for adaptation. Youths made the calls at a two-day virtual event titled 'Bangladesh Youth COP 2022' held on September 17 and 18.

At the COP 26 conference, there was no progress in addressing issues faced by women affected by climate change and improving their situation. This issue must be seriously considered in COP 27 , demanded youth participants. There should be special allocations of support for women affected by climate change, they demanded. International Children's Peace Prize winner and youth icon Greta Thunberg as a special guest said, ""The powerful voices of global north say they pledged to be climate neutral by 2050, turning everyone back to sleep.""

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh58","Nepal to talk up climate losses and seek more funding at COP27","October 25, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Oct. 25 Kathmandu(Kathmandu Post/ANN)- Climate change is getting little attention of Nepali politicians, busy as they are with the upcoming parliamentary elections, despite the calamity it's wreaking on the country's fragile ecosystem. Experts say the government's apathy towards climate change is glaring, especially given the increasing incidents each year of melting glaciers, flash floods and landslides. The incidents have claimed lives and destroyed property. The numbers continue to see an alarming rise every passing year. ""The number of people displaced by floods and landslides from 2008-2014 equals around 400,000,"" says Madhukar Upadhya, a climate expert. ""People displaced due to climate change in the past six years outnumber those displaced during the decade-long insurgency, which was around 300,000."" However, the federal government officials claim the government has been competently handling the challenges posed by climate change. ""To confront the challenge of climate change, the government of Nepal has worked on all fronts,"" Buddhi Sagar Poudel, joint-secretary at the climate change management division of the Forest and Environment Ministry, told the Post. ""The government has brought a climate change policy, Environment Protection Act, and has worked on a long-term strategy on climate change. So we can say that the government has given the necessary priority to climate change."" He, however, agreed that the government is lagging behind on two fronts programme implementation and budgeting. Poudel didn't elaborate. Meanwhile, the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6. Just like in the past, the likelihood of Nepal having an impact on participating countries during this conference is rather slim, although the government is planning to send a minister-level delegation to the COP27 conference. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba led the Nepali delegation to the COP26 conference held in Glasgow, Scotland in November last year. This time around, Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens Uma Regmi is likely to represent Nepal at the conference, according to a foreign ministry official. COP is a global event which brings together policymakers, delegates, scientists, lobbyists and private sector participants to discuss and combat the world's climate change issues. In 2018, President Bidya Devi Bhandari participated in the COP24 conference organised in Katowice, Poland. COP25 conference held in Madrid, Spain was led by Shakti Bahadur Basnet, then Minister for Forest and Environment. But, sadly, Nepal could not attract global attention to its problems brought on by climate change at any of the conferences it has previously attended, said the experts. This time, Nepal is preparing to present a five-point agenda to delegates at the upcoming conference, according to Poudel. These include highlighting the losses being suffered as a result of climate change and drawing attention of delegates to a lack of sufficient funding to offset those losses. Nepal also plans to urge developed countries to reduce carbon emissions which would help mitigate the sufferings of people living in the mountainous regions of Nepal who have had to bear the brunt of climate change.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh59","EDITORIAL: Pakistan's delegates must be lauded for successfully leading climate justice campaign at COP27","November 22, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 22 Karachi(DAWN/ANN)  Pakistan's mission was spurred by devastation from unprecedented monsoon and extreme heatwaves this year. KARACHI: PAKISTAN'S representatives at the UN COP27 climate summit deserve commendation for leading a group of vulnerable countries in pulling off an unlikely diplomatic coup. The summit concluded on Sunday in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh with a hard-fought deal to establish a loss and damage fund for nations most vulnerable to climate change  an achievement that many had thought impossible till just days ago. After the development, Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman was credited internationally for leading the bloc known as the Group of 77 plus China, keeping it united, and thereby ensuring that a loss and damage fund, which had long eluded climate change campaigners, was finally agreed to before the conference disbanded till next year. Reports in foreign media and Ms Rehman's account of the breakthrough spoke of intense deliberations as negotiators worked round the clock to ensure that a deal was finalised before the COP27 participants headed home. Their commitment and dedication to ensuring climate justice must be applauded by all. It may also be recalled that Pakistan fought to have the loss and damage fund officially included on this year's agenda of the UN climate summit. It had been an important step, as powerful nations had long resisted the idea of a compensation fund, fearing it could open them to legal liabilities for causing devastating changes to the global environment because of unchecked industrialisation and consumerism. However, Pakistan's mission had been spurred by the devastation from the unprecedented monsoon and extreme heatwaves this year, and it is no mean feat that our representatives successfully leveraged those experiences to secure a package for climate justice on a global scale. The Global Shield initiative announced last week had been a breakthrough in climate finance, but its scope is limited to helping climate-vulnerable nations secure themselves against the risks arising from natural disasters through insurance and other financial instruments. On the other hand, the loss and damage fund answers the question of climate reparations on a scale that insurance policies cannot and will not cover. At the heart of the fund is the idea that countries that pay the price for climate change must be compensated by the nations that are responsible for it. It may be too early to celebrate, however, as the fund does not yet have anything in it, and the question of who must pay how much has been left for next year. Many also worry that powerful nations have managed to avoid another very important question  how to immediately mitigate global warming  amidst the buzz over the loss and damage fund. That is as much a critical concern for the survival of the human race and needs equally urgent attention. Having secured this particular victory, Pakistan must now direct its efforts to help ensure progress on the other goals on the climate change agenda. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh60","Access green energy through legal obligations, say experts","November 4, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- The enlarging energy crisis that has engulfed the world, including Bangladesh would have been avoided if there was an adequate supply of renewable energy, experts said on Friday. Bangladesh can access green energy through awareness building and legal obligations, environmental experts observed at a workshop held in the city titled ""Dialogue with Media Road to COP27 : The Importance of Transition to Clean Energy"". In the main discussion, Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder, chairman of the Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS), Stamford University, said that the currently renewable energy is 3.71 per cent globally. ""Currently, wind power projects are underway in 13 places in Bangladesh. Besides, it is possible to increase renewable energy capacity through biogas along with solar energy. And, it is possible to achieve clean energy targets in 2030 and 2041,"" he added. ""Bangladesh can access green energy through awareness and legal obligations,"" he added, saying that if there was an adequate supply of renewable energy, the world would not have to see this crisis. Director General of Press Institute of Bangladesh Zafar Wazed was present as the chief guest, Prof Mohammad Ali Naqi, former vice chancellor of Stamford University Bangladesh was present as the president of the event. Researcher at the University of California, and lecturer in the Department of Environmental Science at Stanford University, Md. Humayun Kabir said that 70 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases are emitted from fossil fuels. Therefore, the first step to reducing or mitigating climate change is to transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. He further said, COP 27 can play an important role in accelerating the process of producing sustainable renewable energy from fossil fuels worldwide. Prof Naqi said, the terms of environmental research are not understood by everyone. Journalists can make them understandable for everyone, which will help in development. Supreme Court lawyer Marufa Gulashan Ara said that every sector of the country should work on contemporary environmental issues like COP 27 .

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh62","Adaptation Finance at COP27","Energy & Power"," ","We all know that adaptation to climate change impacts that had a steady rise during the last two decades is an agenda under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Though the Convention had no separate article on adaptation, the Paris Agreement (PA) has article (#7) dedicated to adaptation. Actually, three reasons can be identified for this steady rise: 1) mitigation was not being done, as expected, other than by the EU countries; 2) extreme climate events were becoming the new 'normal' across the globe, inflicting heavy devastations the world over, particularly in the poorest vulnerable countries and communities, which are the least contributor to causing the problem; 3) So, climate justice movement was growing rapidly and stronger. The PA also has a provision of a global goal on adaptation, though its operationalization is actually very complex, because it is more of national and local nature, which cannot be universalized, like mitigation. But, adaptation remains the poor neighbor, compared to mitigation. However, adaptation remains the prime concern for even the physical survival, particularly of the low-lying coastal and small island states. This write-up will focus on adaptation finance, with discussions centering on three issues: a) status of adaptation finance, particularly its qualitative aspects, b) why the current status is so poor and c) what could be the ways out. We all know the figure of $100 pledged more than a decade ago by developed countries is far below the target level. Latest figure from OECD claims to mobilize $83.6B in 2020. But Oxfam usually deflates those claims at least by three times, because of over-counting of climate finance under the Rio Markers and presenting the loans at face value, not in its grant equivalence. Now the target is to have a new collective quantified goal by 2025, keeping the $100 B figure as the floor. Already three of the four mandated expert dialogues have taken place, but no substantive outcome in terms of the concrete goal is there yet. The fourth dialogue will happen at the beginning of COP27 . Now, only 20% of climate finance goes to adaptation and of this, just 20% goes to the particularly vulnerable countries, which include around 45 small island developing states and 46 least developed countries. So, the G77 countries are pushing hard for a loss and damage financing facility for consideration at the upcoming COP27 . Further, even for the LDCs, almost 70% of this money is delivered as loans, not grants. But adaptation investments don't bring in immediate returns in most cases. So this is creating a new 'climate debt trap', adding additional strains to the already accumulated debt burden, which got worse due to Covid-19. What is more disquieting is that now an increasing share of development aid is delivered as climate finance, while global development assistance is going down. This is double injustice. It is true that often adaptation and development cannot be differentiated; in that case both instruments should go up! Against this trend, Assessment Report six (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds that adaptation actions have so far been largely ineffective and even maladaptive. It also argues that there is adequate liquidity globally for increased investments to address climate change, but money is not flowing where it is most needed. For example, about half trillion dollars are funded for sustaining the problem of climate change as a fossil fuel subsidy, but not a fraction of this is available for its solution. In like manner, about two trillion dollars are spent yearly as military expenditure, to address the 'perceived' security threats, but for addressing the 'real' threat of climate change, not a miniscule share is available. Why is this poor status of adaptation finance? Actually, climate finance reflects the political and economic dynamics of a neoliberal globalized order. So, global responsibility is deemphasized and private capital is expected to solve global problems, which usually do not happen. Certainly, private capital has a role to play, particularly in mitigation, but adaptation does not yet attract much private capital. At national level, public goods are provided mainly by public resources; then why at international level it is not available is the central question. Adequate financing could have been made available if even 'market justice' could be ensured in terms of correcting the greatest market failure, i.e.emissions externality, through internalizing them in pricing of carbon. Here, we may recall two teachings from Adam Smith, the father of classical economics, particularly from his book: Theory of Moral Sentiments written in 1759, years before his seminal work Wealth of Nations. The first chapter of his 1759 book is titled: 'On Sympathy'. He argued that for an invisible hand to function in the form of demand and supply in the market as a cybernetically corrective mechanism, economic agents must behave 'morally'. Amartya Sen, the Nobel economist, also argued in his article titled 'Rational Fools,' written back in 1977 that human beings are not just pots of selfinterests. They also have altruistic genes. But this positive part of human beings is not coming out as a critical mass to engender change for the better in the market system. So, appropriate government interventions are called for. This is also not happening as needed, to contribute to ensuring climate justice at a minimum level. So, the UN Secretary General Guterres, while opening the current UN General Assembly session very cogently stated that this world was 'gridlocked in a colossal disfunction'. The second teaching of Smith was that interests either at individual or national levels are indivisible, where our interests are bound with those of others. That time the world was under the first wave of globalization. And now, we no longer live in a Westphalian order of a zerosum game, but in a win-win, positivesum world in an era of increasing global common problems. So, cooperation under enhanced multilateralism is desperately needed to generate responsible internationalism, to rectify the global public bads (GPBs) like climate change that each and every nation on Earth suffers from, but the low-income countries and communities remain at the frontline, with their least capacity to adapt. So, how to address the dysfunctionality of the world order that is failing to address the existential threat of the day? We cannot have radical change, but can push for incremental changes, charted wisely, along a trajectory of improving the system. With this end in view, this piece suggests just few important options: Application of the polluter-paysprinciple as carbon pricing. This may begin first in the Global North; then gradually in phases in the Global South, with an approach of poverty-sensitive application of the PPP in the lowincome countries. With no ambitious mitigation around, the £tlas of human suffering' is expanding, including cross-border and second-order climate risks, which are likely to impact on the global trade and financial systems. So, we need to get out of the territorial framing that conceptualizes adaptation largely as a local or national public good, and, hence, the inadequate international support for adaptation and unwillingness of the private sector to step in. So, it makes conceptual and political sense to consider adaptation as a global public good (GPB), and such a reframing should make a difference in boosting adaptation finance though penalizing the GPBs. Focusing on locally-led adaptation (LLA), as climate change impacts the local communities most, who have been coping from ages back, we need to build on this with a forward looking approach, considering also the future risks. This LLA must be locally-led, in order to make them effective and sustainable, while linking with national and international policies. Under the LLA model, provisions must be there for local climate finance facilities for access by the most vulnerable including women. Providing loans for adaptation must change, toward a provision of only grants in low-income countries. The developed countries have promised at COP26 in Glasgow to double adaptation finance by 2024, compared to the 2019 level. This must be realized. A new instrument called 'debt for adaptation swap' (DAS) can be mobilized, either at multilateral or bilateral levels. Earlier models of debt for nature swap succeeded neither in conservation nor in strengthening debt sustainability because of paltry amounts involved. So, the DAS scheme must involve billions to have any significant impact. Capacity building at all levels through education and training including for developing project proposals and their implementation is a must. So, the Capacity Building and Action for Climate Empowerment agendas under the UNFCCC process must have adequate support. However, focus should be given on specific training to promote LLA, which is closely linked to naturebased solutions. The development partners have to change their metrics of success - away from just tons of emissions reduced, or co-financing, toward process indicators to measure the progress in areas, such as CB, which cannot be quantified. Finally, a participatory fiduciary management system must be in place at national and local community levels in developing countries. We must understand that adaptation finance will not flow, as the trend shows, not to the most vulnerable countries, but to those, which have transparent and accountable financial management of funds. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh63","COP27 climate summit to test resolve of world battling war, inflation","October 31, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 31 -- An international climate summit starting next week in Egypt will test the resolve of nations to combat global warming, even as many of the biggest players are distracted by urgent crises ranging from war in Europe to rampant consumer inflation. According to Reuters, more than 30,000 delegates, including representatives from some 200 countries, will gather Nov. 6-18 in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh to hash out details around how to slow climate change and help those already feeling its impacts. But with nations dealing with the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, along with soaring food and fuel prices and stuttering economic growth, questions loom over whether they will act quickly and ambitiously enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The chill in relations this year between top greenhouse gas emitters China and the United States does not bode well, experts say. A United Nations report released last week showed most countries are lagging on their existing commitments to cut carbon output, with global greenhouse gas emissions on track to rise 10.6 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Scientists say emissions must drop 43 per cent by that time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)above pre-industrial temperatures - the threshold above which climate change risks spinning out of control. Only 24 of the nearly 200 countries attending the COP27 talks have submitted new or updated emissions-cutting plans since last year's UN climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, even though all had committed to doing so, according to the UN climate agency. A few countries, including Chile, Mexico and Turkey, are expected to release new plans during the Egypt conference, but it is unclear if any major developing economies like China and India will be among them. ""The chance for China to make another major move ahead of COP27 is low,"" said Li Shuo, a China climate expert at environmental group Greenpeace, who is familiar with the government's thinking. Alden Meyer, international climate policy expert at E3G, said the fraying of diplomatic ties between Washington and Beijing over issues including Taiwan and the war in Ukraine were a headwind for global climate progress, noting past collaboration between the two had helped boost climate talks. ""Is it possible to make progress without the US and China collaborating? Yes, it is, but it's not easier,"" he said. The administration of US President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been urging US and international oil and gas drillers to ramp up production to address tight global markets, lower consumer prices and offset supply disruptions linked to Russia's war on Ukraine - showing how the energy crunch has changed the policy priorities of a president who had campaigned on a promise to quickly put an end to the fossil fuel era. The US delegation to the UN conference is likely to tout Biden's legislative victories on climate change, including passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included billions of dollars in subsidies for wind and solar power and electric vehicles. LOSS AND DAMAGE The two-week UN negotiations in Egypt follow a year of wild weather disruptions around the world, as global warming takes a toll - from the devastating floods in Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria, to heatwaves in the Arctic and across Europe and record-setting droughts in the American West and France. The talks are likely to address how these and other nations affected by climate change could be compensated by rich countries believed to have caused it. Other topics will include how international financial institutions like the World Bank could be reformed to speed the transition away from fossil fuels. The issue of mobilising new funding to compensate for climate-driven destruction is a contentious one, with rich nations, including the United States and European Union members, having opposed past proposals for a ""loss and damage"" fund over concerns about their liabilities. US Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry said last week the United States supports a serious dialogue on the topic at COP27 , but said the issue was tricky given upcoming Congressional elections that could swing the legislative body toward Republican control. He also pointed out that the United States is the biggest donor of global humanitarian aid and will focus on ramping up spending on climate adaptation. That message rings hollow for some. The talks received a boost from Brazil's election on Sunday of leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose team has decried deforestation while calling for an international summit on the fate of the Amazon. ""African nations are going to call out the hypocrisy of Europe securing gas deals in the name of energy security while telling African nations not to develop their resources for baseload energy,"" said Lily Odarno, director of the Clean Air Task Force's Africa climate program. Egypt's lead climate negotiator, Mohamed Nasr, has said the summit's success would be measured by whether countries deliver a package of agreements that keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive, while ensuring poorer nations are treated fairly and receive the support that rich countries have promised. ""Climate change is not giving us any space to breathe,"" Nasr said. ""Science is telling us we are not on track on anything.""

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh64","Climate change adaptation: Bangladesh needs $230b till 2050","November 7, 2022 Monday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 7 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- Bangladesh has a National Action Plan ready on climate change stressing the need for $230 billion over next 27 years till 2050 to enhance its adaptation capacity, as the the COP 27 , the biggest climate event, kicks off today in Egypt to tame the rising temperature. The COP 27 For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. ""This COP needs to demonstrate that there is a distinct shift from negotiations to implementation,"" UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told journalists online. Egypt must mark a leap from the long process of hammering out a treaty to ensuring that its goals are met, he added. ""Paris told us what needs to be done, and Glasgow defined how we need to do it,"" he said, referring to the landmark 2015 deal that sets a cap on global warming, and the summit last year in Scotland that finalised the treaty's rulebook. ""Sharm El-Sheikh is about getting stuff done   moving from words to action."" Without a ""historic pact"" bridging the North-South divide, ""we will be doomed, because we need to reduce emissions, both in the developed countries and emerging economies,"" UN chief Antonio Guterres said on last Thursday. Last week the UN warned that ""there is no credible pathway in place"" for capping the rise in global temperatures under the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. COP27 will arguably boil down to a trio of interlocking priorities: emissions, accountability and money. The creation of a separate pool of capital for ""loss and damage""  UN climate lingo for unavoidable and irreversible climate damages  could be a make-or-break issue. ""This discussion has been going on for three decades,"" UN climate change chief Simon Stiell told journalists Friday. ""The most vulnerable countries are tired, they are frustrated."" ""The success or failure of COP27 will be judged on the basis of whether there is agreement on a financing facility for loss and damage,"" Munir Akram, Pakistan's UN ambassador and chair of the powerful G77+China negotiating bloc of more than 130 developing nations, told AFP. Rich nations will also be expected to set a timetable for the delivery of $100 billion per year to help developing countries green their economies and build resilience against future climate change. The promise is already two years past due and remains $17 billion short, according to the OECD, reports AFP. Last year's COP26 in Glasgow prioritised reducing carbon pollution, mostly through sideline agreements orchestrated by host Britain to curb methane emissions, halt deforestation, phase out fossil fuel subsidies and ramp up the transition to renewable energy. Nations agreed to review their carbon-cutting pledges annually and not just every five years, though only a handful of nations have done so in 2022. A 22-member government delegation led by Shahab Uddin MP, minister for environment, forest and climate change, has gone to Egypt to participate in the conference. A member of the team told The Daily Star that ahead of COP - 27 The NAP has identified 113 interventions, including 90 high-priority and 23 moderate-priority ones. Bangladesh will need $8.5 billion per year, of it $6.0 billion per year from external sources or international climate funds and development partners. And it proposes to mobilise around 72.5 percent of the total investment cost by 2040. Bangladesh will present its NAP on climate change at a side event during the COP conference, he said. Asked, Mirza Shawkat Ali, director, Department of Environment, said Bangladesh has already uploaded its NAP documents to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change website as the 40th country and as the 17th least developed country. Regarding carbon reduction, he said Bangladesh has set a target to bring it down to 6.3 percent unconditionally. The country would be able to reduce carbon up to 15.12 percent if it gets technical and financial support. He said this year Bangladesh also joins hands with others in a global pledge to control the country's methane gas emission. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh65","COP27: Saudi Arabia's vision of environment-friendly future on display, but critics unmoved","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Hydrogen cars and vehicles that capture their tailpipe pollutants. Computer mice made from recycled ocean waste plastic. Hundreds of millions of trees planted in the desert. Saudi Arabia's vision of an environmentally friendly future is on display just a short drive from the venue of the U.N. climate summit being held in Egypt. What's not highlighted in the glossy gallery are the earth-warming fossil fuels that the country continues to pump out of the ground for global export. Fossil fuel emissions are the reason why negotiators from nearly 200 countries have gathered at the annual two-week conference, haggling over how pollution can be cut and how fast to do it. In and around the conference, Saudi Arabia is presenting itself as a leader in green energies and eco-friendly practices, with flashy pavilions, glossy presentations and optimistic assessments of technologies like carbon capture, which can remove carbon dioxide from the air but is costly and years away from being deployed at scale. 'We have hugely ambitious goals and targets,"" Saudi climate envoy Adel al-Jubeir said at the two-day Saudi Green Initiative Forum on COP27 's sidelines. 'We want to be an example to the world in terms of what can be done."" The effort is part of a large push by Saudi Arabia, which has some of the world's largest reserves of oil and is a leader of the OPEC oil cartel, to make the case that the nation should be part of the transition to renewable energies while holding on to its role as the top global crude oil exporter. That vision is sharply contested by climate scientists and environmental experts, who argue that Saudi Arabia and other countries with large reserves of oil simply want to distract the world to continue with business as usual. The Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman al Saud, announced a raft of new green projects or updates to existing ones, from beefed up tree planting pledges to fresh solar energy energy projects in the pipeline. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched his Saudi Green Initiative at last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, with a target for 'net zero' greenhouse gas emissions by 2060, which he changed to 2050 at the start of this year's meeting. READ: UN climate talks near halftime with key issues unresolved Still, energy exports are the Saudi economy's mainstay, earning $150 billion in annual revenue, despite efforts to diversify revenue as the global transition away from fossil fuel reliance accelerates. At the Saudi forum, officials and invited guest speakers from renewable energy companies held forth on topics like clean hydrogen, greening the desert, and a futuristic desert city project called Neom. State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, said the world needs more investment in oil and gas, not less, a message at odds with the sentiment among many country delegations and climate experts and activists attending COP27 . 'Yes, there is good investment happening in the alternatives,' such as wind and solar power, he said, adding that the amount of money spent on oil production capacity has fallen to $400 billion a year from $700 billion in 2014. 'That is not enough to meet global demand in the mid to long term,' he said. An Aramco spokesman said Nasser wasn't available for an interview. Among the Saudi announcements, there were plans to set up a regional center to £dvance emissions reductions' and one to host a regional climate week ahead of next year's COP meeting. There's also a plan for 13 renewable energy projects with a total generating capacity of 11.4 gigawatts, though experts said that's a step back from numbers announced in previous years. Once they're up and running, the new energy projects will cut carbon dioxide emissions by about 20 million tons a year. Saudi Aramco plans to build the world's biggest carbon capture and storage hub, which will store up to 9 million tons of carbon dioxide when its up and running in 2027. It's all part of the kingdom's pledged to cut emissions by 278 million tons a year by 2030. That's still small compared to about 10 billion metric tons of carbon spewed globally into the air annually. The kingdom also upgraded its tree planting goal to 600 million by 2030, including mangroves, up from its 450 million initial target. Climate experts weren't convinced. 'Saudi Arabia would be better placed to focus on cutting emissions rather than relying on carbon capture and storage and questionable reductions from planting trees, the offsets of which would simply allow them to continue increasing emissions from burning fossil fuels,"" said Mia Moisio, a an energy policy expert focusing on Middle East and North Africa at the New Climate Institute think tank. READ: How Qatar's wealth brought the World Cup to the Middle East 'To keep emissions on a 1.5\'b0C pathway, all governments must focus on cutting fossil fuel emissions, not offsetting them.' The tracker analyzes nations' climate targets and policies compared to the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement that spells out ideally limiting the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Saudi authorities are promoting what they call a 'circular carbon economy' to cut emissions from oil and gas operations, but the tracker says this it 'only addresses a fraction of relevant emissions in Saudi Arabia and globally, as most emissions related to oil and gas come from fuel combustion rather than extraction and processing.' Saudi Arabia's oil and gas assets spew 900 million tons of emissions a year, according to an inventory of top known sources of greenhouse gas emitters compiled by the Climate TRACE coalition and launched at COP27 . There's also a plan for a greenhouse gas crediting and offsetting scheme next year, with few details. Carbon credits, which allow countries and companies to pay to reduce their carbon footprints, say by planting trees, have become increasingly controversial, with critics saying they're a license for polluting companies to keep polluting. At least year's talks in Glasgow, Saudi Arabia faced accusations that its negotiators were working to block climate measures that would threaten demand for oil - a charge that the energy minister called a lie. 'The Saudis may well be coming to COP27 with a green hat on and extolling the virtues of planting trees, but this is a state that continues to profit wildly from the destructive practices causing the climate crisis,"" said Alice Harrison, a campaigner at Global Witness, one of the groups that did the count. 'Any exhibitions, talks or shows to the contrary are pure greenwashing.' \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh66","Japan-led CO2 plan to be launched at COP27","October 11, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Oct. 11 Tokyo(The Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)- A Japan-led offset credit trading framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be launched at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in Egypt next month. More than 30 countries and international organizations are expected to participate in the framework. The Japanese government hopes a framework it has been working on independently will become an international standard. It also hopes to capitalize on Japan's decarbonization technology overseas. Under the framework, if a developed country provides a developing country with technology or financial assistance that leads to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a portion of the reduction can be credited to the developed country. The mechanism was stipulated in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 in 2015. Implementation guidelines for the article were agreed upon at COP26 last year. Under the framework, developed countries will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions efficiently, and developing countries will be able to improve decarbonization technology. Once trading gets into full swing, an estimate indicates emissions will be reduced by up to 9 billion tons a year, about 30% of global emissions, by 2030. Japan has pioneered efforts toward such a framework. Under the Joint Crediting Mechanism established in 2013, Japan has launched more than 200 projects in 22 countries mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, supporting the introduction of renewable energy power generation. Many Japanese companies have participated in these projects. In Bac Ninh Province, Vietnam, a large-scale waste-to-energy plant is being constructed by Japanese companies including JFE Engineering Corp. Instead of burning fossil fuels, the power plant will incinerate 500 tons of waste per day and use the heat from the incineration to generate electricity. The project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 41,800 tons a year, part of which will be factored into Japan's emissions reduction tally. Ahead of the launch of the Japan-led framework, 19 nations including Britain, Germany and India, and 14 international organizations, including the World Bank and the U.N. Development Program, attended a meeting in Kanagawa Prefecture last month. The Japanese government hopes more than 100 countries will adopt the new framework, which is aimed at helping partner countries by providing them with knowledge acquired through the Joint Crediting Mechanism, as well as positioning Japan as a leading player in global decarbonization efforts. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"

READ: Every country is struggling to cope, and Bangladesh is no exception: WB Official Expressing hope over the financial assistance from the other countries, Momen said already Germany is ready to provide Tk 20 billion, US Tk 12 million and France Tk 8 million and the UK will also provide assistance. He also placed five-point demands to protect Bangladesh from climate change. The demands include the developed countries which are emitting more carbon need to increase their rate of carbon emitting reduction, to pay the $100 billion now as per previous agreement, demanding compensation for loss and damage, need for green energy and for this funds and technology is needed and the developed countries should provide the money for this technology so that we can produce electricity from 40% renewable energy. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh69","Climate Change: IOM DDG calls for redoubling efforts ahead of COP 27","United News of Bangladesh"," ","International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Deputy Director General (DDG) for Operations Ugochi Daniels has advocated for greater efforts to jointly address climate change and human mobility at national, regional and global levels. 'Ahead of COP 27 DDG Daniels discussed the issues during her discussions with government officials and international humanitarian and development actors. The World Bank estimates that by 2050 one in every seven people in Bangladesh will have been displaced by climate change. Read:D-8 PTA likely to be operational this year to boost intra-trade Climate Change: IOM DDG calls for redoubling efforts ahead of COP 27 Daniels called for continued support to Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh. During her five-day visit to Bangladesh, she praised the government of Bangladesh's exemplary role in migration management and tackling climate change. IOM has been supporting the government of Bangladesh (GoB) since 1992 and has had an uninterrupted presence in the country since 1998. ""Bangladesh should be recognized for the important role they play in hosting more than 900,000 Rohingya refugees and their leadership as a 'champion country' of the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,"" said DDG Daniels. Daniels visited the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, which hosts more than 900,000 Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh. Most fled violence in Myanmar nearly five years ago. 'As the government of Bangladesh continues to provide humanitarian assistance, ongoing support from the international community is crucial until the situation in Myanmar allows for Rohingya refugees to voluntarily return in a safe and dignified manner,' said DDG Daniels. In Cox's Bazar, IOM has been providing life-saving assistance, including shelter, health services, water and other emergency items to Rohingya Refugees since 2017. Climate Change: IOM DDG calls for redoubling efforts ahead of COP 27 During her visit, DDG Daniels viewed environment friendly initiatives such as a sustainable solid waste management facility, the world's largest humanitarian solar powered water supply system and a cleaner energy provision system all designed and implemented by IOM. She noted that many of these initiatives could be scalable at the national level. 'The protracted nature of this crisis requires us to scale up the creative and innovative response to this unique situation. We need to continue to build the resilience of the refugees to ensure they live with dignity in the face of reduced humanitarian funding,' DDG Daniels added. Earlier this year, IOM issued an appeal for USD 139 million to support 1.4 million refugees and host community members in the country. In Dhaka, Daniels met State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md. Enamur Rahman; Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen and Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Secretary Dr Ahmed Munirus Saleheen, among other diplomats, UN officials and civil society representatives. Commenting on the DDG's visit to Bangladesh, Abdusattor Esoev, IOM Bangladesh's Chief of Mission, said the high-level visit is very timely and reflects the importance of the government of Bangladesh to IOM, and the organization's continued commitment to support people on the move in this country. Every year, approximately one million Bangladeshis migrate abroad, while the 13 million nationals who have been employed overseas since 1976 contribute to national development through remittances. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh70","Simmering criticism grows about climate summits","November 6, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 6 -- Environmental analysts and socio-economists have been making less than positive observations about the forthcoming United Nations Climate Summit ( COP 27 ) scheduled to be convened in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6 to November 18 this year. Last year COP 26 was held in Glasgow, UK. This summit has already drawn the attention of world leaders, high-ranking United Nations officials, and thousands of environmental activists worldwide. The COP27 summit is an annual gathering of 197 countries that is expected to discuss climate change and what each country is doing to limit the impact of human activity on the climate. About 90 Heads of State have already confirmed their attendance. Prince of Wales Prince Charles had planned to go to November's COP27 conference but after ascending the throne as King Charles he decided not to attend on the advice of the then Prime Minister Liz Truss. The current British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after initial uncertainty about his participation in COP 27 has made a U-turn and has announced on November 2 that he will attend the COP Climate Summit in Egypt. The UK will apparently also be represented by other senior ministers, as well as by COP26 President Alok Sharma. A Downing Street spokesperson has, however, pointed out that ""the British government is absolutely committed to supporting COP27 and leading international action to tackle climate change and protect nature."" US Secretary Kerry, President Biden's climate envoy has suggested that King Charles should reconsider his decision not to go to the UN climate conference in Egypt. He has also underscored that as Prince of Wales, Charles had spent decades campaigning on environmental causes, which was not a political issue. According to him, climate change and its effect ""is a generic broad-based, existential issue for the world, and his continued leadership"" will be ""very important"". One has to wait and see what happens. Amr Abdel-Aziz, Director of Mitigation at Egypt's Ministry of Environment has noted that while the central theme for COP27 is implementation as host, Egypt is also looking forward to ""demonstrate what that looks like in terms of mitigation and adaptation. If the summit can address the topic of implementation in all of its discussions, it will be a sign of its success."" The primary objective of COP27 will apparently be directed towards analysis of the steps that have been undertaken since COP26 to achieve positive results in terms of emissions reduction. It will also evaluate the impact of financing losses and damage. In this matrix, Egypt plans to also facilitate discussion on ""doubling climate adaptation financing by 2025 and reaching an agreement on the unfulfilled US Dollar 100 billion financial pledges from developed countries."" It appears that the overarching goal during the forthcoming COP27 will be to strike a balance between all parties' interests. It is being expected that the mitigation programme, for example, will primarily be driven by developed countries and small island developing states, which are currently experiencing severe climate change impacts. On the other hand, emerging markets will principally be accountable for adjustments, losses, and damages. Many like Professor Felix Dodds and Chris Spence, who have attended many of them, have gone to the extent of questioning as to whether such Climate Summits are a ""waste of time"". Queries are also emerging as to how Simon Stiell, the UN Climate Chief will resolve the various issues that have surfaced since the last meeting in Glasgow. Some of the anxiety that is slowly surfacing requires serious thought. It needs to be mentioned that since 1995, there has been a climate COP (short for 'Conference of the Parties') every year except 2020, when it was postponed due to the Covid pandemic. Over the years, the COP meetings have travelled from Berlin to Buenos Aires, Kyoto to Cancun, and Bali to Marrakesh. It has gone round the world with the aspiration of finalising new agreements to see off the apparition of climate change. Effects of climate vulnerability have also repeatedly drawn attention to its effect regarding achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In this context I am reminded of my attending the 1992 Climate Conference that was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and the creation of a UN Climate Treaty. This triggered a wave of national laws, policies, and regulations that have rippled out across every country on earth. This initiative created a consensus among nations that the modern socio-economic system needed to not only seriously monitor the evolving dynamic being brought about through climate change but also determine the least common denominators and agree on how to tackle the intractable problem. This process started to shift almost every aspect of our modern economic system away from 200 years of reliance on fossil fuels. The most recent Climate Summit held in Glasgow attracted tens of thousands of participants and generated a lot of interest. World leaders and celebrities joined the multitude, while the global media reported every move in the corridors of power and to concerned citizens protesting outside the meeting areas. However, it needs to be understood that discussion on the evolving circumstances related to climate change, variability and the required response needed for adaptation and mutation also takes place before and after the COPs every year, through UN-sponsored technical group preparatory climate meetings and workshops. These events are supposed to help us move the needle on climate change, keeping our warming world within the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold beyond which we face potentially catastrophic consequences. The question that has slowly surfaced after Glasgow is whether the world, particularly the developed countries, addicted to fossil fuel have abided by the required measures that are needed to control climate change. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence have warned us that climate scientists have been expressing scepticism as to whether we have been really able to, despite our many meetings, to get off our dangerous path. In this regard environmentalists and climatologists associated with efforts related to tracking carbon action estimate that we are currently on track for somewhere between 1.8-2.7 degree C, with the lower number representing their most optimistic-and least likely-scenario. This is clearly well above where we need to be. Climate activists think that there are words exchanged and views expressed but in most cases it ends in acrimony with very little agreement between parties. Even when accord is reached, there is no guarantee that governments and other stakeholders will keep their pledges. Nevertheless, some activists and environmentalists disagree with such pessimism. They underline that despite flaws and weaknesses, these summits have actually played a significant role in the paradigm of energy. They point out that within our global energy systems, from being a niche market in the 1990s that could not compete on cost with coal, oil and gas-generated electricity, in 2020 solar power became the cheapest source of electricity in history. The technology behind both solar and wind have since moved on since then in a positive manner-- thanks in large part to the flow-on effects of international lawmaking. The much-criticised Kyoto Protocol of 1997, now largely superseded by the 2015 Paris Agreement, has also brought the private sector firmly into the equation, launching carbon markets and spurring private sector investment that has begun to reshape our global economy away from its reliance on fossil fuels. There has also been some influence in terms of manufacturing electric vehicles, power generation and also with regard to building design. It also needs to be acknowledged that despite pessimism among certain quarters many new pledges and promises are slowly surfacing on the sidelines of the official negotiations. This is emerging through ""coalitions of the willing"" who are wishing to make progress in specific sectors like green investment, electric vehicles, reducing methane emissions or halting deforestation. This can only be seen as positive developments. Analysts F. Dodds and C. Spence have in this context correctly observed that these alliances of governments, private companies and other stakeholders have been able to make advances in specific sectors where the official UN negotiations-which require consensus among more than 190 governments-could not. The groups involved in such coalitions subsequently choose to network, negotiate, and announce their plans during the COPs because of the public interest in these events. One should not deny that the benefits of such initiatives and collaborations are certainly considerable. Many are consequently hoping that the COP27 in Egypt will be an ""implementation COP"" where we will seriously try to turn pledges and well-laid plans into action. This time it is being expected that there will be pressure for countries to come with bolder measures to reduce their national emissions and for wealthier nations to bring more money to the table when it comes to supporting the developing world with regard to urgent measures not only associated with both adaptation and mitigation, but also with financial help pertaining to the loss and damage incurred through climate change. Time has come for participants in the coming COP to try and make efforts similar to the dedication demonstrated by a handful of scientists and diplomats who helped create the Montreal Protocol to save the ozone layer. Environmental activist A. Fathy has also astutely observed that the most significant obstacle to developing countries achieving their climate goals has been a ""lack of adequate and adequate financing from developed countries. Despite years of neglect, adaptation financing remains a top priority for developing countries"". He has drawn attention to the fact that Egypt is also one of the few nations that actually struggle with water scarcity and has expressed hope that COP 27 will also focus on this aspect. Without it, developing countries cannot combat and mitigate the effects of climate change. We have also noticed on the other hand the opposite side of this equation in the last few months through the massive flooding that has taken place in Bangladesh, some parts of India and also in Pakistan. Africa is also facing similar problems in Nigeria. There have also been cyclones which have wrecked devastation in parts of North America, the Caribbean and also in parts of South East Asia. Discussions in recent past COP meetings have generally been flawed, frustrating and at times agonisingly slow. Nevertheless, it is still without doubt our last and the best hope of success. We have to rise above national interests and look towards global good. We need to remember that our next generation should not inherit an impaired world that we leave behind. Instead of disagreements we need to undertake cooperation. That is the only way to go forward.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh71","COP27: UAE, Egypt agree to build one of world's biggest wind farms","November 8, 2022 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 8 -- The presidents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt witnessed the signing of an agreement on Tuesday to develop one of the world's largest onshore wind projects in Egypt, reports Reuters citing an official statement on the Gulf nation's state news agency. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the UAE's renewable energy firm Masdar alongside its joint venture with Egypt's main renewable energy developer Infinity and Hassan Allam Utilities, the statement on news agency WAM said. Masdar, invested in a portfolio of renewable energy assets with a combined value of more than $20 billion and a total capacity of more than 15 GW, said the new project would be its biggest yet. ""With this agreement to develop our largest ever project, Masdar is proud to bolster our contribution to Egypt's renewable energy goals,"" Masdar's CEO Mohamed Jameel al-Ramahi said. Tuesday's agreement was signed on the sidelines of the ongoing COP27 climate summit in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. The UAE is hosting the COP28 conference next year. When completed, the wind farm would be part of Egypt's Green Corridor initiative, a grid dedicated to renewable energy projects that is aimed at ensuring renewable energy makes up 42% of the country's energy mix by 2035. The wind project would save Egypt an estimated $5 billion in annual natural gas costs, the statement said. Egypt's total installed power capacity was around 59.5 GW in 2019/2020, the country's renewable energy authority said in an annual report. ""The project will enable the country to save vast amounts of natural gas; thereby attaining economic growth, reduce carbon emissions and provide greater access to sustainable energy sources,"" Mohamed Mansour, the chairman of Infinity Power, the Masdar and Infinity joint venture, said in the statement. In April, Masdar and Hassan Allam Utilities signed two Memoranda of Understanding with Egyptian state-backed organisations to cooperate on the development of 4 GW green hydrogen production plants in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and on the Mediterranean coast. In the first phase of that project, a green hydrogen manufacturing facility will be developed and operational by 2026, able to produce 100,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually for bunkering in the Suez Canal, the statement said. The electrolyzer facilities could be extended to up to 4 GW by 2030 to produce 2.3 million tonnes of green ammonia for export as well as supply green hydrogen for local industries, it said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh72","Nearly 100 scientists call for health-centred response to climate change: Report","October 26, 2022 Wednesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Oct. 26 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  In the summer of 2022, record-breaking heatwaves blazed through parts of Europe, India, Pakistan and North Africa, triggering wildfires and heat-related deaths. The changing climate has raised the risk of dengue transmission by 12 per cent globally over the past decade, compared with the 1950s. Reporting these findings in top science journal Lancet, close to 100 scientists across the globe are calling for a health-centred response to the climate crisis, as its increasingly alarming health impacts are often less emphasised. The seventh annual Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change report, released on Wednesday, pulled 43 indicators that monitor the health impacts of climate change and analysed the extent of solutions available to address the impacts. Led by the University College London, the report represents the work of 99 experts from 51 institutions, including WHO, the World Meteorological Organisation and two researchers from Singapore. The two researchers  Associate Professor Jason Lee and Dr Samuel Gunther from the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine  contributed to an indicator that investigated heat's effect on light exercise. They found that over the past decade, a typical person who did light exercise outdoors was at high risk of suffering heat stress for 238 more hours each year  a 42 per cent rise  compared with someone who did it 20 years ago. A handful of new indicators and metrics were added to the new edition, including the impact of extreme temperatures on food insecurity and households' exposure to harmful pollutants caused by burning fossil fuels. That same year, fossil fuel-derived particulate matter in the air led to 1.3 million deaths worldwide, the report added. Food insecurity also worsened this year, with the economic effects of the Russia-Ukraine war pushing up food prices. Extreme weather events have also shortened the growth of staple crops by up to 10 days compared with a few decades ago, reducing yield and harvests. The report said: ""The prevalence of undernourishment increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. This situation is now worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy and cost-of-living crises... threatening to result in 13 million additional people facing undernutrition in 2022."" The experts' call for a health-centred response to climate change comes less than two weeks before November's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Beyond physical health, the report also touched on mental health. It noted that temperature spikes, heatwaves and humidity have been associated with worsened mental health outcomes and increased suicidality. The experts recommended incorporating mental health management in disaster reduction plans and efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ""Climate activism can be associated with increased mental wellbeing,"" they added. However, the report also gave a nod to emerging glimmers of hope  as the authors called it  where progress has been seen in climate action and in efforts to phase out pollutive fossil fuels. For example, although the deployment of clean, renewable energy remains insufficient, it reached record high levels in 2020. In 2021, zero-carbon energy sources also accounted for 80 per cent of investments in ways to generate electricity. The report also noted that 86 per cent of the countries that submitted their updated or new climate pledges to the UN, called the nationally determined contributions (NDC), acknowledged the link between health and climate in their updated documents. The updated NDCs were submitted between 2020 and 2021, and Singapore was one of 126 countries that included health-climate links in their documents. By 2045, temperatures in Singapore could hit 40 deg C on some days, compounded by the urban heat island effect. The Republic is also at risk of worsened dengue outbreaks, since warmer weather allows the Aedes mosquito to breed faster. Singapore has already seen a major dengue outbreak this year, with more than 29,200 people infected in 10 months. Several factors contributed to the surge, including warm, rainy and humid weather, and the spread of a previously uncommon dengue serotype, DenV-3. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh73","Prioritizing mitigation, adaptation strategies in COP-27 summit","November 6, 2022 Sunday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 6 -- This year, the COP-27 climate summit is projected to be taken place on the frontlines of the converging climate change, foodstuffs, energy & fossil fuel, health complexities & hygiene, and acute state of debt crises. The summit, in Egypt in November 2022, will hopefully deal with new weather extremes, food shortages, and crises in fossil fuel, global price hikes, and a gradually rising cost of living worldwide. The summit will necessarily justify a need and opportunity like never before to galvanize immediate, on-the-ground action in the countries that most require it. The current year's summit has been themed 'implementation' that aims to shift the focus from negotiations and planning to action on the ground, where it is a must-need perspective. This seeks to strengthen adaptation and mitigation mechanisms to climate change impacts, in parallel with emission reductions. The ensuing summit will push and navigate countries, the private sector, and local governments to deliver on promises already made, capacitate them in line with science & technology, and help to develop and emerging economies overcome barriers to finance and build long-term climate action capacity for better resilience. This is also the time for major polluters to accelerate their phasedown of coal, oil, and gas. It is true that Russia is financing its war machine, while the shrinkage of global supplies has already made acute energy shortages and cost of living spikes in the developed and developing worlds bringing hardline austerities in everyday life. Excessive emission of carbon, the erratic presence of methane, and other greenhouse gases like - nitrous oxide, CFC, ozone, etc. have been turning the earth's surface intensely hot and excessively warmer. Industrially developed nations are mostly responsible for the huge creation of greenhouse gas (GHG). Many nations including Bangladesh, because of unfavorable geo-position, experiencing the impacts of climate-induced adversity on severe magnitudes. If the global community fails to reduce global warming within a rise of two degrees (ideally within 1.5 degrees), a goal which was set under the Paris Agreement earlier, almost half of victim developing nations will suffer extensively. Increasing threats of imbalance in the environment and ecology, gradual temperatures rising, melting ice of polar regions, sea levels rising, and frequent natural calamities-will challenge human survival vigorously. Consequently, some unforeseen impacts of climate change have already entangled our bio-diversity, life and livelihood, and socio-economic perspectives of the country's climate-vulnerable communities. Global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by at least 45 per cent from current levels by 2030 if it is to achieve the target set by the Paris Agreement. And global coal usage in power generation must be cut back by 80 per cent, which means developed countries must pledge to phase out coal by 2030 to avoid the perpetual catastrophe of climate change. Following the Paris Agreement, we all have to work for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by the middle of this century. And rapid action to withdraw the use of harmful fossil fuels from the power sector has to be instituted throughout the world. This is indeed bittersweet that the World Bank continues to empower fossil-energy projects despite promises to tackle climate change. A German-based environmental research report says that the World Bank has invested more than 1200 crore dollars in fossil energy projects since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. According to Oxfam, millions of dollars in loans are being rendered by the World Bank to climate-vulnerable poor countries instead of helping them to deal with the effects of climate change. The use of fossil fuels has declined during the ongoing pandemic, but there is an upward trend in fossil fuel investment funds. As of now, nearly 81 per cent of the world's total energy comes from fossil fuels. Since the use of non-renewable energy has been increasing alarmingly for decades, we might move towards a Non-Proliferation Treaty of using fossil fuels. Poor nations must be provided with both technical assistance and a handsome amount of grants from the developed ones to depart from fossil fuels. As Bangladesh is one of the most affected countries, it has no choice but to take potential action to assert its rights as a victim country. Rehabilitation with extending livelihood advantages for climate-vulnerable communities should get prioritized. To mitigate the risks of climate change, and alleviate the impoverishment and fatality resulting from global climate, the issuance of necessary support from responsible developed countries is capitally substantial. In that case, our country needs to bargain successfully for getting the required climate funds (cash support) from the global initiators concerned with world climate change. Otherwise, we have to face many hurdles to mitigate the inevitable risks of climate change in the days ahead. As a part of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce the emission of carbon within the domestic territory and adapt to the effects of climate change and increase the use of alternative energy, our country might head to undertake eco-friendly and cost-efficient energy-generating ventures. Just as a timely move to have a climate-resilient transformation the government should necessarily formulate the green energy generation policy, and reconsider future investment in the fossil fuels-dependent mega power projects in the country. To combat climate change issues, protect biodiversity, and accelerate growth to achieve the goals of a sustainable environment-all nations must limit greenhouse gas emissions for a better existence and safer survival in the future.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh74","COP27: Our Expectation on Climate Finance","Energy & Power"," ","The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in the year 1992 in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil at the Earth summit. It was ratified in the year 1994 with 52 signatories. The first COP, the apex body of UNFCCC called conference of parties (COP), was held in Berlin, Germany in 1995. In this process of COPs the 27th meeting will be held from 6-18th November 2022 at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The Bangladesh delegation, led by Md. Shahab Uddin, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, will participate in this COP along with other 196 countries. The decisions of the COP process to some extent are slow. However, from COP 1-26, we got some very remarkable and historic decisions to address the global climate change issues. The principal objective of UNFCCC is to reduce the GreenHouse Gas emissions (mainly CO2, methane and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere. Under climate change this is called mitigation. From the previous COPs, major and important decisions were: adoption of Kyoto Protocol in COP 3 which is the binding commitment for the developed countries (Annex -1) to reduce the GreenHouse Gas emissions in the atmosphere. In COP 7 there were some important decisions on climate finance, such as creation of climate funds (least developed countries fund, special climate change fund and adaptation fund). COP 7 also adopted the flexible mechanism (market mechanism) of the Kyoto Protocol. That is the operationalization of carbon trading/market. In COP 13 in the year 2007 in Bali, Indonesia, Bali Action Plan (BAP) was adopted and AWG-LCA was formed (Ad hoc working group on long term cooperative action). Under the Bali action plan the countries under UNFCCC were supposed to take decisions on vision on global temperature rise, adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology developmental transfer and capacity building within 2009. However, in COP 15 at Copenhagen, Denmark, parties were unable to make consensus on COP decisions. Parties can only take note on some important issues on climate change. These notes of the parties are termed as Copenhagen Accord. In COP 16 in the year 2010, parties adopted some important decisions such as Cancun adaptation framework (adaptation committee, formulation of national adaptation plan), Technology framework (creation of climate technology committee, climate technology center and network etc. ), creation of dedicated climate fund called Green Climate Fund (GCF), provision to generation of 100 billion USD per year as climate finance from 2020, generation of 30 billion dollars as fast start financing within 2012 etc. In 2015 at COP 21, the historic Paris agreement was adopted with the presence of around 120 heads of government including our Prime Minister with some key outcomes. The vision to keep global temperature rise in this century well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, was adopted. Other major decisions were submission of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by every country in each 5-10 year interval (based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities). For the first time Article 8 of the Paris Agreement recognized the issues of loss and damage (although compensation issues are still in limbo). The new element transparency and global stock take were incorporated as the important building blocks of climate change negotiation). In the finance decision the 50-50 allocation between adaptation and mitigation, preferential treatment on financing for the least developed and vulnerable countries and access issues on climate finance were also addressed. The outcome of COP 22 to COP 26 was the operationalization of the decisions of the Paris Agreement. In short we call them MPG (modalities procedures and guidelines). In COP 26 we got some important decisions on climate finance such as long-term climate finance (LTF); new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG); information related to Article 9.5, of the Paris Agreement (PA); Matters related to the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF); Report of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to the COP and guidance to the GCF; Report of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to the COP and guidance to the GEF; Matters relating to the Adaptation Fund (AF); Report of the AF Board for 2020 and 2021; and Fourth Review of the AF. In COP 26, SCF got the mandate to find out the universal and accepted definition of climate finance. The language in the decision was however considerably weakened, since the developed countries were completely opposed to the idea of giving any mandate to the SCF for a single multilaterally agreed climate finance 'definition'. Common definition of climate finance is important to have clarity to avoid double counting and to account for the financial flows from developed to developing countries to address climate action. For the lack of common definition sometimes we misunderstood about the climate finance flow from developed to developing countries. For example, if we consider the calculation of OECD the finance flow for 2020 was around 80 billion USD whereas according to Oxfam it is around 20 billion USD. According to India, it is around 5 billion USD. There are huge discrepancies on numbers (financial flow) due to lack of common definition of climate finance. COP 26 took a decision on this issue and said in the decision 'notes with serious concern the gap in relation to the fulfillment of the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020, including due to challenges in mobilizing finance from private source'. According to sources, during the discussions on the aforesaid paragraph, developed countries wanted to push the responsibility to developing countries and the lack of 'enabling environments' in their countries due to which the private sector had not been able to mobilize finance. Instead of taking responsibility for the lack of fulfillment of the goal, developed countries suggested welcoming their efforts in meeting the goal of USD 100 billion. Following a lot of heated exchanges, the language above was adopted. On adaptation finance, the decision requests developed countries 'to significantly increase their provision of adaptation finance, including by, as appropriate, considering doubling adaptation finance with the aim of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation'. Developing countries wanted stronger language and more emphasis on adaptation finance, but there was a lot of opposition from developed countries to make references to 'doubling'. Although the Paris Agreement language emphasized the importance of public and grant-based resources for adaptation finance, these were dropped from the final text of COP 26. The decision adopted also requests the SCF 'to undertake further work on mapping the available information relevant to Article 2.1(c), of the PA, including its reference to Article 9 thereof, with a view to providing input for consideration by COP 27 . Parties also requested the SCF to 'prepare a report in 2022 on progress towards achieving the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year to address the needs of developing countries (to be considered at COP 27 ) and to continue to contribute to assessing the achievement of the goal in the context of the preparation of its biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows (BA)'. Parties also invited the COP 27 Presidency to 'organize the high-level ministerial dialogue on climate finance in 2022 on the progress and fulfillment of the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020'. Expanding the work of the LTF further, Parties decided 'to convene biennial high-level ministerial dialogues on climate finance in 2022, 2024 and 2026' and requested the COP Presidency 'to summarize the deliberations at the dialogues for consideration by the COP in the year thereafter'. As explained above, developing countries were in favor of mandating the SCF to work on one definition rather than multiple definitions and they said that this would aid in transparency and accountability of climate finance. They proposed that climate finance resources must be new and additional, climate-specific and consist of grants, concessional loans and guarantees or other instruments that ensure concessional finance. Developed countries were opposed to this, and were of the view that having one definition of climate finance was just not possible since each Party defined the climate finance differently. The stand of developed countries is an obstacle to finding a common definition on climate finance. In fact the quality of climate finance is an area of concern. The major part of climate financing is loan (around 70%) and sometimes not even concessional loan. Loan might be suitable for mitigation as it generates some profit or revenue but adaptation in almost every case does not generate revenue so how a vulnerable country or people could repay the loan money with interest. Again for a long time the developing countries including Bangladesh are fighting for the balance allocation between adaptation and mitigation. But still allocation for adaptation is around 10-20% and maximum of them are loans. Access to adaptation financing is another big obstacle. Access to mitigation financing (as it only calculates the GHG emission reduction) is somehow easier than the adaptation financing (adaptation is local and depends on local vulnerability and sometimes it needs a lot of effort to make it properly understandable). If we consider approved projects of GCF, adaptation projects took 2-3 times higher time than the mitigation projects. In this way adaptation is treated as the step son of UNFCCC. For making our understanding on climate finance clear, here are some important principles, the outcome of UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Financial Mechanism of UNFCCC A mechanism for the provision of financial resources on a grant or concessional basis, including for the transfer of technology-------------. (Article 11.1 of UNFCCC) The developed country Parties may also provide and developing country Parties avail themselves of financial resources related to the implementation of the Convention through bilateral, regional and other multilateral channels. (Article 11.5 of UNFCCC) The developed country Parties ------shall provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their obligations ------. -----------------. The implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate burden sharing among the developed country Parties. (Article 4.4 of UNFCCC) The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties. (Article 4.7 of UNFCCC) The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situations of the least developed countries (LDCs) in their actions with regard to funding and transfer of technology. (Article 9.1) The provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation (Article 9.1). Taking into account country-driven strategies, and the priorities and needs of developing country parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and Small Island Developing States, considering the need for public and grant-based resources for adaptation. (Article 9.4) Developed country Parties shall provide transparent and consistent information on support for developing country Parties provided and mobilized through public interventions biennially in accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement, at its ---------------(Article 9.7) The institutions serving this Agreement, including the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, shall aim to ensure efficient access to financial resources through simplified approval procedures and enhanced readiness support for developing country Parties, in particular for the least developed countries and small island developing states, in the context of their national climate strategies and plans. (Article 9.9) Other Important COP Decisions on Climate Finance Recognizes that developed country Parties commit, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries; (COP 16, paragraph 98) Decides that a significant share of new multilateral funding for adaptation should flow through the Green Climate Fund (COP 16, paragraph 100) Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective mobilization goal through 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation; prior to 2025 ------------------ shall set a new collective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries; (Paris decision, paragraph 53). After situation analysis and considering the financial mechanism of UNFCCC, COP decisions and the Paris Agreement, Bangladesh along with other vulnerable counties and LDCs make their stand for the following points: The term 'climate finance' should be defined clearly for transparent accounting, monitoring and to ensure the new and additional nature of climate finance. The principles of UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, particularly article 9.4, 9.5 and 9.7 should be materialized immediately. Adaptation financing is less prioritized than the mitigation financing both as GCF and other funding windows. Adaptation financing should be prioritized for climate vulnerable developing countries. Significant portion of international climate funds should flow through multilateral processes such as GCF, LDCF and adaptation funds rather than through bilateral channels. The decision on new, additional, predictable financing as well as balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation, grant based financing for adaptation and prioritized financing for climate vulnerable countries, LDCs and SIDs should be implemented. Given the concerning projections about the $100 billion, it is vital that developed countries give clear indications of how they will step up their funding to meet the USD 100 billion goal in line with the Paris Agreement. Developed countries should come forward with a Delivery Plan including sources of financing and the mode of allocation. We need to define how the provision of climate finance should be divided between rich nations, what should be counted as climate finance, how flows of finance should be reported, ensuring transparency of information with a robust MRV system. Our Stand and Crucial Points on Green Climate Fund (GCF) Proper and regular replenishment of developed countries to GCF (and Adaptation Fund) and the enhanced capacity of GCF is the key to the success of the financing mechanism of UNFCCC. The latest figure of GCF replenishment stands at around $9.8bn, but that is inadequate relative to the needs. Our expectation is that the 2nd replenishment must be adequate. There should be prioritized and easy access for vulnerable countries, LDCs and SIDs both for accreditation and project funding. The investment criteria indicators related to calculating the incremental costs needs to be made flexible for the LDCs and vulnerable countries, as this will consume extra resources for proposal development and expertise. This in turn will delay the preparatory process of a project proposal for submission to GCF funding. Bangladesh demands that the longdecided issue of balanced distribution of CF between Adaptation and Mitigation (50:50) will be achieved by the next COP. Also, we want to see the implementation of the decision of allocating 50% of adaptation finance to go for the vulnerable countries. In conclusion, we can say our expectation on different issues of climate change particularly on climate finance is high. However, it is only possible to materialize it by the strong political commitment of developed countries and the major economies of the world. Otherwise, maybe we are moving towards a dangerous and unsustainable pathway of development. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh75","COP27: We're on a highway to climate hell, UN boss says","November 7, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 7 -- United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres told countries gathered at the start of the COP27 summit in Egypt on Monday they face a stark choice: work together now to cut emissions or condemn future generations to climate catastrophe. The speech set an urgent tone as governments sit down for two weeks of talks on how to avert the worst of climate change, even as they are distracted by Russia's war in Ukraine, rampant consumer inflation and energy shortages. ""Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish,"" Guterres told delegates gathered in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. He called for a pact between the world's richest and poorest countries to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels and the delivery of funding to ensure poorer countries can reduce emissions and cope with the impacts of warming that have already occurred. ""The two largest economies - the United States and China - have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality,"" he said. Guterres asked countries to agree to phase out the use of coal, one of the most carbon-intense fuels, by 2040 globally, with members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development hitting that mark by 2030, reports Reuters. Despite decades of climate talks - the Egypt COP is the 27th Conference of the Parties - progress has been insufficient to save the planet from excessive warming as countries are too slow or reluctant to act, he noted. UAE TO CARRY ON PUMPING OIL, GAS Immediately after Guterres' speech, United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan took the stage and said his country, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, would continue to produce fossil fuels for as long as there is a need. ""The UAE is considered a responsible supplier of energy and it will continue playing this role as long as the world is in need of oil and gas,"" he said. The UAE will host next year's UN conference, which will attempt to finalise agreements made last year in Britain and at this year's Egyptian talks. Signatories to the 2015 Paris climate agreement pledged to achieve a long-term goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. Scientists have set this as the ceiling for avoiding catastrophic climate change. Guterres said that goal will only stay alive if the world can achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The head of the International Monetary Fund told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference that climate targets depend on achieving a global carbon price of at least $75 a tonne by the end of the decade, and that the pace of change in the real economy was still ""way too slow"". The World Trade Organization, meanwhile, said in a report published on Monday that it should tackle trade barriers for low carbon industries to address the role of global trade in driving climate change.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh76","Disappointing UN climate talks leave 'huge task' for COP27 Egypt summit","June 17, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, June 17 -- A ""disappointing"" fortnight of UN talks in Bonn has left much work to be done just five months before a crucial climate summit, diplomats and analysts said, after negotiations failed to make concrete advances on efforts to tackle global warming. At the closing session on Thursday, developing nations expressed disappointment over scant progress at the mid-year session on key issues, especially on setting up a finance facility to deal with rising losses from extreme weather and rising seas. The lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) said the 39-member grouping had not received assurances that climate finance ""will be delivered at scale or speed"". ""The climate emergency is fast becoming a catastrophe. Yet within these walls, the process feels out of step with reality,"" said Conrod Hunte, UN ambassador for the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda. The weak outcome from Bonn - which also saw no major steps forward on emissions cuts or toward a global goal to drive adaptation - leaves diplomats with a ""huge task"" before November's COP27 summit in Egypt, said Alex Scott of think-tank E3G. ""It's looking like negotiators have come without the political wiggle room to ... make sure that we get to COP27 with a real sense of progress,"" E3G's climate diplomacy leader told journalists. RIFTS The talks in Bonn saw longstanding tensions flare between developing and developed countries over issues ranging from who should take more responsibility to reduce climate-changing emissions to how to pay to repair and avert ""loss and damage"". From the start, countries tussled over whether and how to put on the official UN agenda a dialogue on setting up a dedicated fund for loss and damage. The issue was left undecided in Bonn, prompting outgoing UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa to call for ""major political decisions"" at COP27 on finance for loss and damage. This - together with increased funding for adaptation and clean energy - ""is crucial to build a more sustainable and resilient future"", she noted in a statement. Harjeet Singh, a senior advisor with Climate Action Network International, said that for the first time many developed countries had in Bonn acknowledged the gap in providing finance to vulnerable countries to help them recover from climate change impacts they had little role in causing. But rich nations - including the European Union, Switzerland and the United States - then went on to block discussion on a new finance facility and did not even allow developing countries to add it to the agenda for COP27 , he noted. ""Instead of using empty words, rich countries must show (a) spirit of international cooperation and solidarity,"" Singh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. PARIS INTO PRACTICE Espinosa said the focus was now on ensuring that the Egyptian COP, in the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, ""could truly be the place where the important promises of the Paris Agreement are turned into reality"". Countries kick-started discussions in Bonn on how to slash emissions faster and deeper to meet the tightest Paris accord goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), and to assess their collective progress in doing so. But there were divisions over how to push forward a programme aimed at ratcheting up emissions reductions globally - with at-risk nations asking for it to continue until 2030, while some countries, such as China, wanted it to last just a year. Wealthy governments also sought to have the mitigation programme include major emerging economies but faced push-back from developing countries that have historically contributed less to carbon emissions. David Waskow, director for international climate action at the US-based World Resources Institute, called on major polluters to strengthen their emissions reduction targets and on rich countries to deliver the funding needed for vulnerable nations to deal with the effects of a heating planet. ""Perhaps the most decisive outcome from these (Bonn) talks is that developed countries now realise that the chorus calling for solutions to loss and damage is only getting louder,"" he said. ""Addressing this issue is a central measure of success for the UN climate summit in Egypt,"" he added in a statement. 'UNCONSCIONABLE' Climate-vulnerable nations have long grappled with the slow pace of progress at UN negotiations, with their key demands - including more finance - going largely unmet. A report by the Vulnerable Twenty Group (V20) on 55 economies hit hard by climate change - from Bangladesh to Kenya to South Sudan - this month found they had lost about $525 billion - or 20 per cent of their wealth on average - in the last two decades due to the impacts of global warming. Climate change-driven losses are already surging and are set to become much worse if measures to curb emissions from fossil fuel use worldwide are not dramatically stepped up, a flagship UN science report in February warned. At the Bonn closing session, Switzerland said the talks had not seen sufficient progress on ambition to cut emissions to keep the 1.5C goal within reach, warning that this year ""we may lose 1.5 degrees"" - something ""we simply can't afford"". Hunte of AOSIS called for high-emitting countries to submit stronger plans for emissions cuts by a UN deadline in late September, warning of a ""code red"" situation, with the world teetering on the edge of ""overshoot into disaster"". ""Science must be the basis of our decision here yet we leave with a disappointing conclusion. This is an unconscionable way to negotiate with vulnerable countries,"" he told delegates.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh78","Professor Yunus calls for single COP 27 agenda, immediate end to Ukraine war","November 14, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 14 -- Colombia's University Externado de Colombia recently organised a day-long public event on the university campus to mark the visit of Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus on the theme of building a more equitable world through social business, says a press release received on Monday. The 140-year-old university, with 14,000 students, has already taken a joint programme with Yunus Center and established a 'Yunus Social Business Center' in the university in 2019. The main event of the day was a dialogue between Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus and former President of Colombia and Nobel Peace Laureate Juan Manuel Santos on the topic of social business as an engine for reducing poverty and building peace, said the release. Yunus called for an immediate stop to the Ukraine war. He said, there should be an agenda for COP 27 ""This war is already a 'World War' -- a war against the present and future of human beings on this planet. It is a war against whole humanity, not just one country. ""The world has no option but to think about the long-term future. Every single country is forced to divert its resources to address the heavy impact of this war on people, food supply and economy. No person or no country is spared from the impact of this war. It has forced COP goals off the radar of policymakers,"" Yunus said. Professor Yunus elaborated on how a world of three zeros -- zero net carbon emissions, zero wealth concentration to end poverty and zero unemployment by unleashing entrepreneurship in all - especially through the mobilisation of young people, can be made possible. Mr Santos agreed that youth are the key drivers for the creation of such a world and that he supported youth initiatives to create social businesses with the help of Yunus Environment Hub, an organisation dedicated to social business in environment and circularity. The nearly hour-long conversation highlighted issues of poverty reduction, youth entrepreneurship and social business, the climate challenge, immediate ending of the Ukraine war and building peace as a prerequisite to creating a more equitable world. The public event at the university was attended by nearly 1000 people including high-level civil society representatives, diplomats, UN organisations, entrepreneurs in person and many more online. The event started with welcome remarks by deans and directors of University Externado de Colombia and the Executive Director of Yunus Centre. There were presentations made by Yunus Environment Hub on the projects they are undertaking together with the Compaz Foundation of Mr Santos. There was also a presentation by Yunus Social Business, an organisation based in Berlin, which has invested in 12 social businesses across Colombia. On the sidelines of the event, Professor Yunus held a discussion with Bogota's Mayor Ms Claudia Lopez to talk about ways Bogota and other cities could become three zero cities towards creating three zero world. She later presented her vision and actions to the audience, especially in the areas of women, entrepreneurship and social business. On the same day, Professor Yunus met with Pedro Ferrari, economic advisor to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, and the country's Vice President, Francia Marquez. Vice President Francia Marquez, a woman of Afro-Colombian origin, expressed interest in establishing a rural model microcredit bank for poor families in Colombia and sought Professor Yunus's advice on the proper steps to take to establish such a bank, including its financing, operational procedures and legal framework. At the end of the day, in a separate session, Universidad Externado de Colombia presented its five research projects on microfinance, social business, circular economy and peace-building through social business conducted in collaboration with the Yunus Center over the last three years. Two young researchers who have received scholarships under the joint programme with Yunus Centre were presented, at the meeting. The researchers are business entrepreneurs themselves who are simultaneously conducting independent research on social business.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh79","COP27: How will UN climate deal on loss and damage work?","United News of Bangladesh"," ","The decision Sunday by nations around the world to establish a fund to help poor countries hit hard by a warming planet was one of the most significant since U.N. climate talks began 30 years ago. It was an unequivocal confirmation that poor countries, with limited resources, are being most impacted by extreme weather events like floods, heat waves and storms and, at least at some level, industrialized nations that have done the most to contribute to climate change have a responsibility to help. While government leaders, environmentalists and activists celebrated plans for such a fund, there are many outstanding questions, ranging from how it will work to long-term repercussions. Here is a look at the development of the idea of 'loss and damage,' the term it's given in climate negotiations, and what we know about the fund. HISTORY In the early 1990s, the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of low-lying coastal and small island countries, began calling for the establishment of a loss and damage fund as the United Nations was creating a framework to deal with climate change on an international level. Since then, the idea has always been a part of annual U.N. climate summits. However, it was often talked about on the margins of negotiations, something developing nations and activists would push for while many rich nations used their weight to squash the idea. For the first time, at this year's COP27 it was included in the agenda and became the centerpiece of discussions. WHO WILL FUND IT? The fund will initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources, such as international financial institutions, with an option for other major economies to join down the line. During the talks, China said money for the new fund should come from developed countries, not them. But there's precedence for China to voluntarily pay into climate funds, if the U.S. does too. When the Obama administration pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund in 2014, China also paid $3.1 billion for the fund. More details of who pays will be decided by a committee that plans to get the fund going within a year. WHO WILL GET MONEY? The deal says the fund will assist 'developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,"" though there will be room for middle-income countries that are severely affected by climate disasters to also get paid. Pakistan, which was devastated by flooding that put a third of the country underwater, or Cuba, recently battered by Hurricane Ian, could be eligible. How the loss and damage fund will fit in with ""other institutions, agencies that are out there doing humanitarian work, helping people rebuild, dealing with migration and refugee crises, dealing with food security, water security' will need to be worked out, said David Waskow, the World Resources Institute international climate director. Those details will also be hammered out by the committee in the coming year. REBUILDING TRUST Beyond just financial help, setting up the fund is seen as a huge step forward, but how it's ultimately viewed will depend in part on how fast it can be set up. In the closing session Sunday, Antigua's Lia Nicholson said the transitional committee should be set up immediately and given clear mandates. 'This loss and damage fund must become the lifeboat that we need it to be,' she said. There is a credibility gap because of past broken promises. In 2009, rich nations agreed to provide $100 billion a year to help developing countries transition to green energy systems and adapt to climate change. However, to date, that initiative has never been fully funded. REPERCUSSIONS One of the main reasons that rich nations long opposed such a loss and damage fund was the fear that it would open then up to long-term liability. Despite passage, that concern is very much still at play, as evidence by how negotiators made sure the language of the fund didn't say 'liability' and that contributions were voluntary. Despite those caveats, the establishment of such a fund could have repercussions, both legal and symbolic, in climate circles and beyond. For example, several Pacific Island nations have been pushing for the International Court of Justice to consider climate change. They argue that international laws must be strengthened to protect their rights in the case that their lands are engulfed by rising seas. The establishment of a loss and damage fund could bolster those arguments. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh80","COP27 climate talks begin as world grapples with multiple crises","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Envoys from around the globe gathered Sunday in the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks on tackling climate change amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch. Negotiators spent a frantic two days ahead of the meeting discussing whether to formally consider the issue of loss and damage, or reparations, to vulnerable nations suffering from climate change. The issue, which has weighed on the talks for years, was agreed just hours before the meeting officially opened. In an opening speech, the head of the U.N.'s panel of climate scientist highlighted the urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of global warming. 'This is a once in a generation opportunity to save our planet and our livelihoods,' said Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The outgoing chair of the talks, British official Alok Sharma, said countries had made considerable progress at their last meeting in Glasgow, including on setting more ambitious targets for cutting emissions, finalizing the rules of the 2015 Paris agreement and pledging to begin phasing out the use of coal - the most heavily polluting fossil fuel. 'We kept 1.5 degrees (2.7 Fahrenheit) alive,' he said, referring to the most ambitious goal of the Paris pact, to keep temperature increase since pre-industrial times under that threshold. Yet now those efforts were being 'buffeted by global headwinds,' he warned. '(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's brutal and illegal war in Ukraine has precipitated multiple global crisis, energy and food insecurity, inflationary pressures and spiraling debt,' said Sharma. 'These crises have compounded existing climate vulnerabilities and the scarring effects of the pandemic.' However even the most optimistic scenarios assuming countries do everything they have pledged put the world on course for 1.7 C of warming (3.1 F), he warned. 'As challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic and can only defer climate catastrophe,' said Sharma. 'We must find the ability to focus on more than one thing at once.' 'How many more wake up calls does the world to world leaders actually need,' he said, citing recent devastating floods in Pakistan and Nigeria, and historic droughts in Europe, the United States and China. His successor, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, said his office would 'spare no effort' to achieve the goals of the Paris accord. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi wrote on Twitter that Egypt, as host country, was seeking to move from the 'pledges phase to the implantation phase with concrete measures on the ground.' The U.N.'s top climate official also appealed to countries both to engage constructively in the negotiations and take the necessary action back home. 'Here in Sharm el-Sheikh, we have a duty to speed up our international efforts to turn words into action,' he said, adding that 'every corner of human activity must align with our Paris commitment and pursue our efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.' More than 40,000 participants have been registered for this year's talks, reflecting the sense of urgency as major weather events around the world impact many people and cost billions of dollars in repairs. Egypt said over 120 world leaders will attend, many of them speaking at a high-level event on Nov. 7-8, while U.S. President Joe Biden was expected to arrive later in the week. But many top figures including China's President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India were not planning to come, casting doubt on whether the talks in Egypt could result in any major deals to cut emissions without two of the world's biggest polluters. Rights groups criticized Egypt on Sunday for restricting protests and stepping up surveillance during the summit. New York-based Human Rights Watch, citing Egyptian media, said authorities had also arrested dozens of people for calling for protests. 'It is becoming clear that Egypt's government has no intention of easing its abusive security measures and allowing for free speech and assembly,' Adam Coogle, the group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Human Rights Watch said it had had joined about 1,400 groups from around the world urging Egypt to lift the restrictions on civil society groups. Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent imprisoned pro-democracy activist from Egypt, escalated his hunger strike Sunday in the first day of the COP27 , according to his family. Abdel-Fattah's aunt, award-winning novelist Ahdaf Soueif, said he went into a 'full hunger strike,' and stopped drinking water at 10 a.m. local time. Concerned that he could die without water, she was calling for authorities to release him in response to local and international calls. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh81","Asia-Pacific youth at COP27 demand loss and damage compensations over climate change's impact","November 16, 2022 Wednesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 16 Singapore(The Straits Times/ANN)- SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  Living in a time when the climate crisis is set to worsen, young people attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt are calling for loss and damage compensation to cope with the irreversible impact of climate change. Holding protests at the conference venue, several youth organisations demanded that countries set up a finance facility to provide new, additional and accessible funding to address and limit the irreversible effects of climate change. The Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, Youngo (the youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), and the UK Youth Climate Coalition also called for a youth advisory committee on loss and damage to be set up so that youth can be more meaningfully included in the decision-making process. Ms Hyacinthe Niyitegeka, 28, a co-founder of the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, said that while she is glad loss and damage have officially been added to the COP agenda this year, it is only the beginning of a long battle to get countries largely responsible for the climate crisis to pay up and compensate developing countries affected by the crisis. So far, countries such as Austria, New Zealand and Denmark have pledged to finance loss and damage. The Loss and Damage Youth Coalition was founded in 2020 to rally youth from developing countries in the Global South to raise awareness of the scale and extent of damage that have been escalating in intensity caused by the climate crisis. The Global South refers broadly to the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. ""There are many people out there who are not aware of these losses and damage, including youth,"" said Ms Niyitegeka, a water scientist from Rwanda. ""With this initiative, we want to be able to fight for ourselves, fight for our future, and at the same time, raise the profile of youth voices on the global stage to pressure world leaders to fulfil their promises."" Having meaningful youth involvement in negotiations could also push for higher climate ambition and intergenerational equity, he added. Filipino climate activist Mitzi Jonnelle Tan, 25, wants young people to have a stake in loss and damage negotiations due to the sheer scale of climate debt that poorer countries would have to potentially pay. ""A lot of loss and damage finance that has been given to developing countries are in the form of loans, and not grants, which would mean that many countries will go into debt to these Global North countries. ""It is not just the older generation who will be paying off this debt, but the younger generation and the generations to come,"" said Ms Tan, who is with Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines. Extreme weather events are now increasing in intensity and frequency. In October, a severe tropical storm  Typhoon Noru  swept across the Philippines, affecting close to three million people and damaging billions of pesos' worth of infrastructure and agriculture. In Pakistan, severe flooding in 2022 has claimed more than 7,000 lives, and caused almost US$40 billion (S$55 billion) in damage, said Mr Pervez Ali, 19, the country coordinator for youth climate advocacy group Fridays for Future (Pakistan). ""So it's a big catastrophe, and I think as youth representatives from Pakistan, we should be emphasising youth involvement in policymaking because it's our future,"" he added. But while the economic fallout from climate change  such as the loss of infrastructure, homes and agricultural land  is large, young people are also worried about the non-economic or intangible losses, such as the impact on physical and mental health, that can be difficult to quantify. Intense flooding events and cyclones in Fiji and Pakistan, for example, have left a traumatic imprint on the youth in those countries. Mr Lavetanalagi Seru, 30, the regional policy coordinator at the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network, said that young people who survived a Category 5 typhoon in the Fijian island of Gau in 2016 are still afraid to play in the rain, and cry at any sound of thunder. The Fijian added: ""We don't have adequate facilities and the necessary resources to deal with mental health on this scale. To be able to address this, we would need funding, and it would have to come from a loss and damage finance facility."" Likewise, Mr Ali hopes for attention and loss and damage funding in Pakistan to go towards climate education, so that young people can better understand and cope with climate change's effects. He added that massive floods have destroyed schools and homes, and upended the lives of many, displacing people to other parts of the country. Dr Sandeep Chamling Rai, a senior adviser for WWF International's Global Policy Adaptation, said that the finance facility might account for mostly loss and damage that can be measured in monetary terms. Dr Rai said resources from the fund can potentially be used to minimise non-economic losses, such as by creating new conservation areas to minimise biodiversity loss, or to help relocate people from one place to another. Ms Joy Reyes, a human rights and climate justice lawyer with the Manila Observatory, said: ""I hope that the finance facility really focuses on assisting those that are historically at the margins, especially indigenous people, who are similarly the front-liners of the climate crisis and its last line of defence.""

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh82","In Egypt, host of COP27, a small step toward green energy","United News of Bangladesh"," ","From a distance, the endless landscape of solar panels stretching toward the horizon can easily be mistaken for crops nearing harvest. But here in the desert in southern Egypt, workers have been cultivating another precious commodity: electricity. After the sun strikes the photovoltaic solar panels, a thermal charge generates electricity that runs to four government-owned power stations distributing power across Egypt's national grid. It's part of the country's push to increase renewable energy production. With near-perpetual sunshine and windy Red Sea coastlines, experts say Egypt is well-positioned to go green. Yet it is also a developing country and like many others faces obstacles in making the switch. Much of its infrastructure depends on fossil fuels to power the nation of some 104 million people. The solar panel farm - Egypt's flagship project named Benban, after a local village - puts it at the African continent's forefront when it comes to renewable energy. But questions remain over Egypt's long-term green energy strategy, and whether there are enough incentives for the cash-strapped government to supply 42% of the country's electricity from renewable resources by 2035, as it has announced. Karim el-Gendy, an expert at Chatham House who specializes in urban sustainability and climate policy, says Egypt has failed to meet its goal of having 20% of its electricity sourced from renewables by 2022. The current figure is now closer to 10%, according to according to the International Energy Agency. There's less demand for solar energy, partly due to the influx of natural gas, thanks to new discoveries located in Egypt's section of the Mediterranean Sea. 'We have seen less interest in the past couple of years in integrated renewable energy projects in Egypt, both in terms of solar, in the south, and wind,' he said. As host of this year's global climate summit, known as COP27 and now underway in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt has said it will pressure other nations to implement climate promises made at previous conferences. Egypt is not bound by any carbon emissions cap, but it has vowed to mitigate and curb its emission rises across key polluting sectors, such as electricity and transport. Its use of natural gas has also helped, allowing Egypt to move away from burning coal and oil, much dirtier industries - but nevertheless, gas is still a fossil fuel. The government has revealed few details on how it will implement or finance the 2035 vision. Foreign investment will likely play a big part, as countries in Europe look south for solar power. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has allotted $10 billion of funding for over 150 projects across Egypt, with Benban claimed as one of its major successes. The sprawling farm is designed to grow as demand for solar energy increases. ''It offers great potential for us and other investors,'' said Faisal Eissa, general manager for Egypt at Lekela, a Dutch company that has invested in Benban. Egypt's New and Renewable Energy Authority claims Benban has already reduced the country's annual greenhouse emission output. But there is still a long way to go. In 2020, renewables accounted for 6% of Egypt's energy consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with petroleum products accounting for 36% and natural gas for 57%. Coal accounted for just 1%. Egypt may also have less of an incentive to invest in renewables as it grapples with domestic challenges, including an economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, Russia's war in Ukraine and a years-long government crackdown on dissent. Last month, Cairo reached a preliminary deal with the International Monetary Fund that would allow access to a $3 billion loan. Effects of climate change are already being felt in the Nile River Delta, where rising seas have brought on creeping salt that eats away roots and cakes farms, devastating the livelihoods of Egyptian farmers. The country's congested capital city of Cairo is the second top source of greenhouse gas emissions, after the giant offshore Zohr gas field, according to the Climate TRACE. The remaining 90% of Egypt's land is uninhabitable desert. By better utilizing the vast expanse and coastlines, the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency said the North African country could generate over half of its electricity from renewables by 2030. It's a different way of viewing the country's sun-scorched landscape. 'People here have started to look at the sun as a source of power,"" said Ahmed Mustafa, who runs one of the area's many new logistics companies that work alongside Benban's developers and engineers, supplying them with equipment. For the locals, the solar farm has been transformative. Thousands worked at the site when it was under construction, and many stayed as technicians and cleaners once it became fully functional. Ultimately, the development of more wind and solar capabilities will come down to what makes business sense for the government, despite its expressions of good intent, according to el-Gendy. ''The need to expand its renewable sector all depends on Egypt's commercial interests,'' he said. \"

The Initial contributions include around 170 million euros from Germany and more than 40 million euros from other countries. The first recipients of Global Shield packages - called Pathfinder countries - include Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines and Senegal. Global Shield, an initiative for pre-arranged financial support designed to be quickly deployed in times of climate disasters, was officially launched Monday by the Vulnerable 20 Group of Finance Ministers (V20) of 58 climate vulnerable economies and the Group of Seven (G7). In addition, a broad coalition of countries, multilateral institutions, and non-state and private sector partners has underlined their full institutional commitment to Global Shield. Ghana Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, V20 Chair: ""As part of our Climate Prosperity Plan to reduce the 98 per cent financial protection sinkhole, the Global Shield will play a key role in resourcing financial and social protection packages to protect our economy, our enterprises and our communities."" Svenja Schulze, Federal Development minister of Germany: ""Under the German Presidency, the G7 have committed to scale-up action and support on loss and damage and to work towards a 'Global Shield against Climate Risks', responding to the V20's call."" Henry Kokofu, special envoy of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Ghana Presidency: ""The fate of the most vulnerable will be the fate of the world. Have we not noticed the way heat waves have ransacked entire cities in France, Italy, and Spain? Forest fires have invaded the US and flooding has invaded Germany. It is time to wake up, Kokofu added. The Global Shield addresses current weaknesses in the financial protection structure in climate vulnerable economies via pre-arranged finance which disburses quickly and reliably before or just after disasters happen. A financing structure with three complementary funds forms the foundation of the Shield: the Global Shield Solutions Platform, which builds on InsuResilience Solutions Fund, the Global Shield Financing Facility at the World Bank, and the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) & V20 Joint Multi-Donor Fund.

'The voices of young people are being reflected and integrated into these plans. Now we need action. We need to know young people's perspectives on climate issues,' she said ahead of the COP27 . To foster climate negotiation and youth voice at the global level, Brighters Society of Bangladesh, with the support of ActionAid Bangladesh organized a virtual two-day long pre-COP conference titled 'Bangladesh Youth COP 2022' on September 17-18. Director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development Prof Saleemul Huq said, 'Don't have high hopes from COP 27 . The leaders of the world come together in COP and take some small initiatives. So, only participating in COP is not important.' He said the climate change problem of yesterday is not the same for today or tomorrow. 'We already entered the era of loss and damage of climate change. We need to highlight the loss and damage issues in the COP. Polluters of the world must agree and pay to the sufferers of pollution. Young people need to act as leaders and activists to advocate and engage others.'' Saber Hossain Chowdhury, MP said it is impressive that young people from every corner of Bangladesh are thinking about the whole world. 'We need them to battle against the climate change issues. We are seeing different crises globally because of climate change,' he said. However, the lawmaker said, the sad reality is that they have not yet found any sustainable solution for it. 'Climate change is an agenda of young people, by the young people and for the young people. It's high time young people led from the forefront, their voices are heard and acted upon. I think, even though they are the front liners, their concerns are not reflected and often remain unheard at the policy-making level,' he said while speaking as the chief guest at the closing session. UN Resident Coordinator stresses urgency of fighting climate change He added, 'We try to reflect on the youth voice and their recommendations in COP and engage them progressively.' In this pre-COP conference, young people from Bangladesh and other parts of the world demanded six points and asked for immediate actions from the world leaders. These demands include keeping the increase of average global temperature within 1.5\'b0, stopping fossil burning and using renewable energy, providing compensation for countries affected by climate change, giving climate responsibility to residents of developed countries, ensuring protection funds for women and children affected by climate change and ensuring adequate funding and technical support for adaptation. Jannatul Maoua, a representative of the youth community at the conference, said the salinity of water and the shortage of clean water have increased due to climate change, affecting women the most. Urging youth to be the one being represented at COP 27 , International Children's Peace Prize winner and youth icon Greta Thunberg said the voices in this world having most power belong to the ones who are destroying it. 'The powerful voices of the global north say they pledged to be climate neutral by 2050, turning everyone back to sleep. If they cared, they would immediately reduce their emission for the benefits of billions of people. But they are not caring, they are not being honest. Instead, they are spending their time actively delaying the necessary changes and prolonging their business as usual for their own benefit,' she said. 'If we continue like today, COP 27 will just be yet another chance for them to pollute the world. We cannot let that happen one more time', she added. Reefat bin Sattar, Director, Program, Development and Quality, Save the Children in Bangladesh said, 'We already are a failure. So, young people should come forward to take the leadership role.' Dr. Ainun Nishat, Emeritus Professor, Center of Climate Change and Environmental Research, BRAC University said, 'Climate change is not the problem of today; not the problem of tomorrow; not the day after tomorrow. 30 years later maybe we won't be here, so it is your problem.'

""We couldn't agree on the primary issue, which is financing for vulnerable countries over climate change-induced losses. No decision has been taken on the length of the mitigation programme to reduce carbon emissions either.

Ziaul added that the COP27 participants are currently preparing the outlines of Global Goal on Adaptation and Loss and Damage programme so that decisions can be taken on them in the next conference. ""Although the issue of adapting to climate change is widely discussed in each conference, no one provides any money as there is a lack of policies. That's why we're working on Global Goal on Adaptation. Hopefully the goal will be finalised in the next conference and then we'll get the money,"" added Ziaul. Talking to various Bangladeshi representatives at COP27 , UNB learned that there is a chance for the Glasgow-Sharm el Sheikh Work Program on Mitigation to get the final nod. Climate vulnerable countries are pushing for this work program. The work programme will list which countries need to check carbon emissions first. Besides, a synthesis report on how much carbon is being emitted will also be prepared till 2030 under the programme.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh95","UN experts alarmed by restrictions on civil society ahead of climate summit","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Egypt must ensure the safety and full participation of all parts of civil society at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) in November, UN human rights experts said, after a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists. This new wave follows years of persistent and sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders using security as a pretext to undermine the legitimate rights of civil society to participate in public affairs in Egypt. 'Arrests and detention, NGO asset freezes and dissolutions and travel restrictions against human rights defenders have created a climate of fear for Egyptian civil society organisations to engage visibly at the COP27 ,' the experts said on Friday. They warned that Egyptian NGOs have previously been subjected to harassment, intimidation and reprisals for cooperating with the UN. A lack of information and transparent accreditation criteria for Egyptian NGOs, a coordinated increase in hotel room rates, undue restrictions to freedom of peaceful assembly outside the COP27 venue, and unjustified delays in the provision of visas to those travelling from abroad were the main concerns for civil society activists, the experts said. Civil society plays an essential role in the advancement of climate action, and the experts underscored that Egypt should ensure safe and meaningful participation at COP27 , including for independent civil society. 'Instead of further limiting their rights, civil society actors and human rights defenders, including those working on climate rights, must be given an opportunity to raise awareness about their views and protection needs,' the experts said. 'We strongly believe that COP27 , organised by the United Nations, should uphold the public's right to participate in the conduct of public affairs, as recognised by Egypt.' The experts expressed their support to calls by civil society that the UNFCCC Secretariat should develop human rights criteria that countries hosting future COPs must commit to meeting as part of the host agreement. COP27 will take place in Sharm el Sheikh from 6 to 18 November. The experts are in dialogue with the Government of Egypt and the UNFCCC Secretariat on this issue. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh97","Mideast nations wake up to damage from climate change","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Temperatures in the Middle East have risen far faster than the world's average in the past three decades. Precipitation has been decreasing, and experts predict droughts will come with greater frequency and severity. The Middle East is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to the impact of climate change - and already the effects are being seen. In Iraq, intensified sandstorms have repeatedly smothered cities this year, shutting down commerce and sending thousands to hospitals. Rising soil salinity in Egypt's Nile Delta is eating away at crucial farmland. In Afghanistan, drought has helped fuel the migration of young people from their villages, searching for jobs. In recent weeks, temperatures in some parts of the region have topped 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). This year's annual U.N. climate change conference, known as COP27 , is being held in Egypt in November, throwing a spotlight on the region. Governments across the Middle East have awakened to the dangers of climate change, particularly to the damage it is already inflicting on their economies. Read: Mideast nations wake up to damage from climate change 'We're literally seeing the effects right in front of us. ... These impacts are not something that will hit us nine or 10 years down the line,' said Lama El Hatow, an environmental climate change consultant who has worked with the World Bank and specializes on the Middle East and North Africa. 'More and more states are starting to understand that it's necessary' to act, she said. Egypt, Morocco and other countries in the region have been stepping up initiatives for clean energy. But a top priority for them at COP-27 is to push for more international funding to help them deal with the dangers they are already facing from climate change. One reason for the Middle East's vulnerability is that there is simply no margin to cushion the blow on millions of people as the rise in temperatures accelerates: The region already has high temperatures and limited water resources even in normal circumstances. Middle East governments also have a limited ability to adapt, the International Monetary Fund noted in a report earlier this year. Economies and infrastructure are weak, and regulations are often unenforced. Poverty is widespread, making job creation a priority over climate protection. Autocratic governments like Egypt's severely restrict civil society, hampering an important tool in engaging the public on environmental and climate issues. At the same time, developing nations are pressuring countries in the Mideast and elsewhere to make emissions cuts, even as they themselves backslide on promises. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh98","The Broken Promise and Climate Summit: What will Developing Countries Get from COP27?","Energy & Power"," ","S ince the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 to COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow, the industrialized western developed countries have made numerous promises and come out with various plans to assist the developing poor countries with the mitigation of climate impact. At each summit, there have been a lot of talks, promises, handshakes and photo sessions but no visible and measurable climate impact mitigation and adaptation activities were undertaken in developing nations. Yet, the western industrialized rich countries have miserably failed to deliver on their pledged 100 billion US dollars each year. At every Conference of Parties (COP) facilitated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) since the 2009 Copenhagen COP, the western rich countries reiterated their promises each time but at the same time spectacularly they failed to deliver them. Climate finance (100 billion US dollars per year) promised by the western industrialized developed countries which mustered their wealth through carbon-intensive industrialization, deforestation, and ruthless mining activities over several centuries, is aimed to be spent for the climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries, which have been affected most by the climate change. Climate mitigation spending is intended to reduce carbon emissions through investing in clean energy systems, reducing emissions, and coping with the impacts of climate change. Climate mitigation is often well suited to the private sector as it allows their money to be dispersed as loans, thereby returning the investment with a substantial profit. In contrast, the adaptation spending is aimed at the relocation, and re-habitation of climateaffected people, flora and fauna, flood-resilient infrastructure development, early warning systems for calamities such as cyclones, tidal surges, floods, etc. , which by nature are not directly profit-making ventures. Thus, climate adaptation needs grants, not loans. Indeed, climate-driven disasters are disproportionately harming low-income countries (less than 1,045 US dollar yearly per capita income)- and lowermiddle-income countries (between 1,045 and 4,095 US dollar yearly per capita income) and these countries have contributed far fewer greenhouse gas emissions which caused the climate change effect. There is an urgent need for climate funding to deal with the escalating loss and damage from climate change. Some of the wealth accumulated through western industrialized developed countries' relationships to the fossil fuel-driven industrial and other carbon-intensive activities is now being used to support those countries which have not contributed to carbon emissions. These unfortunate countries are now disproportionately affected by climate disasters. Developing countries call for the commitment to a climate fund by the western developed industrialized nations for addressing the loss and damage as compensation. The research indicates that the climate crisis has destroyed a fifth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the developing nations, which contributed the tiniest bit to global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. In contrast, industrialized western countries have contributed over two-thirds of global CO2 emissions since the industrial revolution. For example, entire Africa has contributed only 3% of the global cumulative CO2 emissions. It is highly discriminatory to ask the most affected developing nations, of their no fault, to share the same or more of the burden of climate mitigation and adaptation. Under Kyoto Protocol, 37 industrialized developed countries signed a binding agreement to reduce CO2 emissions by 5%, the commitment was increased further by 18% under Doha Agreement in 2012. But in Paris Agreement in 2016 (more accurately December 2015), the industrialized developed countries retracted from their binding agreements of CO2 emissions reduction and forced emerging and developing nations to commit to CO2 reductions and climate change mitigation. The western industrialized developed nations are now advocating to keep the average global temperature rise below 1.5\'b0C by 2050. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), at least 1.8 trillion (1,800 billion) US dollars per year is required to keep global warming not exceeding 1.5\'b0C. The promised 100 billion US dollars is 18 times less than the required amount. The raised highest amount for climate funds is around 62 billion dollars. However, the actual amount is less than 20 billion according to Oxfam estimates. The developed countries use a non-transparent or dubious accounting system to estimate their contribution. According to India's Ministry of Finance estimation, the actual contributed amount is less than 1 billion dollars per year. An article published by the world's top-ranked journal 'Nature' in 2021, stated that the UN's 46 leastdeveloped nations received less than 6 billion dollars from 2014 to 2018, amounting to less than 1.2 billion dollars per year for 46 countries combined (26 million dollars per country per year). This amount includes cash and in-kind through bilateral finance ( 30%), multilateral finance (~ 25%), private finance (~ 15%), export credit (~ 3%) and other dubious mechanisms (~27%). Most interesting is that nearly 80% of the committed fund is a loan with various strings and less than 20% is a grant. On the other hand, only 20% fund is committed to climate adaptation while 80% fund is for climate mitigation. The ratio is supposed to be fifty-fifty. The continent of Africa, where most least developed and climate-affected countries are located, needs to spend over 50 billion US dollars each year for food imports despite having vast fertile farming land. If technological and financial assistance is provided for sustainable agricultural development, African countries can spend 50 billion US dollars on climate impact mitigation and adaptation, health, and education. The onslaught of COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia conflict fuelled by the US-led western countries have created a profound impact on global food production due to the shortage of fertilizer and high energy costs. Without fertilizer use, the crop yield can drop by over 50%. On the other hand, when energy prices go up, food prices also go up. Therefore, energy prices and food prices are interconnected. Thanks to self-imposed sanctions by the US-led western countries against Russia's energy resources (oil, gas, and coal), the gas price in Europe has shot up to an oil price equivalent of 500 US dollars per barrel of oil, creating an unimaginable misery for developing countries as they are unable to purchase energy resources (oil, gas, and coal) from the global energy market. At such a skyrocketing energy cost, can any industry manufacture products or farmer produce food at a price affordable for the common masses in any emerging and developing countries? The US-led western sanctions against Russia (a country with plentiful surplus energy resources and a leading energy exporter, the largest food, and fertilizer supplier to the rest of the world) have had a severe effect on climate impact mitigations, especially in developing countries. Some key points in this regard are: Some European countries have restarted their coal-fired power plants to generate electricity breaking their commitments to greenhouse gas emission reductions due to the shortage of imported natural gas and the high cost of imported fuels. Transportation of coal, oil, and LNG as far as from Australia to Europe to replace Russian energy creates higher greenhouse gas emissions thanks to burning more fuels by ships as they need to travel a longer distance. Artificial creation of energy shortage by imposing sanctions on the world's largest energy exporter resulted in severe energy shortage, high demands, and high prices in the international market, which have forced developing and emerging nations to spend more money on energy procurement leaving no money left for climate mitigation effort. Unprecedented money printing and giving printed money to the population as COVID-19 help, and defense industries to ramp up their military armament production by the US, UK and the European Union have created high inflations in their jurisdictions, and to reduce the high inflation, their central banks have been progressively raising the benchmark interest rates, which in turn drains the capitals from the developing nations to avail the high-interest rate on deposits in the USA, UK and European Union. This unprecedented outflow of capital has created shortages of the US dollar, UK pound, and EU's euro, forcing the sharp devaluation of developing countries' national currencies. The developing countries are losing over 2 billion US dollars of their foreign reserves every weekday, to prop up their currencies against the dollar. In total since February 2022, the developing nations have lost their reserves by over half a trillion US dollars so far. Nearly all developing countries have experienced the freefall of their national currency exchange rate against the dollar, pound, and euro (some countries devaluated up to 40%). Furthermore, low-income and lower-middle-income countries are now facing a debt servicing crisis. Therefore, developing nations are in a difficult position to spend any money on climate mitigation and adaptation as agreed in COP26. The climate fund should be spent as a grant not a loan for true and meaningful climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. It is the expectation of developing nations from any COP including Sharm El-Sheikh COP27 in 2022. The western developed nations must show their sincerity in their actions, not in promises. The climate fund (100 billion dollars yearly) must be spent at a fifty-fifty ratio on climate adaptation (50%) and climate mitigation (50%). \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh103","War Defocuses Climate Target","Energy & Power"," ","The COP26 could not be held as per schedule in 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic, but the deferred one held in Glasgow, Scotland in 2021 ushered in great hopes and expectations. The developed world virtually did not give any positive response before the global commitment of the Paris Agreement to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the present millennium. Consequently, the agreement had to rephrase the commitment to limiting global warming as much as possible well below 2 degrees Celsius. The developing world had to remain contended with that target. But global leaders talked about limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius before the avalanche of the COVID pandemic. They talked about the challenges of achieving the target. However, COP26 had to agree on 'Phasing Down Coal' in place of the originally planned 'Phasing Out Coal'. Developed countries also did not object to reducing subsidies to fossil fuels. On top of all, the 'Rule Book' considered an essential tool for implementing Paris Agreement could be finalized. These created great hype about potential successes for the COP of the African countries, COP of the developing countries - COP27 . But the faster resumption of economic activities following the easing of the pandemic triggered unprecedented skyrocketing of primary fuel prices in the global market. The Russia - Ukraine war and western countries' embargo on Russia added fuel to the fire. The situation of entire world is now topsy-turvy in absorbing the impacts of the unprecedented price hike of fuel. Currency devaluation against the US dollar in different countries has further deepened the crisis. Hence disappointments and apprehensions have spread among global communities about the success anticipated for COP27 , which is going to take place from 6 November at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The question now being raised is about the pledges the world community, especially the developed countries, is going to commit to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 14-day Conference of Parties (COP). Bangladesh delegation will also reach there before the official commencement of the conference. Md. Shahab Uddin, MP, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, will lead the delegation. Experts observed that COP negotiations proceed according to the visions and perspectives of participating countries. Global war and conflicts will cast an impact on the discussions of the leaders. OECD countries informed that till COP26, only about US$80 billion in contributions has so far been accumulated. But contesting the contention of the OECD, international NGO OXFAM stated that the contribution to GCF is not more than US$20 billion. Dr. Munjurul Hannan Khan, CEO of Nature Conservation organization, quoting information from the recent meeting of GCF told EP that the fund contributed to GCF is merely US$11.3 billion. The situation appears bleaker as per research by an Indian economist, who claimed the amount to be only around US$ 1 billion. According to commitments in 2010, the developed world was supposed to provide an additional US$100 billion annually on top of the assistance and finance that developed countries provide to developing nations. Against the backdrop, the definition of Climate Assistance and Transparency of disbursement of funds will be discussed in COP27 . Talks may also be held about getting more contributions to the fund after 2025. Dr. Ainun Nishat, Professor Emeritus, said that the mere availability of funds in GCF will not serve the purpose. Until transparency can be established in the disbursement process, it will be extremely difficult for developing countries like Bangladesh to access the fund. Another element of the dispute of climate funds is about 80% loan and 20% development assistance. The loans were supposed to be soft loans. But in actual practice, this is not happening. According to Dr. Mizan R Khan, Deputy Director at International Center for Climate Change and Development, climate-vulnerable countries and developing nations may be trapped in the 'Climate Loan Net' for the lack of fund availability, the character of funds, and transparency of disbursement. The issue of the inclusion of carbon trading under the Paris Agreement from the Kyoto Protocol through almost finalized, but the Paris Rule Book remains incomplete. This can be discussed and completed in COP27 . Md. COP27 . The stocktaking on the progress of limiting the global temperature rise and other pledges commensurate with NDCs of different countries will start next year. It would not be as easy as pledged. The modus operandi will be extensively discussed at the technical and policy level meetings during COP27 . Experts believe that it may be possible to finalize the stocktaking mechanisms at COP27 . Despite the expectations of most countries, the process of utilizing the climate fund on adaptation and mitigation at a 50:50 ratio could not be agreed upon at the UNFCCC forum. 80% of the proceeds of the fund are now being used for mitigation. COP26 decided that the Adaptation fund would be doubled to the level of 2019. This matter may be discussed in COP27 . 146 countries of G77+China are in favor of it. But there remains considerable doubt whether the countries expected to deliver funds will agree. Climate continues to play havoc all over the world although various measures were undertaken in adaptation and mitigation. Massive drought has severely affected agriculture in African countries. Possibilities of famine are looming in the coming years. Europe ran into a crisis of extremely hot summers and drought. Countries like Australia and the USA are no less impacted. Drought, absence of rain, excessive rain, bush fire, flood, tidal surge, etc. are now almost annual events. The issue of loss and damage was continuing for a long time under the Warsaw mechanism as well as the Santiago Network technical discussion forum. The matter was discussed with priority at COP26 in Glasgow and expectations were there for getting a global fund for this. As a token, Scotland and some other countries made some contributions. The loss and damage fund issue is on the provisional agenda for discussion at COP27 . Negotiators of Bangladesh are optimistic that this will be discussed and finalized at COP27 . 146 countries of G77 expect that developed countries will pledge funds for compensating the affected countries in addition to the US$100 billion for climate fund. But former Principal Secretary to Bangladesh Prime Minister and President of Bangladesh Energy Society Abul Kalam Azad observed that the availability of finance from climate funds would remain a challenge even if the fund is there. Developed countries are also affected by climate disasters. They would rather be willing to use this money in their countries. Additionally, African countries now want the inclusion of methane emissions from agriculture with food security. There will be food scarcity if agriculture is affected by the actions related to reducing methane emissions from agriculture. The availability of sweet water is gradually turning to a crisis level with the continued growth of the global population. But the source is not increasing, rather it is declining. Many rivers even in Europe dried up during summer. Even mighty Tigris got dried up. It is expected that this issue may be taken up in overall consideration at COP27 . The main challenge of the world community now is limiting global warming below 1.5 Degrees Celsius by 2100. But the IPCC report suggests that GHG emissions will reach a peak by 2025. Hence for achieving the target GHG emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030. But till now if emissions reduction can be achieved 100% of what countries have submitted through NDCs, the emissions cannot be reduced by more than 7%. Dr. Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed, Deputy Managing Director of PKSF (Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation) observed that developing countries do not emit much, hence they do not have much to reduce. 46 least-developed countries contribute only 3% of the total global emissions. G20 countries are responsible for 80-90% of global emissions. These countries are now adopting ambitious emissions reduction programs and implementing them religiously. Otherwise, global warming may increase by 2.4- 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2100. That is bad news for the world. Bangladesh has no obligation to reduce emissions. Bangladesh has made notable achievements in emission reduction by using its fund. Experts believe that Bangladesh has achieved more than it pledged. In the absence of stocktaking, Bangladesh cannot present exact figures to the global community. Besides, a major plan for renewable energy development, especially offshore wind resource development, has been undertaken under the Mujib Climate Perspective Plan. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina informed the global community that the country targeted 40% power generation from clean sources by 2041 that includes solar, wind, nuclear and imported clean electricity from neighboring countries. This is for the first time local experts have prepared the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Also, the local experts are formulating the National Adaptation Plan, which is at the final stage and will be presented at COP27 . But Bangladesh has so far received no mentionable global assistance in its endeavor towards reducing emissions. The reasons include a very difficult process in developing projects as a candidate for global assistance and a lack of required expertise. Now the first requirement is to take action plans along with India, China and other developing countries for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The second is working out a plan for providing technical as well as financial assistance to those countries that make pollution but lack capabilities for combatting. EIA forecasts that for the higher price of primary fuel in the global market, the investment required for EIA forecasts that for the higher price of primary fuel in the global market, the investment required to generate power from clean sources for achieving the emission reduction target by 2030 will increase to US$2 trillion annually. This may reduce the global emission gradually to 32 billion tonnes by 2050 from the present 37 million tonnes. But to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the investment must be doubled from US$2 trillion to US$4 trillion. Besides, this huge investment will be required for reducing GHG emissions. The reality is that even US$100 billion pledged for the Green Climate Fund is not available now. Wherefrom the additional finance would come? The western countries' embargo on Russia following its aggression on Ukraine requires huge investment for offsetting the impacts. Russia has restricted gas export to Europe. On top of it, the EU is providing US$5 billion in financial assistance every month to Ukraine. Military assistance to Ukraine is also expensive. The USA has announced US$110 billion worth of assistance to Ukraine. A major component of it is military assistance. Every country is under financial stress because of an increase in the prices of essential products. Countries have to devalue their currency against the US dollar - around US$200 billion is being drained out every month from the foreign exchange reserve. Talks on various programs for combating climate change may take place at COP27 . But experts expressed doubt over the commitments to provide additional money towards climate funds and other funds required. They also expressed skepticism about getting pledges for ambitious NDCs from major polluters. Ministers of Countries in the European Union at a recent meeting pledged to continue their contributions, but doubt remains about how much this would be. The EU countries appear more interested in providing financial assistance to Ukraine in the war rather than combating climate change. Many think that the war is for energy and that energy-rich countries are benefiting from it. The situation may not change unless political pressure is created on developed countries for investing in climate for saving the world rather than investing in war to destroy the world. The present situation, if not changed soon, is bound to delay getting commitments for funds. Hence it can be concluded that war has created grey holes in the global war against climate change. \"

'We submitted the final draft prepared to revisit the renewable energy policy on Monday', an official of the consultant firm- Development Technical Consultants Pvt. Ltd (DTCL), told UNB. Experts engaged in the review said the most emphasis was put on revisiting the existing policy targeting the government's goal for 40 percent of electricity from renewable and clean sources by 2041. 'Against the backdrop of land scarcity, use of rooftop of industries and urban establishments for solar power, solar-run irrigation pumps, floating solar, use of non-agricultural land, wind power potentials, biomass plants received the highest priory in the final draft of the revised policy', said an expert involved in the process of the draft preparation, but preferred anonymity. 'Hydrogen energy, net metering system, use of Opex and Capex models for large-scale solar plants are also the areas, which received important focus in the review of the policy', he added.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh106","UN chief warns planet is heading toward `climate chaos'","United News of Bangladesh"," ","U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday that the planet is heading toward irreversible 'climate chaos' and urged global leaders at the upcoming climate summit in Egypt to put the world back on track to cut emissions, keep promises on climate financing and help developing countries speed their transition to renewable energy. The U.N. chief said the 27th annual Conference of the 198 Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change - better known as COP27 - 'must be the place to rebuild trust and re-establish the ambition needed to avoid driving our planet over the climate cliff.' He said the most important outcome of COP27 , which begins Nov. 6 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, is to have £ clear political will to reduce emissions faster.' That requires a historical pact between richer developed countries and emerging economies, Guterres said. 'And if that pact doesn't take place, we will be doomed.' In the pact, the secretary-general said, wealthier countries must provide financial and technical assistance - along with support from multilateral development banks and technology companies - to help emerging economies speed their renewable energy transition. Guterres said that in the last few weeks, reports have painted £ clear and bleak picture' of global-warming greenhouse gas emissions still growing at record levels instead of going down 45% by 2030 as scientists say must happen. The landmark Paris agreement adopted in 2015 to address climate change called for global temperatures to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions are now on course to rise by 10%, and temperatures are on course to rise by as much as 2.8 degrees Celsius under present policies by the end of the century. Read more: Climate Change: Int'l community must act with fund and solutions to help most vulnerable nations 'And that means our planet is on course for reaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible and forever bake in catastrophic temperature rise,' the secretary-general warned. He said the 1.5 degree goal 'is in intensive care' and 'in high danger,' but it's still possible to meet it. 'And my objective in Egypt is to make sure that we gather enough political will to make this possibility really moving forward,' the U.N. chief said. ' COP27 Rich countries, especially the United States, have emitted far more than their share of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, data shows. Poor nations like Pakistan, where recent floods left a third of the country under water, have been hurt far more than their share of global carbon emissions. Loss and damage has been talked about for years, but richer nations have often balked at negotiating details about paying for past climate disasters, like Pakistan's flooding this summer. 'Loss and damage have been the always-postponed issue,' Guterres said. 'There is no more time to postpone it. We must recognize loss and damage and we must create an institutional framework to deal with it.'

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh107","Energy-efficient buildings on the rise in Viet Nam","June 27, 2022 Monday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Jun. 27 Ho chi minh City(Vietnam News/ANN)- Developing energy-efficient buildings is an inevitable trend for Viet Nam to achieve its environmental objectives. The energy used by high-rise buildings in Viet Nam accounts for around 35-40 per cent of the country's total energy consumption. A survey by real estate service firm Cushman & Wakefield (CWK) showed that around 40 per cent of gas emissions came from real estate. According to the Viet Nam Green Building Council, there are about 200 green buildings across the country. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021 (COP26), Viet Nam committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. According to CWK, the urban ecosystem development, including buildings, landscapes, resources, infrastructure, and air, should follow standards. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria could be considered a focus of the urban planning, CWK said, adding that ESG sets out specific standards related to business performance in the real estate market. Although some said that paying more attention to the environment might limit the pace of development, the on-track urban action was a worthy trade-off. This also creates opportunities for developers, owners and residents to develop strategies for building a habitable zone, CWK said. Singapore is a typical example of effective, sustainable planning with the introduction of the scoring system Green Mark for all real estate projects from 2005, according to CWK, adding that more than 49 per cent of buildings in Singapore met the government's green standards. Other green building rating systems currently applied in Viet Nam are LOTUS and LEED. Buildings with green certificates were Deutsches Haus, Friendship Tower, President's Place, Phu My Hung Tower and Saigon Centre 2 in HCM City and Techcombank Tower, Capital Place and Landcaster Luminarie in Ha Noi. According to Pham Van Tan from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology, construction costs of energy-saving buildings could be around 10-30 per cent higher, but these buildings could help reduce 20 per cent of the energy cost. He said that energy-efficient buildings would help reduce operating costs, bring socio-economic benefits, promote sustainable urban development, and ease environmental impacts. CWK said that industrial real estate would also need to go green, urging developers to pay attention to reducing emissions and protecting the environment, coupled with other factors which had impacts on the community in the building, such as green spaces, parks, and libraries and rooms for kids. Trang Bui, general director of Cushman & Wakefield Viet Nam, said that green buildings could be considered an investment for the future, adding that real estate associated with environmental, social and governance values was an inevitable trend. According to Hoang Manh Nguyen from the Green Urban Science and Technology Institute, it was necessary to develop a strategy for green building development with a focus on minimising inputs (raw materials) and outputs (waste) and increasing the re-use of materials.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh108","Flood affected children in Bangladesh, other countries highest in 30 years","November 8, 2022 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 8 -- The numbers of children affected by flooding in Bangladesh, Chad, Gambia, and Pakistan are the highest in over 30 years, according to a latest UNICEF report. As COP27 A large majority of the 27.7 million children affected by flooding in 2022 are among the most vulnerable and are at high risk of a multitude of threats, including death by drowning, disease outbreaks, a lack of safe drinking water, malnutrition, disruption in learning, and violence. ""We are seeing unprecedented levels of flooding all around the world this year, and with it, an explosion in threats to children,"" said Paloma Escudero, head of the UNICEF delegation for COP27 . ""The climate crisis is here. In many places, the flooding is the worst it has been in a generation, or several. Our children are already suffering at a scale their parents never did."" The aftermath of floods is often more deadly for children than the extreme weather events that caused the flooding. In 2022, floods will have contributed to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria, cholera, and diarrhoea. In Pakistan, more than one in nine children under the age of five were admitted to health facilities in flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan. In Chad, 465,030 hectares of farmland were destroyed, worsening the already dire food insecurity situation. In Malawi, torrential rains and flooding caused by tropical storm Ana in January 2022 caused extensive damage to water and sanitation systems, which created the perfect conditions for a cholera outbreak. The outbreak has claimed the lives of 203 people, of whom 28 are children. To date, 1,631 children have been infected with cholera. Together with other climate shocks and the conflict, floods have caused the projected number of children in South Sudan facing high levels of food insecurity to surpass the rates seen during the conflict in 2013 and 2016. Additionally, the United Nations recently warned that some communities are likely to face starvation if humanitarian assistance is not sustained and climate adaptation measures are not scaled-up. In addition to threatening the lives of millions of children, the flood waters have disrupted essential services and displaced countless families: The recent floods in Pakistan damaged or destroyed nearly 27,000 school buildings, forcing 2.0 million children to miss school. In South Sudan, 95 UNICEF supported nutrition sites have been affected by floods, hampering the delivery of life-saving and preventative malnutrition services for 92,000 children. An estimated 840,000 children were displaced by floods in Nigeria in recent months. Heavy rains and flooding in Yemen triggered floods causing extensive damage to shelters in displacement sites. Up to 73,854 households were affected, and 24,000 households were displaced. "" COP27 provides an opportunity to chart a credible roadmap with clear milestones for finance for climate adaptation and solutions for loss and damage,"" said Paloma Escudero. ""Young people from the most affected places on Earth are drowning in climate inaction. Enough is enough. Lives are on the line - children need action now."" As well as pressing governments and big business to rapidly reduce emissions, UNICEF urges leaders to take immediate action to protect children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on. Adaptation measures, like creating water, health and education systems that stand up to flooding and drought, will save lives. Last year, developed countries agreed to double support for adaptation to $40 billion a year by 2025. At COP27 , they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this will be delivered, as a step to delivering at least $300 billion per year for adaptation by 2030. Euro At least half of all climate finance should flow towards adaptation. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh109","Dude, where's my $100 billion?","November 11, 2022 Friday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Nov. 11 -- In 2009, the developed countries most responsible for global warming pledged to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing nations deal with its consequences. The commitment has still not been met, generating mistrust and reluctance among some developing nations to accelerate their emissions reductions. This has now emerged as the major issue during the ongoing 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change. The $100 billion was promised during COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark - one of the more important of these annual conferences held under the auspices of the UN. It was also the first to be held after the current Awami League-led government under Sheikh Hasina came to power earlier that year. In a lecture at Sweden's Lund University following her participation at the conference, the prime minister expressed satisfaction over a 'reasonable conclusion' of the UN Climate Change Conference, saying that there are certain areas that need to be finalised in the future. ""An agreement has been reached taking in most of our concerns. There are certain areas that would be finalised in the coming days to safeguard the earth's existence threatened by global warming,"" she said to the teachers and students of the university. Not surprisingly, she is one of the few world leaders who participated in COP15 still in office. Anyone else is not in a very prominent role, whereas Bangladesh has over the years slowly grown into one of the leaders of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although not attending this year's event, her government's role therefore at the conference is considered very important, as a standoff emerges between the poorer, vulnerable countries and the industrialised world. COP27 already underway, Sheikh Hasina said that the rich countries responsible for global warming are not keeping their promise to help developing nations deal with its consequences through financial assistance. ""The rich countries are not keeping their promises,"" she told the five-member delegation led by EU Commissioner for Home Affairs YIva Johansson during the meeting. Johansson wanted to know the steps taken by Bangladesh to address the impacts of climate change. The prime minister narrated how the government had already with its own resources taken steps for climate change adaptation and mitigation. She mentioned that many trees are being planted across the country as part of government's efforts at mitigating the effects of climate change. ""Bangladesh is able to manage any kind of disaster."" COP27 is taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 6-18 November 2022 where Bangladesh is playing a crucial role as one of the top actors on behalf of the vulnerable countries that are desperate to get funds to tackle the impacts of climate change. Meanwhile in Sharm El Sheikh, the Bangladesh delegation at this year's conference is being led by Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Shahab Uddin, who has said that Bangladesh will urge the developed countries for the $100 billion that they had promised to provide to the countries affected by climate change. In an interview with our sister newsagency UNB at the venue, the minister also said that Bangladesh expects the world leaders to implement Glasgow-Sharm El-Sheikh Work Program on The Global Goal on Adaptation at this year's climate conference. ""To implement the National Adaptation Plan prepared by the Bangladesh government, we need $230 billion till 2030. We hope that international organisations like the United Nations will help us execute the plan effectively,"" Shahab said. He said that allocation of funds by the rich countries, which are the top emitters of harmful carbon dioxide, would top Bangladesh's demand at COP27 . ""According to the Standing Committee on Finance, the developing nations need $8.8 to $9.9 trillion till 2030 to deal with the climate change-induced losses. Besides, the rich countries need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas by 45 percent within 2030 to keep the rise of temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh will strongly urge the developed countries to take these facts into cognizance,"" Shahab said. Asked about what happened to the Paris Agreement, the minister added that the decisions laid out in the agreement haven't been implemented yet. ""Developed countries are yet to provide their promised money to the Green Climate Fund. A decision was taken to equally distribute the money of the fund among the climate vulnerable countries, which is yet to happen. Besides, developing countries haven't recovered from the losses caused by climate change yet. These issues will be discussed at COP27 ,"" Shahab added. Shahab also said that although Bangladesh is a victim of impacts of climate change, the country doesn't contribute to the rise in temperature. ""Bangladesh's per capita per area greenhouse gas emission was at 0.2 tons a decade ago. This amount has increased to 0.6 tons in recent years due to urbanisation and industrialisation. On the contrary, developed countries emit 10 to 15 tons per capita of greenhouse gas, while the amount is 4 to 5 tons in rapidly developing countries. Although Bangladesh doesn't contribute to climate change, unfortunately we're one of the worst victims of this calamity,"" Shahab said. Shahab added that Bangladesh has been witnessing a surge in the signs of climate change for the last couple of years. ""Rivers created from the glacial lakes (lakes formed through the melting of ice) are falling into the Bay of Bengal crisscrossing Bangladesh. This water system is having adverse impacts due to climate change. Sea level is rising and salinity is increasing, while irregular and excessive rain is happening. In a nutshell, all the signs of climate change are now visible in our country,"" Shahab added. Asked about Bangladesh's preparations to face climate change, Shahab said that the government has beefed up its activities to reduce the risks posed by the global crisis. ""To tackle climate change, the government has taken up a total of 789 projects at a cost of Tk 3,362.32 crore. The entire amount has already been allocated for the execution of the projects. Besides, the drafts of National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan 2022-2041 have also been finalised,"" Shahab said. The vital United Nations conference, billed as one of the last chances to stave off climate breakdown, is taking place amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch. Negotiators are spending frantic days discussing whether to formally consider the issue of loss and damage (see later story), or reparations, to vulnerable nations suffering from climate change, and the issues, which weighed on the talks for years. Show me the money For Bangladesh, climate finance is one of the major topics to be broached at COP27 . The Bangladesh delegation has said it will try to convince the developed countries to deliver on the $100 billion finance per annum that they had promised to provide to the countries hit by climate change earlier. ""After the Paris Climate Accord was signed in 2015, a rulebook or guideline was being formulated to implement the agreement all these years. The rulebook was approved at COP26 in Scotland's Glasgow last year,"" Bangladesh delegation member and Department of Environment Director Ziaul Haque told UNB. ""At Glasgow, the developed countries promised to do what it takes to cut carbon emissions by 45 percent in 2030 compared to 2010 to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. However, in the last one year, they were long on promises but woefully short on deliveries,"" Ziaul said. Low- and lower-middle-income nations need financial support to lower their susceptibility to climate shocks and vulnerabilities and adapt to the rapidly changing environment. At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising $100 billion every year by 2020 for the developing countries to help them undertake climate actions. The commitment was later extended to 2025 at COP21 in Paris. The Bangladesh delegation members said: ""Unfortunately, that target has not yet been reached and largely missed."" The developed countries provided and mobilised $83.3 billion in overall climate finance in 2020, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Also, combining both the demand for mitigation and adaptation, the financing amount of $100 billion committed at that time, remains insufficient, to say the least, the Bangladesh delegation members said. So, how developed countries will meet the $100 billion target and how climate finance will be arranged post-2025 is crucial for least developed and developing countries, they added. ""Against this backdrop, the COP27 presidency of Egypt envisions moving from negotiations and planning to implementation,"" Md Shamsuddoha, a climate expert observing the climate conference, said. South Asia United The charge on behalf of extracting the concessions from the developed world is in many ways being led by Pakistan this year. The country currently chairs the G-77 group, composed of 134 developing countries at the UN, and Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, is a vice chair of COP27 . Before the conference began, Islamabad succeeded in putting the issue of loss and damage onto the summit agenda. As currently envisioned, loss and damage financing would involve developed, or industrialised countries, providing support to developing countries on the front lines of the climate crisis. Following, or rather despite the pledge made in 2009, the industrialised countries have long resisted such a policy, fearing it will make them vulnerable to continuous demands for compensation, given their outsized production of greenhouse gas emissions. But Pakistan has a golden opportunity, according to South Asia expert Michael Kugelman, to make the case for wealthy countries to embrace loss and damage aid and for international donors to make new commitments for aid focused on adaptation and mitigation. That is because Pakistan's catastrophic floods this year-triggered by early and intense monsoon rains-offer a vivid example of why loss and damage is so compelling. The disaster, which submerged one-third of the country and affected 33 million people, provides a perfect data point. The flooding and its aftermath have so far cost the cash-strapped country around $40 billion, as well as a projected 2.2 percent decline in GDP. So Pakistan has not only full support from the G-77 but also from its neighbors. Support for loss and damage is a rare point of policy convergence in South Asia. Excluding India, the region contributes relatively little to global greenhouse gas emissions. But it is one of the world's most climate-vulnerable areas and suffers from high levels of poverty-meaning that its residents are some of the most affected by climate change. Shortly before COP27 , Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav released a statement calling for action on climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage. Bangladesh's environment minister, Md. Shahab Uddin, has promised to push for loss and damage funding, too. In his COP27 speech, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that developing countries ""need to be compensated for loss and damage."" Even Afghanistan's Taliban have echoed the language of loss and damage. With its greater global clout, India could play a key role in advocating for loss and damage financing. India made some ambitious carbon-emissions-reduction pledges at last year's climate summit, although it has also been blamed for scuppering a more binding overall agreement. It has also come up with mitigation strategies, including major investments in renewable energy that have made it one of the world's fastest-growing solar markets. India's efforts can drive home a powerful message: Developing countries may seek loss and damage help, but they are also willing and capable when it comes to fighting climate change. Having said that, the history of these conferences teaches us not to expect immediate policy success. It's a major victory for South Asia and its G-77 partners just to get loss and damage on the summit's agenda. But the negotiations over loss and damage will be long and acrimonious, and there's unlikely to be any agreement by the end of COP27 . HYPERLINK contentservices@htlive.com \"

They also condemned the current false solution of ""Net Zero target by 2050"" and urged to immediate stop of this discourse, according to a statement. The press conference titled ""LDC's & MVC Peoples' expectations and CoP 27 "" held at the meeting room of CoP 27 climate conference center, Sharm El Sheikh where representatives of different CSO leader Md Ziaul Hoque Mukta CSRL (Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihood), Md Shamsuddoha (Centre for Participatory Research & Development), Sanjay Vashist (Climate Action Network-South Asia-India), Mrs Rabeya Begum (Chair-CANSA-BD), Atle Solberg of PDD (Platform of Disaster Displacement-Switzerland), Md Mohan Kumar-Leaders, Bangladesh, participated and spoke. The keynote on civil society expectation is presented by Aminul Hoque (EquityBD) from Bangladesh. Presenting the keynote, Aminul Hoque said global leaders continue their promise and come with new idea, vague solution and also create obstacles to dilute MVCs priorities and demands. He concerned that CoP 27 negotiation may distracted by some developed country and their allies. He put some key demands in favour of civil society, those are (i) Developed countries must change their theory of ""Net Zero Target"", instead they will revise again the own country NDC before 2023 global stoctake to achieve ""Zero Carbon emission"" target by 2050 (ii) A political declaration to be made by big emitters on banning the coal-fired power plants now, and phase out of all other fossil-fuels by 2040, (iii) Developed countries have to fulfill the delivery gap of their committed USD 100 billion annually that by now culminated to USD 600 billion to be delivered by 2025 and (iv) MVCs should start their work for a separate international mechanism to manage climate displacements in existing failure of WIM (Warsaw International Mechanism) and TFD (Task Force on Displacement). Md Shamsuddoha said that COP 27 must set a mandatory timeline for submitting long-term mitigation strategies by all the parties. It is important to make them accountable towards a low emission pathway and a net-zero economy by 2050. He also demands an ambitious NDCs coherent to the 1.5-degrees Celsius target and an option to update and scale-up targets biennially to comply with the mitigation requirements. Sanjay Vashist demand to phase out of all fossil fuel activities as science advised, because the NDCs submitted by the 193 Parties including 24 updated or new NDCs submitted after Glasgow CoP, will increase of emissions by 10.6 percent by 2030 and tracked to 2.4 degree by the end century. He demands to all countries must follow the UNFCCC road map implementing renewable energy by 2050. Atle Solberg expressed his deep concern on displacement that's happening in MVCs due to climate change impacts and becoming unable to manage by adaptation. He expects WIM (Warsaw International Mechanism od Loss & Damage) become an effective mechanism and duly operational with separate mandate of action plan under the Convention of UNFCC and Paris Agreement. Ziaul Hoque Muka supports to start for a separate mechanism for displacement due to existing inaction of WIM and TFD. Mrs Rabeya Begum said the though the CoP 27 has a good start with adopting Loss & Damage Financing [LFD] agenda, but we are always worried about the obscure role of US and their allies taking firm stand against to the MVCs priority agendas. We hope that they will be positive and support for a truly ambitious decision-making process for frontline climate vulnerable communities viewing justice and equity.

A few weeks after several local media outlets reported of the K-pop quartet's possible new release this year, the bandmates confirmed of their comeback and a possible concert tour through a Rolling Stone interview published on May 26. Speaking about her health recovery following the band's previous world tour that ended in 2020, Jennie, the group's rapper, said she was thinking every day about how to prepare herself ""for the next busy two years"" as ""we're preparing for our comeback and planning our tour"" these days. If Blackpink makes a comeback as anticipated within this year, it will mark the band's return as a complete group in almost two years since its debut full-length album, ""The Album,"" in October 2020. Rumors of the quartet's return with new music have been floating around since early this year as local analysts continued to paint a rosy outlook for the band's label, YG Entertainment, this year, with Blackpink among many of the company's headlining artists to make their prolonged comeback. The rumors began taking shape in May after reports from local brokerage firms predicted YG would see a rebound in performance in the second half of the year from the lower-than-expected turnout of the first quarter. While YG Entertainment refused to confirm or comment about the reports, anticipation for Blackpink's comeback has been climbing fast with the four bandmates appearing in the public spotlight together more often in the recent weeks. The girls made local media headlines on May 23 after Rolling Stone published the exclusive interview with the K-pop group, who graced the June cover of the magazine. Reports noted Blackpink was the first female band from Asia to make a solo cover on the American music magazine. Through the extensive interview  released in five parts with each of the four members, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rose  the members shared never-before-heard personal stories about topics ranging from their childhood to trainee period, health concerns, family and future plans. On Thursday last week, the act made a surprise appearance at the British Embassy in Seoul where they were invited to a birthday party celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's 96th birthday and Platinum Jubilee, which marked Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne. The girls attended the event as ambassadors of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also referred to as COP26, which was held in November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland. Blackpink made a successful debut in 2016 under YG Entertainment with its first single, ""Square One,"" soaring to instant global stardom, taking the charts in and out the country by storm with every release. The quartet is currently the musician with the most subscribers on YouTube with over 74.4 million subscribers, taking the throne from Canadian musician Justin Bieber last September. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"

The promise was given in the 27th World Climate Conference ( COP-27 ) held in Egypt's Sharm Al-Sheikh recently. Md Shahab Uddin, Minister of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, disclosed it at a press conference in his secretariat office on Tuesday. The Bangladesh delegation played an effective and strong role on various issue-based discussions in the conference on behalf of least developed countries and countries that are very endangered and vulnerable due to climate change. The heads of state and government of more than 110 countries participated in the high level segment of the conference held on November 7 to 8, he added. ""Bangladesh highlighted four demands in the country statement. The demand includes the establishment of a financing system to avoid, reduce and deal with loss and damage due to the climate change,"" Shahab Uddin said.

Besides, a transitional committee has been constituted to implement the fund and to fix its details at COP-28, he added. There was no decision like the loss and damage in the past conferences, the minister said, adding that what they received on loss and damage this time is a good sign for Bangladesh. The developed countries will provide global aid for the loss and damage of the affected countries along with Bangladesh, he added.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh115","Singapore to join partnership on implementation of carbon markets","November 17, 2022 Thursday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 17 Singapore(The Straits Times/ANN)- SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  To advance the implementation of carbon markets around the world, Singapore will join a partnership that will coordinate international capacity-building efforts to foster the trade of carbon credits. Carbon markets, covered under Article 6 in the Paris Agreement, will enable countries and firms to trade carbon credits that could help them to decarbonise and cut emissions in a cost-effective way. The Article 6 Implementation Partnership was launched by Japan's Environment Ministry at its pavilion on the sidelines of the COP27 climate conference. Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said: ""This will enable high-integrity carbon markets to be set up and provide new pathways to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement."" The new programme, which 63 countries are currently part of, will also serve as an information platform for Article 6 to be implemented, and provide the support needed to pilot initiatives in the realm of carbon markets. Ms Fu added that the progress made on carbon markets, along with increasing support for investments in low-carbon technologies worldwide, has given Singapore the confidence to raise its national climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Mr Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said Article 6 is essential in accelerating emission reductions. He added that the UNFCCC will support countries by building capacity, and sharing knowledge and technical assistance, particularly for developing countries so they can fully benefit from carbon markets. Two aspects of Article 6 are being discussed at COP27 this year, the first of which involves the bilateral trade of carbon credits between countries, or with private developers in another country. The second aspect entails establishing a centralised marketplace of carbon credits that will be overseen by the UN. While countries agreed on the broad rules during the COP26 conference in Glasgow in 2021, negotiators were left to fine-tune the details at COP27 this year. Ms Fu will be co-facilitating the ministerial consultations on Article 6 for the second time with her Norwegian counterpart, Minister of Climate and the Environment Espen Barth Eide. Both countries will have to listen to the views of different parties on crunch issues under Article 6 and work collectively towards resolving them. In 2021, the ministerial consultations on Article 6 co-facilitated by Ms Fu and Mr Barth Eide saw the establishment of the international carbon markets after six years of protracted negotiations. Said Ms Fu: ""To fully harness the potential of carbon markets, we need to lower the barriers of entry for countries to participate in carbon markets. ""One such barrier is the uneven levels of knowledge among countries. Hence, we need to build platforms that enable countries to exchange their experiences and knowledge in carbon markets."" To that end, Singapore has been working on a number of capacity-building initiatives to enhance knowledge among countries on Article 6 in order to develop high-quality carbon credits. Ms Fu added that Singapore, along with the World Bank and the International Emissions Trading Association, will be launching the Climate Action Data Trust in the coming weeks. The trust is an independent global market infrastructure that aims to reduce the risk of double-counting and foster transparency and confidence in carbon markets. Speaking at a fireside chat at the Singapore Pavilion on Tuesday, Ms Fu said there are a number of issues that would still have to be ironed out during the Article 6 negotiations. One sticking point between negotiators involves the authorisation of carbon credits, she said. Say, for example, one country authorises the sale of carbon credits to another country from its forest conservation project. Negotiators have yet to decide if the host country can later withdraw its authorisation. This may happen if the host country determines at some point that it requires these carbon credits to meet its own emissions targets.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh116","OPINION: Fighting the calamitous climate crisis: More urgent now than ever","November 8, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 8 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- As the world gathers at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt for the United Nations climate conference ( COP27 ), we are facing a dual challenge. On the one hand, the climate crisis is hitting with ever-greater force. This summer, floods swept a third of Pakistan, killing thousands. In Ethiopia, the worst droughts in decades pushed millions into hunger and starvation. In the Sahel, water scarcity is exacerbating conflicts over resources and land, forcing people to migrate. All of this shows the climate crisis is the biggest security challenge humanity faces in the 21st century  and taking action against it is more urgent than ever. On the other hand, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has been eroding the international trust we need for successful global climate action. President Vladimir Putin's war is not only inflicting unspeakable suffering on Ukraine, but is also trampling the UN Charter underfoot. It has shaken global energy markets and fueled a hunger crisis, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. Putin's aggression has brought geopolitical polarization to heights not seen since the Cold War. As the German delegation heads to COP27 , we are keenly aware of this tough environment. We know this will be a particularly difficult climate conference. Still, as Germany and with our partners in the European Union, we will do all we can to advance climate action. Now is the time for ambitious emissions cutting by all countries to stay on the 1.5-degree path. Now is the moment to show solidarity with the children, women and men hit hardest by storms and droughts. As a major economy and emitter, Germany has particular responsibilities. When entering office last year, our government set out ambitious energy transition plans. Today, in response to Russia's weaponization of energy, we are taking painful steps that seemingly contradict those plans. Many people from Africa, the Middle East and Asia are asking us: ""Now that Russia's war rages in Europe, has Germany cancelled its energy transition and its promises on solidarity?"" Our answer is clear  and it is also our message for COP27 : Germany is not deviating one inch from its climate goals. On the contrary, we are doubling down on them. Yes, we are taking tough decisions to get Germany and Europe through this and next winter. But the coal-fired power plants we have reactivated will run only until March 2024. New permanent pipelines we are building to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) are required by law to be hydrogen-ready. And in the European Union, we have committed to cutting gas consumption by 15 percent this winter  not least to push global LNG prices down. Most importantly, our government has boosted Germany's energy transition. In July, the Bundestag passed the most ambitious legislation ever to expand renewables and energy efficiency. In the first half of 2022, the share of renewables in our electricity mix rose to almost 50 percent  and with the new legislation, it will climb to 80 percent by 2030. The European Union, after the Green Deal and the Fit-for-55 agenda, presented one of the strongest climate packages in its history this June  with stricter rules for renewables, energy efficiency and CO2 pricing. Last week, the EU decided to phase out the sale of new combustion engine vehicles by 2035. These steps will make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. All this is making it clear that Russia's war is not leading us back to a fossil fuels past. Instead, we are moving towards a greener future faster than before. Every solar panel and every wind turbine means more security: for our country and Europe, since they make us less dependent on fossil energy imports. And for the world, as every tenth of a degree less in global warming means fewer climate impacts globally. At the same time, Germany is stepping up global climate solidarity. By increasing our contribution to international climate financing to six billion euro, we are doing our part to ensure that industrialized countries finally live up to their US$100 billion-pledge. In the Group of Seven, we are committed to doubling adaptation financing by 2025. And we will work hard to achieve progress on loss and damage at COP27 . With the Global Shield, the G7 is reaching out to vulnerable countries to expand disaster risk financing and insurance. From the Pacific to South Asia to the Sahel, rising sea levels, scorching heat and terrible floods are a threat to people's safety and security. We hear you and we see you  and we stand by your side. Germany is doing this also through its new climate diplomacy. The technologies for the global energy transition are out there. Now we have to transfer them to countries in the south  and mobilize financing away from fossils to renewables. Germany, its partners and South Africa are setting up a Just Energy Transition Partnership. Together, we are investing billions in renewables  and in ensuring that communities dependent on coal mining get new opportunities to make a living. The G7 is working on more such partnerships with other countries: Senegal, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. Not only to help them to protect the climate  but to transform their entire economies. It is important to keep these opportunities of the green transition in mind as we meet in Sharm el-Sheikh. The dual challenge of ever-harsher climate impacts and geopolitical tensions will make negotiations hard  their outcome is unclear. But Germany stands ready to cooperate  for greater ambition and greater solidarity. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh117","India power binges on coal, outpaces Asia","November 19, 2022 Saturday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 19 -- India's coal-fired power output has increased much faster than any other country in the Asia Pacific since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, underscoring the challenges the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter faces in weaning its economy off of carbon. Coal fuels nearly three-quarters of the power output of India, which presented its decarbonisation strategy at the United Nation's COP27 climate summit this week - the last of the world's five largest economies to do so, reports bdnews24,com. But the increase in India's coal-fired power output has outstripped its regional peers, data from the government and analysts showed. India's power ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked about high coal use, the government has previously cited lower per capita emissions compared with richer nations and surging renewable energy output. India's coal-fired power output increased more than 10 percent year-on-year from March to October to 757.82 terawatt hours, an analysis of government data shows, as electricity demand increased off the back of a heatwave and pickup in economic activity. The government expects this output to grow at the fastest pace in at least a decade in the current fiscal year ending March 2023. An analysis of data from independent think tank Ember shows India's surge in coal-fired output for the March-to-August period was 14 times faster than the average in Asia Pacific. The heat wave and economic revival following the pandemic meant overall electricity demand grew twice as fast as rest of the region, Ember's data shows. The European Union was the only region where coal-fired power output grew at a rate faster than India, the Ember data says, as nations in the region scrambled to reduce their reliance on Russian supplies. India is also the only major country in Asia, besides Japan, where the contribution of coal-fired power in overall electricity production increased in the six months since March, the data shows. India wants countries to agree to phase down all fossil fuels at the COP27 summit, rather than a narrower deal to phase down coal as was agreed last year.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh118","Bangladesh urges developed nations to double provision of adaptation finance by 2025","November 18, 2022 Friday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Nov. 18 -- Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Shahab Uddin has urged developed countries to at least double their collective provision of adaptation finance by 2025, as agreed upon during COP26 in Glasgow, and to provide support for the implementation of National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The environment minister made the call while speaking at the two-day high-level segment of COP27 conference in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh on Tuesday. ""The countries that are most responsible for greenhouse gas emission should share responsibility for protecting the people vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We want to see the developed countries keep their commitments, providing 100 billion US dollars each year - major portion of which should come from public funds dedicated to climate change adaptation,"" he said. He also said, ""At COP27 , it's essential that we make progress in addressing the gap that exists between nationally determined contributions and emission reductions required by science to keep 1.5-degree Celsius target alive, including finalising the mitigation work programme as necessary to reduce global carbon emission by 45% by 2030."" ""Bangladesh is an innocent victim of climate change as it contributes less than 0.48% of global emissions,"" he added. Bangladesh has always been highly susceptible to climate change and climate-induced disasters due to its unique geographical setting, said the minister. ""Studies show that about 12-17% of the country, an area larger than many small island countries, will be submerged due to sea level rise by this century."" On October 31, 2022, Bangladesh submitted its National Adaptation Plan to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), he said, adding: ""In our NAP, we have identified 113 actions for 8 vulnerable sectors. USD 230 billion will be required to implement the actions over the next 27 years (2023-2050). We need dedicated, additional financial resources for effective implementation of adaptation actions identified in the National Adaptation Plan."" The country has established a national climate finance mechanism, ""Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund"" from its own resources and allocated USD 490 million that supports more than 850 projects for making the country climate resilient, he said. ""Apart from this, the climate-relevant allocation in our Annual Development Plan has increased by two and a half times over the last eight years - from USD 1.4 billion to more than USD 3.1 billion - for climate adaptation and resilience-building through construction of embankments, cyclone shelters, development of stress tolerant crop varieties and coastal afforestation and reforestation,"" the environment minister said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh119","Migration on the rise as climate shocks grow","November 17, 2022 Thursday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 17 -- Tina Stege's atoll home in the Marshall Islands is two metres (6.5 feet) above sea level and so narrow that ""you can see the ocean on both sides of the land almost anyplace you are,"" she said. That leaves little room for retreat from rising seas, as climate change heats oceans and fuels melting of the world's ice, according to Reuters. In coming years, keeping the Pacific nation's about 60,000 people above the waves would require investing tens of billions of dollars in physically elevating homes and infrastructure, Stege said - money unlikely to be found. ""In my country, there is no higher ground,"" noted Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, during an event at the COP27 UN climate talks in Egypt. ""If we're going to have higher ground, we need to build it."" ""We should not be so naive to think in the current circumstances people will not move,"" said Antonio Vitorino, director general of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Climate change is already having ""profound impacts on human mobility,"" he said at COP27 . In 2021, about 23.7 million people were uprooted within their own countries, usually temporarily, as a result of disasters, many related to weather extremes, according to the Internal Displacement Migration Centre. Most climate change-related migration still occurs within countries, rather than across international borders, migration experts say - although migrants from low-lying small island nations may not have that option. Furthermore, distinguishing conflict refugees from climate-driven migrants is also getting harder, as the two crises fuel each other, said Michael Kohler, acting head of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations. In Africa's Sahel region, for instance, water shortage and agricultural failures as a result of drought have displaced families and made it easier for extremist groups to recruit young people desperate for an income - which then in turn fuels conflict, experts said. ""The distinction between climate crises and humanitarian crises is becoming more and more artificial,"" Kohler said at COP27 . ""We have to think of both things together."" Andrew Harper, special advisor on climate action to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), said many areas of the world are also now being hit by such relentless spells of disasters that efforts to help people adapt to a shifting climate are failing. In parts of Mozambique, where about a million people are displaced, in part by lingering civil strife, families are hit by ""cyclone after cyclone ... and if they're not being hit by a cyclone they're being hit by droughts,"" Harper said. PREVENTING MIGRATION? To try to hold the line on climate-related migration, much greater efforts - and more money - are needed now to help vulnerable people adapt to changes and build resilience to shocks, said Rabab Fatima, a UN representative for small island developing states and least-developed nations. ""For all these vulnerable country groups there is an urgent need to increase adaptation funding,"" she said at COP27 . ""We need a global surge in adaptation investment to save millions of lives from climate carnage."" However, a promised $100 billion in annual funding by 2020 - promised by wealthier nations to help vulnerable countries grow cleanly and adapt to climate threats - remains only partly delivered, which has been a sore point at the UN talks. Vitorino, of the IOM, said that in addition to adaptation spending, investment in better early warning systems and in humanitarian aid innovations such as ""anticipatory action"" could help limit migration. Anticipatory action involves measures including delivering small amounts of cash to families days ahead of a forecast disaster, giving them resources to prepare. In 2020, for example, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) gave such transfers to 142,000 people in Bangladesh five days ahead of an expected flood. As a result, families were a third less likely to go hungry during the disaster, said Gernot Laganda, WFP's climate and disaster risk reduction chief. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calculates that for each dollar given of such aid, $7 in damages is saved. But even stepped up efforts to protect people will not prevent all climate-related migration, Vitorino said, noting that plans for ""safe, orderly"" movement were also needed. ""Right now, tens of thousands of people are losing their homes and moving. There is no humanitarian help, no existing system for that,"" said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh. ""It's the responsibility of the UNFCCC (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) to come up with a solution,"" he said, calling such movement a form of growing ""loss and damage"" from climate change. In Africa, Uganda now has an ""open-door policy"" on accepting refugees - something that remains uncommon - said Beatrice Atim Anywar, the country's environment minister, urging more countries to follow its lead. But climate-displaced migrants from within Uganda's own borders are also increasingly evident in the country's capital, said Rose Kobusinge, a Ugandan climate justice activist working on migration issues. Uganda's northeast Karamoja region, for instance, has been increasingly slammed by drought and food insecurity, she said, making survival harder for the arid region's herders. Now ""we have so many kids, young girls and women from Karamoja on the streets of Kampala,"" Kobusinge lamented. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh120","'More than 50 poor countries in danger of bankruptcy'","November 12, 2022 Saturday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- More than 50 of the poorest developing countries are in danger of defaulting on their debt and becoming effectively bankrupt unless the rich world offers urgent assistance, the head of the UN Development Programme has warned. Inflation, the energy crisis and rising interest rates are creating conditions where an increasing number of countries are in danger of default, with potentially disastrous impacts on their people, according to Achim Steiner, the UN's global development chief. ""There are currently 54 countries on our list [of those likely to default] and if we have more shocks - interest rates go up further, borrowing becomes more expensive, energy prices, food prices - it becomes almost inevitable that we will see a number of these economies unable to pay,"" he said. ""And that creates a catastrophic scenario - look at Sri Lanka [which has descended into civil strife] with all the social and economic and political implications this carries with it."" Speaking at the Cop27 UN climate summit, Steiner said any such default would create further problems for solving the climate crisis. ""It certainly will not help [climate] action,"" he said. Without measures to help them with debt, he warned, poor countries could not get to grips with the climate crisis. ""The issue of debt has now become such a big problem for so many developing economies that dealing with the debt crisis becomes a precondition for actually accelerating climate action,"" he said. ""We need to inject targeted liquidity into countries to be able to invest in energy transitions, and adaptation [to the impacts of extreme weather]."" The climate crisis is further compounding the problem, he warned, as countries are facing increasing effects from extreme weather. Poor countries are not receiving the funding they were promised from the rich world, yet are facing a growing danger of storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves. Steiner warned that some developing countries were in danger of giving up on the UN climate talks if developed country governments failed to fulfil a longstanding promise to poor nations of $100bn (&#163;86bn) a year in assistance, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. ""If Cop27 Countries could slow down their efforts, he warned. ""Part of accelerating our ability to deal with climate change is premised on having all countries do something. So the highest risk is that we slow down things again, some would say even further."" But developing countries were already taking their own actions to tackle the climate crisis, he added. ""The developing world already invests multiples of the $100bn to help accelerate the energy transition. The way it looks to a taxpayer in London, or Berlin or Paris, is why are we being asked to pay for everything that happens outside our country in the developing world? ""And that's simply not true. China, India, countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt - they're all investing their own resources in moving towards clean energy transitions. Never mind the extraordinary resources they have to mobilise when a climate-related extreme weather event hits."" One of the most contentious issues at the Cop27 talks is loss and damage, referring to the most devastating impacts of extreme weather, which countries cannot protect themselves against. Steiner said the issue was often misunderstood. ""It's building on something that in many of our countries is an established practice. When extraordinary floods take place and the taxpayer essentially steps in, with the government paying house owners the damage that has not been recoverable from insurance companies,"" he said. ""We have an established practice that the common purse steps in where a catastrophic event happens. But when a Caribbean island has a third of its GDP wiped out in 12 hours through a hurricane, there's nobody to turn to."" That was why a loss and damage fund was needed, he said. ""That's where the injustice of climate change becomes so egregious in the view of many developing countries. Not having been even remotely a principal causal factor [in the climate crisis], they are now paying an extraordinary price through the damage they suffer."" He predicted that there would be no final settlement at Cop27 of how a funding mechanism for loss and damage could work, but said countries meeting in Egypt, where the talks are now almost at the halfway mark, should be able to make substantial progress. On Thursday, the theme of discussions at the talks was science, and youth and future generations. Hundreds of youth activists attended to demonstrate their support for climate action, but the protests were muted as the Egyptian government has kept a tight rein on demonstrations outside the talks. Some civil society groups have reported concerns over intimidation and monitoring. No such restrictions have been placed on lobbying within the halls, however - a coalition of NGOs revealed on Thursday that more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were among those attending, a far higher number than in previous years. Also at the talks, new analysis showed that countries seeking alternative gas suppliers to Russia after its war on Ukraine, had ""over-reached"". European and other governments are now planning new gas infrastructure and supply contracts that would far exceed the amount of gas that countries previously imported from Russia, according to the data from Climate Action Tracker. If all of these contracts were fulfilled, and infrastructure built, temperatures would breach the crucial 1.5C limit, the analysis found. In rare good news, however, Norway's oil company has postponed development of the world's most northerly oilfield exploitation. The Wisting field would be a $10bn project, but has been put on ice for four years. Nancy Pelosi, the US House speaker, arrived at Sharm el-Sheikh to fanfare as the Democrats did better than expected in the midterm elections, and warned that some Republicans still regarded the climate crisis as a hoax. US president Joe Biden is expected to join the conference on Friday and make a major intervention. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh121","Repair, preventive steps cost rural households US$2.0 billion a year","November 2, 2022 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- Households in rural Bangladesh spend almost US$2.0 billion yearly on repairing climate-related damage and preventive measures- twice as much as the national government spends and 12 times higher than multilateral international financing for the country's rural population, says a new global report on Tuesday. There is an urgent need for financial support to reshape and rebuild livelihoods and infrastructure. The report ""Operational-ising Finance for Loss and Damage: from Principles to Modalities"" by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) highlighted that in the countries like Bangladesh, vulnerable communities bear the greatest costs of climate impacts. It shows that despite an increasing demand for financial support, finance for addressing loss and damage has largely been absent and falls far short of the scale of needs. It focuses on several current climate finance architecture gaps, including largely inaccessible and complicated funding modalities for vulnerable communities. Often the funds are loan-based and project-based, which increases the debt burdens for vulnerable countries and may fail to reach the most vulnerable communities in need. Ms Ines Bakhtaoui, the lead author of the paper and Research Associate at the SEI, mentioned, ""The challenge with loss and damage finance is not only to determine how much is needed but also how that money should be delivered. Inappropriate funding mechanisms might hurt the victims of climate change even more. Our report is one of the first to explore the issue."" The report makes key recommendations for prioritising negotiation of loss and damage finance at COP27 Including simplified and directly accessible funds for communities and marginalised groups. The report highlights the potential of unconditional cash transfers to the communities, as vulnerable communities know their needs best. Also, representatives of the most vulnerable and discriminated communities should be engaged in all the decision-making processes. Dr Saleemul Huq, one of the paper's authors and Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), stated, ""The issue of how to operationalise modalities for mobilising and disbursing finance for loss and damage is extremely relevant right now. This report starts the ball rolling."" The report emphasizes adopting a climate justice lens to operationalise the loss and damage finance facility. It stresses the need to focus on the historical responsibility of polluter nations and enacting the polluter pays principle. The climate finance modality should ensure gender equality, and human rights, while funding is available on a grant basis. The report showcases examples of some countries that have already taken steps to incorporate loss and damage into national plans. Including the recently developed Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) in Bangladesh, identifying and quantifying potential climate-induced loss and damage. Moreover, working with local actors has been prioritised in the report. However, it mentions the challenges in addressing local-level vulnerabilities due to the redistribution of power in disfavour of poor and vulnerable communities. The report uses Bangladesh's Local Disaster Risk Reduction Fund as an example since this was aimed to provide adaptation funds to local communities based on risks. However, strong political and economic elite capture was prevalent due to lack of local capacity and reliance on government for technical support. Hence, the report highlights the importance of creating a financial structure that prioritises power dynamics at local level, reinforcing marginalisation and exclusion of communities. Zoha Shawoo, lead author of the paper and Associate Scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, mentioned, ""Any decision on loss and damage finance at COP27 must center the needs and priorities of vulnerable communities most affected by loss and damage. This involves giving them sufficient decision-making power over how finance is used; be directly accessible, and give autonomy to affected communities to utilise it following their needs."" In recommendation, the report states that a loss and damage finance facility is time-consuming for implementation; however, it has the advantage of offering a blank slate for modalities tailored to principles grounded in climate justice. Highlighting that the COP27 decision could include a phased approach of establishing a facility in the medium term and mobilising finance through existing mechanisms in the immediate term.

Through these events, IFAD wants to ensure small-scale farmers and rural populations from developing countries receive the attention and funding they urgently need. Small-scale farmers are essential to global food security and stability, IFAD said on Friday. They produce one third of the world's food (as much as 80 percent in many developing countries) yet their livelihoods and capacity to feed the planet are threatened by ever-increasing extreme weather events, erratic and changing rain patterns and the deterioration of ecosystems. Solutions to help small-scale farmers adapt exist and provide multiple benefits, but significant investments are urgently required to implement change at a global scale. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh123","""Loss and damage has become the biggest risk to global prosperity in the present age""","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Climate change impacts generate loss and damage, globally creating crises for society, human health and development, says a new report released on Wednesday. Disclosing comprehensive new data on the impact of climate change, the report also highlighted the asymmetric consequences for society which deepen global inequalities with poorer and more vulnerable nations the hardest hit. The flagship report titled 'Climate Vulnerability Monitor, 3rd edition: A Planet on Fire', commissioned by the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the Vulnerable Twenty (V20) Group of Ministers of Finance of the CVF presented the stark proof. Ban Ki-moon, Chairman of the Board of Global Center on Adaptation and 8th UN secretary-general said with this third edition 'CVM' we see clearly just how much humanity finds itself at the crossroads. ""Sadly, we have become a 'Planet on Fire', as the report's title highlights. If we do not act now, by the end of the century, millions of lives would be lost every single year because of scorching heat,"" he said. Prof. Dr. Patrick V. Verkooijen, CEO of Global Center on Adaptation said this report reaffirms that the impact of climate change is asymmetric, particularly today, particularly with respect to health, jobs, food and development for poor and vulnerable communities in developing countries. ""The shocking finding of this global assessment is that some of the world's richest and most powerful economies will also see their economic growth compromised throughout the 21st century, not just lowering incomes but also increasing inflation and interest rates. It is now crystal clear that every economy, every government, and every community must take action to analyse, monitor and respond to these risks.' Prof. Dr. Saleemul Huq, Chair of the CVF Expert Advisory Group said the Climate Vulnerability Monitor provides them with the anatomy of the loss and damage the world now lives with because of decades of insufficient climate inaction by rich, powerful and responsible countries. The detailed impact data and evidence presented by the CVM3 provides sobering reading on just how bad the situation already is, and how much worse it will become with fast rising global health risks, extreme heat events, and economic shocks, to name a few, he said. ""Loss and damage has become the biggest risk to global prosperity in the present age. The international community must act and support those worst affected and least responsible with funding and solutions. COP27 must make good on this agenda,"" Huq added. The CVM3's full online data set with global coverage at national level portal will be released via a dedicated portal on 10 November 2022 at UNFCCC COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The third edition of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor (CVM3), a research program into the impact of climate change publicly released today, is the product of a multi-year research program involving a multi-organization science consortium led by the Global Center on Adaptation, Climate Analytics, the Lancet Countdown and finres, as well as 14 regional partner organizations. The Monitor consolidates the latest research from the scientific literature on the attribution of climate change in 32 distinct indicators of socio-economic and environmental change and impact phenomena. UN, ADB to support Bangladesh's fight against climate change The Monitor projects and compares how, for a wide range of countries, these impacts evolve throughout the 21st century under a climate and socio-economic scenario that limits warming to 1.5\'b0C, versus a below 2\'b0C scenario, and a high emissions scenario without climate action to reduce emissions or mobilize additional adaptation efforts. The CVM3 findings illustrate the significant extent to which limiting warming to 1.5\'baC could contain otherwise enormous losses and damage for the world this century. The CVM3 and its scenarios and modeling are informed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latest Sixth Assessment Report. The 32 individual climate impact indicators for the time periods of 2030, 2050 and 2090, are as follows: 19 indicators of the impact of climate change in biophysical terms including temperature changes, drought, precipitation and runoff/discharge, windspeed, soil moisture and crop yields. 10 indicators of the impact of climate change on human health, including through infectious disease and exposure to risks like heat, wildfires and food insecurity. 3 indicators of the economic impact of climate change on GDP per capita growth, inflation and interest rates. Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghana Minister for Finance and Economic Planning and V20 chairman said climate-fueled risks have driven up the cost of capital and debt to unsustainable levels, especially across climate vulnerable economies, worsening already horrific financial protection gaps. ""Such measures can lower the impact of climate change, make vulnerable country economies more resilient, safeguard sustainable development, and protect the lives and livelihoods of poor and vulnerable people.' Annual global heat deaths among vulnerable groups could reach 3.35 million by end of century if insufficient climate action is taken: 91% of the increase in heat deaths could be avoided if global warming is limited to 1.5\'baC As much as over 10% of economic growth lost every single year in the long-term for key world regions: Africa, Asia, Europe Fast-growing cumulative economic losses are already lowering incomes worldwide and raising inflation and interest rates across all regions in a negative impact that would more than double if warming exceeded 1.5\'baC and reached 2\'baC 20-year extreme drought events will increase 4-8 fold during the decade ahead (at 1.5\'b0C) and 8-12 times under a below 2.0\'b0C scenario Extreme wildfire risk to increase by 8.5% in the coming decade (at 1.5\'baC) and to triple by end-of-century under a no climate action scenario Decreases in staple crop yields could reach 30-40% by end of century, but could be reduced to 5-10% if global warming is limited to 1.5\'baC Henry Kokofu, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency and Special Envoy of the CVF Presidency of Ghana said the vulnerable nations have been working all year towards a decisive outcome from COP27 on loss and damage. ""With this landmark CVM3 report, we are reminded of the scale and breadth of the climate calamities being visited upon poorer and vulnerable nations that lack responsibility for the climate crisis. I hope all delegations to COP27 will study the findings of the CVM3 and that the rich, powerful and responsible nations will be convinced to extend necessary support for addressing the stark injustice of loss and damage.' \"

Under the global 2015 Paris deal, countries agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (degC) and aim to keep the rise below 1.5degC, which scientists say would avert some of its worst effects, reports Reuters. Across the G7, which consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, corporate emissions targets are overall on a 2.7degC warming trajectory, CDP and Oliver Wyman analysis showed. COP27 , we must get our 1.5degC goal off life support,"" he added. Collective emissions of US and Canadian firms are seen matching the pace of decarbonisation required to restrict global warming to 2.8degC and 3.1degC, respectively, with the study stating that it is ""largely the result of companies completely lacking targets, rather than targets that lack ambition"". The study revealed that firms in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands had the most ambitious targets to lower emissions in the G7, as they align with 2.2degC on average, while France is at 2.3degC and the United Kingdom at 2.6degC. ""The analysis highlights big differences in ambition and willingness across companies to take a lead with their targets, and the urgent need to spread best practices further and faster,"" Partner, Financial Services at Oliver Wyman James Davis said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh125","BD wants developed countries to deliver on $100b promise","November 11, 2022 Friday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 11 -- The vital United Nations climate talks, billed as one of the last chances to stave off climate breakdown, are taking place from November 6-18 in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch. Negotiators are spending frantic days discussing whether to formally consider the issue of loss and damage, or reparations, to vulnerable nations suffering from climate change, and the issues, which weighed on the talks for years, reports UNB. For Bangladesh, climate finance is one of the major topics to be broached at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). The Bangladesh delegation has said it will try to convince the developed countries to deliver on the $100 billion finance per annum that they had promised to provide to the countries hit by climate change earlier. ""After the Paris Climate Accord was signed in 2015, a rulebook or guideline was being formulated to implement the agreement all these years. The rulebook was approved at COP26 in Scotland's Glasgow last year,"" Bangladesh delegation member and Department of Environment Director Ziaul Haque told UNB. ""At Glasgow, the developed countries promised to do what it takes to cut carbon emissions by 45 percent in 2030 compared to 2010 to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. However, in the last one year, they were long on promises but woefully short on deliveries,"" Ziaul said. Low- and lower-middle-income nations need financial support to lower their susceptibility to climate shocks and vulnerabilities and adapt to the rapidly changing environment. At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising $100 billion every year by 2020 for the developing countries to help them undertake climate actions. The commitment was later extended to 2025 at COP21 in Paris. The Bangladesh delegation members said: ""Unfortunately, that target has not yet been reached and largely missed."" The developed countries provided and mobilised $83.3 billion in overall climate finance in 2020, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Also, combining both the demand for mitigation and adaptation, the financing amount of $100 billion committed at that time, remains insufficient, to say the least, the Bangladesh delegation members said. So, how developed countries will meet the $100 billion target and how climate finance will be arranged post-2025 is crucial for least developed and developing countries, they added. ""Against this backdrop, the COP27 presidency of Egypt envisions moving from negotiations and planning to implementation,"" Md Shamsuddoha, a climate expert observing the climate conference, said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh126","Climate-impacted countries like Bangladesh need financial, tech support: UN Resident Coordinator","United News of Bangladesh"," ","UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Gwyn Lewis on Tuesday (November 08, 2022) said loss and damages, and adaptation need to be on the table at COP27 and urgent steps need to be taken to provide financial and technological support to most impacted countries like Bangladesh. 'Climate action is obviously on top of the agenda,' she said, touching on some of the areas of UN's focus to support Bangladesh. Speaking at 'DCAB Talk', held at Jatiya Press Club in Dhaka, Lewis said climate change is also impacting Bangladesh's economy. DCAB President Rezaul Karim Lotus and General Secretary AKM Moinuddin also spoke at the event. The UNRC said COP27 comes at a time when South Asia is 'impacted in unprecedented ways' by climate change, whether it is the floods in Sylhet and Sunamganj, Bangladesh or in Pakistan and repeated cyclones in India and Bangladesh in recent years. 'Unfortunately, climate talks have been bogged down with politics and economic pressures, so we need to see more citizen action and listen to the voices of people living in Bangladesh, particularly young people and women who are often excluded,' she said. One of the recommendations following the recent visit of the Special Rapporteur on Climate Change and Human Rights to Bangladesh was to focus on inclusion and making sure the voices of the most marginalised were included in decision-making, said the UN official. 'UN plans to further work on supporting the government to implement the national adaptation plan and the other policy frameworks such as the Delta Plan and the Mujib Climate Prosperity action plan,' she said, adding that the UN with their NGO and Red Crescent partners are also supporting disaster risk management and humanitarian efforts led by the ministry. Lewis said there are also ongoing programmes to support migrants and displaced people who are forced to leave their homes due to the impact of climate change. By one estimate, up to 50% of those now living in Bangladesh's urban slums may be there because they were forced to flee their rural homes as a result of riverbank erosion or flooding, she said. The data shows that from 2000 to 2019, Bangladesh suffered economic losses worth over $3.72 billion due to extreme weather events linked to climate change, said the UN official. This leads to another area of work that the UN is supporting in Bangladesh - economic growth and LDC graduation, she said. 'The growth of Bangladesh's economy over the past 20 years has been extraordinary, as has been the reduction in poverty,' Lewis said. Before coronavirus hit the country, Bangladesh had been advancing fairly well to qualify for graduation. 'Although the pandemic has been disruptive, the economy remained on a positive track. However, the current food and fuel crisis generated by the war is also creating pressures and uncertainty, including for the markets for Bangladeshi goods overseas,' Lewis said. In this global climate, she said, although there are benefits to LDC graduation, there are also risks. The UN official said graduation will enhance the confidence of the country in dealing with the international financial bodies, improve Bangladesh's credit rating and attract higher foreign direct investment flow. However, she said, graduation will also affect certain preferential treatments in trade, subsidies to agriculture and access to some LDC-specific funds. 'The risks need to be mitigated and this is where I hope that the UN's technical support can be useful,' Lewis said, adding that further diversification and greater efforts are needed to attract foreign direct investment and meet the requirements for trade agreements when Bangladesh reaches middle income status. She said the UN is working to support the government in the development of a smooth transition strategy. Training of young people in IT and new technologies to make them better equipped for the future is one area where effort could be expanded. Another is the creation of new industries and continuing to make Digital Bangladesh a reality, said the UN official. 'I would also like to emphasize however, as important as LDC graduation is, middle income status is only a stepping stone,' Lewis said, adding that ultimately the objective is to achieve sustainable development goals and leave no one behind. The UN official said achieving the SDGs goes beyond economic growth and focuses on improving health, education, social protection and good governance. Bangladesh's social indicators, such as gender equity, women's empowerment, mortality rate, life expectancy, immunisation and access to water and sanitation have improved dramatically over the past 50 years, she said. Read What can COP27 do for climate vulnerable countries? Investments in social services, however, need to continue to grow with the growing population, and with the growing expectations of people who are living in a middle-income country, UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Gwyn Lewis said. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh127","Editorial; Climate coup","November 23, 2022 Wednesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 23 Karachi(Dawn/ASNN)- PAKISTAN'S representatives at the UN COP27 climate summit deserve commendation for leading a group of vulnerable countries in pulling off an unlikely diplomatic coup. The summit concluded on Sunday in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh with a hard-fought deal to establish a loss and damage fund for nations most vulnerable to climate change  an achievement that many had thought impossible till just days ago. After the development, Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman was credited internationally for leading the bloc known as the Group of 77 plus China, keeping it united, and thereby ensuring that a loss and damage fund, which had long eluded climate change campaigners, was finally agreed to before the conference disbanded till next year. Reports in foreign media and Ms Rehman's account of the breakthrough spoke of intense deliberations as negotiators worked round the clock to ensure that a deal was finalised before the COP27 participants headed home. Their commitment and dedication to ensuring climate justice must be applauded by all. It may also be recalled that Pakistan fought to have the loss and damage fund officially included on this year's agenda of the UN climate summit. It had been an important step, as powerful nations had long resisted the idea of a compensation fund, fearing it could open them to legal liabilities for causing devastating changes to the global environment because of unchecked industrialisation and consumerism. However, Pakistan's mission had been spurred by the devastation from the unprecedented monsoon and extreme heatwaves this year, and it is no mean feat that our representatives successfully leveraged those experiences to secure a package for climate justice on a global scale. The Global Shield initiative announced last week had been a breakthrough in climate finance, but its scope is limited to helping climate-vulnerable nations secure themselves against the risks arising from natural disasters through insurance and other financial instruments. On the other hand, the loss and damage fund answers the question of climate reparations on a scale that insurance policies cannot and will not cover. At the heart of the fund is the idea that countries that pay the price for climate change must be compensated by the nations that are responsible for it. It may be too early to celebrate, however, as the fund does not yet have anything in it, and the question of who must pay how much has been left for next year. Many also worry that powerful nations have managed to avoid another very important question  how to immediately mitigate global warming  amidst the buzz over the loss and damage fund. That is as much a critical concern for the survival of the human race and needs equally urgent attention. Having secured this particular victory, Pakistan must now direct its efforts to help ensure progress on the other goals on the climate change agenda. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh128","'Bangladesh's lead crucial for LDCs' position to develop framework for LDFF'","December 5, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 5 -- Civil society organisations (CSOs) recommended the government lead the LDC's position to develop the framework on Loss & Damage Financing Facility [LDFF] in the climate discourse leading up to CoP 28. Saving the interests of LDCs [Least Developed Countries] and MVCs [Most Vulnerable Countries] are crucial in LDFF where Bangladesh can play an effective role using the leadership experience of CVF [Climate Vulnerable Forum] and V-20 [Vulnerable 20 group] they opined. A press conference titled "" CoP 27 Outcome: Bangladesh's lead is crucial framing the Loss & Damage Financing Facility"" was held at the national press club on Monday, where representatives from CSOs participated in the CoP 27 global climate conference. The conference was attended by Md Ziaul Hoque Mukta, CSRL (Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihood), Md Shamsuddoha, CPRD (Centre for Participatory Research and Development), and Mrs. Rabeya Begum (CANSA-BD). The press conference was moderated by M. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of the COAST Foundation and the keynote was presented by Aminul Hoque from EquityBD. Aminul Hoque said that the declaration of the LDFF is a significant victory, but there is a limited scope for self-complacence for LDCs until an effective framework is developed, followed by pro-poor and justice based. He chastised developed countries and the CoP presidency for delivering a complicated and tricky text on LDFF and failing to mention the names of LDCs and SIDCs in the final declaration of those who have long contributed to and fought for losses and financing. He demanded: Shamsuddoha opines that declaration of Loss and Damage Financing is somehow very tricky and linked conditions on mitigation actions. The decision text emphasises keeping the global average temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius meaning that the countries need to increase their emission reduction targets in the future to get LDFF support. This is very controversial and political divergence may arise between developing countries and LDCs focusing on the issues of definition of vulnerabilities, set priority financing to LDCs, etc. to develop the LDFF. ""Developed countries can take the opportunities and delay the process with the inclusion of conditionalities. So our government should be cautious and steps accordingly."" Ziaul Hoque Mukta chastised CoP 27 for failing to produce meaningful results in meeting the 1.5-degree target.He said the current discourse on reducing global temperature is 40 years behind the science suggested. ""Achieving a 1.5-degree goal is very important and big polluters did nothing. In the case of the so-called ""Phase Down"" concept, many European countries have resumed carbon emissions and coal-fired power plants.This trend is unaccepted and must be stopped creating pressure from UNFCCC."" Mrs. Rabeya Begum put emphasis on more initiatives on climate change issues at the national and international level in the context of obscure solutions to MVC's issues and collaborative efforts from CSOs and the government can strengthen our voice indeed. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury emphasised a new LDC, MVC, and Climate Vulnerable Forum negotiation stream in the next CoPs [Conference of the Parties] to strengthen the unified voice, particularly on LDFF issues.

""Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government has constructed the Padma Bridge for all. But, the BNP leaders including Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir have no shame. If they have shame, before riding on the bridge they should have told 'we are seeking an apology from the nation and the prime minister for spreading propaganda."" ""They are using the bridge secretly as they have no shame,"" he said while talking to journalists at the meeting room of his ministry at the secretariat after returning from the COP27 event held in Egypt, according to BSS. Presenting an expenditure of the Padma Bridge and Hardinge Bridge, Hasan said the standard of value of anything is determined based on the gold rate as the price rate of gold is static. As per the account, the cost of the Padma Bridge is one-fifth of the cost of the Hardinge Bridge, said Hasan, also Awami League joint general secretary. Replying to another query over BNP's movement against the government, the minister said they are telling for long 14 years that they will topple the government and they would not return home until bringing down it (government). But, the reality is that they go home after every rally as the countrymen are not with them, he added. He said, ""Their (BNP) movements benefited us and our activists are becoming stronger and preparing themselves to combat the evil forces. Awami League has a quality that if someone punches, the workers of the party are united and energised. And the Jubo League rally is the manifestation of that where millions of youths were gathered."" Replying to another query over an allegation of BNP's secretary general, the minister said BNP had made the country champions consecutively five times. BNP had collected tolls from every business through 'Hawa Bhaban' when they were in power, he added. He said Mirza Fakhrul Islam has told that a national government will be formed under the leadership of Tarique Rahman after toppling the government. But the people of Bangladesh never accepted it, said Hasan. COP27 He said there is a big secret deception as the Paris Agreement on global climate finance clearly states that 'In addition to present ODA (Overseas Development Assistance)' which means that the ODA given by the developed nations will not be considered to be included in this fund. Additional money will be paid to the Climate Fund, he added. ""We do not agree with this,"" said Hasan. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

The activists came up with the demand on the first day of the two-day long preCOP conference titled 'Bangladesh Youth COP' aimed at declaring the stance of the youth from the Global South on the issue of climate change. The youth leaders said that the global leaders should take responsibility to check carbon emissions without any further delay as the negative impact of climate change had already affected millions of people every year. Climate activist Ayshka Najib said that due to climate change frequency of floods in many countries made many people homeless every year. She demanded financial assistance from developed countries, which are responsible for climate change, for funding the sector. Over a hundred young climate advocates from 20 countries participated in the event organized ahead of COP 27 , said the organizers. The COP 27 conference will be held in November at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. The youths hoped their views and demands would be placed by their representatives at the conference. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh131","It's time to follow through on the Glasgow Climate Pact","November 11, 2022 Friday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Nov. 11 -- At no other point in human history has a cause proved more urgent than tackling climate change; never has there been more at stake for us on this planet we call home, and for every species we share it with. However, rousing speeches and inspiring language are but hollow sentiments now - just empty rhetoric and fine-spun nothings in the absence of the robust action that scientists have long been urging. For the people of Sylhet in Bangladesh, facing the worst floods in a century, words aren't close to enough. Words didn't prevent flash floods from carrying away their homes, destroying their livelihoods, killing their loved ones. And tweets of support or small aid packages aren't nearly enough for the 33 million affected by the floods in Pakistan last month. Instead, what I am calling for today is action - action to fulfill the promises made last year at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, to assist nations like mine in facing the harshest realities of a warming planet. And as world leaders prepare to gather once again, this time Sharm El-Sheikh, I call upon my esteemed colleagues to find the means to honor the commitments they made, and to at least double the provisions for adaptation as well as finance by 2025. This pledged financial support from developed countries should be considered a moral obligation - and it is vital to climate vulnerable countries such as mine. This can't be left to some future date either. If it is to protect against the wide-ranging consequences of climate change that we have been battling, and continue to battle at this very moment, assistance needs to be immediate. Bangladesh currently contributes 0.56 percent to global carbon emissions, and yet, the proportion of damage inflicted upon our nation from climate change is overwhelming. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, droughts, heat and flooding will all continue to take a serious toll on our economy. They will wreak havoc on our infrastructure and agricultural industry as we face considerable challenges in averting, minimizing and addressing the loss and damage associated with climate change impact, including extreme and slow onset events. Studies show that our GDP is expected to be significantly reduced due to human-caused warming, and average income is projected to be 90 percent lower in 2100 than it would have otherwise been. The Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Assessment Report projects that Bangladesh will experience a net increase in poverty of approximately 15 percent by 2030 due to climate change. It would be easy to become despondent when faced with such bleak forecasts, when the call for urgent action is going unheard by many and progress is so slow. It would be much easier to succumb to the paralysis of anxiety - but we must resist. And in Bangladesh, we're doing just that. In the face of such grave threats, we have so far been able to achieve relatively resilient and consistent growth. We have also unveiled the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan in order to deal with matters of climate change, from decarbonizing our energy network to green investment initiatives - both now and in the future - all in a bid to shift our trajectory from vulnerability to resilience and, in turn, to prosperity. We were the first among developing countries to adopt a comprehensive Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan back in 2009. So far, we have allocated $480 million to implement various adaptation and mitigation programs. Meanwhile, we've adopted the ""Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100,"" which aims to shape a safe, climate-resilient and prosperous delta. And every year, my party plants millions of saplings to increase our country's tree coverage as well. As the former chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the V20, Bangladesh continues to focus on promoting the interests of climate vulnerable countries. It isn't enough to just survive; we intend to succeed, to be a global leader, to show our neighbors and the world that there's still a path to a hopeful future - but we cannot do this alone. The words of the international community must turn to deeds, once and for all. The $40 billion increase in adaptation funding agreed upon in Glasgow must be regarded as an initial investment in our common future. Otherwise, the cost of inaction will be immense: Last year's IPCC Working Group II report already warned that global GDP loss could hit 10 to 23 percent by 2100 - far higher than previously predicted. Each passing year more powerfully highlights the deeply interconnected nature of our planet in the 21st century, with supply lines and energy reliance casting a long shadow over us all. This year has already brought more record-breaking heat events across the world, with temperatures in the U.K. surpassing 40 degrees Celsius for the first time in recorded history. Climate change, loss and damage are already with us, wherever we care to look. It's playing out across the world in a myriad of ways. and the issues facing climate-vulnerable nations like mine will be at the door of other nations soon enough. If we are to have any hope of surmounting this great challenge, we must recognize that the floods in Bangladesh, the fires in California, the droughts in Europe - all triggered by just a 1.2-degree rise in temperature - are interconnected and must be confronted together. The promises made last year must be fulfilled; words must finally lead to action. Sheikh Hasina is the prime minister of Bangladesh.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh132","Africa lays out goals ahead of UN climate summit","United News of Bangladesh"," ","African officials outlined their priorities for the upcoming U.N. climate summit, including a push to make heavily polluting rich nations compensate poor countries for the environmental damage done to them. The continent will also focus on how countries can adapt to global warming and how the continent can best halt further climate-related disasters. Africa has seen debilitating droughts in the east and Horn of Africa and deadly cyclones in the south. Other key areas for discussion include moving from high-carbon energy sources like oil and gas to renewables, and 'carbon credit' schemes, where foreign governments and companies pay for tree planting in exchange for producing greenhouse gases. The U.N. climate conference, known as COP27 , will be held in Egypt in November. How much funding Africa gets is the biggest factor for how prepared it will be for a hotter future, said Harsen Nyambe, the director of sustainable environment at the African Union Commission. 'We recall the $100 billion that was promised has never been fulfilled and current assessments show that even that amount is not enough,' Nyambe said, referring to a 12-year-old pledge by rich nations to provide climate funding for poorer nations. 'Africa must be given adequate time to transition and transform its energy infrastructure. We cannot transform abruptly. We need resources, capacity, technology transfer and finance to power our development,' he added. He added the continent only received about 7.5% of its promised $70 billion in climate funding between 2014 and 2018. Africa needs around $3 trillion to fulfill its self-determined emissions targets, known as nationally determined contributions, that each country is required to submit as part of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate, according to U.N. and Africa Development Bank estimates. More meetings between the continent's climate leaders are set to follow ahead of COP27 . \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh133","Japan to provide rainfall warning tech to developing countries","November 7, 2022 Monday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 7 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)- The government will unveil a plan to support the rollout of an early warning system to monitor heavy rainfall in developing countries reeling from the effects of global warming at the U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), which will kick off Sunday in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The government hopes to lead the world's efforts to combat climate change by providing disaster prevention technologies and know-how cultivated in disaster-prone Japan. Torrential rains, heat waves and droughts have been occurring frequently around the world in recent years. According to a report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the frequency of extreme climate events will likely increase as temperatures rise. The human and economic impact of climate change tends to be particularly extensive in developing countries where social infrastructure is fragile. Developing countries have been strongly calling for assistance to deal with climate-related damage. How developed countries will respond to their calls will be a focus of this year's conference. In March, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres stressed the need for widespread use of an early warning system, saying one-third of the world's population, mainly in developing countries, is not covered by such a system. The government is considering creating a disaster warning system by utilizing small radars operated by Weathernews Inc., a Chiba-based weather data company. The radar can predict localized torrential rains based on the development of clouds. The government will also work with Japanese insurance companies to provide weather derivatives to help developing countries build economies that are more resilient to disasters. Weather derivatives are a kind of damage insurance that provides partial compensation in the event of a decline in agricultural or commercial production due to bad weather. ""We want to contribute to the support being offered to developing countries in cooperation with Japanese companies that have excellent technology and know-how. This will also lead to the overseas expansion of these companies,"" Environment Minister Akihiro Nishimura told The Yomiuri Shimbun ahead of COP27 , which runs through Nov. 18. At the conference, 198 countries and regions participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will discuss climate change countermeasures. Whether the international community can demonstrate a concerted effort toward decarbonization will be put to the test, amid deepening divisions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At COP26 in Glasgow last year, an agreement was reached to ""pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels"" in this century. However, the combined climate pledges of 193 parties under the Paris Agreement could still put the world on track for about 2.5 C of warming by the end of the century, according to a U.N. climate change report released last month. At this year's COP, the aim is to compile a plan to strengthen emission reductions during the 2020s. However, reaching an agreement will not be easy, as several countries have reverted to coal-fired thermal power generation, which produces high emissions, due to energy insecurity since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh134","Vulnerable Nations Need Global Support to Deal with Climate Change","Energy & Power"," ","Climate expert Professor Saleemul Huq says that the international community must act and support the worst affected and least responsible nations with 'funding and solutions' to deal with climate change impacts. Climate change unequally impacts vulnerable nations and indiscriminately creates global crises causing chaos, new poverty and violation of human rights. ' COP27 must make good on this agenda,' said Professor Saleemul, chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum expert advisory group, speaking at a report launching event recently. The flagship report entitled Climate Vulnerability Monitor, 3rd Edition: A Planet on Fire, commissioned by the CVF and the Vulnerable Twenty Group of ministers of finance of the CVF presented stark proof that climate change impacts generate loss and damage, globally creating crises for society, human health and development. Professor Saleemul said the Climate Vulnerability Monitor provides them with the anatomy of the loss and damage the world now lives with because of decades of insufficient climate inaction by rich, powerful and responsible countries. He said the detailed impact data and evidence presented by the CVM3 provide a sobering reading on just how bad the situation already is, and how much worse it will become with fast-rising global health risks, extreme heat events, and economic shocks, to name a few. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh135","UN climate talks near halftime with key issues unresolved","United News of Bangladesh"," ","As the U.N. climate talks in Egypt near the half-way point, negotiators are working hard to draft deals on a wide range of issues they'll put to ministers next week in the hope of getting a substantial result by the end. The two-week meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh started with strong appeals from world leaders for greater efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and help poor nations cope with global warming. Scientists say the amount of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere needs to be halved by 2030 to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord. The 2015 pact set a target of ideally limiting temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, but left it up to countries to decide how they want to do so. Climate Change: Int'l community must act with fund and solutions to help most vulnerable nations With impacts from climate change already felt across the globe, particularly by the world's poorest, there has also been a push by campaigners and developing nations for rich polluters to stump up more cash. This would be used to help developing countries shift to clean energy and adapt to global warming; increasingly there are also calls for compensation to pay for climate-related losses. Here is a look at the main issues on the table at the COP27 talks and how they might be reflected in a final agreement. KEEPING COOL The hosts of last year's talks in Glasgow said they managed to 'keep 1.5 alive,' including by getting countries to endorse the target in the outcome document. But U.N. chief Antonio Guterres has warned that the temperature goal is on life support £nd the machines are rattling.' And campaigners were disappointed that agenda this year doesn't explicitly cite the threshold after pushback from some major oil and gas exporting nations. The talks' chair, Egypt, can still convene discussions on putting it in the final agreement. CUTTING EMISSIONS Negotiators are trying to put together a mitigation work program that would capture the various measures countries have committed to reducing emissions, including for specific sectors such as energy and transport. Many of these pledges are not formally part of the U.N. process, meaning they cannot easily be scrutinized at the annual meeting. A proposed draft agreement circulated early Saturday had more than 200 square brackets, meaning large sections were still unresolved. Some countries want the plan to be valid only for one year, while others say a longer-term roadmap is needed. Expect fireworks in the days ahead. SHUNNING FOSSIL FUELS Last year's meeting almost collapsed over a demand to explicitly state in the final agreement that coal should be phased out. In the end, countries agreed on several loopholes, and there are concerns among climate campaigners that negotiators from nations which are heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs or as revenue might try to roll back previous commitments. MONEY MATTERS Rich countries have fallen short on a pledge to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 in climate finance for poor nations. This has opened up a rift of distrust that negotiators are hoping to close with fresh pledges. But needs are growing and a new, higher target needs to be set from 2025 onward. COMPENSATION The subject of climate compensation was once considered taboo, due to concerns from rich countries that they might be on the hook for vast sums. But intense pressure from developing countries forced the issue of 'loss and damage' onto the formal agenda at the talks for the first time this year. Whether there will be a deal to promote further technical work or the creation of an actual fund remains to be seen. This could become a key flashpoint in the talks. MORE DONORS One way to raise additional cash and resolve the thorny issue of polluter payment would be for those countries that have seen an economic boom in the past three decades to step up. The focus is chiefly on China, the world's biggest emitter, but others could be asked to open their purses too. Broadening the donor base isn't formally on the agenda but developed countries want reassurances about that in the final texts. CASH CONSTRAINTS Countries such as Britain and Germany want all financial flows to align with the long-term goals of the Paris accord. Other nations object to such a rule, fearing they may have money withheld if they don't meet the strict targets. But there is chatter that the issue may get broader support next week if it helps unlock other areas of the negotiations. COP27 SIDE DEALS Last year's meeting saw a raft of agreements signed which weren't formally part of the talks. Some have also been unveiled in Egypt, though hopes for a series of announcements on so-called Just Transition Partnerships - where developed countries help poorer nations wean themselves off fossil fuels - aren't likely to bear fruit until after COP27 . Jennifer Morgan, a former head of Greenpeace who recently became Germany's climate envoy, called the talks this year 'challenging.' 'But I can promise you we will be working until the very last second to ensure that we can reach an ambitious and equitable outcome,' she said. 'We are reaching for the stars while keeping our feet on the ground.' \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh136","The science which keeps our oceans healthy","November 15, 2022 Tuesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 15 -- Oceanography is a multi-disciplinary field such as biology, chemistry, geology, and physics that interrelate to expand knowledge of the world oceans and the processes within it. Many scientists throughout the world are busy at work with a diversity of important issues of oceans such as climate change, development of new drug, invention of new technology to explore the sea, to address marine pollutions, to investigate declining fisheries, eroding coastlines, etc. To address these issues, we need more and more skilled and educated manpower on ocean related subjects which will allow us to explore and exploit our vast sea area, 118,831 sq. km, in the Bay of Bengal. Like other branches of science, oceanography has also specifications and specializations within it such as Biological Oceanography deals with the organisms which live in the ocean and study their behavioral patterns, their food habits and their breeding. Oceans are very rich in minerals and nutrients and Chemical Oceanographers identify those beneficial ocean resources. Recent reports also show that ocean resources can be used as medicines for many critical ailments. One of the very important fields of oceanography is the Geological Oceanography and with this we study the structure of the ocean floor, exploring the ocean bed, and taking cognizance of what changes in the physical structure formed the valleys, the mountains and the canyons. Geological oceanographers look at millions of years of history of physical movements like volcanic movements that constructed the sea-floor. Maritime Education: To develop skilled man power in the field of maritime higher studies and research, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Maritime University (BSMRMU), Bangladesh, the first Maritime University of the country, was established in 2013 with a motto, ""We Strive for Maritime Excellence"". At present, the university conducts its academic programmes from its temporary campus at Pallabi, Mirpur -12 in Dhaka. The government of Bangladesh has allocated 106.68 acres of land at Hamidchar in the district of Chattagram for the permanent campus of the university. Due to the shortage of space in the temporary campus, currently the university runs only 5 undergraduate and 9 post-graduate programmes. Marine Pollution: Our oceans are being degraded by human activities that harm marine life, undermine coastal communities and negatively affect human health. The types of marine pollution can be grouped as ocean acidification, toxins, nutrient pollution, pollution from marine debris, plastic including micro plastic pollution, and underwater noise. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land. One of the biggest sources is called non-point source pollution, which occurs as a result of runoff. Runoff includes many small sources, like septic tanks, cars, trucks, and boats, plus larger sources, such as farms, ranches, and forest areas. Millions of motor vehicle engines drop small amounts of oil each day onto roads and parking lots. Much of this, too, makes its way to the sea. Some water pollution actually starts as air pollution, which settles into waterways and oceans. Dirt can be a pollutant. Top soil or silt from fields or construction sites can run off into waterways, harming fish and wildlife habitats. Non-point source pollution can make river and ocean water unsafe for humans and wildlife. In some areas, this pollution is so bad that it causes beaches to be closed after rainstorms. Another culprit pollutant is plastic pollution in our oceans. Till 1970s, only a small amount of plastic was produced, and as a result, plastic waste was relatively manageable. Since 1970s, the rate of plastic production has grown faster than that of any other material. If the current growth rate continues, global production of primary plastic is forecasted to reach 1.1 billion tons by 2050. It is reported that 1,000 rivers are accountable for nearly 80 per cent of global annual riverine plastic emissions into the ocean, which range between 0.8 and 2.7 million tons per year. UN Decade of Ocean Science (2021-2030): One of the many activities of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) is 2022 UN climate change conference at COP27 . The Ocean Decade will host a sries of events that will focus on the need and methods for diverse actors to collectively work across the science - policy - society to ensure that ocean science leads to tangible and sustainable climate action. Specific themes to be addressed through the Ocean Decade events include: (i) climate action in Africa, (ii) resilience including the role of nature-based-solutions, (iii) financing for ocean science for climate action, and (iv) communicating ocean science for climate action. All events will align with the priorities ofCOP27 related to adaptation, mitigation, financing and collaboration and the key messages of the Ocean Climate Dialogue held in June 2022.

While strong global action is needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting future temperature increases to less than 1.5\'b0C by the end of this century, there is also an urgent need for countries to integrate climate migration into national development plans and national policies.

The event brought together high-level representatives from State Party delegations, development partners, international organizations, academia, and Civil Societies to explore issues of human mobility in the context of global climate change negotiations. COP27 represents an opportunity for States to proactively address the impact of climate change on human mobility. During the plenary, GoB, IOM and CVF representatives all recognized that human mobility challenges have serious implications on the rights and entitlements of individuals and communities. According to the Global Report on Internal Displacement 2021, 216 million people could become internal climate migrants by 2050. Climate change a threat to millions, vulnerable countries must be taken into account: FM With a population of 165 million and high susceptibility to flooding, storm surges, riverbank erosion and salination, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change. Ugochi Daniels, IOM's Deputy Director General for Operations, stressed the growing link between human mobility and climate change. She emphasized that international cooperation and collective action are preconditions to managing the mobility and ensuring that migration remains a choice and not a necessity. Alfred Okot Okidi, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Water and Environment, Republic of Uganda joined virtually and highlighted the pertinent points from the Kampala Declaration on displacement. Participants noted that concerted action on climate change mitigation and adaptation, together with inclusive development policies and embedding of climate migration in policy and planning, will help address some challenges around climate migration. Policy decisions made today will shape the extent the effects of climate change impact the lives of migrants and their families. Henry Kwabena Kokofu, Special Envoy of Ghana, Presidency of CVF ; Caroline Dumas- IOM's Special Envoy for Migration and Climate Action, Ivan Delgado, Coordinator of the Adaptation Area, Climate Change Directorate, Ministry of Environment and Energy, Republic of Costa Rica, and Atle Solberg, Head of Secretariat, Platform on Disaster Displacement participated in a panel discussion moderated by Matthew McKinnon, Senior Advisor, CVF-V20 and Strategy at Global Center on Adaptation. A video messages was also provided by Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, Mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Founding Leadership Board Member, Mayors Migration Council. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh138","Helping victims of climate change","November 4, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- Traditionally, the worst victims of natural calamities like storms, floods, tidal surges, downpours and droughts have been the poor. As usual, being increasingly exposed to the extreme climate-change-induced vagaries of weather, the poor have been experiencing even greater damage to their lives and properties than before. But the existing official financial support available to mitigate their losses is neither timely nor adequate. Also, any aid from international agencies is too small to meet their need. But since the disaster victims' needs are urgent, they cannot wait for the government assistance to arrive. Naturally, they try to tide over the crises on their own with whatever means they have at their disposal. According to a report from an international research institute, the poor stricken by climate-induced disasters in rural Bangladesh annually spend around US$2.0 billion dollars to repair their destroyed properties and other infrastructures as well as to take various preventive measures against future calamities. This is around twice the amount of financial assistance the rural climate victims receive from the government and 12 times the aid channelled through international multilateral agencies to meet such emergencies. It only points to the extent of the damage the rural climate victims are subjected to and the insufficiency of the succour they get from the government and other external sources to address it. So far as the financial support from the government or aid agencies is concerned, there is no structured mechanism to deliver the assistance to those in need. As reported in the last Wednesday's issue of this paper, a Sweden-based international body, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), came up with a search report that dwelt mainly on ways to make the 'finance for loss and damage' to the climate-affected poor operational. What the report further pointed out is that though with the worsening of the climate-change-induced disasters the demand for the financial assistance to address the victims' loss and damage is increasing, there is practically no arrangement as such in existence to meet the demand. What is there falls far short of what is required. Worse yet, the existing financial assistance regimes have funding procedures that are too complicated for the climate-vulnerable communities to access. Channelled mostly in the form of loans and projects, such assistances actually risk ensnaring the target communities in debt traps that basically defeats the very purpose of the help. Sometimes, the aid money even fails to reach the intended recipients. So, it calls for a change in the approach to deliver the financial assistance to the climate-vulnerable communities. In fact, the focus should first be more on devising a mechanism for delivering the financial assistance to the victims before determining the volume of the assistance to be provided. Though the advanced industrialised economies of the world are the biggest contributors to climate change, they have so far gone back on their commitment to help the affected poor peoples in the developing and the least developed countries. At the last year's Glasgow Climate Summit (COP26), for example, low-and-middle income countries proposed establishing a Loss and Damage Finance Facility. But the wealthy nations did not agree. Given its urgency, the matter should be raised again at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. As one of the worst victims of climate change, Bangladesh should play a leading role at the COP27 in creating the earlier proposed Loss and Damage Finance Facility.

They recommended that the government would lead the LDCs to develop the framework on Loss and Damage Financing Facility (LDFF) in the climate conference next year. They further said that Bangladesh should play a pivotal role using its leadership experience of Climate Vulnerable Forum and Vulnerable-20 Group to defend the interests of LDCs and Most Vulnerable Countries in the LDFF. The recommendations were made at a press conference titled ' CoP-27 Outcome and Bangladesh's Next Role' held in the National Press Club in the capital where representatives who attended the CoP-27 were present. Among others, Md Ziaul Hoque Mukta of Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihood, Md Shamsuddoha of Centre for Participatory Research and Development and Rabeya Begum of CANSA-BD, were present. The event was moderated by Director of COAST Foundation Mostafa Kamal Akand and a keynote paper was presented by Aminul Hoque of EquityBD. Aminul Hoque said that the declaration of LDFF is a significant achievement, but there is no place for self-complacence for the LDCs until it is being established as a measure for pro-poor and justice through an effective framework. Criticising the developed countries and the CoP President for not mentioning the names who had worked for LDFF for a long time, he demanded for Bangladesh should have a lead role for LDCs for developing the framework of LDFF, the Framework of LDFF must be developed followed by historical responsibility of global warming by rich countries that caused huge loss and damage for LDCs and MVCs. Bangladesh should put pressure on developed countries to revise their National Determined Contribution targeting 50% emission reduction by 2030 and LDCs Representation must be included in the ad-hoc committee on New Collective and Quantified Goal process that will serve the interest of the poor, he continued. Shamsuddoha said that the LDFF was somewhat complex and various conditions of climate mitigation have been added here. He also said that the developed countries can take the opportunities to delay the process by imposing various conditions and for it, the government should be cautious in dealing with it. Rabeya Begum underscored the need for more initiatives on climate change issues at the national and international level.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh140","OPINION: What Bangladesh must do now as a global climate leader","December 7, 2022 Wednesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Dec. 7 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- The recent agreement by all countries to establish a new fund for loss and damage from human-induced climate change at COP27 was a simple recognition of an unfortunate reality that has existed for a long time. The reality is that the impacts that are now scientifically attributable to global temperature rise are now happening every day around the world, and most countries, rich or poor, are not at all prepared to address those impacts. This means that every country has to examine its existing systems in order to respond to climate impacts such as floods, cyclones, heat waves and wildfires, as well as slow onset events such as sea-level rise and prolonged droughts, and make them fit for purpose in the new era of loss and damage. In particular, this should now be a high priority in every climate-vulnerable developing country. The International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) has initiated this research through the Least Developed Countries Universities Consortium on Climate Change (LUCCC), where preliminary scoping studies have already been conducted in 10 LDCs by young female researchers, the findings of which were presented to the negotiators from the LDCs at COP27 . Every country already suffers from some climate-related issues, which will no doubt become worse due to the continued global warming, so every country needs to become better prepared by setting up a national platform to address loss and damage from human-induced climate change. In Bangladesh, we have an opportunity to lead the other LDCs by taking forward the proposal to set up a National Mechanism for Loss and Damage (NMLD) as a public-private partnership under the leadership of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, as well as the ministries of disaster management, finance, and planning. Together with private sector actors such as insurance companies, civil society and researchers, Bangladesh is in a position to become a pioneer in developing a national-level mechanism to deal with the inevitable losses and damages caused by climate change. Such a national mechanism could include ways to consolidate disaster preparedness efforts with adaptation efforts to minimise climate impacts as well as address the losses and damages once they take place. At the same time, mechanisms to provide both immediate and long-term support to the victims of climate change impacts can also be examined. While the international negotiations on how to set up the loss and damage fund will no doubt continue until COP28, there is a lot of homework for the LDCs as well as other vulnerable countries to do to prepare their own governments and citizens to anticipate and deal with the now inevitable adverse impacts of climate change. Once the global fund is set up and running, an important aspect of who would be eligible to access the funds will be the ability of a recipient country to demonstrate its own national systems to address loss and damage domestically. One final aspect to emphasise is the potential displacement of millions of people, particularly in the low-lying coastal areas, who will inevitably have to move despite our efforts to help them adapt where they are. This aspect of human displacement due to climate change has not been addressed well and needs to be prioritised. Bangladesh is in a good position to become a champion on this issue by taking actions at the national and local levels as well as by playing an important role in the international discussions in different forums, including but not exclusively at the upcoming COPs. This is also an important human security issue that should be taken up at the UN Security Council. This would entail making the Bangladesh diplomatic corps experts in this issue, who will then be able to raise it at every appropriate international event and gathering, as it will undoubtedly gain importance going forward. By taking loss and damage from human-induced climate change seriously both at home and abroad, Bangladesh has an opportunity to become a global leader in addressing this rapidly escalating global crisis.

""The decommissioning and repurposing of the Komati coal-fired plant is a demonstration project that can serve as a reference on how to transition fossil-fuel assets for future projects in South Africa and around the world,"" the World Bank said in a statement distributed by South Africa's National Treasury. According to Reuters, Eskom's chief executive said in September that the company expected a World Bank decision on the funding before this month's COP27 climate summit. The money is separate from a $8.5 billion financial package on offer from wealthy countries to help South Africa reduce its carbon emissions, which are among the world's highest because it depends on coal for the bulk of its electricity generation. The World Bank's statement said the $497 million funding was made up of a $439.5 million World Bank loan, a $47.5 million concessional loan from the Canadian Clean Energy and Forest Climate Facility and a $10 million grant from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program.

The IEA predicted CO2 emissions would stand at 33.8 billion tonnes in 2022, more than 300 million tonnes in 2021. That increase was however far smaller than the 2-billiontonne jump the world experienced last year as countries turned to fossil fuels to power their Covid-19 recoveries, it added. The United Nations says greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 to keep the Paris Agreement temperature goals within reach -- effectively a drop of some eight percent each year this decade. BD to Press for $100b Climate Fund Pledge at COP27 in Egypt The energy crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine had propped up some coal demand this year due to hikes in natural gas prices, said the IEA. But the relatively small increase in coal emissions had been offset by widespread deployment of renewable tech, including electric vehicles (EVs) -- and this had prevented a CO2 rise of some 1 billion tonnes in 2022. ""The encouraging news is that solar and wind is filling much of the gap, with the uptick in coal appearing to be relatively small and temporary,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. ""This means that CO2 emissions are growing far less quickly this year than some people feared -- and that policy actions by governments are driving real structural changes in the energy economy.' \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh144","EDITORIAL","Energy & Power"," ","Delegates from different countries have started gathering at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt to take part in the COP27 . The Bangladesh delegation, led by the climate change minister, will also reach there before the official commencement of the conference of parties on 6 November. The COP negotiations proceed according to the visions and perspectives of participating countries, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. And that needs huge commitments as well as investment by the parties, especially the developed and developing ones. The negotiations had been making significant signs of progress before the COVID-19 pandemic slowed them down. The UNFCCC had to defer the COP26, scheduled for 2020, to 2021 due to the pandemic. Because the developed countries and major polluters were now providing a huge amount of funds to finance the war spending. Moreover, there is another apprehension that the release of pledged US$100 billion contributions annually by the developed countries to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) could be further delayed due to the war. EIA forecasts that for the higher price of primary fuel in the global market, the investment required to generate power from clean sources for achieving the emission reduction target by 2030 will increase to US$2 trillion annually. But to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the investment must be doubled from US$2 trillion to US$4 trillion. The truly frustrating situation particularly for the poor climate-vulnerable countries would not change unless political pressure is mounted on the developed countries to invest in climate rather than in the war. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh145","UN climate deal: Calamity cash, but no new emissions cuts","United News of Bangladesh"," ","For the first time, the nations of the world decided to help pay for the damage an overheating world is inflicting on poor countries, but they finished marathon climate talks on Sunday without further addressing the root cause of those disasters - the burning of fossil fuels. The deal, gaveled around dawn in this Egyptian Red Sea resort city, established a fund for what negotiators call loss and damage. It was a big win for poorer nations which have long called for money - sometimes viewed as reparations - because they are often the victims of climate-worsened floods, droughts, heat waves, famines and storms despite having contributed little to the pollution that heats up the globe. It has also long been called an issue of equity for nations hit by weather extremes and small island states that face an existential threat from rising seas. 'Three long decades and we have finally delivered climate justice,' said Seve Paeniu, the finance minister of Tuvalu. 'We have finally responded to the call of hundreds of millions of people across the world to help them address loss and damage.' COP27 Pakistan's environment minister, Sherry Rehman, said the establishment of the fund 'is not about dispensing charity.' Antigua and Barbuda's Molwyn Joseph, who chairs the organization of small island states, described the agreement as a 'win for our entire world.' 'We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve,' he said. The deal followed a game of chicken, with nations that supported the fund also signaling they would walk away if there was any backsliding on language on the need to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Early Sunday morning, delegates approved the compensation fund but had not dealt with the contentious issues of an overall temperature goal, emissions cutting and the desire to target all fossil fuels for phase down. Through the wee hours of the night, the European Union and other nations fought back what they considered backsliding in the Egyptian presidency's overarching cover agreement and threatened to scuttle the rest of the process. CSOs express dissatisfaction on the outcome of COP27 The package was revised again, removing most of the elements Europeans had objected to but adding none of the heightened ambition they were hoping for. 'What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet,' a disappointed Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Union, told his fellow negotiators. 'It does not bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts. 'We have all fallen short in actions to avoid and minimize loss and damage,' Timmermans said. 'We should have done much more.' Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock likewise voiced frustration. 'It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,' she said. The agreement includes a veiled reference to the benefits of natural gas as low emission energy, despite many nations calling for a phase down of natural gas, which does contribute to climate change. While the new agreement doesn't ratchet up calls for reducing emissions, it does retain language to keep alive the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The Egyptian presidency kept offering proposals that harkened back to 2015 Paris language which also mentioned a looser goal of 2 degrees. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. COP27 Nor did the final deal expand on last year's call to phase down global use of 'unabated coal' even though India and other countries pushed to include oil and natural gas in language from Glasgow. That too was the subject of last minute debate, especially upsetting Europeans. Last year's climate talks president chided the summit leadership for knocking down his efforts to do more to cut emissions with a forceful listing of what was not done. 'We joined with many parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to this emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text,' the United Kingdom's Alok Sharma said emphasizing the last part. 'Clear follow through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text weakened in the final minutes.' And in his remarks to negotiators, U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell, who hails from Grenada, called on the world 'to move away from fossil fuels, including coal oil and gas.' However, that fight was overshadowed by the historic compensation fund. 'Quite a few positives to celebrate amidst the gloom and doom' of not cutting emissions fast enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, said climate scientist Maarten van Aalst of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center, which responds to climate disasters. It's a reflection of what can be done when the poorest nations remain unified, said Alex Scott, a climate diplomacy expert at the think tank E3G. 'I think this is huge to have governments coming together to actually work out at least the first step of ... how to deal with the issue of loss and damage,' Scott said. But like all climate financials, it is one thing to create a fund, it's another to get money flowing in and out, she said. The developed world still has not kept its 2009 pledge to spend $100 billion a year in other climate aid - designed to help poor nations develop green energy and adapt to future warming. Next year's talks will also see further negotiations to work out details of the new loss and damage fund, as well as review the world's efforts to meet the goals of the Paris accord, which scientists say are slipping out of reach. According to the agreement, the fund would initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources such as international financial institutions. While major emerging economies such as China wouldn't automatically have to contribute, that option remains on the table. This is a key demand by the European Union and the United States, who argue that China and other large polluters currently classified as developing countries have the financial clout and responsibility to pay their way. The fund would be largely aimed at the most vulnerable nations, though there would be room for middle-income countries that are severely battered by climate disasters to get aid. Martin Kaiser, the head of Greenpeace Germany, described the agreement on a loss and damage as a 'small plaster on a huge, gaping wound.' 'It's a scandal that the Egyptian COP presidency gave petrostates such as Saudi Arabia space to torpedo effective climate protection,' he said. Many climate campaigners are concerned that pushing for strong action to end fossil fuel use will be even harder at next year's meeting, which will be hosted in Dubai, located in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. \"

Addressing a parliamentary committee, the minister in charge of coal Pralhad Joshi said the fuel was an affordable source of energy and demand for it had yet to peak in India, reports Reuters. ""Thus, no transition away from coal is happening in the foreseeable future in India,"" Joshi said, adding it would have a big role until 2040 and beyond. At the COP27 India has long resisted renouncing coal and manoeuvred with China at last year's COP26 talks, hosted by Britain, to block stronger commitments to quitting it. Months of declining fuel inventories at power plants culminated in the worst power crisis in more than six years in April, disrupting industrial activity and driving India to accelerate coal mining. As heatwaves boost air conditioning use and drive up power demand, the government said in a statement coal accounts for more than 51% of India's primary energy requirement and around 73% of power generation. Richer nations are under pressure to help the poorer world finance a transition to cleaner fuel.

Since the recently elected President Gustavo is currently at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), he instructed selected senior ministers to have an intensive consultation meeting with Yunus under the leadership of the minister in charge of the president's office. Yunus has been invited to Colombia by successive governments over the last two decades, and there are many programmes inspired by his work already running in the country, including microcredit programmes, social business programmes and university-initiated academic programmes. During his visit, University Externado de Colombia, a leading university in the country, organised a large public event and invited Yunus to address it. The university has a joint programme with Yunus Centre and set up a Yunus Social Business Centre three years ago. Yunus programmes in Colombia were presented by Yunus Centre on the work with universities, and Yunus Environment Hub about the projects for the environment and circularity in the Amazon region of the country as well as in other parts. This was followed by Yunus presenting his vision of a three-zero world and how that can be attained by building social business and with the involvement of the young people creating three-zero clubs. The ministers appreciated Yunus's vision, as well as his work on the ground and his presentation, which was followed by a long discussion with them on aspects of microcredit, social business, globalisation, the role of youth, climate change, the environment and deforestation and the culture of peace. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh151","BIDEN TO LEAD MAJOR ECONOMIES IN PUSH FOR ACTION ON CLIMATE","Energy & Power"," ","U.S. President Joe Biden recently will urge China and other major economies to ramp up their efforts to combat climate change by cutting methane emissions, adopting ambitious targets for zero-emission vehicles and cleaning up shipping. At the third virtual gathering of the Major Economies Forum (MEF) under his presidency, Biden will also call on countries to spend $90 billion to speed commercialization of clean technologies, and to develop new fertilizers that cut agricultural emissions and boost food security, senior U.S. officials told reporters. The meeting will be the largest gathering of world leaders on climate change before the November global climate conference known as COP27 to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The White House said Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will announce a joint effort to build climate resilience in Africa, while other countries were slated to join in several initiatives to reduce emissions. The countries that make up the MEF account for roughly 80% of global economic output and global greenhouse gas emissions. Several countries were expected to announce new 2030 emissions targets under the Paris climate agreement, the White House said, but did not name them. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh152","Climate change wipes out $525 bn over last 2 decades: Report","United News of Bangladesh"," ","A V20-commissioned report launched on Wednesday alongside the UN climate talks in Bonn, Germany, shows how climate change has already eliminated one fifth of the wealth of these countries, or US$ 525 billion, over the last two decades. The V20 Group of finance ministers from climate vulnerable economies including Bangladesh called for the immediate establishment of a separate and dedicated international funding for loss and damage crisis-level adaptation action. The report, titled 'Climate Vulnerable Economies Loss Report: Economic losses attributable to climate change in V20 economies over the last two decades (2000-2019)"", shows that for the top ten per cent of worst at-risk of the V20 countries, economic losses due to climate change for the past two decades are estimated to exceed half of all growth. The analysis provides the first ever estimate of the economic losses attributable to anthropogenic climate change only. Economic losses cut GDP growth in the V20 by one full per cent each year on average which averaged 3.67% in 2019 across the vulnerable economies, according to a message received from Bonn. From 2000 to 2019, the report estimated economic losses due to hydro-meteorological extreme events are higher than the previous two decades and the world's most vulnerable economies are also not adapting fast enough to cope with the changing climate as it currently stands. Though the study analysed historical economic losses, it also highlighted that these losses will continue to increase given the earth's warming is set to progress to within 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next decade regardless of further actions to reduce emissions. It noted that losses due to climate change have been growing over time, underscoring that countries are not adapting fast enough. Kenneth Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta, Ghana Finance Minister, said this should sound alarm bells for the world economy, since V20 are fast-growing engines of global economic growth, whereas the climate crisis has the potential to bring that phase to an end if the world fails to act. 'The failure on the $100 billion of international climate finance delivery, particularly the failure to ensure a 50:50 balance for adaptation, has left us highly exposed. Meeting and exceeding the COP26 agreed Delivery Plan to make-up shortcomings on the $100 billion and to double adaptation finance by 2025 are therefore absolutely crucial to our and the world's economic well-being. But it is no longer enough,' he said. Minister Ofori-Atta said as matter of pragmatism and justice, the V20 and Climate Vulnerable Forum is calling on COP27 to establish an international financing mechanism for climate change loss and damage in solidarity with victims least responsible for, and least equipped to withstand, the increasingly extreme physical shocks driven by climate change. Dr Michiel Schaeffer, chief scientist at Finres, author of the study, explained at 1.1\'b0C of warming, the majority of V20 countries have already reached their optimum temperature - any further warming beyond this will cause an acceleration in the loss and damage experiences by societies - this report is an also urgent call for more stringent mitigation action in line with keeping global mean temperature increase below 1.5\'b0C. Florent Baarsch, CEO of Finres, who led the study, said results are extremely novel they built on new peer-reviewed scientific methods and data that did not exist less than a year ago. Prof. Dr. Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, which hosts the V20 secretariat, while countries work hard to find enough ambition to reduce emissions within Paris Agreement bounds, the climate emergency has become the lived reality that is devastating lives around the globe. 'Acceleration adaptation at speed and at scale is a solution we have at hand right now to reduce loss and damage. It is not only proven to work but it is also a smart investment that will continue to pay off.' 'When this was first negotiated over a decade ago, recognition of loss and damage was not what it is today. It is untenable that the world's rich and responsible nations continue to refuse the poor, vulnerable and least responsible nations support for the crushing costs that we bear because of inaction on the climate crisis.' Ghana highlighted how the V20 and Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) are working unitedly for COP27 in Egypt later this year to deliver concrete results in terms of establishing international funding for loss and damage through a dedicated new instrument. 'It should fall on COP27 to decisively act on the void of finance for loss and damage in a clear litmus test for whether those fueling the climate crisis can truly begin to take responsibility for the breath of damage that has been unleashed by it.' \"

Buckingham Palace sought government advice about the United Nations COP27 summit and it was unanimously agreed that it would not be right for Charles to visit in person for what would be his first overseas trip as sovereign, the source said. There had been no confirmation that Charles would attend the meeting before he became king last month following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, the source said. According to Reuters, Charles spoke at the opening ceremony of the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, which he described as a ""last chance saloon"" to save the world from climate change, after the queen pulled out on doctors' advice. The Sunday Times newspaper reported that Charles had been told not to go to Egypt by new Prime Minister Liz Truss, dashing his plans to deliver a speech at the conference. The newspaper quoted a Downing Street source as saying a recent meeting between Charles and Truss had been cordial and there had not been a row. The new king campaigned for the environment and other issues while heir but he said last month that it would no longer be possible 'to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply'.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh155","OPINION: The end of the world? (1)","November 28, 2022 Monday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 28 Manila(Inquirer/ANN)- As we know it. In 2014, before the 2015 Paris Agreement, Obama and Xi called climate change ""one of the greatest threats facing humanity."" I'd like to suggest it's the greatest threat. COP27 is over, and I'm going to predict the apocalypse for one reason: politicians. Politicians who think in two-to-six-year terms for a problem that is decades into the future; who will only spend on results today; who will only decide for their nation (and their reelection), not on helping others; who consider promises equal action; who are uneducated on climatology; who, despite all these weaknesses, are the ones who make the decisions that will determine the fate of the human (and animal) inhabitants of this planet. And those humans are similarly shortsighted. In the US elections, when critical issues are brought to the fore, the public listed climate change sixth on their list of concerns. Survival of the human race should be number one. The previous five were all on day-to-day issues, affecting them now. If scientists could make the decisions, the planet would be saved. The evidence is already there. Devastating floods, never before experienced. Everlasting droughts for the longest time ever. Fires destroying areas at a scale new to the world. Cyclones and typhoons becoming ever more destructive. Glaciers that have been there for millions of years, falling into the sea. It rained for the first time in history in Greenland. The world's seas are up 9.7 centimeters and rising 0.32 cm annually. The world's temperature is up 1.1 degrees Celsius from preindustrial days. Temperatures have reached the 40s, a level that people struggle to live in, yet we're heading there, and higher. It's a well-named ""polycrisis,"" so many disastrous activities. It looks almost certain now that the scientifically accepted 1.5-degree rise committed in the 2015 Paris Agreement can no longer be attained. It will be higher. A United Nations report in October found that there is ""no credible pathway"" to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Current indicators are that the rise could be as high as 2.8 degrees Celsius, which would threaten billions of people. If countries just met their Paris Agreement commitments, the rise would still be an unacceptable 2.4 degrees Celsius. There is just one small piece of good news. And that was the win of Lula da Silva in Brazil. He has promised to fight the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest that ex-president Jair Bolsonaro allowed to continue, and, if he'd won, would have continued to allow. I've never understood why when someone cuts down a tree, they don't plant another a simple task that could help save the world. Since they don't, the carbon dioxide doesn't get sucked from the air. Germany has offered $175 million of the initial $210 million needed to reforest this forest, and also the once massive ones in Indonesia and the Republic of Congo. Industrial-scale emissions began in 1750. The carbon dioxide emitted stays in the air for thousands of years, so it's a cumulative effect. China, today, is the largest polluter, but over the centuries, it's the US that holds the top slot. They are followed by China, Russia, Germany, the UK, Japan, India, France, Canada, and Ukraine all rich advanced nations, except India whose huge population and uncontrolled use of coal, charcoal, and wood brings them into the picture. There was another attempt to actually get beyond talk, and do something last week at COP27 , getting 200 countries together in Egypt to make serious, firm commitments. More than 120 world leaders attended. But the leader of the world's worst carbon polluter, China, didn't attend. US President Joe Biden didn't make it till the sixth day. Which emphasizes what I said, in the most visible way, in the first paragraphs. Domestic politics is more important than the survival of planet Earth. Biden should have been there on Day One; Xi Jinping, too. Between them, they account for 44 percent of the pollution that is destroying the planet. They have to not only be the biggest cutter of pollution, but also the biggest spender in compensating for it. The greatest sufferers from an overheated planet are the poorest, smallest polluters. As a group, they only contribute 25 percent of pollution. You couldn't be more unfair than this. The Philippines is the world's most disaster-prone country, according to the World Risk report, with an average of 20 typhoons annually. These will become more destructive as the world's air heats up. Possibly even more frequent. Just one example of the problem in getting a solution is paying for where the most damage is likely. Ever so many of the most vulnerable countries, and that certainly includes the Philippines, have done the least to overheat the world. Yet must pay a vastly disproportionate amount to counter the likely damage. The countries that created the heating are only just starting to discuss who pays after 26 prior meetings. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh156","Define climate-induced loss and damage exactly: Experts","November 4, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- Country's leading climate experts suggested fixing the exact definition of loss and damage and making a proper calculation to claim a fund from the global parties for the climate-induced loss and damage, ahead of the COP 27 . ""We have to first determine the definition of loss and damage and make a proper calculation to claim a global fund to repair the damage inflicted by climate change. There are a number of relevant issues, including displacement, climate refugee and migration,"" said Prof Ainun Nishat of BRAC University. ""There is a lack of understanding of climate disaster and subsequent preparation at the government level. We witnessed the recent cyclone hit the country badly,"" he added. He suggested raising height of the coastal embankments, concentrating more on innovation and sustainable technology rather than depending on cheap technology. Echoing the same, M Asaduzzaman, research director of Bangladesh Development Research Centre, said ""If we fail to provide categorical information about loss and damage, we will not be able to press our demand in events like COP."" The webinar was organised by the Society of Experts on Environment Development (SEED) on the occasion of COP-27 Conference 2022. The main objective of the event was to lay focus on what to expect from the conference and its global importance. Md Ziaul Haque, director of the Environment Department, presented the keynote paper. He said the term 'climate finance' should be defined clearly for transparent accounting, and monitoring; and to ensure the new and additional nature of climate finance. It is a matter of deep regret that nothing has been done though the COP 26 requested to prepare a report in 2022 on progress towards achieving the goal of jointly mobilising US$100 billion find per year to address the needs of developing countries, reads the keynote. Adaptation financing is less prioritised compared to mitigation financing in both GCF and other funding windows, it states. Adaptation financing should be prioritised for achieving climate resilience in climate-vulnerable developing countries, says the keynote. Saber Hossain Chowdhury, president of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change was the chief guest. Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman, chief adviser of the SEED and the Chairman of PKSF, was special guest. Abul Kalam Azad, president of SEED and special envoy of CVF to Bangladesh Presidency, and former Principal Secretary and Chief Coordinator (SDG) of the Prime Minister's Office, presided over the event. Prof Md Nazmus Sadath of Khulna University and Maliha Muzammil, climate finance expert of UNDP Bangladesh, participated as speakers. Chowdhury said, ""The promises we received in the previous conferences have not been properly implemented and there is no guarantee that our demands will be fulfilled this year as well."" ""We will place our demands, but we should not stop development in the hope that help will come from there,"" he added. The speakers suggest that displacement of people from the coastal region needs to get special attention during urban planning.

The report, released ahead of talks on climate change finance at the COP27 summit in Egypt, said the funding was required to cut emissions, boost resilience, deal with damage from climate change and restore nature and land, reports Reuters. ""The world needs a breakthrough and a new roadmap on climate finance that can mobilise the $1 trillion in external finance that will be needed by 2030 for emerging markets and developing countries other than China,"" said the report, commissioned by the current and previous climate summit hosts, Egypt and Britain. It said the total annual investment requirement of developing countries would hit $2.4 trillion by 2030, with half coming from external financing and the rest from public and private sources in those countries. The biggest increase should come from the private sector, both domestic and foreign, while annual flows from development banks should be tripled, it said. Concessional loans, which offer more favourable terms than markets, should also be stepped up. ""Unlocking substantial climate finance is the key to solving today's development challenges,"" said Vera Songwe, one of the report's authors. ""This means countries must have access to affordable, sustainable low-cost financing from the multilateral development banks to help crowd in investments from the private sector and philanthropy."" Delegates at the climate summit in Egypt are expected to focus on financing issues on Wednesday.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh158","OPINION: Can Asia and the Pacific get on track to net zero?","November 30, 2022 Wednesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 30 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- The recent climate talks in Egypt have left us with a sobering reality: the window for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is closing fast, and what's on the table currently is insufficient to avert some of the worst potential effects of climate change. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets of Asian and Pacific countries will result in a 16 percent increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 from the 2010 levels. The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan and the package of decisions taken at COP27 are a reaffirmation of actions that could deliver the net-zero resilient world our countries aspire to. The historic decision to establish a Loss and Damage Fund is an important step towards climate justice and building trust among countries. But they are not enough to help us arrive at a better future without what the UN secretary-general calls a ""giant leap on climate ambition."" Carbon neutrality needs to be at the heart of national development strategies and reflected in public and private investment decisions. And it needs to cascade down to the sustainable pathways in each sector of the economy. At the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), we are working with regional and national stakeholders on these transformational pathways. Moving away from the brown economy is imperative, not only because emissions are rising but also because dependence on fossil fuels has left economies struggling with price volatility and energy insecurity. A clear road map is the springboard needed for an inclusive and just energy transition. We have been working with countries to develop scenarios for such a shift through National Roadmaps, demonstrating that a different energy future is possible and viable with the political will and sincere commitment to action of the public and private sectors. The changeover to renewables also requires concurrent improvements in grid infrastructure, especially cross-border grids. The Regional Road Map on Power System Connectivity provides us the platform to work with member states towards an interconnected grid, including through development of the necessary regulatory frameworks to integrate power systems and mobilise investments in grid infrastructure. The future of energy security will be determined by the ability to develop green grids and trade renewable-generated electricity across our borders. The move to net-zero carbon will not be complete without greening the transport sector. In Asia and the Pacific, transport is primarily powered by fossil fuels and, as a result, accounted for 24 percent of total carbon emissions by 2018. Energy efficiency improvements and using more electric vehicles are the most effective measures to reduce carbon emissions by as much as 60 percent in 2050 compared to 2005 levels. The Regional Action Programme for Sustainable Transport Development allows us to work with countries to implement and cooperate on priorities for low-carbon transport, including electric mobility. Our work with the Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade is also helping to make commerce more efficient and climate-smart, a critical element for the transition in energy and transport sectors. Even with mitigation measures in place, our economy and people will not be safe without a holistic risk management system. And it needs to be one that prevents communities from being blindsided by cascading climate disasters. We are working with partners to deepen the understanding of such cascading risks and to help develop preparedness strategies for this new reality, such as the implementation of the Asean Regional Plan of Action for Adaptation to Drought. Finance and investment are uniquely placed to propel the transitions needed. The past five years have seen thematic bonds in our region grow tenfold. Private finance is slowly aligning with climate needs. The new Loss and Damage Fund and its operation present new hopes for financing the most vulnerable. However, climate finance is not happening at the speed and scale needed. It needs to be accessible to developing economies in times of need. Innovative financing instruments need to be developed and scaled up, from debt-for-climate swaps to SDG bonds, some of which ESCAP is helping to develop in the Pacific and in Cambodia. Growing momentum in the business sector will need to be sustained. The Asia-Pacific Green Deal for Business by the ESCAP Sustainable Business Network (ESBN) is important progress. We are also working with high-level climate champions to bring climate-aligned investment opportunities closer to private financiers. Climate actions in Asia and the Pacific matter for global success and well-being. The past two years have been a grim reminder that conflicts in one continent create hunger in another, and that emissions somewhere push sea levels higher everywhere. Never has our prosperity been more dependent on collective actions and cooperation. Our countries are taking note. Member states meeting at the seventh session of the Committee on Environment and Development, which opens today (November 29, 2022), are seeking consensus on the regional cooperation needed and priorities for climate action such as oceans, ecosystems and air pollution. We hope that the momentum begun at COP27 and the committee will be continued at the 79th session of the commission as it will hone in on the accelerators for climate action. In this era of heightened risks and shared prosperity, only regional, multilateral solidarity and genuine ambition that match with the new climate reality unfolding around us  along with bold climate actions  are the only way to secure a future where the countries of Asia and the Pacific can prosper. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"

In other words, the High Commission on Sunday said, solar power will be offset against the High Commission's electricity consumption from the grid. The solar panels will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the High Commission by approximately 320 tonnes over its expected life of 30 years, and will produce approximately 18,000 kilowatt hours of electricity every year. Bangladesh, Cyprus keen to expand cooperation on public safety British High Commissioner Robert Chatterton Dickinson, who inaugurated the solar panels, said he is delighted to see that they are moving to green, renewable energy at the High Commission. He said electricity produced through renewable sources such as solar is critical to reducing their dependence on electricity produced by the burning of fossil fuels, which drives climate change. 'The energy crisis and the global situation since the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) hosted under the UK Presidency in November 2021 demonstrates that the rapid acceleration of renewable energy is not only essential to protecting the planet, but critical to the security of energy supply,' said the High Commission. Dr Sebastian Groh, Managing Director of SOLshare Limited, said, 'We applaud the entire team of the British High Commission for taking this initiative.' Groh said it is important to walk the talk and it is good timing during COP27 to set an example for all other missions. 'And this is just the beginning; we look forward to having further potential opportunities to support the British High Commission in their sustainability journey.' The green energy transition will help to meet bold climate commitments by accelerating transition to more affordable, reliable, and accessible energy that spurs growth, and reduces carbon emissions. Rooftop solar panels have been proven as one of the most effective renewable energy solutions for Bangladesh to meet its desired energy target and alleviate the present energy crisis. The British High Commission Dhaka said they are proud to be part of this change by contributing solar energy from its office rooftop. \"

Fifty UNESCO World Heritage sites are home to glaciers, representing about 10 percent of the world's glacier areas, including some of the world's best-known glaciers. They include the highest (next to Mount Everest), the longest (in Alaska), and the last remaining glaciers in Africa. Glaciers in a third of sites are under threat. However, UNESCO said, the rest can still be saved if global temperatures do not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times, according to UNB. The UNESCO study shows that these glaciers have been retreating at an accelerated rate since 2000 due to CO2 emissions. World Heritage glaciers lose on average some 58 billion tons of ice every year - equivalent to the total annual volume of water used in France and Spain together - and are responsible for nearly five per cent of observed global sea-level rise. The glaciers under threat are in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and Oceania. ""Only a rapid reduction in our CO2 emissions levels can save glaciers and the exceptional biodiversity that depends on them. COP27 will have a crucial role to help find solutions to this issue,"" UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay said. Also, UNESCO is advocating for the creation of a new international fund for glacier monitoring and preservation - such a fund would support comprehensive research, promote exchange networks between all stakeholders and implement early warning and disaster risk reduction measures. Half of humanity depends directly or indirectly on glaciers as their water source for domestic use, agriculture, and power. Glaciers are also pillars of biodiversity, feeding many ecosystems. ""When glaciers melt rapidly, millions of people face water scarcity and the increased risk of natural disasters such as flooding, and millions more may be displaced by the resulting rise in sea levels,"" said International Union for Conservation of Nature Director General Bruno Oberle.

The WTO's World Trade Report 2022 launched at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt says the most realistic way to make deep emissions cuts without reducing living standards in richer countries and harming development prospects in poorer ones is through advancing low-carbon technologies, according to Reuters. ""The WTO has an opportunity to use the present moment to strengthen its role as a forum for coordination on trade and climate change, to address trade policy barriers holding back the dissemination and use of low-carbon technologies, and to support structural changes needed to decarbonise the global economy,"" she said in the report's foreword. ""I hope we will make the most of this opportunity."" One example of how the 164-member WTO might help is by cutting tariffs and other barriers for low-carbon industries which tend to be higher than for carbon-intensive ones, the report said. A WTO simulation estimate included in the report indicates that eliminating such measures could boost global exports in energy-related environmental goods, such as solar panels or smart heating controls, by 5 per cent by 2030, or $109 billion and reduce emissions. Another is through establishing a broadly-accepted price for carbon, the report says. By the global trade watchdog's own admission, trade has been ""part of the problem"" in the past - by generating transport emissions and by helping to drive carbon-intensive growth. Nearly a third of the world's total carbon dioxide emissions were embodied in global goods and services exports in 2018, according to an estimate from the OECD policy forum.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh163","British High Commission in Dhaka turns to solar panels","November 20, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 20 -- British High Commission in Dhaka has activated solar panels in its office in an attempt to move to renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. In partnership with SOLshare, a climate tech company, the High Commission has installed a 15.93 kilowatt per hour grid-tied rooftop solar project for its office, reports UNB. In other words, the High Commission on Sunday said, solar power will be offset against the High Commission's electricity consumption from the grid. The solar panels will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the High Commission by approximately 320 tonnes over its expected life of 30 years, and will produce approximately 18,000 kilowatt hours of electricity every year. British High Commissioner Robert Chatterton Dickinson, who inaugurated the solar panels, said he is delighted to see that they are moving to green, renewable energy at the High Commission. He said electricity produced through renewable sources such as solar is critical to reducing their dependence on electricity produced by the burning of fossil fuels, which drives climate change. ""The energy crisis and the global situation since the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) hosted under the UK Presidency in November 2021 demonstrates that the rapid acceleration of renewable energy is not only essential to protecting the planet, but critical to the security of energy supply,"" said the High Commission. Dr Sebastian Groh, managing director of SOLshare Limited, said, ""We applaud the entire team of the British High Commission for taking this initiative."" Groh said it is important to walk the talk and it is good timing during COP27 to set an example for all other missions. ""And this is just the beginning; we look forward to having further potential opportunities to support the British High Commission in their sustainability journey."" The green energy transition will help to meet bold climate commitments by accelerating transition to more affordable, reliable, and accessible energy that spurs growth, and reduces carbon emissions. Rooftop solar panels have been proven as one of the most effective renewable energy solutions for Bangladesh to meet its desired energy target and alleviate the present energy crisis. The British High Commission Dhaka said they are proud to be part of this change by contributing solar energy from its office rooftop.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh164","G7 makes new $15b offer to Vietnam to cut coal use","December 7, 2022 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 7 -- The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations has made a new $15 billion offer to Vietnam to agree during a summit next week on funding to speed up its transition away from coal, three people familiar with the talks said. Vietnam, which is among the world's top 20 coal users, was initially slated to sign up for the so-called just energy transition partnership with G7 nations at a global COP27 climate summit in November, but high-level talks broke off before the meeting, according to Reuters. To persuade Vietnam to back the offer, Western negotiators led by the European Union and Britain have proposed a bigger financial package, which includes $7.5 billion made up almost exclusively of loans from the public sector and the same amount in pledges from the private sector, the sources said. All three Western officials, who declined to be named because talks were confidential, said it would be the final offer from the G7 before a summit of European Union and Southeast Asian nations in Brussels on Dec 14, which EU officials have repeatedly indicated as the new target date for a deal. The offer has gradually expanded from an initial pledge of just $2 billion in public funds with undefined additional private support. It is unclear whether it could be further revised if no deal was reached next week. Vietnam's government and the European Commission did not reply to emailed requests for comment. It remains unclear whether Vietnam would be prepared to accept the increased offer, because its main concerns do not appear to have been addressed. The Southeast Asian country had asked for more grants, because it is traditionally opposed to taking on large loans. One of the sources said there was a ""50/50"" chance of a deal next week. Another noted talks were still under way and final figures may still change slightly. Vietnam's energy security remains potentially at risk as the G7 plan focuses on renewable energy which may result in power shortages in the booming nation without a credible back-up in the event of low power output from wind farms or solar panels. Immediately after talks broke off in November, when Vietnam's authorities cancelled a meeting due to take place in Hanoi with top US and EU climate envoys, according to sources, the country's industry ministry circulated a new draft for its long-term power plans which boosted the use of coal compared to a previous version of the same document.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh166","Resilience imperative for South Asia","November 7, 2022 Monday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 7 -- In July, I became the new World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region. Just over two months later, I stood in the Khanpur tent city in the Dadu district of Pakistan, where tens of thousands of people whose homes had been destroyed by recent floods had taken refuge from the green, putrid water that had swallowed up their livelihoods. The human suffering that I witnessed in Khanpur has become the new normal across many parts of South Asia. In our region, climate change is not an abstract concept; it is happening now, and fast. This spring, record-breaking heatwaves brought India and neighboring Pakistan and northern Bangladesh to a standstill. In August, unusually intense monsoon rainfalls - exacerbated by melting glaciers - caused a super flood that submerged one-third of Pakistan, displacing millions and destroying critical infrastructure like hospitals, schools and bridges. More than half of all South Asians, or 750 million people, have been affected by one or more climate-related disasters in the past two decades. As my World Bank Group colleagues and I prepare for COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, we know that climate change is a serious risk multiplier that hinders sustainable and inclusive development across South Asia and will do so more in the future. Without comprehensive, scaled-up climate action, gains in human development and poverty reduction across South Asia are at risk, and macro-economic fragility will grow. For South Asia, whose per capita greenhouse gas emissions are well below the global average, climate action first and foremost means investing in climate resilience as an urgent priority . This requires strengthening the systemic resilience of rural landscapes including food, freshwater, and forest systems to boost adaptation to a changing climate, livelihoods, and food security. As South Asia continues to urbanize rapidly, it also requires building climate-resilient cities and infrastructure. And it demands a people-centric approach to strengthen community resilience through early warning systems and shock-responsive safety nets. It is not that South Asia can afford to ignore greenhouse gas emissions altogether. But in prioritizing climate action, countries in the region should look for synergies between adaptation, mitigation and development, such as relying on nature-based solutions for water resource management or building more efficient cities to reduce the need for cooling. The World Bank Group has already ramped up our support for adaptation and mitigation efforts in the region through our South Asia Climate Roadmap. We recently completed in-depth Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDR) for Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan that have a clear message: The urgent need to increase domestic and international investment in resilience across the region's roads, hydropower dams, coastal communities and agriculture, as well as its rapidly growing cities, which are full of informal settlements that are at highest risk. To do this, there are two important gaps that need to be addressed. First, accessing financing for climate resilience projects remains a challenge for many countries. Continuing high inflation, slow economic growth, and the ongoing fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic have constrained the fiscal space of governments across South Asia. Unlocking private investment in climate resilience and adaptation has proven difficult. A combination of measures is likely needed to fix this: regulation to incentivize private climate action and reduce climate risks on corporate and financial balance sheets, more concessional funding to complement insufficient revenue streams from investments in resilience, and new financial instruments that make use of markets to generate new, cost-effective solutions. Our CCDRs contain several practical suggestions, but let's be honest: none of us have ready-made solutions - our diagnostics are a way to begin the conversation. One challenge in South Asia on which much is known already is the low revenue base of most governments. This is a constraint not just for climate action but for development more generally. Greater domestic resource mobilization must complement increased support from the international community to effectively leverage private sector finance. Secondly, investing in the well-being, education, and health of citizens can pay huge dividends in boosting the productivity, growth, and resilience of economies. Investments in human capital, increased availability of and access to productive jobs, and improving social protection systems can help communities better prepare for - and respond to - the increasing and inevitable climate shocks they will face. Timely, equitable development can reduce people's vulnerability to climate change, potentially halving the number of people that will fall into poverty because of climate change by 2030. The role of local communities and the partnership with civil society is key here. Across South Asia, the World Bank Group is helping countries to strengthen this critical 'soft' infrastructure through community resilience projects. For example, thanks to decades of systematic investments in cyclone preparedness, Bangladesh has become a global leader in disaster risk reduction. In Nepal, the World Bank's Forests for Prosperity project works to increase community benefits from forests by including women and other socially excluded groups, thereby incentivizing sustainable forest management practices. Such solutions can be highly cost effective. For cash-strapped governments, investing in efficient delivery mechanisms could be the cheapest form of climate action. As I write, the secondary impacts in Pakistan from the catastrophic flooding that I saw firsthand in the Khanpur tent city are only just beginning. With the flood waters stubbornly slow to recede, diseases such as malaria, typhoid, and dengue fever are taking hold while millions face food insecurity. With COP27 just around the corner, we need everyone to play their part to deliver increased finance for resilience and to ensure we are on a more equitable, prosperous, and cleaner development path in South Asia and across the globe.

With an air quality index (AQI) score of 165 at 9 am, the metropolis ranked second in the list of world cities with the worst air quality. Vietnam's Hanoi and Pakistan's Lahore occupied the first and third spots in the list, with AQI scores of 172 and 156 respectively. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered 'unhealthy', particularly for sensitive groups. On the other hand, an AQI between 50 and 100 is considered 'moderate' with an acceptable air quality. However, there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. Similarly, an AQI between 201 and 300 is said to be 'poor', while a reading of 301 to 400 is considered 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to residents. AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, is used by government agencies to inform people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy during winter and improves during monsoon. Read What can COP27 do for climate vulnerable countries? With the advent of winter, the city's air quality starts deteriorating sharply due to the massive discharge of pollutant particles from construction works, rundown roads, brick kilns and other sources. Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognised as increasing a person's chances of developing heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung infections and cancer, according to several studies. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.

Scientists in Israel are creating a gene bank from the seeds of local wild crops, some that have survived for thousands of years since the birth of agriculture and that may help farmers deal with a harsher climate in the coming decades, reports Reuters. In a eucalyptus grove nestled between an industrial zone and a new railroad under construction, botanist Alon Singer collected seeds from a number of plants recently spotted, including a variety of water mint, that will be frozen and stored at the Israel Plant Gene Bank at the Volcani Institute, the national agricultural R&D centre. Singer is combing the country along with other scouts and foragers in search of varieties of wheat, barley and countless other wild crops so their genetic makeup can be saved and studied before they are lost to expanding deserts and urbanization as the climate warms. ""The plants here are very unique. They are the ancestors of many of the cultivated plants used today,"" he said. Resilient characteristics can be harnessed to genetically modify farmed crops so they better withstand drought or disease. Sometimes they don't make it in time and a plant of interest falls victim to a new road before its next bloom. Tens of thousands of types of seeds are stored in the gene bank. It may be smaller than some collections elsewhere in the world but the gene pool here is unique, coming from an area that was part of the Fertile Crescent region known as the birthplace of crop cultivation. ""This is where agriculture started about 10,000 years ago,"" said Einav Mayzlish-Gati, director of the gene bank. ""Species that were domesticated here are still in the wild adapting along the years to the changes in the environment."" The research has already been paying off. For example, the institute has engineered a variety of wheat with an ultra-short lifecycle. It may not be able to compete today, but it could be a saving grace in a hotter climate with reduced growing seasons.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh174","Singapore aiming to have emissions reach net zero by 2050; public feedback sought","September 6, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Sep. 6 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  The Republic is considering setting 2050 as the year for Singapore to have its planet-warming emissions reach net zero, giving clarity to a timeline announced earlier this year. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) on Monday said Singapore is also deciding whether to raise its 2030 climate target to support the longer-term goal. The current target allows the country to continue releasing planet-warming emissions, reaching a peak of 65 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030. NCCS said the public can give their views on the 2050 timeline and the possibility of an updated 2030 target via government feedback portal Reach. The public consultation exercise opened on Monday and closes on Sept 26. Achieving this means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible, such as by swopping fossil fuels for renewable energy. Any remaining emissions need to be reabsorbed from the atmosphere by restoring forests and mangroves, for instance. During this year's Budget in February, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong had said Singapore will aim to have its emissions dwindle to net zero ""by or around mid-century"". He added that the carbon tax rate in Singapore will also be increased from the current $5 per tonne of emissions to between $50 and $80 by 2030, to help the country reach its climate targets. The increase in carbon tax is among a slew of climate initiatives that Singapore announced in recent months. Others include Singapore's plans to electrify its vehicles and make its buildings and factories more energy-efficient. Singapore's target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 aligns its longer-term climate target with other developed nations. Japan, Canada, the United States and the European Union are among the countries and jurisdictions that are aiming to reach net zero by that year. ""Building on Singapore's longstanding emphasis on sustainable development, making a decisive move to net zero will ensure that we do our part in the global fight against climate change,"" added NCCS. In 2020, Singapore told the United Nations that it aims to halve its emissions from its 2030 peak by 2050, and that it aims to reach net-zero emissions ""as soon as viable in the second half of the century"". At last year's COP26 UN climate change meeting in Glasgow, countries were urged to have shorter-term plans that are aligned with their longer-term goals. Leaders from almost 200 nations agreed then to submit stronger 2030 emissions reduction targets ahead of this year's COP27 climate summit, which will be held in Egypt from Nov 6 to 18. Net-zero climate pledges backed up by stronger shorter-term mitigation plans will put the world in a better position to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. That is the target that climate scientists say will help the world avoid harsher climate impacts, such as more intense floods, wildfires and extreme weather events. The NCCS said Singapore is well positioned to take advantage of global trends in sustainable financing and corporate net-zero targets, and develop as an attractive place for green economic activities in industry, services and finance. ""In repositioning our economy and establishing our competitive edge early, this will allow us to capture many good jobs for Singaporeans and enhance Singapore's value proposition in the future low-carbon global economy,"" NCCS added. But the secretariat said cutting emissions would require efforts from all segments of society. Companies will have to be less carbon-intensive in their operations, workers have to acquire new skills, and individuals will have to adjust to lifestyle changes such as consuming and wasting less and reducing energy usage. Ms Woo Qiyun, a climate action advocate who works in the sustainability sector, said of the latest update: ""It is notable that we are finally considering setting a definitive timeline to reach net zero, compared to our latest update of achieving this by or around 2050. ""This way, we'll be aligning ourselves to science  to keep global warming to no more than 1.5 deg C, global emissions need to be reduced by 45 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050,"" she added. However, she said that the public consultation period of three weeks is relatively short, given that climate change may be a technical topic for some. More outreach and details should accompany such announcements, she added. Ms Melissa Low, a climate policy observer at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, said public feedback is timely as COP27 is in two months. But she added that the Government could consider other channels to collect qualitative feedback, such as over e-mail or via townhall meetings, instead of relying on a survey format. Ms Low said these views will be taken into consideration when Singapore makes a formal revision to its 2030 and 2050 targets before the end of the year. ""The revision to the (targets) is important to all Singaporeans, and we should have an adequate chance to submit our inputs,"" she added.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh176","Over 50% of life-threatening bacterial infections becoming resistant to treatment: WHO","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Over 50 percent of life-threatening bacterial infections are becoming resistant to treatment, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said in its new report. Also, high levels of resistance to treatment are reported in bacteria frequently causing bloodstream infections in hospitals, according to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System report, published Friday, based on 2020 data from 87 countries. Antimicrobial resistance undermines modern medicine and puts millions of lives at risk, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Within the context of national testing coverage, the report, for the first time, analyses antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates, tracking trends in 27 countries since 2017. It reveals high levels of bacteria resistance, frequently causing life-threatening bloodstream infections in hospitals, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp, which require treatment with last-resort antibiotics, such as carbapenems. However, eight percent of those infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to carbapenems, increasing the risk of death. Bacterial infections are becoming increasingly resistant to treatments, with over 60 percent of Neisseria gonorrhoea infections, a common sexually transmitted disease, showing resistance to ciprofloxacin, one of the most widely used oral antibacterials.

Although most antimicrobial resistance trends have remained stable over the past four years, bloodstream infections due to resistant E.coli, Salmonella, and gonorrhoea infections have jumped by at least 15 percent compared to 2017 rates. More research is needed to discover why AMR has increased and the extent to which infections are related to hospitalisations and antibiotic treatments during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the UN health agency. ""To truly understand the extent of the global threat and mount an effective public health response to AMR, we must scale up microbiology testing and provide quality-assured data across all countries, not just wealthier ones,"" Tedros said. New analyses show that countries with lower testing coverage - mostly low and middle-income countries (LMICs) - are more likely to report significantly higher AMR rates for ""bug-drug"" combinations. This may be partly because only a limited number of referral hospitals in many LMICs provide data for the WHO report. Read: Health must be at the centre in COP27 climate change negotiations: WHO These hospitals often care for the sickest patients who may have received previous antibiotic treatment. Meanwhile, in terms of antibiotic consumption, 65 percent of 27 reporting countries met the WHO's target of ensuring that at least 60 percent of antimicrobials are first or second-line treatments. ""These 'ACCESS' antibiotics are effective in a wide range of infections with a relatively low risk of creating resistance. However, insufficient testing coverage and weak laboratory capacity, particularly in LMICs, make AMR rates difficult to interpret,"" the UN agency said. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh179","Call for collective actions to minimise migration, displacement due to climate change","November 14, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 14 -- Collective actions are needed to minimise migration and displacement, including in Bangladesh, due to global climate change. Bangladesh, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) jointly made the call for more action around climate induced migration and displacement. They recognised that climate change is a risk multiplier for displacement and migration, and that millions of people throughout the world will be impacted by climate-induced displacement unless immediate action is taken. Participants reflected on the need for immediate climate action Monday at the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) side event. It focused on Human Mobility in the Context of Climate Change: Building a Positive Narrative on Migration and Climate Action, held at the CFV Pavilion, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The event was jointly organised by GoB, IOM and CVF. The event brought together high-level representatives from state party delegations, development partners, international organisations, academia, and civil society organisations to explore issues of human mobility in the context of global climate change negotiations. According to the Global Report on Internal Displacement 2021, 216 million people could become internal climate migrants by 2050. With a population of 165 million and a high susceptibility to flooding, storm surges, riverbank erosion, and salinization, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change. Bangladesh is also at the forefront of climate change adaptation, and disaster risk reduction and management efforts, as well as consensus building through different regional and global forums and platforms. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, speaking at the event, noted that climate change drives migration and displacement. ""The global community must recall that the Paris Agreement acknowledged that climate change is a threat to millions of people, and vulnerable countries must be taken into account,"" he said. While strong global action is needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting future temperature increases to less than 1.5degC by the end of this century, there is also an urgent need for countries to integrate climate migration into national development plans and national policies. Ugochi Daniels, IOM's deputy director general for operations stressed the growing link between human mobility and climate change. She emphasised that international cooperation and collective action are preconditions to managing the mobility and ensuring that migration remains a choice and not a necessity. Alfred Okot Okidi, permanent secretary, Ministry of Water and Environment, Republic of Uganda joined virtually and highlighted the pertinent points from the Kampala Declaration on displacement. Participants noted that concerted action on climate change mitigation and adaptation, together with inclusive development policies and embedding of climate migration in policy and planning, will help address some challenges around climate migration.

They will discuss managing their countries' competition and issues, including Taiwan and trade, the White House said on Thursday. A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the meeting would be an in-depth and substantive conversation for the leaders to better understand each other's priorities and intentions. ""The (US) President believes it is critical to build a floor for the relationship and ensure that there are rules of the road that bound our competition,"" she said. ""It's also ensuring that we're working together on areas where our interests align, especially transnational challenges that affect the international community. This meeting will be a part of this ongoing effort, and the President believes there's no substitute for face to face to carry these discussions forward,"" she added, stressing the importance of keeping lines of communication open. Mr Biden and Mr Xi have not met in person since the US President took office in January 2020, although they have spoken over phone or video five times, most recently in July. Mr Xi did not travel outside of China for much of the Covid-19 pandemic. The US official said that Mr Biden would be honest about America's concerns, including China's activity threatening the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as longstanding concerns about Beijing's human rights violations and harmful economic practices. China regards the island of Taiwan  one of the thorniest issues in US-China relations  as a renegade province to be reunited with by force if necessary, and has accused the US of upsetting the status quo. At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Biden said he wanted to ""lay out what each of our red lines are"". He also said he wanted both of them to understand each other's positions on critical national interests, and to determine how conflicts between their interests should be resolved. Asked if the US would commit to militarily defending Taiwan, Mr Biden replied that he was ""not willing to make any fundamental concessions"" and that America's policy on the island had not changed. The US official said that Mr Biden would also propose ways to advance cooperation, and discuss issues that included Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and North Korea's recent missile launches.

At COP27 As the increasing speed and intensity of the climate crisis are outpacing the ability of poor rural people to cope, 'we need to think out of the box and find new ways, such as this scheme, to bring justice and provide the support that rural people need,' said Jo Puri, IFAD's Associate Vice-President, Strategy and Knowledge Department. Three PES pilot projects will be developed in Brazil, Ethiopia and Lesotho to help small-scale producers build their resilience to climate change, boost food production, better participate in markets, and improve their access to nutritious diets. Each of the three pilots will be equally funded. All the activities under the PES project aim to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and boost carbon sequestration. 'We must not spare efforts in acknowledging and harnessing the strategic contribution of rural people in low- and middle-income countries to improve food security and preserve vital environmental resources for future generations,' said Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary in Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), at the signing ceremony. Germany's financing pledge is also a way to encourage the international community to diversify financial instruments to fund sustainable climate adaptation and climate mitigation practises in the agricultural sector. 'It is about time to reward the economic value of these essential services that rural people are carrying out. These are key activities to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems, which also provide a significant contribution to mitigate climate change. They are indeed preserving our future,' Puri added. The PES scheme in Lesotho will incentivize better water resource management in the Orange River Basin, spanning across Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia, and rural communities will be able to contribute to restoring degraded soils and landscapes. In Lesotho and Ethiopia, as an income-generating opportunity, small-scale farmers will be connected to the voluntary credit carbon market, where companies and countries can buy credits to make up for greenhouse gases, they themselves emit. Since the establishment of IFAD in 1977, Germany has contributed US$711 million to IFAD's work on climate action, gender equality, food and nutrition security, and establishing equitable and sustainable food systems. Germany has also provided loans for up to EUR 800 million through KfW, Germany's public development Bank, and contributed US$89 million in supplementary funds to support inclusive sustainable value chains development, climate adaptation, and youth employment. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh182","How dynamic is 'dynamic energy pricing'?","November 30, 2022 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 30 -- With the approval of amendment to the BERC (Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission) Act 2003 by the cabinet, the government has assumed the right to adjust power and gas prices without a public hearing. The purpose of the move is to introduce what has been termed a 'dynamic energy pricing' system. On paper, the argument looks strong enough when the delay in taking effect of a price adjustment following the BERC's process is often atrociously long. According to the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, a proposal sent to the BERC for price hike took one and a half years for adjustment. But by the time it did so, it proved irrelevant. Dynamic pricing will avoid such lengthy procedures, let alone a public hearing, to readjust the tariff rate within two to three days. Although it gives the impression that the exercise is very simple and local power and gas tariffs will be raised or lowered consistent with price hike or drop in the international market quite often, it is unlikely to be such a continued sequence. The present woes find their origin in the policy flaws that have made the country overwhelmingly dependent on imported fuel oils and LNG (liquefied natural gas). Even when petroleum products registered a record slump before the post-Covid bullish energy market, consumers did not enjoy any benefit out of it. Through this energy crisis global lobbyists of fossil fuels including coal, the dirtiest of all, have successfully diverted focus from clean or renewable energy sources. In case of Bangladesh, the captive power plants run on imported but subsidised oil, should not have been more than an emergency solution to the power crisis but the system was unnecessarily protracted. The expenditure of Tk 900 billion on this head over the past 11 years speaks volumes for the misdirected priority. There is no guarantee price revision will take place in consistent with international market when it will abruptly come down. It happened earlier on the pretext that the BPC needed to recover some of the losses it incurred on account of subsidy. Many will feel prompted to view it as a move consistent with the IMF recipe for receiving the multilateral agency's loan. Whatever may be the case, the fact is that Bangladesh has not done its homework well enough to meet an emergency when it comes to exploring its domestic sources either on the fossil fuel --- mainly gas --- front or on the renewable front. The country along with others has convincingly argued at the COP27 summit at Sharm el-Sheikh for a loss and damage fund from the rich and pollutant countries. But it did not put its own house in order by way of opting for renewable energy. Had it done so, the current crisis could not hit it so hard. Instead of charting a roadmap for green or clean energy, it is now compelled to look for a way out of the energy crisis no matter if it means falling back upon dirty energy sources like coal. Costly imported fuel has not only led to rising production cost but also its crisis has badly affected industrial output. It is like a chain reaction that makes the economy wobbly. Better it would be to explore domestic gas and its rational use for power generation and other productive purposes in order to overcome the present crisis and opt for a roadmap for harnessing wind and solar power as early as possible.

V20 countries have at least $435 billion of debt servicing payments due in four years at a time when new investment is severely needed, the Group said in its V20 Ministerial Dialogue IX Communique. The combination of high debt servicing costs and climate change represents a systemic risk to climate-vulnerable economies that can trigger a vicious cycle that depresses revenues and exchange rates while increasing inflation and the cost of capital including for investments to respond to climate shocks themselves - all are factors that exacerbate climate vulnerabilities. Climate change shocks and disasters have already eliminated $525 billion from V20 economies in the past 20 years, according to research commissioned by the Group. ""As economic managers, it has long been clear to us that climate change is not a distant challenge. It has set ablaze not only many of the world's forests but also our fragile national budgets. Climate change is simply compounding existing and increasingly acute fiscal stress,"" Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghana's finance minister and current V20 chair, said. ""The international financial architecture must become fit for climate and our development ambitions and it must support and not detract from transformational changes needed in the real economy towards our common prosperity."" ""Climate change has already eliminated one-fifth of our wealth - in other words, V20 economies would be 20 percent wealthier today had we not been suffering the daily toll of climate loss and damage. In aggregate dollar terms, this is half a trillion in losses. And for the most at-risk countries, economic losses exceed half of all growth since 2000,"" President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed said. ""For the most at-risk V20 economies, the loss exceeds total growth. We are experiencing losses and damages from the climate emergency every day, and yet we have contributed the least to emissions."" Other calls from the V20 Ministerial Dialogue IX Communique include immediate reform of the sovereign debt restructuring architecture. Then, through guarantee facilities and regulatory action, all creditor classes will be compelled to reduce the level of debt in V20 countries for them to mobilise financing for their climate and development goals, according to the statement UNB received from Washington. The Group called on all international financial institutions and their major donors to consider debt flexibility to free up capital for investment in growth-spurring climate action. It urged multilateral financing institutions to specify their commitment to climate investment and to deliver at least a doubling in international finance for adaptation within the next 30 months, with all multilateral development banks (MDBs) ensuring their climate portfolios are at least 50 percent focused on climate adaptation. Also, it said the delivery of the minimum $100 billion a year goal is commensurate with the emergency nature of the fallout of the global climate breakdown as it harms V20 economies and developing nations most and called for clear evidence of results through an update to the $100 billion Delivery Plan by COP27 . \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh184","Impending heat wave disasters: Are S Asian countries prepared?","October 13, 2022 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 13 -- heatwaves will become so extreme in certain regions of the world including our South Asia that maintaining human life will not be sustainable in these places. The Sahel, the Horn of Africa as well as South and Southwest Asian regions will witness heat waves that will ""exceed human physiological and social limits"" triggering large-scale suffering and loss of life. That this prediction holds true is being palpably felt for quite some years as in the summer it has become increasingly difficult to maintain life in Bangladesh due to extreme hot weather. Before the UN's COP27 climate change summit that is going to be held next month in Egypt, it has been warned that aggressive steps are needed to be taken immediately to avert potentially recurrent heat disasters. Besides the heat waves, rising sea levels and changing rainfall patterns are already disrupting the ecosystem and damaging livelihoods. These vagaries will become more intense in the time to come. According to a previous forecast, by the end of the century, many areas of the populous continent of Asia could see mean temperatures shoot up to eight degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is indeed a grim prediction for a country like Bangladesh which is already witnessing, and acutely so, prolonged heat waves and unusual rainfall. Rise in sea level will submerge much of the country's coastal areas. Now the question that arises is: are Bangladesh or vulnerable countries such as Myanmar, the Philippines, Vietnam, Pakistan and Thailand preparing themselves for these grim prospects? When countries worldwide are faced with bleak climate change facts, it was a matter of extreme surprise that the US under the leadership of Donald Trump withdrew itself from the 2015 Paris climate change accord through which nations had committed to keeping global temperatures well below 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. Though Joe Biden, after his election to office, came back to the commitment, nations seem to be not serious about the climate change predicament. Experts say even a 2 degrees Celsius rise in heat will be difficult to manage, and a 4 degrees Celsius increase can cause humanitarian disasters in many nations and result in unmanageable migration flows or locked-in populations. Besides the sea level rise, heat waves as well various diseases would take their toll. Now, the vulnerable countries or LDCs ought to create pressure on the developed countries to extend their financial and technical support to climate change vulnerable countries. There is a Green Climate Fund (GCF) within the framework of the UNFCCC founded as a mechanism to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices to counter climate change. However, it would be very worthwhile if the vulnerable countries, especially in South and Southwest Asia regions create a forum of their own to find out means and ways to effectively face the climate change realities in the coming years shunning the present business-as-usual approach.

Thus far, Mr Biden's only bilateral meetings will be with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Sharm El Sheikh where he will attend the COP27 climate summit; Cambodian Premier Hun Sen in Cambodia where he will attend the US-Asean and East Asia summits; and Indonesian President Joko Widodo at the G-20 summit. Asked about additional bilateral meetings, one of the senior officials said: ""There is nothing to report at this time."" In Indonesia, President Biden will underscore the importance of the US-Indonesia strategic partnership, a senior official said. Mr Biden will also work with G-20 leaders to ""lay the foundations for a more sustainable, inclusive global economy which will support American families and vulnerable countries' economies alike"", he said. ""The United States will be... unapologetic in our defence of Ukraine, we will be unapologetic in calling out Russia for its brutal war,"" the official added. The President's agenda at the G-20 meet includes working to address the war's impact on the global economy. Energy security and food security are at the top of that list, the official said. Mr Biden will co-host an event in Bali where the US will advance the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, he added. This is an effort that was launched in June to mobilise US$600 million (S$840 million) in financing over five years for lower- and middle-income countries. The President will announce new projects in quality infrastructure, which will also strengthen supply chains, added the official. Mr Biden will also talk about debt relief for vulnerable countries, leveraging multilateral development banks to fund global challenges and global health, he said. At the US-Asean summit in Phnom Penh taking place just before the Bali meeting, Mr Biden will continue to press the US' seriousness in institutionalising stepped-up levels of engagement with the region, said the senior official briefing on the Asean meetings.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh187","No alternative to climate cooperation accord","November 9, 2022 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- ""Cooperate or perish"" is a short but powerful message. It is uttered by none other than the UN chief and the occasion he has chosen to deliver the message is the 27th edition of the climate summit called Conference of the Parties (COP) now being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. In his address at the climate conference, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could not be more blunt when he probably made the ultimate assertion humanly possible, ""It is either a climate solidarity pact, or a collective suicide pact"". No doubt, these are very strong words and a dire warning for those who are indifferent to their responsibilities for the planet's temperature rise beyond any acceptable limit. Point-blank, his remarks that followed were unfailing in hitting their targets. Reminding the world leaders, particularly those of the rich and developed countries which are mainly responsible for major carbon emission, of their moral obligation--- by no means a charity---Guterres makes a strong case for their contribution to the climate fund. In this context, the approval on Sunday of the developing nations' agenda of monetary compensation for 'loss and damage' already caused can be considered a good beginning. For Bangladesh, it is particularly savouring to note that Bill and Melinda Gates has pledged $1.4 billion to help small holder farmers in Bangladesh cope with the impacts of climate change. Once the world's richest person Bill Gates perhaps wanted to send a message to the rich world that not only the governments of the developed world but also the superrich and rich have a role to mitigate the woes of the climate vulnerable in parts of the planet where natural calamities wreak havoc with lives and livelihoods. That the news of this donation comes right at the time of the COP27 is significant. Of late, the frequency and ferocity of such calamities have only crossed past records most likely because of the heedless acts of the rich world. The rich world is also feeling the heat of the planet's turmoil. They are also suffering the worst type of natural calamities ---some of those never experienced before---in their own backyard. For example, Europe's temperature has risen twice as fast as the global average in the past 30 years. There is no way of living in an ivory tower for rich nations. When the world needed to join hands together to get over the post-Covid-19 adverse impacts on economies, nasty geopolitics stoked a war between Russia and Ukraine. An exacerbated energy crisis and soaring prices have not only rendered millions defenceless against hunger and diseases, but also left no option other than increasing use of carbon-emitting fossil fuels including coal. At a time when there was need for far greater investment in research on and innovation of affordable green technologies for shifting to clean energy, the war may have delayed the transition by a decade or decades. This is why the UN chief has warned of a mass annihilation of the human race. Already, the temperature has risen to 1.2 degree Celsius over the pre-industrial level. The war is set to upset the UN target of arresting the temperature rise well below the 1.5 C above that level. There will be a point of no return if the world cannot agree to reduce greenhouse gas emission. If the human species goes extinct, it will have none other than itself to blame.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh188","ADB announces mobilising $200m for water resilience programme in Asia, Pacific","November 12, 2022 Saturday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recently joined with partners at COP27 to announce the ambition to mobilise more than $200 million from 2021 until 2025 to create water and sanitation resilience and security in Asia and the Pacific. The Asia and the Pacific Water Resilience Initiative, also known as RUWR: ARe yoU Water Resilient?, is a wide-ranging programme aiming to build capacity and resources for innovative solutions to mainstream resilience by addressing gaps, needs, and opportunities at the local level. It is part of ADB's commitment to scale up financing for climate change adaptation, according to an ADB statement. Building on the mobilisation of more than $80 million in 2021-2022, ADB recently welcomed new support to take effect in 2023. The Netherlands is supporting the initiative with a $20 million contribution to the newly established Water Resilience Trust Fund, which falls under the banner of RUWR and will focus on adaptation, innovation, and inclusivity to accelerate water resilience. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is providing $10 million to the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund under the initiative, which will help expand inclusive urban sanitation services, pilot and upscale sanitation technology and innovations, and support policies and capacities to deliver inclusive, resilient, and sustainable sanitation systems. ADB plans to allocate more than $120 million in grants between 2023 and 2025 for water and sanitation security and resilience to support the initiative. It has also established a technical assistance (TA) cluster of $8.0 million, called Mainstreaming Water Resilience in Asia and the Pacific, which will manage the RUWR. The TA cluster is funded by ADB resources, the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and the Japan Fund for a Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific. The contributions from the Netherlands and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will add to the $115.9 million in grant financing received from partners under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF), which has supported 113 ADB investment projects in 20 countries since 2006. The governments of Spain and Austria are also WFPF funding partners. ""Water is one of the world's most critical natural resources and one increasingly threatened by the impacts of climate change in Asia and the Pacific. It is the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change,"" said ADB's Chief of Water Sector Group Neeta Pokhrel. ""Small transformational steps toward water and sanitation resilience today will mean we can make great strides in climate adaptation at the local level."" ""Climate change threatens millions of people in Asia and the Pacific. Women and children are the most affected,"" said head of the water unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands Karin Roelofs. ""We have to join hands to make the water sector more resilient."" ""In the face of more frequent and severe flooding, as well as in drought-affected areas, lack of resilient sanitation systems is a major public health hazard. The spread of disease from poor sanitation has the greatest impact on the poorest families in vulnerable, disaster-prone areas,"" said Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation President Rodger Voorhies. ""Our support to the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund is a pledge to our continued partnership with the Asian Development Bank in building systems, knowledge, and capacity for urban water resilience in the region and ensuring that sanitation is central to this effort,"" Voorhies said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh189","National Adaptation Plan to make Bangladesh climate-resilient: Speakers","United News of Bangladesh"," ","The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) will help Bangladesh to reduce its vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change by having relevant ministries, departments and other stakeholders together for collective and urgent climate action, speakers said at a workshop on Sunday. The workshop on the final draft of the NAP was held at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, jointly organised by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and CEGIS-led consortium. The concerned ministries validated the National Adaptation Plan in the workshop after a series of consultation workshops held under the initiatives of the 'Formulation and Advancement of the National Adaptation Plan Process in Bangladesh' project of UNDP and in partnership with the Environment Ministry and Economic Relations Division supported by the Green Climate Fund. The NAP has been considered as the most valuable plan for adapting to climate change which helps countries conduct comprehensive medium and long-term climate adaptation planning, depending on adaptation capabilities and activities and integration of climate change in the national decision-making process. The main objectives of the NAP are to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience and adaptation to new and existing policies and programmes, especially development strategies. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 129 developing countries have initiated their NAP process, of which Bangladesh is not an exception. Addressing the workshop as the chief guest, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md. Shahab Uddin said the government formulated the NAP to address the risks of climate change based on the views of concerned ministries, departments, and will be implemented with the cooperation of all concerned. He said if the National Adaptation Plan is implemented in Bangladesh, it will be easier to deal with climate change by taking and implementing long-term integrated adaptation programs. 'Specific adaptation needs for Bangladesh were identified and appropriate implementation strategies were incorporated in the plan,' he said. The Minister said this plan is not merely a national plan, but it will also reflect the country's commitment in the world forum over climate adaptation. Deputy Minister for environment Habibun Nahar stressed mainstreaming the climate change adaptation and said, 'I believe NAP will integrate adaptation with national planning by prioritizing Climate Change Adaptation through its six goals.' She thanked UNDP and the Green Climate Fund for their support in formulating the National Adaptation Plan. Stefan Liller, Resident Representative of UNDP Bangladesh highlighted the leadership role of Bangladesh in climate adaptation. He said, 'The finalization of NAP could not be made at a more apt period of time, as we look ahead to COP27 in November, where countries including Bangladesh will gather to discuss progress on the Global Goals on Adaptation strategies to support the most climate vulnerable.' 'UNDP is committed to continuing supporting the Government of Bangladesh on its journey of advancing and implementing NAP to achieve the agenda 2030 for a climate resilient future,' he added. Water resources (sr) secretary Kabir Bin Anwar and ERD secretary Sharifa Khan, among others, spoke at the workshop presided over by environment secretary Dr Farhina Ahmed. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh190","Climate change adaptation: $230b plan up for passage","October 16, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 16 -- A 27-year comprehensive plan involving $230 billion to combat adverse impacts of climate change in Bangladesh is set to be placed before the cabinet shortly. The draft plan styled 'National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2023-2050' entails a detailed outline to attract both domestic and foreign funds, according to experts who drafted it. Some 52 per cent of the fund would be invested in urban water management, water infrastructure and river dredging, said CEGIS executive director Malik Fida A Khan. A pool of experts comprising 35 fellows of the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) drafted the NAP. The private sector's contribution is estimated at 5.01 per cent of the aggregate amount in the NAP, Mr Khan said. The funds would be managed through offloading green bonds, attracting investment in economic zones, export-processing zones, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association or Bangladesh Investment Development Authority. The government's annual development programme (ADP) would be another source of fund management for implementing the plan, he added. Once the NAP is passed, Bangladesh would be able to seek fund assistance from development partners with the support of the plan's detailed data and outline. ""Development partners often wanted to know how much money Bangladesh would need to combat adverse impacts of climate change, but we couldn't provide any data or study."" Mr Khan said the NAP has pointed out segments and categorised the areas where investment would be needed for adaptation to climate change. An implementation road map has to be prepared after the NAP gets approved, he continued. Last week, the cabinet sent back the NAP to incorporate the government's landmark initiatives, taken so far on climate change front, in the plan. Mr Khan said the NAP has been formulated as per the requirements of the Cancun framework of COP16 in 2010. At the COP21 UN climate-change conference, the Paris Agreement called for each country at risk to adopt a national adaptation plan. Environment, forests and climate change ministry initiated the formulation of the plan in 2016. Sources said the government took the initiative to finalise the NAP ahead of COP27 in Egypt, slated for next month. Mr Khan said the losses might reach more than 2.0 per cent of the GDP in 2030 and 9.0 per cent in 2050 if no effective action is taken. The NAP has been drafted selecting four sectors-water resources, agriculture, urban area and coastal zone. In the drafting process, the CEGIS conducted rigorous consultations with an estimated 5,000 people, including the underprivileged ones. The NAP has divided Bangladesh into 11 climate-change areas considering 14 climate hazards. It has considered the period-2030 and 2050-keeping in mind sustainable development goals (SDGs) and delta plan, and Bangladesh's target to become a developed country by 2041. The plan has categorised eight areas considering the country's future risks of climate change. The areas are water resources, disaster, social-safety net, agriculture, fisheries and livestock, urban area, biodiversity and wetland, ecology, institution and rules and regulations, capacity development research and innovation. Mr Khan said Bangladesh would need fund support to manage climate risks. Earlier, drafting such an inclusive plan required foreign consultants' support, but the CEGIS has gained expertise to prepare this international standard document, he concluded.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh191","Climate adaptability","October 17, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 17 -- At a time when a large segment of world population is gasping for breath under the grinding pressure of the more immediate and pressing issues of market volatility, failure to manage enough and nutritious foods, loss of jobs and income, it is only natural that climate change took a back seat. But much of their woes originates directly from climate change. Indifference to the global warming which is the cause and effect of human acts of indiscretion in effect is a sure recipe for the obliteration of the human race and other creatures from the face of the planet Earth. Climatologists, researchers working with bio-diversity and the natural world and environmental scientists have long warned of the precariousness of the planet's sustainability caused by release of CO2 from automobiles, factories and industries. The world has reached its tipping point, so actions for reducing emission of greenhouse gas cannot wait. It is against this backdrop, the 27th edition of the Convention of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is going to be held in Sharm El-sheikh, Egypt next month. As one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, Bangladesh needs to present its case in a comprehensive manner at the conference there. A report published in this newspaper on Sunday confirms that a draft climate adaptability plan covering 27 years has been finalised. Once the plan titled, 'National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2023-2050' receives approval from the cabinet, it will be presented at the COP27 summit. In fact, it was incumbent on Bangladesh, following the Paris climate conference's mandate, to prepare a comprehensive paper convincingly arguing in favour of its need for climate funds to fight adverse effects of global warming, the causes of which are mostly extraneous than internal. The highly industrialised nations are often the worst polluters in the world and the UNFCCC's climate conferences have, happily, made it mandatory for the polluters to compensate for parts of the losses and damage incurred in vulnerable countries on account of hostile climate. According to the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), which is responsible for preparation of the plan, the country lost $4.65 billion or 1.3 per cent of the GDP in the fiscal year 2021-22 on account of adverse impacts of the climate. This loss, the CEGIS maintains, is likely to surpass 2.0 per cent in 2030 and reach up to 9.0 per cent by 2050 if no action for climate adaptability is taken. So, the $230-billion plan for climate adaptability had to be devised in order to stave off the collateral damages and losses of climate change. On the face of it, the amount sought for the implementation of the plan looks large but when 27-year period along with the purposes to be served are taken into account, it may not be large enough. The way climate is getting in unforeseen turmoil, there is no knowledge of how hostile the environment will turn for life and livelihoods. It is too early to comment on the merit of the plan drafted. However, adaptability is no substitute for stalling or reversing the environmental decline and Bangladesh alone cannot do much in this regard unless the world at large comes to terms with drastic reduction of fossil-fuel use and consequent pollution. Yet some programmes like green revolution taken locally can significantly help improve the country's physical environment.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh192","New blue carbon institute to be launched in Singapore","November 15, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 15 Singapore(The Straits Times/ANN)- SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  To help mitigate climate change and protect coastal communities, a new institute will be supporting the restoration and protection of ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrasses in South-east Asia and beyond. Announcing this at Singapore's pavilion on the sidelines of the COP27 climate conference in Egypt, Amazon and Conservation International said they will be establishing an International Blue Carbon Institute, which will be housed in Singapore. Blue carbon refers to the carbon dioxide stored in coastal and marine ecosystems like mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes that sequester and store large quantities of carbon in both plants and sediments, thus playing an essential role in the solution to global climate change. Speaking at the institute's launch on Monday evening, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the implementation of these blue carbon initiatives will allow countries to realise their climate ambition  both in mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Mangrove forests, for example, are known to be coastal guardians and can help protect communities from heavy flooding and sea-level rise. ""South-east Asia, with its vast stretches of mangroves and coastal ecosystems, has tremendous potential for blue carbon initiatives that will also support environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, and livelihoods and heritage of local communities,"" she added. According to a report looking at the state of the world's mangroves, South-east Asia holds over one-third of the world's mangrove forests. But the greatest loss of mangrove forests has also occurred in this region, largely due to factors such as the expansion of aquaculture and oil palm plantations. With support from the Economic Development Board, the International Blue Carbon Institute will serve as a knowledge hub to build capacity, expertise and standards to develop and scale these blue carbon projects. Key tools will also be developed to create methodologies for establishing carbon credits. Each credit represents one tonne of carbon emissions. Establishing a mechanism can allow countries to have access to finance by protecting a mangrove forest, for example, and preventing tonnes of CO2 emissions from being released. Dr Emily Pidgeon, who is vice-president of ocean science and innovation at Conservation International, told The Straits Times that a mangrove forest stores about 10 times the carbon per unit area compared with terrestrial forests, but these projects can be difficult to measure and track over time. They are also often difficult to scale, as many blue carbon projects are often built around local communities. Therefore, scaling up conservation or restoration of a particular mangrove area would often have to involve working with different communities, she added. Key to the institute would be to help people understand how important mangroves are for climate adaptation and mitigation. In the first year, the institute will focus on areas like developing key guidance on how preserving blue carbon ecosystems can be included in a country's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which refers to climate-related targets to achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It will also look to expand knowledge on the role of seagrasses and kelp ecosystems in sequestering carbon, which can then help in informing policies to conserve these for mitigation against climate change, said Dr Pidgeon. Amazon will be providing the institute with a grant of up to US$3 million (S$4.1 million) to establish and fund its operations for the first three years, to help the region build and scale credible blue carbon projects.

'Health workers have a crucial role in helping to overcome these barriers. The WHO Global School on Refugee and Migrant Health is a valuable resource for building the capacity of health workers to better serve refugees and migrants.'

'We need 230 billion US dollars for implementing our National Adaptation Plan from both domestic and international resources. Bangladesh continues to seek a 50-50 distribution between adaptation and mitigation from international climate financing,' she said. The premier was addressing the inaugural ceremony of a global hub on Locally Led Adaptation (LLA) at Foreign Service Academy through a virtual platform from her official residence Ganabhaban. She opened the global hub to reinforce Bangladesh's global leadership on LLA, building on the momentum generated during COP27 . The PM said Bangladesh now spends 6-7 percent of the GDP for climate adaptation. Bangladesh has so far implemented 800 projects for both climate adaptation and mitigation under a Climate Change Trust Fund set up with its own resources in 2009, she said. She called upon all major carbon emitting countries to further enhance the scope of their nationally determined contributions. 'We must all redouble our efforts to keep the global warming limited to 1.5\'b0 Centigrade,' she added. The Prime Minister said the people of Bangladesh have long been using migration as an adaptive response to climate impacts. 'We need to give priority to both preventing and managing increased human mobility due to climate change,' she said. Under the flagship Ashrayan programme, her government has built about a million semi-pucca disaster-tolerant houses for the homeless and landless people. The world's biggest multi-storied housing project for climate migrants is being built at Khurushkul in Cox's Bazar. Some 5,000 climate-refugee families who migrated from different islands were already rehabilitated in 139 multi-storey buildings there, she said.

Their collective efforts have turned Bangladesh into a climate adaptation hub,' she said. In Bangladesh, local communities have their traditional knowledge and solutions for climate adaptation. The government also supports those solutions with resources and innovations, she said. 'This combination has served us well in developing a pool of bankable locally-led adaptation measures,' she said. In this context, the PM focused on her government's success and steps on building cyclone and flood shelters across the country; creating the coastal green belt and artificial mangrove forests through tree plantation; developing saline-, drought- and flood-tolerant crop varieties; adaptation of innovative methods for climate-smart fisheries and livestock rearing; strengthening mechanization in agriculture; promoting roof-top cultivation for food production and heat reduction; dredging rivers, ensuring easy access to safe drinking water for the coastal people; promoting adoption of renewable energy for irrigation purposes, and keeping measures for rainwater harvesting in new public sector buildings.

A small thaw in relations between the United States and China at the Group of 20 meeting in Bali has boosted hopes that the world's top two polluters can help get a deal over the line in Egypt. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry confirmed Wednesday that he and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua had resumed formal talks after they were frozen three months ago by China in retaliation for U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan. Asked what his goal for the outcome of the meeting was, Kerry was cautious, however. 'We'll have to see, it's a late start,' he said. Coming into this year's annual U.N. climate conference, known as COP27 , the host Egypt had declared the overarching drive would be to implement past promises, including firming up cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to meet the 2015 Paris accord's headline goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Instead, delegates have been haggling over whether to even restate the 1.5 degree goal. That objective got a boost when the G-20 meeting in Bali ended with a statement that endorsed the 1.5 degree target and made 49 references to climate. Officials from developing nations, meanwhile, are pushing for rich countries to make good on pledges of further financial aid for those struggling to cope with global warming. One significant aspect of that could be payments for 'loss and damage' resulting from climate change, which developed countries have long resisted for fear of being held financially liable for the carbon dioxide they've pumped into the atmosphere for decades. But there has been a softening of positions among some rich nations that now acknowledge some form of payment will be needed, just not what. 'Countries that are particularly affected, who themselves bear no blame for the CO2 emissions of industrial nations such as Germany, rightly expect protection against loss and damage from climate change,' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said as she departed for Egypt. She acknowledged that negotiators have £ difficult path' ahead of them for a substantial agreement. Asked about the issue of loss and damage, EU Executive Vice-President Timmermans said: 'We're all willing to find some substantial steps forward, but we're not there yet.' The middle of the second weeks of climate summits in general are £ deep valley of anxiety,' said Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief who was at more than 20 summits but not the one in Egypt. She said that's because there is such a big desire for something to come out of talks, but 'it's also the moment in which people begin to be much more aware of the short time horizon that is left to be able to deliver something by Friday.' That pressure 'makes us act on the double and hopefully be more creative and also more conciliatory than we were perhaps in the first week,' Figueres said. Geopolitical tensions have been reflected at this year's talks, with European Union delegates walking out of a speech Tuesday by Russia's special climate representative, and a small group of Ukrainian and Polish activists briefly disrupting a Russian side event. Brazilian President-elect Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva received a more enthusiastic welcome at the talks in Egypt. He met late Tuesday with Kerry and was due to hold talks with other top leaders, despite not yet being in office. Brazil's efforts on climate change are seen as vital because its Amazon rainforest territory provides a vast 'carbon sink' to the world where emissions can be stored, whereas deforestation would fuel global warming. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh197","'Time is up': Countries trapped in climate crisis raise alarm at UN","September 24, 2022 Saturday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Sept. 24 -- Countries on the front lines of the climate crisis are fed up. During the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations this week, low-lying island nation Vanuatu stepped up a fight to get the world to focus on combating global warming by calling for a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty, reports Reuters. ""The time is up - action is required now,"" Vanuatu's President Nikenike Vurobaravu told the UN General Assembly on Friday. The treaty would aim to scale down coal, oil and gas production to limit the rise in temperatures to the globally agreed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). It would also ""enable a global just transition for every worker, community and nation with fossil fuel dependence,"" said the leader of the carbon-negative country. A UN climate science panel - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - has warned that global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5 degrees C warming limit and reach some 3.2 degrees C by the end of century. Vanuatu has also asked the International Court of Justice to issue an opinion on the right to be protected from the adverse impacts of climate change, a move that Vurobaravu said ""is not a silver bullet for increasing climate action, but only one tool to get us closer to the end goal of a safe planet for humanity."" In Pakistan, devastating floods this month engulfed large swaths of the country, killing more than 1,500 people and causing damage estimated at $30 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asked world leaders why his people were paying the price of global warming. ""Pakistan has never seen a more stark and devastating example of the impact of global warming. Life in Pakistan has changed forever,"" Sharif told the General Assembly. ""Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan, without looking ... at our carbon footprint."" 'CLIMATE CHANGE MONSTER' Around the world on Friday young activists rallied for climate action, staging protests from New Zealand and Japan to Germany and the streets of New York to demand rich countries pay for global warming damage to the poor. The protests take place six weeks before this year's UN climate summit, known as COP27 , where vulnerable countries plan to push for compensation for climate-related destruction to homes, infrastructure and livelihoods. ""We renew our call to the world to declare total war on this century's greatest challenge: the climate change monster. And yet, after all these years, the world has failed to break our addiction to fossil fuels,"" Marshall Islands President David Kabua told the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the least responsible for climate change are suffering the most. ""The Philippines is a net carbon sink, absorbing more carbon dioxide than we emit. And yet, we are the fourth most vulnerable country to climate change,"" he told the UN gathering. UN chief Antonio Guterres on Friday warned that the world is ""not even close"" to making enough progress on climate change, telling a meeting of Pacific Island leaders: ""Those who did nothing to create this crisis are paying the highest price."" Guterres has also urged rich countries to tax windfall profits of fossil fuel companies and to use that money to help countries harmed by the climate crisis and people who are struggling with rising food and energy prices. The United States and China are the world's biggest carbon emitters. On the fight against global warming, US President Joe Biden warned at the United Nations this week: ""We don't have much time."" Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama condemned the climate war as being fought with ""apathy, denial, and a lack of courage to do what we all know what must be done."" He appealed for the world to step up. ""Fiji is ready to make the coming years count for our people and for the planet - our question to you is this: Are you with us?

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh198","$230b needed: PM seeks support from global partners to implement national adaptation plan","December 11, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 11 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today (Sunday) urged the international partners to support Bangladesh's efforts to implement the National Adaptation Plan for 2023-2050, as USD 230 billion is required towards that end. ""We need 230 billion US dollars for implementing our National Adaptation Plan from both domestic and international resources. Bangladesh continues to seek a 50-50 distribution between adaptation and mitigation from international climate financing,"" she said, reports UNB. The premier was addressing the inaugural ceremony of a global hub on Locally Led Adaptation (LLA) at Foreign Service Academy through a virtual platform from her official residence Ganabhaban. She opened the global hub to reinforce Bangladesh's global leadership on LLA, building on the momentum generated during COP27 . The PM said Bangladesh now spends 6-7 percent of the GDP for climate adaptation. Bangladesh has so far implemented 800 projects for both climate adaptation and mitigation under a Climate Change Trust Fund set up with its own resources in 2009, she said. She called upon all major carbon emitting countries to further enhance the scope of their nationally determined contributions. ""We must all redouble our efforts to keep the global warming limited to 1.5deg Centigrade,"" she added. The Prime Minister said the people of Bangladesh have long been using migration as an adaptive response to climate impacts. ""We need to give priority to both preventing and managing increased human mobility due to climate change,"" she said. Under the flagship Ashrayan programme, her government has built about a million semi-pucca disaster-tolerant houses for the homeless and landless people. The world's biggest multi-storied housing project for climate migrants is being built at Khurushkul in Cox's Bazar. Some 5,000 climate-refugee families who migrated from different islands were already rehabilitated in 139 multi-storey buildings there, she said. Talking about local climate resilience, Sheikh Hasina said the people of Bangladesh have been living with natural calamities for ages. They have attained some sort of resilience against flood, tidal surge, cyclone and other hazards. ""They have learned to adapt to the changing courses of nature. Their collective efforts have turned Bangladesh into a climate adaptation hub,"" she said. In Bangladesh, local communities have their traditional knowledge and solutions for climate adaptation. The government also supports those solutions with resources and innovations, she said. ""This combination has served us well in developing a pool of bankable locally-led adaptation measures,"" she said. In this context, the PM focused on her government's success and steps on building cyclone and flood shelters across the country; creating the coastal green belt and artificial mangrove forests through tree plantation; developing saline-, drought- and flood-tolerant crop varieties; adaptation of innovative methods for climate-smart fisheries and livestock rearing; strengthening mechanization in agriculture; promoting roof-top cultivation for food production and heat reduction; dredging rivers, ensuring easy access to safe drinking water for the coastal people; promoting adoption of renewable energy for irrigation purposes, and keeping measures for rainwater harvesting in new public sector buildings. ""Bangladesh is now considered as a role model in disaster risk reduction,"" she said. She said her government will extend all possible support to the Global Hub on LLA. ""We are pleased to have this as yet another offering from Bangladesh for the climate vulnerable people around the world,"" she said. The PM hoped that the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA) South Asian Regional Office, which was launched here in Dhaka in 2020, would emerge as a centre of excellence for the region and beyond. Now the GCA has launched the Global Hub on LLA, responding to the call made by Sheikh Hasina to promote the sharing of experiences of Bangladesh, and other countries on building the climate resilience of vulnerable communities. The global will identify LLA best practices and scale them via investments and partnerships; while advocating, and building capacity, for broader systemic change towards locally led adaptation in countries. The Hub will implement activities that promote progress towards scaling up LLA in at least 25 countries by 2025. GCA Chair and former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, GCA Chief Executive Officer Dr Patrick Verkooijen (through virtual platforms), Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, Environment Minister Shahab Uddin and British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson spoke on the occasion.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh199","1 in 5 children in poverty, at climate risk: Report","November 3, 2022 Thursday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 3 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- One in every five children in Bangladesh is living with poverty and high climate risk, according to a new global report. Styled ""Generation Hope: 2.4 billion reasons to end the global climate and inequality crisis"", the Save the Children report said more than one crore children in Bangladesh are facing this double burden. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. ""A total of 21 percent of the total child population [in Bangladesh] are living with the dual impacts of poverty and high climate risk,"" the report read. It mentioned that the child population in Bangladesh is 53,407,032. ""So, the 11.1 million is 21 percent of the total child population."" They are among the almost 350 million children across Asia, who are gripped by both grinding poverty and climate disaster, the report added. Mostak Hossain, humanitarian director of Save the Children Bangladesh, said, the World Bank estimates that 20 million people will be the internal climate migrants in Bangladesh by 2050, and around 40 percent are children. ""One of the reasons they remain vulnerable is that we do not separately emphasise their situation in our planning process, strategies or guidelines."" However, he said, it is a good thing that in the draft of the National Adaptation Plan, children and the youth in general are considered one of the most important vulnerable groups. ""Save the Children builds future climate leaders by working with students and youth climate organisations, so that they can be better equipped to address children's vulnerability to future climate shocks."" The report was developed by the Save the Children with climate modelling from researchers at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, who found that 77.4 crore children from across the world fall into this high-risk group. The country with the highest percentage of children impacted is South Sudan (87 percent), followed by the Central African Republic (85 percent) and Mozambique (80 percent). The analysis revealed that India has the highest number of children both living in poverty and bearing the brunt of the climate crisis  up to 223 million in total. It is followed by Nigeria and Ethiopia, with 58 million and 36 million children, respectively, living with this double burden. Save the Children warned if the climate and inequality crises are not addressed with urgency, the frequency and severity of humanitarian and cost of living crises are set to soar. To estimate the number of children affected by the dual crisis, Save the Children estimated the proportion of climate-affected children and poverty-affected children in 1,925 sub-national regions across 159 countries, covering 98 percent of the world's child population. A significant number of children  121 million  experiencing the double threat of high climate risk and poverty are from higher income countries, with 28 million of them living in the world's most affluent countries. More than two out of five of these children (12.3 million) live in the US or the UK. In addition, 183 million children across the globe face a triple threat  high climate risk, poverty and conflict. Out of the total child population experiencing this, those in Burundi (63 percent), Afghanistan (55 percent), and the Central African Republic (41 percent) are the worst affected. Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said, ""Across the world, inequalities are deepening the climate emergency and its impacts, most notably for children and low-income households. ""As leaders prepare to travel to the COP27 and G20 summits, they should have the rights and voices of children at the front of their minds. It is imperative that they secure ambitious outcomes, ensuring children have safe and meaningful ways to give their input in the decision-making process."" She added that the world's richest countries, whose historic emissions have driven the climate and inequality crisis, must lead the way in unlocking financing for the countries that are struggling to protect children from its impacts. This includes fixing the global debt relief system and climate financing, particularly for adaptation and loss and damage. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh200","Global solidarity needed for overcoming crises caused by Ukraine war: PM","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday called for strong political commitment and global solidarity to face the challenges caused by the Ukraine war and other overlapping crises. '.... no single country can tackle these challenges alone by itself. At this moment, what we need the most is strong political commitment and global solidarity,' she said. The prime minister said this in a statement at a Roundtable convened by UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres together with the GCRG (Global Crisis Response Group) Champions here in New York. She said the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine and other overlapping crises have left deep scars in the societies and economies, especially in developing countries. 'This has added many new challenges to our COVID recovery efforts, and SDGs implementation process,' she said. She thanked the UN Secretary General for mobilizing the UN system to respond to the crises. In this regard, she commended the work of the GCRG steering committee. The premier mentioned that the three policy briefs produced before the roundtable provided important policy directions, and all stand ready to work with other partners to advance the right policy options to emerge out of these crises. Talking about Bangladesh, she said the government has taken concrete fiscal and monetary measures to ensure macro-economic stability and control inflation. 'Our social-safety-net programs have been expanded manifold. There is targeted support for agriculture, MSMEs, and other vulnerable sectors,' she said. She also mentioned that the government has also adopted specific plans to increase the share of the renewables in the country's energy mix. Hasina shared six specific thoughts to face the challenges of the present crises. First, she said, ""we need to address the volatility of the global financial and economic outlook."" The G-7, G-20, OECD, IFIs, MDBs should now scale up efforts to address the immediate concerns, she added. 'These include lack of SDGs financing, limited fiscal space, declining ODA, and debt servicing,"" she said. Second, Sheikh Hasina commended the Secretary General for his pivotal role in the Black Sea Grain initiative. 'We commit to support any such future initiatives for keeping food production and delivery system out of the harm's way during conflicts,"" she said. 'Third, we need bold and comprehensive measures to revitalize global trade. It is imperative to ensure fair share of low and middle-income countries in global trade and export earnings.' Fourth, she said, there should be increased investments in the agriculture sector of the developing countries to enhance productivity, and for effective food storage and distribution systems. 'We need more G2G and B2B collaboration for creating new business opportunities, targeted technology support, enhanced ODA, and concessional financing,"" the PM added. Fifth, she said, ""We need to make the global architecture for climate cooperation more effective and just."" 'We should seize the opportunity of the upcoming COP-27 to address the concerns of the most vulnerable countries. We wish to work with our partners for creating necessary impetus for addressing energy security issue in a comprehensive manner.' Finally, Sheikh Hasina said, ""We do need to find ways and means to bring an amicable end to this blood-soaked disastrous crises."" The sanctions and countersanctions are deeply hurting people around the globe, more so, those in the countries at direct conflict, and those in developing and least developed world, she observed. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh201","G-20 summit could put Biden in the same room with Putin and MBS","United News of Bangladesh"," ","President Joe Biden will make a week-long, three country trip next month for a quartet of summits-including one that could potentially put him in the same room as China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Friday that Biden will first travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Nov. 11 for the COP 27 climate conference before heading to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to participate in the U.S.-ASEAN Summit of Southeast Asian leaders and the East Asia Summit. He'll then head to Bali, Indonesia for the Group of 20 summit, a gathering of leaders from most of the world's largest economies. The president's overseas travel begins just days after the pivotal midterm elections in the United States, which will determine which party controls the House and Senate. The G-20 summit could also offer Biden his first opportunity as president to meet face-to-face with his Chinese counterpart, Xi, and potentially puts him in the same room with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The prince, who often is referred to by his initials MBS, is the de facto leader of the oil rich kingdom. Putin, Xi and MBS have yet to announce their travel plans. Biden and Xi travelled together in the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents and have held several calls since Biden became president in January 2021. But the U.S.-China relationship has become increasingly fraught. The U.S. president has taken China to task for human rights abuses against the Uyghur and other ethnic minorities, squelching democracy activists' voices in Hong Kong, coercive trade practices, its military provocations against democratic, self-ruled Taiwan and differences over Russia's prosecution of its eight-month -old war against Ukraine Xi's government, meanwhile, has criticized the Biden administration's posture toward Taiwan-which Beijing looks to eventually unify with communist mainland China- as undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said earlier this week that U.S. and Chinese officials were working to arrange a meeting of the leaders but one has not yet been confirmed. Biden on Wednesday at the start of a meeting with Defense Department officials underscored the ""responsibility to manage increasingly intense competition with China.' 'We must maintain, as I said, our military advantage, but we're making it clear that we don't seek conflict,' Biden said. It's less likely that Biden would hold one-on-one meetings with Putin or MBS. The Biden administration organized the international community to hit Moscow with a barrage of sanctions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has pledged more than $40 billion in economic and military assistance to assist Ukraine and its neighbors impacted by the war. Biden and Putin held a face-to-face meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 2021, months before Russia began massing troops along Ukraine's border. They last spoke by phone in February, with Biden warning Putin that Russia would face 'severe costs' if he moved forward with the invasion. Biden announced earlier this month that there would be 'consequences' for Saudi Arabia after the Riyadh-led OPEC+ alliance moves to cut oil production. The White House also said it is reevaluating its relationship with the kingdom in light of the oil production cut that White House officials say will help Russia, another OPEC+ member, pad its coffers as it continues its nearly eight-month war in Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel separately to Bangkok, Thailand, to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders' meeting Nov. 18-19, and then visit Manila, the Philippines, the White House said. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh202","V20, G7 reach deal on protection against climate change loss","October 16, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 16 -- The Vulnerable 20 (V20) and Group of 7 (G7) will jointly launch the Global Shield Against Climate Risks at COP27 in a wider effort to accelerate pre-arranged financing at speed and scale, reports UNB. The Vulnerable 20 Group of Finance Ministers - from climate vulnerable economies - and the G7 Presidency have announced they have reached agreement on a financial protection cooperation that responds to loss and damage as a contribution to the Paris Climate Treaty. V20 Chair Ken Ofori-Atta, Finance Minister of the Republic of Ghana, and Svenja Schulze, German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, from the G7 Presidency met in Washington DC to conclude the final details of the Global Shield, according to a joint media release received from Washington DC early Saturday. The V20 membership stands at 58 economies representing some 1.5 billion people including Bangladesh. The Group of 7 (G7) consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the USA. The European Union also participates in G7 meetings. Germany took on the presidency of the Group of 7 from the United Kingdom on 1st January this year. The presidency lasts for one year. Ofori-Atta said they are pleased that the G7 Presidency of Germany has partnered with the V20 on the Global Shield Against Climate Risks. It is obvious that their socio-economic losses are compounding due to the increased severity and scale of climate-fuelled risks, said the Minister. V20's debt service payments alone are half a trillion US dollars over the next four years, and on top of that, the Group is facing inflation and currency depreciation against the dollar. Pre-arranged funding and the efficient delivery of subsidies for insurance through the V20 Trust Fund is critical to ensure that we do not increase our debt burdens. It is important to recognize that we do not ask for charity. What we need is stronger economic cooperation through Climate Prosperity Plans between the developed world and the climate vulnerable countries of the world. Schulze said climate change is already a dramatic reality and it is no longer a question of whether climate change-related loss and damage will happen, it is only how often it will occur - and how fierce and how expensive it is, and most importantly, who is affected most. ""To stop the climate crisis from becoming worse, we need to drive global climate action with even greater commitment,"" said Schulze. ""This includes that we must acknowledge that there is climate-related loss and damage and that the most vulnerable countries, in particular, need our solidarity in dealing with it,"" said the German Minister. ""This is where we want to build bridges for the upcoming global climate conference in Egypt by putting forward concrete solutions. The world needs concrete action more than words in order to deal with loss and damage,"" Schulze said. Together with the most vulnerable developing countries, Schulze said, they have taken a big step in this regard. ""The decision to build together a Global Shield against Climate Risks will offer millions of vulnerable and poor people financial and social protection after climate disasters."" The Global Shield includes the following: Strengthened coordination within the global climate and disaster risk finance and insurance (CDRFI) architecture across G7, V20 and other climate vulnerable economies to ensure coherence of different institutions' and donors' efforts at the global, regional and national level. A global, flexible, and collaborative financing structure to mobilise and pool respective donor and other funds and enable a more systematic global approach to closing protection gaps. Sustained protection in the face of increasing climate risks by scaling up existing successful CDRFI programmes, including social protection schemes, and preparing country-specific, needs-based CDRFI support packages, including the scaling up of smart premium and capital support to address affordability barriers. The Global Shield builds on the InsuResilience Global Partnership which the V20 and G20 previously introduced with a goal of insuring 500 million people in climate vulnerable countries by 2025. The Global Shield is a wider approach that encompasses an acceleration of these efforts including social protection schemes, with V20 and G7 members. Formed in 2015, the V20 Group of Finance Ministers is a dedicated cooperation of economies systematically vulnerable to climate change. Currently chaired by the Republic of Ghana, V20 Group members are also states of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF).

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh203","Reforestation could boost water security in vulnerable regions in the Asia-Pacific: Study","November 15, 2022 Tuesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 15 SINGAPORE(The Straits Times/ANN)  Planting up forests can help soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but a new study has shown that reforestation efforts could also boost water security for some regions in the Asia-Pacific. If all areas suitable for forest growth in the Asia-Pacific were planted up, rainfall would go up in four of the 15 water-stressed regions, found the study led by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. The researchers considered areas which can support the growth of forests. These exclude grasslands and savannas, as well as spaces used by humans, such as cropland and densely populated rural areas. Based on this, about 276 million ha of land in the Asia-Pacific  more than 10 times the size of Britain  are suitable for reforestation, the study determined. Of the four dry areas that could benefit from more rainfall due to regional reforestation, three are in China  the Loess Plateau-North China Plain, Yangtze Plain and South-east China. The Irrawaddy river basin, which lies mainly in Myanmar but also spans parts of China and India, would also benefit from increased rainfall. But other parts of the Asia-Pacific could potentially suffer from a decline in total annual rainfall, the study's lead author Teo Hoong Chen said. The findings of the study, which analysed models that looked at the interaction between land use and atmospheric moisture, showed that of the 15 regions, east Australia could potentially suffer from a decline in annual rainfall from regional reforestation. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of reforestation on the region's water cycle, said Mr Teo, a PhD candidate at the NUS centre. ""Reforestation is emerging as one of the most attractive solutions to tackling climate change, and can also offer many other co-benefits, such as biodiversity conservation,"" he said. ""But reforestation could have far more complex impacts on the regional water balance."" This is because forests are both consumers and suppliers of water, Mr Teo added. As water consumers, these habitats draw in water from the soil through their roots and release it into the atmosphere through the process of evapotranspiration, which occurs when trees release water vapour through their leaves. When forests release water into the atmosphere, they help to increase the humidity in the air. This stimulates the formation of rain clouds, either over the forest basin or elsewhere, since air moisture could be transported over long distances by winds. For instance, models used in the study showed that the Loess Plateau  North China Plain could benefit from moisture carried from reforestation in south-west China and the Yangtze Plain in summer. Even through winter, when winds blowing from the cooler northern regions move moisture-laden air away from the plain, there is still an overall increase in annual rainfall, the study found. Mr Teo said that in India and China, monsoon winds in the summer transport moisture from the oceans over large tracts of land. This means that inland areas enjoy less rainfall than places closer to the sea, and could benefit from more moisture brought about by reforestation, he added. However, the study finding that the Irrawaddy region in South-east Asia could benefit from increased rainfall was surprising. ""Mainland South-east Asia isn't such a large land mass, yet there is some increase in precipitation,"" said Mr Teo. Professor Koh Lian Pin, who is director of the NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, said the findings showed that nature-based solutions such as reforestation could do more than just help draw down planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Past research from the centre had shown that healthy forests could also boost agricultural yields of nearby farms, improve water quality for surrounding settlements and help with biodiversity conservation, he added. Prof Koh added: ""There is considerable potential for more research into reforestation as a transboundary nature-based solution for climate mitigation, as well as for water and food security."" Water security is an issue that is being discussed at the United Nations climate summit COP27 on Monday, which was designated by host country Egypt as Water Day. Discussions will cover issues related to sustainable water resource management, including water scarcity, drought, cross-boundary cooperation and improvement of early warning systems.

""The indigenous communities in the CHT have led impressive efforts to preserve and rehabilitate forests and their natural habitat. Climate change has made their work even more vital,' Lewis said on Thursday. The RC also said that the visit provided her with a scope to familiarise herself with the region, listen to the concerns of women and adolescents and visit a range of different programs. 'UN and Partners' support in CHT must be inclusive and in line with Agenda 2030's promise of leaving no one behind to achieve a concerted, effective and sustainable development of the Chittagong Hill Tracts,' she added. The week-long visit from November 13 to November 17 covered the hill districts of Khagrachhari and Rangamati. The delegation included UN Resident Coordinator Gwyn Lewis, EU Ambassador Charles Whiteley, UK High Commissioner Robert Chatterton Dickson and Norway Ambassador Espen Rikter-Svendsen. UNDP Resident Representative Stefan Liller, UNFPA Country Representative Kristine Blokhus, FAO Country Representative Robert Simpson and UNICEF Country Representative Sheldon Yett were also in the delegation. EU Ambassador Charles Whiteley said the European Union has been a staunch supporter of the UN's development work in this region.

The envoys met Khagrachhari and Rangamati Hill District Councils Chairmen and Deputy Commissioners, Mong and Chakma Circle Chiefs, women leaders, environmental NGOs and the CHT Development Board. The delegation also listened to diverse community members' stories, challenges and recommendations while visiting various UN programs. One of the many highlights was their visit to the solar power-based safe water supply facilities and the provision of safe drinking water during crises at Jurachari Upazila of Rangamati District. The initiative was recently awarded the Local Adaptation Champions Award at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. Another was listening to the achievements of women entrepreneurs in the region. Greater involvement of women in the development of CHT will strengthen economic growth and build the resilience of families. 'We are addressing the issue of water scarcity by protecting and restoring forests and by using renewable energy to supply clean water in marginalized communities,' said Stefan Liller, Resident Representative of UNDP Bangladesh, after visiting the water supply facility. 'The people of the Hills face many challenges, including access to education, healthcare, livelihoods and water, coupled with increasing impacts of climate change. We have worked extensively in the Hill Tracts since the signing of the Peace Accords, and we will continue to stand by the people here,' he added. 'Children must be at the centre of our work in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Investing in children's well-being today and in their future is not just the right thing to do; it will ultimately benefit all of Bangladesh,' said Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative to Bangladesh. UNFPA Representative Kristine Blokhus said, 'women in CHT face serious challenges due to remoteness and lack of access to health services. To ensure every pregnancy is wanted and every childbirth is safe, as the lead UN agency for reproductive health and rights, UNFPA provides integrated sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence support to the government health system. This includes deploying midwives and other specialist personnel to health facilities and connecting them with local communities.' FAO Representative in Bangladesh Robert D. Simpson stressed the importance of agriculture in the region and its potential to drive development. LDC Graduation: Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Nepal join UN-led exchange on smooth transition He said, ""The majority of people living in CHT depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and food and nutrition security. The region has great potential to develop the production of high-value crops such as coffee, mango, and pineapple, which would raise families' incomes, but development must be managed well in order to deliver equitable economic growth and protection for the environment."" The mission ended on November 17 with a promise to further strengthen the work with the government of Bangladesh to achieve prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Chittagong Hill Tracts, leaving no one behind. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh205","Shamsul urges major carbon emitters to meet mitigation targets","October 5, 2022 Wednesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 5 -- Minister for Planning Dr Shamsul Alam on Tuesday urged the major global carbon emitters to meet their mitigation targets aiming to help address the adverse impacts of climate change. ""This is high time the major emitters met the mitigations target swiftly,"" he told the inaugural session of a seminar here, reports BSS. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) organised the hybrid seminar on ""Climate Diplomacy: Constraints and Choices for Bangladesh"" at its auditorium. Speaking as the chief guest, Shamsul said Bangladesh is a significant player in global climate diplomacy. ""During the presidency of CVF (Climate Vulnerable Forum), Bangladesh emerged as a legitimate voice in the climate change negotiations under the skilled leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,"" he said. The state minister said the country has launched the ""Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan"" with the aim to put her on a journey from climate vulnerability to resilience to climate prosperity. It is indeed one of the landmark policy guidelines for climate vulnerable countries, he said, adding that Bangladesh firmly believes that climate change is a security issue and it must be discussed at a regular interval at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Shamsul said the strict implementation of Paris Agreement is necessary to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Besides, he said, the issue of loss and damage must be addressed with utmost importance. Saleemul Huq, Director of International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), said: ""We need to understand and take into account that the COP, which only takes place once a year, is no longer the only place where climate diplomacy occurs. Indeed, he said, every diplomat in Bangladesh embassies across the world now needs to make efforts to tackle climate change as a core issue of bilateral discussion. BIISS Chairman Ambassador Kazi Imtiaz Hossain said climate diplomacy has become a necessity. ""Like many other countries, Bangladesh is also enhancing endeavours in this field,"" he said. For example, at national levels, the 8th Five Year Plan, the Perspective Plan to 2040, and the BDP 2100-all incorporate addressing climate change issues as a key priority, the BIISS chairman said. However, he said, there still remains much to do at regional and global levels for Bangladesh. In his welcome address, Acting Director General of BIISS Colonel MA Saadi said both human actions and inactions are creating planetary crises like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Bangladesh, as one of the most climate vulnerable countries, is actively pursuing the cause of environmental justice in international forums, he said. Moreover, Saadi said, the country has led the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and has been an exemplary model by translating its vulnerability into resilience through different climate actions and diplomatic efforts. He said the fundamental bases of Bangladesh's climate diplomacy are: adhering to multilateralism in climate policy, accelerating domestic action and raising global ambition, and enhancing international climate cooperation through advocacy and outreach. The working session of the seminar was chaired by former Foreign Secretary Ambassador Shamsher M Chowdhury. Four presentations were deliberated in the working session. Professor Mizan R Khan, Deputy Director, ICCCAD, made a presentation on ""Financing for Loss and Damage: Concerns for Bangladesh"", while Arif M Faisal, Programme Specialist (Nature, Climate and Energy), UNDP Bangladesh, on ""Role of International Organization in Climate Diplomacy"". Mirza Shawkat Ali, Director, Climate Change and International Convention, Department of Environment, made a presentation on ""Major Outcomes of COP 26 and Issues of COP 27 : Bangladesh Perspective"" while Dr Sufia Khanom, Senior Research Fellow, BIISS, on ""Bangladesh Leadership in Climate Change Negotiations: An Assessment"".

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh206","Climate-induced migration poses security risks for Bangladesh, says Momen","July 25, 2022 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, July 25 -- Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has warned that climate-induced migration poses grave security risks that may go beyond national borders. ""We remain sensitised to the fact that climate-induced forced migration can pose serious security risks with spill-over effects beyond national borders,"" he said seeking united and urgent action on climate migration. The event aimed at bringing together all stakeholders for identifying potential avenues for Bangladesh to contribute further to advance the global agenda on climate change-migration nexus in the lead-up to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November this year, reports UNB. It was jointly organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The dialogue served as a forum to voice the different perspectives from the government, civil society, private sector, and international community, as well as the media. During the last COP26 in Glasgow, Momen said, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged for a global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants, displaced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and draughts. As a champion country of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration (GCM), the foreign minister said, Bangladesh believes that the plight of millions of climate induced migrants must be placed at the centre of migration and climate change discourses. including in a gender-responsive and child-sensitive manner. Overall, the number of Bangladeshis displaced by the impacts of climate change could reach 13.3 million by 2050, making it the country's number-one driver of internal migration, according to the World Bank. Such displacement, Momen said, is creating a heavy burden on Dhaka and other major cities of the country. On top of that, Bangladesh is hosting 1.2 million forcibly displaced Rohingya from Myanmar at the cost of massive environmental loss and ecological damage in Cox's Bazar. ""Our government is countenancing these twin displacement challenges, while also accelerating the trajectory of our socio-economic development,"" he said. Momen warned that international community cannot afford to remain oblivious to issue of climate migrants. He said due to relentless diplomatic efforts of Bangladesh, the international community is gradually opening up to the crucial issue of creating additional financing mechanisms for climate-generated loss and damage. Opening the policy dialogue, Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen highlighted the various initiatives taken by Bangladesh to raise the issue of climate induced migrants globally. ""Vulnerable countries like Bangladesh need adequate finance and technology to respond to climate change related challenges,"" he emphasized. Chair of the parliamentary standing committee on the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and honourary president of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Saber Hossain Chowdhury said concerted action on climate change mitigation and adaptation, together with inclusive development policies and embedding climate migration into policy and planning could help to address climate migration. Caroline Dumas, Special Envoy for Migration and Climate Action, IOM, delivered a keynote address on 'Global and Regional Consultative Processes and Policy Frameworks,' while Golam Rabbani, Head of Secretariat, Climate Bridge Fund, shared a detailed overview on 'Human Mobility in the Context of Sudden and Slow-Onset Events and the Adverse Effects of Climate Change in Bangladesh'. Joining the discussion, IOM's Deputy Director General for Operations Ugochi Daniels said IOM is strongly committed to develop solutions for people impacted by climate change, including people on the move, people seeking to move and those seeking to stay. UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Gwyn Lewis said climate migration issues feature strongly in Bangladesh's United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026 and the UN family remains committed to support the Government of Bangladesh to deal with the adverse effects of climate change. Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change Farhina Ahmed, Director, International Center for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) Saleemul Haque, Head of the Secretariat, Platform on Disaster Displacement Atle Solberg, Programme Specialist at UN Women Dilruba Haider also spoke at the event. At the closing session, IOM Bangladesh's Chief of Mission Abdusattor Esoev reiterated IOM's commitment to continue to work with the government of Bangladesh and all other key stakeholders on climate migration.

'Seven member states other than Egypt have ratified the D-8 PTA. You will be happy to know that Egypt has announced at this meeting that they will soon ratify the D-8 PTA,' said Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen while briefing the media on the outcome of the D-8 Ministerial meeting at a city hotel on Wednesday. The volume of intra-trade among the D-8 member states at the time of establishment was $14 billion, which has now reached $129 billion. 'My hope is that within the next 10 years our intra trade will increase by 10 times. That's my hope. There is no reason that we can't achieve it,' Momen said. While talking to UNB, D-8 Secretary General Ambassador Isiaka Abdulqadir Imam said the D-8 PTA is already there and they just need to make it operational. 'We hope it will become operational by October this year.' Foreign Minister Momen said the process of finalization of the draft 'Trade Facilitation Strategy' is underway with a view to speedy implementation of the D-8 PTA. The issue was reviewed in the ministerial meeting and it is expected that this draft Trade Facilitation Strategy will be accepted in the 3rd Trade Ministers meeting to be held in Bangladesh soon, he said. D-8 PTA likely to be operational this year to boost intra-trade Read: Hasina offers Bangladesh land for setting up D-8 economic zone Momen talked about tariff barriers and hoped that those barriers will be removed to help boost trade among the member countries. Responding to a question on inclusion of new members, the foreign minister said there has been discussion on Azerbaijan's inclusion and there was no objection from any country. 'But we have to develop the procedures for inclusion of new members.' The Foreign Minister said Bangladesh will remain chair of the D-8 for another year as Egypt will remain busy with Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ). 'They (Egypt) made a special request. We have no objection. Other member states also agreed. This is good news for us,' he said. The foreign minister said the D-8 energy ministers' meeting will be held soon but the date is yet to be fixed. Director General (International Organizations wing) Wahida Ahmed and DG (Public Diplomacy wing) Toufique Hasan were also present. D-8, also known as Developing-8, is an organization for development cooperation among Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh208","World heritage engulfed by Sahara Desert sand in global warming","August 29, 2022 Monday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Aug. 29 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)- The Japan-led Eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD8), is being held in Tunisia to discuss Africa's development challenges, one of its main themes. The two-day conference started Saturday. There is a high expectation for Japan, which has decarbonization and other technologies, to play a role in avoiding a worst-case scenario in Africa. CHINGUETTI, Mauritania  Having survived as a trading center for more than 1,000 years, this ancient city registered as a World Heritage site is being steadily engulfed by the Sahara Desert. ""The city may soon disappear,"" said Salem Youma, 49, who was mending the wall of his house on the outskirts of the old city. Beside him, a young relative was shoveling away a sand pile more than 2 meters high. Chinguetti, including the surrounding areas, is home to about 5,000 people these days, having lost more than half of its population in about 10 years. The expansion of the desert is the prime factor for its population loss. There had been no rain here for 11 years until June this year. Measures such as planting date palms and other means have not been successful in halting the desertification. Residents have been abandoning their homes and leaving the city one after another. The Sahara Desert in northern Africa has expanded by 10% in the last 100 years. Besides the over-cutting of trees, climate change is considered one of the factors contributing to the expansion of the desert. The sand gains momentum year after year, also in Chinguetti. ""It is my birthplace, so I want to continue living here. But I wonder if I can win the battle against the sand,"" Youma said anxiously. Great Green Wall On the outskirts of Rosso in southern Mauritania, saplings of trees that are resistant to drought and can grow in sandy soil are being planted over an area of 10 hectares. ""The sandy soil was coming closer and closer to our village. I hope more trees will be planted so that we will be able to feel safe soon,"" said farmer Bekaye Mohamad, 45. Eleven countries, including Mauritania, began a project in 2007 to build a Great Green Wall of trees stretching about 8,000 kilometers as part of efforts to stop the expansion of the Sahara. The project aims to restore vegetation to an area of 100 million hectares by 2030. Carbon dioxide emissions in Africa account for only about 4% of the global total. Yet the effects of droughts and floods are enormous, with Asia, Europe and the United States passing the burden on to Africa. More than 216 million people could be forced to move within their countries by 2050 due to climate change, according to a 2021 report by the World Bank. Given that Africa accounts for almost half of the total at 105 million people, there is concern that this could increase the number of refugees and trigger new conflicts. Abnormal weather has also caused widespread damage. Although there is no known cause-and-effect relationship with climate change, record flooding has occurred in South Sudan, and Angola is in a severe drought, with more than 1.5 million people facing a food crisis. Progress on the Great Green Wall project, which is considered to be one of the main measures, has only reached about 20%, due to financial difficulties and inadequate management. Mauritania needs more support from the international community, said Alioin Fall, coordinator in charge of climate change at Mauritania's Environment Ministry. Rising sea levels A threat is also coming from the sea. Egypt, which will host the U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November, is striving hard to combat erosion that is becoming stronger every year. In northern Egypt's Alexandria, there have been reports of stores along the seafront being inundated, and the construction of barriers is underway in areas such as around the Qaitbay Fort, a famous tourist attraction. Abbas Sharaqqy, a professor at Cairo University and an expert on climate change issues, said it is important that the world's major powers take the lead in reducing the use of fossil fuels more and stopping global warming. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"

ISLAMABAD: As the number of cross-border attacks targeting security forces from Afghanistan increases, Foreign Office on Thursday said Pakistan was holding discussions to sort out the issues. Addressing the weekly press briefing, FO Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch agreed that there were issues at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. ""The two sides are holding regular border flag meetings and are engaged in discussion at various levels, including Kharlachi Border Crossing Point,"" Ms Baloch told reporters. She said the Chaman border was reopened on Monday following Border Flag Meetings between the two sides. The focus of these meetings was to clear pedestrian, traffic and trade consignments, she added. The 'Friendship Gate' at the border was closed on Nov 13 after an armed man from the Afghan side opened fire on Pakistani security personnel, resulting in the martyrdom of one soldier. Ms Baloch said Afghanistan has communicated its ""serious regret"" over the incident and constituted a high-level committee comprising officials from foreign and border and tribal affairs ministries, local chambers of commerce and tribal elders to investigate the incident. ""We continue to engage with the Afghan side through our embassy in Afghanistan and the Afghan embassy in Islamabad"". PM's Turkiye visit Briefing about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's upcoming visit to Turkiye, the spokesperson said it was ""taking place as planned"". The prime minister will visit the country for a two-day trip on Friday at the invitation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy fraternal ties deeply embedded in commonalities of faith, culture and history and underpinned by exceptional cordiality and mutual trust,"" she said. The two leaders will inaugurate PNS Khaibar, a MILGEM Corvette Ships of the Pakistan Navy at the Istanbul Shipyard, she told the reporters. The contract for four Milgem class corvettes for the Pakistan Navy, with concurrent Transfer of Technology, was signed with ASFAT Inc, a Turkish state-owned Defence contractor firm in 2018. The MILGEM project, a joint collaboration between the two countries, represents a ""significant milestone"" in the Pakistan-Turkiye strategic partnership, she remarked. The two leaders will also hold wide-ranging discussions on the regional situation and other issues, she added. The prime minister will also interact with the Turkish business community. Pakistan rejects India's remarks Ms Baloch also said Pakistan rejects India's unwarranted remarks at a Security Council briefing. ""Unfortunately, India continues to abuse its non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council and the Chair of the 1373 Counter-Terrorism Committee to target Pakistan through false narratives and malicious propaganda"", she noted. She said India's irresponsible behaviour confirmed that it ""neither has the competence nor the wisdom"" to qualify as a permanent member of the Security Council. She also censured India for its ""blatant human rights violations"" in held Kashmir. ""We have not seen any improvement in the situation in [held Kashmir] as it remains under military siege and Indian oppression there continues unabated."" About the recent decision to establish the 'Loss and Damage Fund' at the COP-27 , Ms Baloch said the parties also agreed to establish a transitional committee for recommendations to operationalise the Fund and determine its terms of reference for new funding arrangements and disbursement mechanism. ""Once these details are ironed out, we will be able to predict the future funding situation"", she said. When reporters asked about the reasons behind the delay in the appointment of a new foreign secretary, Ms Baloch said: ""This is a decision taken at a very senior level. What I can share with you is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is continuing to perform its functions to the best of its abilities as we have always done in the past.""

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh211","Climate change much deadlier than cancer in some places, UNDP data shows","November 5, 2022 Saturday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- The impact of climate change on health could be up to twice as deadly as cancer in some parts of the world if carbon emissions remain high, according to new data released on Friday by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Climate Impact Lab. The study gives the example of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where under a scenario of very high emissions by 2100, additional deaths due to climate change could rise to nearly twice the country's current annual death rate from all cancers, and 10 times its annual road traffic fatalities. ""Because of human action, the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is reaching dangerous levels, driving Earth's temperatures higher and amplifying the frequency or intensity of extreme events"", says the newly-launched Human Climate Horizons platform. The data shows climate change will further exacerbate inequalities, and uneven development without concerted and urgent action. The UN News published a report on Friday pointing out the following topics that were highlighted in the newly-launched data: Mortality impacts Building on the analyses of 2020, 2021 and 2022 Human Development Reports - and fed by an evolving stream of frontier research - the data shows how climate change can impact people's lives - from mortality to livelihoods, and energy use. Although higher temperatures and a warmer climate put cardiovascular and respiratory systems under stress everywhere, outcomes will vary between places, according to communities that have the resources to adapt and those that do not. The data shows that climate change could increase mortality rates in Faisalabad, Pakistan by near 67 deaths per 100,000 population - causing more fatalities than strokes, the country's third leading cause of death. Rising temps Since the late 19th century, the earth's average temperature has risen by nearly 1.2degC, changing the entire surface area of the planet, according to the research. However, billions live in regions that have already experienced warming greater than the global average. As an example, the platform pointed to Maracaibo, Venezuela, noting that in the 1990s it averaged 62 annual days with temperatures exceeding 35degC. However, by mid-century, that number will likely soar to 201 days. Energy impacts Electricity availability and fuels used to generate it to power air conditioners and heaters, play a crucial role in our ability to cope with extreme temperatures, said UNDP. Yet, the impacts of climate change on energy use will vary locally, as individuals, communities and businesses adapt to conditions using available resources. In Jakarta, for example, electricity consumption in response to warmer temperatures is projected to increase by roughly one-third of current household consumption in Indonesia. This will require critical additional infrastructure planning. Labour impacts More frequent and severe temperature extremes also impact livelihoods, affecting the ability to perform tasks and influencing work intensity and duration. ""The impact of climate change differs across sectors of the economy with workers in high-risk, weather-exposed industries like agriculture, construction, mining and manufacturing most affected"", according to platform data. In Niamey, Niger, in sectors such as construction, mining and manufacturing, excessive heat was responsible for 36 fewer working hours annually, taking a 2.5 per cent toll on the country's future GDP. Human consequences As the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed globally, they will generate a significant uptick in inequalities over the coming years and decades. But by highlighting that the future is not predetermined, UNDP hopes the information can empower people everywhere, to step up climate action. The Human Climate Horizons mission is to ensure equal access to data on future impacts, inform decision-making and help everyone understand the human consequences of climate change in different scenarios. 'Logical economic choice' Meanwhile, UNDP has also launched the How Just Transition Can Deliver the Paris Agreement report this week, highlighting the need to embrace the ""green revolution"" - or risk increasing social inequality, civil unrest, economic loss. Ahead of the UN climate conference, COP27 , which kicks off on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the report spotlights the importance of ""fair and equitable"" transitioning to meeting the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. From providing workers with new green economy skills and access to social protection to ensuring that countries lay out a clear pathway to a net-zero future, UNDP chief Achim Steiner said the report provides ""real-world insights into how to accelerate momentum around a just transition that is fair and equitable for the energy sector and beyond"". A just transition The report analyses both enhanced short-term climate pledges, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and long-term strategies in which countries lay out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. ""As climate change intensifies and the world faces an immense energy crunch.decoupling from fossil fuels and investing in the green energy infrastructure of tomorrow.[is] the only logical economic choice"", said Mr. Steiner.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh212","Climate-hit businesses pin hopes on Bangladesh's new plan to adapt","October 9, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 9 -- Khaleda Sultana's small workshop in Dhaka, where she makes homeware and handicrafts from jute and other plant fibres, is far from the coastal areas of Bangladesh that are struggling to cope with rising seas and powerful storms, Thomson Reuters Foundation reports. But, she says, her business still needs to adapt to worsening climate change impacts. ""I have to count losses when the coasts are flooded and my remote subcontractor workers there have to go looking for shelter, or when rainfall becomes irregular and it affects the quality of fibre that we use,"" Sultana said. The question of how to withstand more extreme weather and encroaching oceans is growing increasingly urgent for many Bangladeshis - from those living on disappearing delta islands to migrants in city slums - as the planet's climate heats up. It is a challenge the government hopes to tackle with its first National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which is set to be approved by the cabinet in the run-up to November's COP27 UN climate change conference in Egypt. ""Bangladesh has been a pioneer in climate strategy among the developing countries,"" said Ahmmed Zulfiqar Rahaman, a climate expert with the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) who helped draft the plan. The country was widely applauded for its earlier national climate change strategy in 2009, which was financed through a dedicated national climate fund, the first of its kind set up by a member of the UN-defined Least Developed Countries group. SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLING A study by the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, published in May, showed rural families in Bangladesh use a large chunk of their budgets to protect themselves from climate change, especially households led by women, who allocate up to 30% of their spending for that purpose. Measures that rural Bangladeshis commonly invest in include raising the plinth of their home above flood-water levels, planting trees and making shelters to keep livestock safe. Climate and aid experts said many affected families do not receive adequate support during and after natural disasters. Shingraj, a factory worker in the eastern city of Sylhet who goes by one name, said he and his brother struggled to cope when flooding hit their home in June. Erosion is one of the multiple risks at play in Bangladesh as the country sits on the frontlines in the battle against climate change. ""We did not receive any aid, being located in a remote corner of the country, and we could not go to work either as long as our locality was inundated,"" he said. In an effort to make sure the NAP will help people like Shingraj, experts held a series of workshops to talk to local government representatives, businesses and citizens, said Dwijen Mallick at the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, one of the key experts who drafted the document. Business owners said the government should ensure adaptation efforts help Bangladesh's roughly 8 million mainly small and medium businesses, which have received little support so far. Md. Abul Hasan, managing director of a textile factory in Khulna, said rising seas are contaminating agricultural land along the coast with saltwater, which is hurting fabric quality. A government initiative to supply clean river water to places affected by salinity is commendable, he added, but it has not reached many smaller businesses, including his own. ""We need huge investment from the government to create alternative employment as salinity erodes agricultural productivity,"" he noted. CLIMATE INTERVENTIONS Bangladesh's new plan identifies more than 110 adaptation measures to tackle climate stresses such as cyclones, floods, droughts, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion, said Rahaman of the CEGIS. It requires an estimated investment of $230 billion between 2023 and 2050 - seven times more than the country is spending on its national climate change strategy now, according to Rahaman. The bulk of the funding is expected to come from global climate finance pools, such as the Green Climate Fund, as well as international aid, with Bangladesh's government and private sector making up the balance, he added. The plan seeks to protect 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) of cropland from floods by better maintaining dikes and polders - land surrounded by embankments - and improving water management. Urban areas will be bolstered against climate disasters with city-level efforts that include more robust infrastructure design and updated drainage systems. According to the World Bank Group, by 2050, climate change impacts could force up to 19.9 million Bangladeshis to flee their homes and move to another part of the country. To avoid such mass migration, the NAP outlines interventions for reducing climate risks to vulnerable communities - such as those living in urban slums - and creating alternative livelihoods for the people who are hardest hit. Jute producer Sultana said to make these efforts effective, the government needs to strengthen policies to assist smaller businesses, for example, by making it easier and simpler to get loan approvals and other financial services. But for Sohanur Rahman, executive coordinator of YouthNet for Climate Justice, a local activist group, the key to the new plan's success lies with Bangladesh's young people. Youth activists were consulted during the formulation of the NAP, and the draft makes a commitment to engage young people in the country's efforts to adapt to climate change, Rahman said. But unless that happens in practice, ""the plan will not bear fruit"", he warned. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh213","Middle East should not pay for Bidens cheap oil","November 21, 2022 Monday","Weekly Blitz","Bangladesh, Nov. 21 -- Biden is catering to his donors desire to have it both ways: lots of oil and cheap gas, without any messy environmental consequences. Writes Jason D. Greenblatt US President Joe Biden flew all the way to Egypt last week to attend a conference on protecting the environment, and yet his message to oil-producing nations is that the environment in their countries does not matter. COP27 , and his statements back home about no more oil production on our shores. For many years, developing nations have demanded compensation from industrialized countries for the losses and damage caused by climate change. These are known as &#8220;loss and damage&#8221; payments. The US and EU nations, with the exception of Denmark, had until this month rejected these claims. While Biden himself has not yet agreed to loss and damage payments, the Biden administrations climate czar, John Kerry, has agreed to discuss the concept. While Kerry is considering ways to give away more US taxpayer money &#8212; funds that are desperately needed here in the US &#8212; Biden continues to push Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other oil producers to increase their output, so that American voters will not blame him for high gasoline prices when they go to fill up their SUVs. At the same time, Biden is catering to his virtue signaling Democratic Party, banning fracking, canceling oil pipelines and other anti-oil proclamations here in the US, at the cost of American jobs and American energy self-sufficiency. Though, in the run-up to the midterm elections, the White House claimed it was pushing US oil companies to produce more oil, that message rang false and seemed designed to deflect blame from voters for obscenely high prices at the pump. Let us remember that, almost as soon as he was sworn in, Biden issued an executive order pausing oil and gas leasing on federal lands to make good on his campaign promise to reduce oil production. When Biden was running for office, he said there would be &#8220;no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period. Ends.&#8221; Why Democrats are so intent on harming the US economy by taking away jobs has never been made clear. Let me take this opportunity to introduce two American acronyms to the readers of Arab News. They are NIMBY and BANANA. NIMBY stands for &#8220;Not In My Backyard&#8221; and BANANA stands for &#8220;Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything.&#8221; The phrases come into play whenever something unappealing has been proposed for a location and the people who live or work there have the power to stop it. The threat might be low-cost housing in a wealthy neighborhood, where the rich people do not want to have to rub shoulders with the poor. It might be turning a wooded area into a shopping mall, thus surrendering an attractive part of the region so that a few people can make money. Or it might be something that negatively affects the environment, like, say, drilling for oil. The president wants America to have cheap oil, or at least cheaper oil, and plenty of it. But he wants Gulf nations, far from American shores, to suffer the environmental consequences of extracting oil from the ground, refining it and shipping it to the US. Biden is catering to his donors desire to have it both ways: lots of oil and cheap gas, without any messy environmental consequences. Let Saudi Arabia and the UAE pay that price, he is saying. You can sum up his position with these two acronyms: NIMBY and BANANA. Extracting oil from the ground? Not in our backyard. Expanding refinery capacity? Build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything in the US. The president must assume that these countries are so hungry for money that they will enable his vision of an America that is at once environmentally sound and benefiting from gasoline at $3 a gallon. Biden is banking on the idea that Arab leaders will say, &#8220;Sure, we will do the dirty work for you at the low, non-market price you demand.&#8221; As long as Bidens limousine liberals are happy, then he is happy. And limousines need a lot of gasoline to get where they are going. Biden is essentially telling OPEC+ countries: &#8220;Sacrifice your environment so Westerners can pretend we are not the cause of the negative impact on the environment caused by oil. You guys handle the dirty work and well cut you a check.&#8221; That is NIMBY and BANANA at its finest. Will OPEC+ countries now line up for the loss and damage payments? Just how big a check is Kerry prepared to have the US Treasury write to nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, since these and other OPEC+ countries are doing our dirty work? The dirty work that Biden is reducing and aiming to no longer allow in the US. Enough to pay for the environmental damage that will follow, as Biden makes oil affordable for his supporters and, as he pretends, helps the environment? All he is really doing is sweeping the pollution under the rug. The overall problem with the environmentalist movement is its sheer hypocrisy. Look at Al Gore, flying in private jets to events where he complains about how we are trashing the environment while flying private. He will tell you that he is buying carbon offsets. Please, Al, if you really want to protect the environment, stay home. Have you not heard of Zoom? Progressives in Bidens camp are unwilling to allow Americans to drill for oil on American soil. But once you get out of the country, anything goes. If all goes according to Kerrys plan, do not be surprised if US taxpayers are soon subsidizing the ravaging of the environments of OPEC+ nations. NIMBY? BANANA? If you are in the UAE, Saudi Arabia or any other OPEC+ nation where oil flows, you better believe it. Jason D.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh214","Climate change: 'Unprecedented' economic transformation now needed","October 28, 2022 Friday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 28 -- At the UN COP26 climate summit last year, nations agreed to make more ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and boost efforts to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. But a year on, only 24 countries out of more than 190 have presented new or updated pledges ahead of COP27 in Egypt next month. Even these revised plans fall well short of the cuts to planet-heating emissions needed by 2030, according to a UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report released on Thursday, Reuters reports. UNEP said an ""unprecedented"" transformation of the global economy is needed to achieve the 2015 Paris climate agreement target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. ""We've barely scratched the surface of climate action, and you could argue that we've procrastinated this year away,"" Inger Andersen, UNEP's executive director, said on Thursday at the Thomson Reuters Foundation's annual Trust Conference. ""It is a dismal picture,"" she said. Current climate policies are projected to result in global warming of 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, or around 2.5 degrees C if the updated climate pledges are implemented, the report said. The report said ""systemic"" changes are needed - from the buildings people live in to the food and energy they consume - to achieve a ""rapid"" shift towards greener economies. UN chief Antonio Guterres told the BBC in an interview this week that the world ""will be doomed"" if countries keep putting climate change ""on the back burner"". Even if countries fulfill their current climate commitments, global emissions will rise by 10.6 per cent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, according to a separate UN report on Wednesday. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said a 43% reduction in emissions by 2030 is needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial temperatures. Despite how far behind countries are from cutting emissions to the extent that is required, people should not conclude that all is lost, said Anne Olhoff, a co-author of the separate UNEP report released Thursday. She said that instead of focusing on the ""doomsday"" scenarios, more time should be spent considering the potential benefits of green policies such as breathing cleaner air or paying lower energy bills once renewable power systems are in place. ""If I look at a net zero emission future, it actually looks much brighter than the current reality in many ways,"" Olhoff said in an interview. 'SYSTEMIC' CHANGE To achieve the unprecedented emissions cuts and economic transformation required, investments of $4-$6 trillion a year will be needed, in everything from renewable electricity to zero-carbon transport, the report said. ""It's a huge number, but if you put it in perspective of total investments it's actually not that big,"" Olhoff said. The investment needed is equal to around 1.5-2% of total financial assets managed, according to UNEP. To shift the money, the report said, reforms are needed, such as putting a price on carbon and making climate risks clearer in decision making. It said that the global electricity supply is the most advanced sector in shifting to net zero as the costs of renewables fall, but emissions in other parts of the global economy will be more difficult to cut. Another shift which may be harder to achieve is changing what people consume, especially food, according to the report. The global food system is responsible for one third of emissions, and the report said these emissions are projected to almost double by 2050 with current practices as populations and demand for meat and dairy products grow. Some of the most significant changes needed, such as a drop in meat consumption to lower agricultural emissions, require changes in people's lifestyles, UNEP said. Olhoff said there are some ""positive signs"" that diets are changing, but nowhere near the scale needed. People will be more encouraged to make these changes if the can clearly see financial savings and health benefits, particularly in richer countries where the carbon footprint of food consumed and food waste are a huge priority. URGENT ACTION Recognising the multiple crises facing governments - from energy prices to the cost of living - the report calls on them to accelerate decarbonisation instead of allowing the myriad challenges to ""divert attention"" from climate action. Olhoff said the ""massive implications"" of climate change - including growing disasters and financial losses - are more apparent than they were even a few years ago, making it clearer for policymakers that they need to act. The report emphasised how huge shifts in infrastructure investment are needed now so that carbon emissions are not locked in for decades. Many buildings last 80 years on average, for example, while coal-fired power plants run for 45 years, it said, meaning investments in in fossil-fuel-heavy infrastructure now will have long lasting consequences for economies and the climate. ""It's about reducing emissions as quickly as possible now, of course, but it's also about getting the foundation for the transformations needed after 2030 in place,"" Olhoff said. She said there is a long time lag between when a decision is made and a policy is implemented to when emissions are reduced. ""So it has to be set in motion now,"" she said.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh216","OPINION: Bali G20: Last best chance to fix climate crisis","June 27, 2022 Monday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Jun. 27 Manila(Inquirer/ANN)- When Martin Luther King reminded us of ""the fierce urgency of now,"" he also warned that ""there is such a thing as being too late."" On fixing the climate crisis, we are almost at that point. With record heat waves now raging across North America, Europe, and Asia; drought, wildfires, crop failures, and famine in some regions; unprecedented floods elsewhere; and record-high global ocean temperatures the last six years in a row, the summer of 2022 seems like we are all walking through the gates of hell. Perhaps the ""fierce urgency"" of this summer's climate chaos will move governments to finally act. Despite 30 years of United Nations climate change conferences, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and the climate crisis continues to worsen. This November, the 27th United Nations climate conference ( COP27 ) will be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and the Group of 20 Summit will be held in Bali, Indonesia. These government summits may be our last best chance to fix the climate crisis. To resolve the climate crisis, governments need to address three significant issues this November. First, the collective emissions reduction commitments of all nations remain insufficient. For a chance to save a habitable planet, global emissions must be reduced by 50 percent by 2030, and to zero by 2040. And we cannot simply trade emissions credits or buy offsets, as fossil fuel interests propose we need a 50 percent reduction in actual emissions. Yet the collective commitments of nations remain far from this goal. Current commitments, including those at COP26 in Glasgow last fall put the world on track for an apocalyptic 2.5 degrees Celsius temperature increase, far beyond the agreed 1.5 degrees ""safe"" limit. While holding warming to 1.5 degrees is no longer possible, a 2-degree goal is still within reach. Every carbon atom we keep out of the atmosphere now will make the future a little more habitable. Second, climate agreements lack legal force or any enforcement mechanisms. These agreements are essentially just promises, with no consequences for noncompliance. This is often where international agreements fall apart. Governments make promises, but when they return home, fail to adopt them in national law or policy. A 2014 global agreement to cut deforestation by 50 percent failed this way. At Glasgow last year, the government of Indonesia first agreed to end deforestation by 2030, but after pressure from its home government, rescinded this commitment only two days later. For emissions reduction agreements to work, they have to be sufficient and legally binding. The international community must establish consequences, sanctions, and penalties for failure to make, or implement, sufficient commitments. Finally, there is a continuing failure of wealthy nations to commit the financing necessary, both domestically and internationally, to reduce emissions. A decade ago, the world's wealthy nations agreed to a $100 billion per year Green Climate Fund to support the climate adaptation and energy transition needs of developing nations. But less than 1 percent of this has actually been funded. Further, the world's most polluting governments have not invested sufficiently in their own domestic transition to low carbon energy economies. The clean energy spending proposed in President Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill would have been a historic step for the United States, but this effort was killed by Senate Republicans and two Senate Democrats. The minimum global investment necessary this decade to save the future of our home planet a ""Living Planet Emergency Fund"" is $4 trillion per year (roughly 5 percent of world gross domestic product). By comparison, the US alone spent more than $8 trillion in just two years in COVID-19 response. The threat from climate change is far more consequential. Either we fully fund the low-carbon energy transition now, or we will lose any chance for a habitable world. Given how easy it is for fossil fuel interests to block progress at UN summits, we should no longer rely on the UN process to solve this problem. Besides, the world's less developed countries have already made their case they aren't the cause of the crisis, and thus cannot be the solution. As such, it seems unlikely that the UN meeting this November will produce much progress. The necessary fix to the climate crisis now sits squarely with the G20 at its meeting in Bali this November. In Bali, G20 governments must do the following: First, adopt a legally binding agreement for all members to reduce emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 100 percent by 2040. Second, establish an enforcement mechanism and penalties for noncompliance. Third, establish a $4 trillion per year Living Planet Emergency Fund ($2 trillion in domestic spending, $2 trillion in international spending), financed by a global minimum carbon tax and subsidy reallocation in each country. And then, each G20 government must go home and adopt these agreed actions in their own law and regulation. If the G20 resolves the three issues, it is still possible to hold global warming to under 2 degrees, saving the future of humanity and our living home planet. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"

A quadruple shock of COVID-19, climate change, conflict and cost-of-living has undone years of hard-fought development gains. As financial conditions tighten, even countries that had seemed on track to prosperity and stability now stare into the abyss of debt distress, fragility and uncertainty about the future. Coordinated, multilateral action is necessary to tackle the crises we face. Both aid and trade have key roles to play in reversing the impacts of this quadruple shock and putting the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We head the three international agencies that comprise the Geneva trade hub  the World Trade Organization (WTO), UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre (ITC). The WTO makes and monitors the rules for global trade. UNCTAD delivers research and consensus-building to guide governments. ITC helps small business go global, especially firms led by women and young entrepreneurs. We work together so that trade works better for development. All three of us share a deep commitment to trade-led prosperity. All three of us understand that a world in crisis means no more business as usual. And all three of us want our organizations to ""walk the talk"" on making aid and trade deliver for real people. To guide aid and trade toward a better world, policymakers need to pivot in three fundamental ways. First, make trade greener. Global trade can play an important role in a transition to a low-carbon economy. Preliminary research at the WTO suggests that removing tariffs and regulatory trade barriers for a set of energy-related environmental goods would reduce global CO2 emissions by 0.6 percent in 2030 just from improved energy efficiency, with additional potential gains from innovation spillovers and as lower prices accelerate the shift towards renewable energy and less carbon-intensive products. Second, make trade more inclusive. Promoting greater trade by small businesses and greater participation by women and youth make companies and countries more competitive, drives economic transformation and reduces poverty. Yet ITC business surveys found that one only out of every five exporting companies is women-led. WTO data show that micro, small and medium-sized firms represent around 95 percent of all companies globally but only one-third of total exports. Third, make trade more connected. In our networked world, the future of trade is through digital channels and platforms, especially for small businesses. During the pandemic, we saw how doing business online went from being useful to critical for survival. UNCTAD data shows that digitally delivered services reached almost two-thirds the level of global services exports. These themes will be discussed at the upcoming Global Review of Aid-for-Trade, which will be held on July 27-29 in Geneva. The event comes one month after the WTO's successful Twelfth Ministerial Conference, which put trade multilateralism back on track and delivered a landmark agreement on fisheries subsidies, and two months before the COP27 meeting in Egypt that could determine the world's chances to keep the 1.5-degree Celsius target alive. The data shows promising signs that aid-for-trade is tilting towards greater sustainability, inclusivity and connectivity. OECD and WTO data reveal a record high of nearly US$50 billion in aid for trade disbursements in 2020, of which half were either climate or gender related, and one-third supported the digital economy. Despite growing budgetary pressures at home, it is critically important to continue and increase these aid for trade flows. Apart from a stronger thematic focus on sustainability, inclusivity and connectivity, maximizing the contribution of aid for trade to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires a resolute focus on the ""where"" and ""how"" of delivering development results. This means a focus on those countries whose trade and development needs are highest  particularly Least Developed Countries and fragile/conflict-affected countries  and regional initiatives like African Continental Free Trade Area, to ensure they become stepping-stones to wider and more inclusive regional value chains and trade-led growth. It means partnership across international organizations. The WTO, UNCTAD, and ITC already collaborate on initiatives like the Global Trade Helpdesk, which simplifies market research by bringing key trade and business information into a single portal, as well as on support to cotton-exporting countries in Africa. Last but certainly not least, it means mobilizing public and private finance. The IFC estimates a worldwide $300 billion financing gap for women  and the global trade finance gap has nearly doubled from an already-staggering $1.5 trillion. Without access to finance, firms cannot grow, diversify or formalize. We want to end with a call to action. Creating a more sustainable, inclusive and connected future is the moon shot of our times. Aid, trade and multilateralism  working together  are part of the solution. It is normal and understandable that governments act to shore up their own economies in troubled times. But we must act now to ensure that the world's poorest and most vulnerable can still see a pathway to prosperity through global trade. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh220","We have 2 months to start healing the world","November 7, 2022 Monday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 7 -- In my 40-year career in environmental politics, I cannot recall a higher-stakes period than the coming two months. summits on climate change and biodiversity will offer the world a unique chance to come together on two of the most critical issues of our time - climate and biodiversity. Change is possible. But given the size of the crises, we must use the coming two months to be brutally honest about where we are and where we must get to. COP 27 on climate to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November and COP 15 on biodiversity to be held in Montreal, Canada, in December are great opportunities for countries to approach both issues in a comprehensive way rather than tackling them on separate fronts. A united approach is essential to ensure that the decisions made at both events pull in the same direction. The goals that negotiators set and refine at these two conferences of the parties will shape policy, investment, and community planning for the long term. Over the next eight weeks, we need to seek unity on the one threat that connects us all - the well-being of our planet. History shows what we can achieve when we unite behind clear goals. Take the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Not only did this historic agreement to reduce ozone-depleting chemicals help shrink the hole in the ozone layer, according to recent research, it also slowed the pace of global warming. Without the Montreal Protocol, the planet would be facing a further 2.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century. Efforts to change the energy mix are also yielding results. The International Energy Agency said last month that record growth in renewables and electric vehicles means that emissions are on track to increase by less than 1 per cent this year, defying expectations for a surge. There is also a growing recognition of the urgent need to transform global agriculture and aquaculture systems in support of the Paris Agreement climate goals, while still feeding a population forecast to hit 9.7 billion by 2050. Big shifts are also needed in how we grow, transport, nourish, and package the food we eat, given the world's food systems are responsible for one-third of human-made global greenhouse gas emissions and 70 per cent of freshwater use, and drive 90 per cent of tropical deforestation and ecosystem destruction. But making these and other changes last requires more than government pledges. We must involve young people, businesses, and marginalized groups, both to increase buy-in and to unlock knowledge and ideas at the community level. We must also change the orientation of global financial flows, realigning public and private spending priorities with our climate objectives. We can no longer afford to maintain a status quo that funnels $1.8 trillion in subsidies to commercial agriculture and fossil fuel producers each year. One item that has emerged as a barrier in both the climate and biodiversity negotiations is how we finance change. With high-income economies under increasing strain from global inflation and low- and middle-income ones also suffering from rising debt and currency devaluation, how to pay for needed action is a major sticking point. Getting past this will require all countries to prioritize the same thing: Healing the world and creating the conditions for a healthy future. This needs to be the thread connecting every discussion on every topic at the upcoming COPs, as well as in national capitals. It is in all of our self-interest to allocate financing in a coherent way in support of these goals - stopping public support for oil, gas, and coal, as well as activities that cause deforestation. Phasing out funding for damaging industries and ending perverse incentives will create fiscal space for governments to invest in the planet. We must also mobilize more resources from the private sector and philanthropic organizations, which have significant contributions to make in this space. I have spent my entire career working to ensure multinational environmental negotiations take us in the right direction. My work in national politics, in international diplomacy, and in civil society has taught me that we have the knowledge and tools we need to heal our planet. What we need is to work together on the issues that unite us - with multilateralism at the center. Addressing the many challenges faced by the global environment requires every country at the table and engaged in a consistent way. This is why the upcoming COPs are so critically important, and why I will be looking to them for ambitious outcomes reaching across topic areas and sectors. The state of the planet has already pushed us well beyond business as usual when it comes to managing environmental crises. We have an opportunity as 2022 comes to a close to define this as an inflection point for nature that takes us where we need to go.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh221","Dhaka interested to receive US investment from DFC for infrastructure opportunities","United News of Bangladesh"," ","Bangladesh has expressed interest in receiving U.S. development finance from the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for a wide range of infrastructure opportunities. The United States affirmed it would consider Bangladesh's request while emphasizing the need for Bangladesh to implement the ILO road map. Bangladesh raised the issue at the second Bangladesh-US high-level economic consultation held in Washington, DC on Thursday. Adviser for Private Industry and Investment to the Prime Minister Salman F. Rahman and US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez co-chaired the discussion. The US urged Bangladesh to take further steps to adhere to internationally recognized labor rights standards, including those developed by Bangladesh for its International Labor Organization (ILO) road map. Bangladesh expressed its commitment to swiftly pass necessary reforms and fully implement the four priority areas of the ILO road map, according to a joint statement issued by the US Department of State on Friday. Bangladesh also expressed a commitment to address other areas of labor reform including improving workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in export processing zones (EPZs) and gradually in other sectors across Bangladesh's economy. Both sides decided that the effective implementation and enforcement of international labor standards can help the economies of both countries recover from the pandemic, broaden economic gains, and unlock further economic potential with other trade partners by creating an attractive business environment. Climate, Energy and Health The US commended Bangladesh on its admirable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bangladesh has fully vaccinated over 76 percent of its population and partially vaccinated over 99 percent of the eligible population. Bangladesh expressed gratitude for the over 64 million vaccine doses the United States donated, in partnership with COVAX, to support Bangladesh's COVID-19 response efforts. The US welcomed Bangladesh's interest in the United States-developed COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement so that Bangladesh could share best practices with the world on its effective vaccination of its population and Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN). The US also highlighted Bangladesh's role as a global climate leader. Both sides emphasized the importance of delivering on and strengthening existing commitments in the lead-up to COP 27 . The US encouraged Bangladesh to consider joining the Global Methane Pledge, urge major emitting countries to do more on climate initiatives, and continue outlining adaptation priorities. Bangladesh welcomed USAID's climate support, including a review of embankments to assess the feasibility of nature-based solutions to protect critical biodiverse areas from degradation. Bangladesh encouraged U.S. companies to invest in clean energy to help Bangladesh advance on its COP nationally determined contribution targets for climate. Strengthening Business Engagement The meeting participants celebrated the strong and growing economic partnership between the United States and Bangladesh, a highlight of our 50 years of bilateral relations. The US highlighted Bangladesh's evident potential to be a regional leader in digital trade and noted with appreciation steps taken by Bangladesh to adopt a transparent regulatory environment to secure broad-based foreign investment in its bourgeoning digital economy sector. Bangladesh welcomed investment from U.S. firms in Bangladesh, including in the renewable energy, telecommunications, and agricultural and food processing sectors and to its economic zones. Bangladesh warmly welcomed a U.S. concept of a U.S.-Bangladesh Women's Council, which would enhance women's employment, entrepreneurship, and access to educational opportunities in support of a more equitable future. Both sides decided to coordinate more on implementing existing transparent commercial policies and consistent enforcement of intellectual property rights in Bangladesh. \"
"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh222","Analysis: RI receives flurry of global pledges to help retire coal plants early","November 24, 2022 Thursday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Nov. 24 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- Indonesia has received pledges totaling US$20 billion from developed countries and global private lenders through the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), led by the United States and Japan, to help the country retire its coal power plants, bringing forward the power sector's peak emissions target to 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The JETP scheme is complemented by another global fund led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Indonesia's energy transition. According to a US Treasury official, the Indonesia JETP, which had been more than a year in the making, ""is probably the single largest climate finance transaction or partnership ever"". The scheme is based on the $8.5 billion JETP, led by the US, the United Kingdom and the European Union, for South Africa's coal phase-out program, launched during last year's COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. Indonesia's $20 billion JETP program comprises $10 billion in public sector pledges in the form of grants and concessional loans from multilateral development banks and the International Partners Group (IPG) coled by the US and Japan that also includes Canada, Denmark, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK. The other $10 billion derives from the investments of private financial institutions coordinated by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which includes the Bank of America, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Macquarie, MUFG and Standard Chartered. To access the loans, which are to be made available over a period of three to five years, Indonesia needs to develop a comprehensive investment plan to achieve its new targets. These include bringing forward the deadline of the power sector's peak emissions target by seven years to 2030 and reducing its peak emissions target to 290 million tonnes of CO2 from a baseline value of 357 million tonnes of CO2. In addition, Indonesia has also committed to bringing forward the power sector's net-zero emissions target by 10 years to 2050. In addition to the JETP, Indonesia has also secured pledges from a group of development banks, private lenders and philanthropic institutions led by the ADB to buy up or refinance coal power plants for retiring them early, as well as to build renewable power plants under the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM). The government has assigned PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (SMI) to manage the ETM country platform and coordinate the fund, though no pledges have been made under the mechanism to date. Meanwhile, the government, the ADB and independent producer Cirebon Electric Power agreed on Monday to provide between $250 million and $300 million to refinance and prematurely retire the 660-megawatt Cirebon 1 coal-fired power plant in West Java as the ETM's first project. The power plant is to be shut down 10 to 15 years before the end of its operating life of 40 to 50 years. The government has targeted retiring a total of 33 coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 16.8 gigawatts and build renewable energy power plants of up to 700 GW to achieve its new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets in 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2060. What's more Just before COP27 , Indonesia submitted its updated NDC to the UNFCCC, committing to a bigger emissions cut of 31.89 percent by 2030 independently and 43.2 percent with international assistance. In its previous NDC submitted in 2016, Indonesia had committed to reducing emissions by 29 percent by 2030 independently and 41 percent with international assistance. The new NDC target means Indonesia should cut carbon emissions independently to 1.95 billion tonnes CO2 by 2030 or to 1.62 billion tons with international assistance, compared to the 2.87 billion tonnes of CO2 it produces in a ""business as usual"" scenario. Reducing the emissions the power sector produces by phasing out coal is crucial for Indonesia to achieve its new emission goals. With coal power plants supplying 65 percent of the country's electricity, the power sector is one of the biggest contributors of CO2. According to state electricity company PLN, if the power sector continued with business as usual, it would produce 920 million tonnes of CO2 by 2060. But phasing out coal is expensive, and requires investments of between $500 billion and $600 billion to build 1,800 terawatts of renewable energy power plants by 2060. What we've heard A high-ranking official at the Ministry of BUMN told us that the financing issue is still an obstacle to accelerating or ending the operation of a coal-fired power plant. The main reason is that the ETM method, which was touted during the G20 event, is doubtful that they can partake in the green financing industry. According to the official, there is a kind of dilemma among donors and funding agencies. They are worried that if they participate in financing the energy transition through the ETM scheme, they will also have to finance additional hydrocarbons. Conceptually, the goal is to reduce emissions. However, terms of the portfolio they will be making, they are considered as companies that participate in releasing emissions because they have financed the the coal-based power plant earlier, even though it's for acceleration retirement. On the other hand, the source added, not many countries have recognized ETM as part of the green taxonomy. That is why before the G20 Summit summit, Indonesia repeatedly stated that ETM financing must be included in the green financing taxonomy. The PLN is said to have signed an agreement with PT SMI. The hope is that the country platform that is being built by Sri Mulyani can later become part of the green financing taxonomy. Another source said that PT SMI had doubts about their ability to manage ETM. This source added that ahead of the summit in Bali, lobbying efforts were intensifying. The Indonesian government relies on ADB. As a multilateral agency, the ADB is considered capable of convincing other institutions and parties to accept the ETM platform as part of the green taxonomy. That is why Indonesia is pushing for the achievement of a joint communiqu\'e9 at the G20 event. One of the things discussed in the joint communiqu\'e9 is energy transition. The debate also occurred when representatives from the G7 discussed JETP, which is funding for a just energy transition. ""The United States is reportedly led directly by John Kerry,"" he said earlier. Many doubt that the JETP scheme is purely designed to save the earth. Moreover, the United States is suspected of carrying a special mission regarding business in the renewable energy sector. The American entrepreneurs who support JETP are those who have been supplying components for coal plants in Indonesia.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh223","Responsibility for tackling climate urged","August 31, 2022 Wednesday","The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network","Aug. 31 Beijing(China Daily/ANN)- Developing nations suffer pain caused by developed states, Pakistan envoy says With Pakistan devastated by unprecedented flooding, the country's ambassador to the United Nations has called on developed countries to take responsibility for climate change. But Munir Akram expressed optimism that the China-proposed Global Development Initiative, or GDI, will play an important role in countering the effects of a warming planet along with easing shortages in global food supplies. ""Countries like Pakistan, we are one of the smallest emitters of carbon. We have contributed almost nothing to global warming. But we are the fifth-largest victim of climate change,"" Akram, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told China Daily in an exclusive interview on Friday. ""And the droughts, floods, melting of the glaciers ... all of these are contributing factors to the disaster we are facing in Pakistan today in the shape of floods."" Floods caused by climate change, monsoon rains, and melting glaciers had killed at least 1,136 people in Pakistan by Monday, and that toll is set to rise further as many communities in the mountainous northern regions remain cut off by flooded rivers that washed away roads and bridges. According to the country's disaster management agency, 33 million people, or 15 percent of the population, have been affected by the floods. The country's climate minister, Sherry Rehman, said a third of the country is under water. Akram said the international community needs a strategy for adaptation to enable developing countries to face these kinds of disasters, and to restrain the impact of flooding and drought on these countries. ""We need major projects for adaptation,"" Akram said. Developing countries are asking for a facility to compensate them for loss and damage, said Akram, who is also the chairman of the Group of 77 and China. The G77 is a group of 134 developing countries at the UN, with the name taken from the number of its founding members. ""It is the industrial countries, which have for the last 200 years contributed to global warming. And it is in developing countries, mostly like Pakistan, who are the victims,"" said Akram. ""Therefore for such damage, there should be some mechanism for loss and damage to compensate for those countries for the impacts they are facing, because of the historical policies of industrialized countries that contributed to global warming."" Akram said developing countries are looking forward to the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP 27 'Iron brother' ""I'm very, very happy, in particular, with the response we received first and foremost from China, which is our 'iron brother'. And it has been a generous response. And we are looking forward to further support from China."" A statement issued by China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday last week said Beijing will provide emergency humanitarian supplies to Pakistan, including 25,000 tents and other supplies, with deliveries to come as soon as possible. The Red Cross Society of China will provide $300,000 in emergency cash assistance to the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, the statement said. The statement said China has already provided 4,000 tents, 50,000 blankets and 50,000 pieces of waterproof canvas in disaster relief for Pakistan under the social and livelihood cooperation framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Of the food crisis threatening countries including Pakistan, Akram said that one lesson Pakistan can learn from China is to eliminate poverty and hunger, and that should also be a development priority for Pakistan. He believes the GDI will make ""a great contribution"" in addressing these needs, and he hopes the ""model can be emulated by developing countries"". The initiative is aimed at supporting the development of developing countries, promoting a global economic recovery and strengthening international development cooperation. ""And then, of course, China itself is investing, is contributing and creating infrastructure, agriculture infrastructure, support to farmers and support to the continuation of crops that are needed by the world,"" said Akram. He said these are concrete means through which the GDI will provide the framework to support nations. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh225","Importance of clean water within the socio-economic system","November 13, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 13 -- Our attention has recently been drawn by the media to the results that have emerged from a ground-breaking research which has helped to quantify vast ground water reservoirs across Bangladesh that can be of immense help in revolutionising the agriculture and food production. Many Bangladeshi climatologists had been following for some time the ground-breaking research that was being carried out by six scientists-- five of whom were of Bangladeshi origin. Recently, the lead researcher Mohammad Shamsudduha informed over the phone from London that a month ago, ""Science"", a renowned journal, had published their research paper about a great water reservoir below Bangladesh that hardly runs dry. The more water is pumped out of the ""Bengal Water Machine"", as the researchers called it, the more water is pumped into it from the vertical and horizontal flow of freshwater from the surface and nearby lateral water sources. Such a mechanical dynamic is being considered by geoscientists as nature's very special gift to the people in the Bengal basin, a vast sediment-filled region upon which lies Bangladesh and a part of West Bengal. This has led Mr. Shamsudduha, a Professor at the University College London, to inform a local daily that this evolving scenario would assist in ""revolutionising our farming further, as irrigation strategy could now be set scientifically."" Apparently, according to these scientists the vast underground reservoir for fresh water was crafted slowly over thousands of years by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra that brought in tons of silt and sediment every year from as far away as the Himalayas to form the delta's spongy soil. Professor Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed, who is a hydro-geologist at the University of Dhaka has in this context observed that this process, named as ""The Bengal Water Machine"" has not only been boosting water yields in the winter, when there is practically no rain, but also helping to lessen flooding during monsoon seasons. The scientists associated with this research have also observed that fresh water amounting to 75-90 cubic kilometres appears to have been captured and pumped back into the Water Machine from 1988-2018. However, research has also revealed that such withdrawal-recharge ratio is not that encouraging and consistent among all regions of Bangladesh. The rice-producing north is precariously placed. On the other hand, the west generally experiences less rainfall than the east and that reflects on the outcome. Groundwater depletion is taking place in the west but not so much in the eastern part of our country. In addition, Prof Anwar Zahid, a Director at the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has pointed out that this Water Machine is also not working as effectively in the greater Dhaka region, big cities, and industrial areas. Such findings have led to environmentalists to stress on the need to use our available groundwater judiciously and cautiously. In the meantime another climate analyst Rafiqul Islam has revealed how the coastal people of Bangladesh are suffering from various health problems caused by not only consuming partly saline water but also having to spend money on collecting that water too. According to a 2019 study, people consuming saline water also tend to suffer from various physical problems, including acidity, stomach problems, skin diseases, psychological problems, and hypertension. It has even been blamed for early marriages because salinity supposedly gradually changes girls' skin color from light to gray. It must be remembered that the coastal belt of Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change and it is hit hard regularly by cyclones, floods, and storm surges every year, destroying its freshwater sources. Consequently, the freshwater aquifer is also being affected by salinity due to rising sea levels. It would be worthwhile to point out here that Ahmmed Zulfiqar Rahaman, hydrologist and climate change expert at Dhaka-based think-tank Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), has observed that if the sea level rises by 50 centimetres by 2050, the surface salinity will reach Gopalganj and Jhalokati districts - 50 km inside the mainland from the coastal belt, accelerating drinking water crisis there. However, it is heartening to know that an effort is underway through a rainwater harvesting plant from the Gender-Responsive Coastal Adaptation (GCA) Project, which is being implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), whereby women in some areas of the coast are now able to collect drinking water using the rainwater harvesting plant. This makes their lives easier. It needs to be mentioned here that under the project, rainwater harvesting plants have been installed at about 13,300 households under 39 Union Parishads in Khulna and Satkhira. Shyamoli Boiragi, a beneficiary of Shaheber Abad village under Dakope Upazila, has said that women in her locality suffered a lot in collecting drinking water in the past because they had to walk one-to-three kilometers every day to collect water. Now under this system, because of rainwater harvesting plants women in some affected areas do not have to go a long distance to collect water. This permits them to also spend required time on more household work. R. Loftus and M. Alexander who have been following carefully the different aspects of the impact that has resulted from the recent devastating flooding in Pakistan has been drawing attention to the recent meeting in Stockholm convened to mark the World Water Week. They have pointed out that for lots of the international attendees, many of whom were from the corporate world; the headlines regarding what had happened in Pakistan were a deadly reminder not only of the power and value of water, but also of the failings of the global system to manage it properly. With COP27 In addition, it also makes sound financial sense, as investing in taps, toilets and hygiene behaviour change is good for business. Installing clean water and decent sanitation facilities help employees stay healthy. This means less absenteeism, lower medical costs, improved morale, and higher productivity. Directly and indirectly, RMG industrial units in different parts of the world, with vast numbers of women employees are realising that such tangible benefits for the workforce and wider communities have positive impacts. Careful monitoring in some of these institutions have exposed that such facilities tend to increase, for example, how many jeans are sewn together, how much tea was picked, how much absenteeism fell and how much less the companies paid on medical bills of their employees. It has also been observed by Loftus and Alexander in this regard that their research suggests that ""for every US Dollar 1 invested in clean water, the apparel and leather sectors combined gained a US Dollar 1.32 return on investment and the tea sector projects a US Dollar 2.05 return. In this context, the analysts have said that to ""highlight the stand-out examples - one of the ready-made garment (RMG) factories in Bangladesh showed a Return of Investment (ROI) of US Dollar 9 on every $1 invested in WASH, whilst in one of the Twinings' tea estate plantations in India, there was a US Dollar 5 to US Dollar1 ROI during the pilot programme. It is true that some businesses might be put off by the initial capital expenditure but they need to remember that though the profitable returns might take some time, still low-cost solutions can often provide big results in the long-term. It would also be appropriate for the corporate sectors to remember that their workforce has to have availability of clean water to meet the water related hygiene needs. Their board-level consideration must not forget that during the on-going pandemic circumstances have enhanced the need for hand washing as the first and most cost-effective defence against infection. Each workplace might be different, but it's time for companies to put the wellbeing of their workforce at the heart of their business strategies and make water, sanitation and hygiene a priority. It is a wise and smart way to future-proof: for communities and for businesses to thrive. If businesses, civil society and relevant government authorities can rally together on this issue, it will also facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh226","Green Economy in Bangladesh: Prospects and Challenges","United News of Bangladesh"," ","The green economy is a new way of living that is based on sustainable consumption and production. In recent years, the concept of a green economy has been getting widely accepted in many countries. To make the green economy a reality in Bangladesh, there are some challenges that are needed to be addressed. One challenge is the lack of access to clean energy, which makes it difficult for people to live sustainably. However, the Bangladeshi Government has already implemented sound policies that would help promote the green economy. Let's focus on the problems and prospects of the green economy in Bangladesh. What is the Green Economy? The green economy is a term that refers to a way of living that is environmentally friendly and economically sustainable. It refers to practices and policies that promote green energy production, consumption, and waste reduction. Green economy initiatives can be focused on a specific sector or area, such as renewable energy, transportation, agriculture, city planning, or manufacturing. The Green Economy has been growing in popularity since the term was used in a 1989 report by a group of leading environmental economists, which was made for the Government of the United Kingdom. Read Renewable energy: 40% target £mbitious, but roadmap absent' In 2008, the United Nations Environment Program started the Green Economy Initiative (GEI). The objective was to strengthen support for environment-friendly investments. One of the aims of the initiative was to increase support at the country level for global risk studies and influence policy-makers to implement green economy programs. Prospects of Green Economy in Bangladesh Generally, the financial sector of a country supports the economic growth of that country. So, if the activities of the financial industry are carried out with proper preparation and sincerity, the expansion of the green economy can be another development wonder in Bangladesh. The population in Bangladesh is increasing day by day. And the use of technology in various stages of product production by various organizations is increasing to keep pace with the increased demand. Hence, the standard of cleanliness of the environment is decreasing. Read Jashore waste treatment plant makes a big difference These eventually increase the unexpected costs related to health, loss of biodiversity, carbon emissions, irreparable damage to the ecosystem, surface temperature, climate change, heavy rainfall, non-rainfall, cold currents, etc. To cope with these issues, the development of a green economy can bring solutions as well as opportunities for exploration within a natural and healthy natural environment. Green communication, green agriculture, green energy, green banking, green technology, green investment, green marketing, green industry, working environment, transportation, biogas, and geothermal energy all are directly related to a green economy. Read UNGA chief calls for shift to green economies on Mother Earth Day However, Bangladesh is not yet ready to apply all of these to improve the green economy. It is a costly and slow process. But the country has some prospects in some sectors such as using solar energy, recycling the used product, green agriculture and using biogas. Bangladesh can increase the use of solar energy. With the proper use of endless light and heat from the sun, we can create an environment-friendly country in the coming days through various effective measures. Fossil fuel reserves are not infinite, and they will be finished. But solar energy is derived from nature, a great gift of nature. Encouraging the principle of conservation of natural resources derived from nature ensures habitable earth for future generations. Read What can COP27 do for climate vulnerable countries? Moreover, renewable energy can be derived from ocean waves, water, and wind without any negative environmental impact. Thus, renewable energy generation, supply, and technological excellence will create jobs as well as create an environmentally friendly modern country. The growth and expansion of green employment depend on ensuring abundant use of renewable energy. Converting the environment and destroying waste into incredible energy resources will be the wealth of our future by processing the remaining unnecessary part of daily used products. Because excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides in unplanned agricultural management creates dire conditions. Therefore, the idea of green agriculture is the right decision for the coming future. Using green fertilizer and chemical-free fertilizer helps retain land fertility and increase fertility simultaneously with greater quantity on less land. Read BGMEA seeks faster delivery of raw materials through green channel Safe crop production is key. This system talks about all environmentally friendly production and production systems, including the use of organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers, diversification of crops, and production of mixed crops. In this regard, encouraging the production and more use of biogas will lead the country toward risk-free environmental development. Challenges of Green Economy in Bangladesh The government has taken several important steps to take the green economy forward, which is very positive. But there are many challenges too. Costly Green factory installation costs can be up to 30% more than a conventional factory because pleasing production process, energy-efficient technology, water conservation technology, solar panel technology, inverter technology, and rainwater harvesting results in greater construction costs. Read Bangladesh fails to exploit full potentials of green energy: Official documents Moreover, industries need to utilize foreign consulting companies because of the absence of qualified professionals in the local area, which increases construction costs a lot. It, therefore, becomes quite hard to reach green economically. Lack of Policy Bangladesh has not issued a specific green industrial policy declaration. The high rates of corporate tax and value-added tax are also creating an obstacle to green industrialization, which also makes it challenging to import high-end machinery from abroad. Lack of Awareness Consumer behavior is additionally a tricky component in green industry development. The local consumers are poorly informed about the importance of going green. Demand for green products is from simply the western business world. As a result, only export-oriented enterprises are motivated to transition from green industries. Read Davos climate focus: Can 'going green' mean oil and gas? Other Challenges Land scarcity, a high-interest cost of loans, insufficient transportation options, insufficient infrastructure for utility services, and other problems can be obstacles to the establishment of green industries in Bangladesh. Taken Steps to Establish a Green Economy in Bangladesh The Bangladesh government has already taken several steps to go green. The Government has already approved the 'Renewable Energy Authority Act' in 2012. Coastal green belt development activities have been undertaken. Also, adopted a five-year waiver on the commercial production of renewable energy. The Bangladesh government has also taken steps to set up solar power and biogas plants. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project was launched in 2013 to make organic compost fertilizer from municipal waste. To reduce air pollution from brick kilns, instructions have been given to convert old brick kilns to modern eco-friendly technology. Read Bangladesh, Denmark sign document to strengthen partnership on green transition Banks have now stopped lending to old brick kilns. A rapid expansion program has been undertaken to set up solar power and biogas plants. Environment courts have been set up in all districts. The government has already taken several steps to encourage farmers to use organic fertilizers. The country has already earned carbon credits by launching a project to produce bio-fertilizers from waste and use solar energy in some villages. Bangladesh Bank has launched a refinancing program for entrepreneurs to produce green products. Between 2012 and 2016, Bangladesh Bank almost doubled its capital (from Tk 478 million to Tk 920 million) in refinancing green products. Sectors receiving the highest amount of loans under this initiative are-eco-friendly brick kilns, renewable energy, and liquid waste management. Moreover, Bangladesh Bank has prepared environmental and social risk management policies. Through this policy, green financing initiatives have been taken. The organization is also working on identifying the risks of financing entrepreneurs involved in the production of toxic carbon monoxide and turning them green. Read RMG: BGMEA, Jeanologia to collaborate on promoting green technologies Final Words Both economic growth and environmental conservation are essential for a country. There is no other way to establish a green economy in Bangladesh to make it suitable for living with development. As we are one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and the environment, it is important to quickly solve the problems by implementing a green economy. Because sustainable development is not possible without a green economy. \"

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh236","Did the G20 summit open new windows?","November 27, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 27 -- Political analysts from all over the world monitored the latest 17th annual Summit of Heads of State and Heads of Government of the Group of Twenty (G-20) - the world's most powerful economies-- which was held in Bali, Indonesia. This was done with great care not only pertaining to whether there was the required attention paid towards global economic recovery but also with regard to several dimensions which were creating crisis in different parts of the world. Seventeen world leaders had gathered for the Bali summit, including U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Russia's President Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit but sent Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in his stead. Professor Kamal Uddin Ahmed has drawn attention to certain interesting facts pertaining to this Conference and recalled that the G-20 Group was formed on September 26, 1999, in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Since then ""the G-20 remains a leading international forum of the key developed and emerging nations to deal with global economic and financial issues as well as other pressing problems. Today, the G-20 represents 54 per cent of the world's land mass, over 80 per cent of the world's GDP, 75 per cent of international trade, 60 per cent of the world's population, and about 81 per cent of the global greenhouse gas emissions."" It has also been noted that ""the G-20 was quite effective in addressing the global COVID-19 pandemic through the free distribution of vaccines to the world. However, there were no significant developments at the G-20 in the fight against global climate change, especially in reducing ominously high greenhouse gas emissions"". Under this year's theme - ""Recover Together, Recover Stronger"" - the G-20 Summit apparently tried to highlight three major priorities: strengthening global health architecture, digital transformation, and realising a sustainable energy transition with a view to fashioning a sustainable future. There was some discussion on these issues and many opinions were delivered. However, the world's attention was particularly drawn to areas related to foreign policy and international relations in terms of challenges and connectivity. The international media had been following the COP27 Conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt and the challenges that had emerged over there. They were also noting how world leaders were tackling these issues. They watched with care how after a near three-year absence from the world stage, Chinese leader Xi Jinping embarked on a whirlwind of face-to-face meetings with Western leaders at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali, hoping to reassert China's global influence. Following a fairly long meeting with US President Joe Biden in an attempt to prevent their rivalry from spilling into open conflict, Xi also had discussions with the leaders of Australia, France, Canada, Japan and South Korea. This was obviously an attempt to review bilateral relations and to find common denominators to move forward. China's relations with these US allies have deteriorated to varying degrees in recent years, due to rising geopolitical tensions, and disputes over trade and the origins of the Covid Pandemic. Analysts have pointed out that China tried to show that both sides could serve to stave off disagreements and reopen communication lines. The Chinese leader's meeting with Biden has been referred to by some strategists as a way to discover measures by which both sides could not only avoid a persistent clash between democracy and autocracy but also promote the willingness of Western countries to view relations with Beijing through this prism. It was the first in-person meeting between the two superpower leaders since Mr Biden took office. The pair apparently discussed the evolving situation in Taiwan, North Korea and Russia's incursion into Ukraine. Both sides apparently opposed the use of nuclear weapons, indicating that there was a need for a simple solution to complex problems. Later, in his press conference President Biden observed that China had ""an obligation"" to dissuade North Korea from engaging in another nuclear weapons test. Biden is understood to have also suggested that he believes ""there need not be a new Cold War. I have met many times with Xi Jinping and we were candid and clear with one another across the board. I do not think there is any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan. I made it clear we want to see cross-strait issues to be peacefully resolved and I am convinced that he understood what I was saying, I understood what he was saying."" Mr Biden said the two leaders had also agreed to set up a mechanism where there would be dialogues at key levels of government to resolve issues. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is now expected to visit China soon. It may be mentioned in this regard that a Chinese readout after Xi's meeting with Biden, Xi described his country's system of governance as ""Chinese-style democracy,"" in an apparent signal to US allies that ideological differences should not become an unbridgeable divide in their relations with Beijing. The Chinese media has also observed that during the Chinese leader's meeting with the French President Xi reiterated his support for a ceasefire and peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. Political analysts have also taken particular note of the format of in-person diplomacy by Xi during the Conference in his meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, partly because ties between Beijing and Canberra have frayed significantly over the past years. The two countries have been locked in a bruising trade dispute and diplomatic freeze since early 2020, when China slapped tariffs on Australia following its call for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Leaders of the two countries had last met when Albanese's predecessor, Scott Morrison, had brief informal discussions with Xi at the G20 in Japan in 2019. But it has been six years since leaders from the two sides have held a formal bilateral meeting, after then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's sit-down with Xi at the G20 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in 2016. However, as in the case of Xi's meeting with Biden, few in Australia believe that the meeting between Xi and Albanese can completely reset the two countries' strained relations related to Chinese objectives associated with the South China Sea, Taiwan and South Pacific. John Lee, former national security adviser to the Australian government has observed in this regard, ""It may be a diplomatic reset of some sorts but not one in substance where both sides begin to genuinely approach each other in good faith and preparedness to compromise"". The print media has also reported that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida in his meeting with the Chinese leader urged on the need for both countries to work together for the APEC region. In this context he mentioned that ""Both China and Japan hold responsibilities in ensuring the security and peace of the region and wider international community"". Many strategic analysts have felt that this was one way for Japan to suggest that the Chinese leadership should exercise their influence on the activities of North Korea and their regular firing of their missiles in ways totally incompatible with international law. In her address to the summit, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva called on the G20 to reduce trade barriers, assist developing economies with their debt burdens and invest in climate-resilient agriculture. ""We are seeing a reversal of all we had been fighting for: bringing poverty down, bringing hunger down,"" Georgieva said. ""Now we have 345 million people that are suffering from a food crisis."" William Chen, the director of food science and technology programme at NTU Singapore, also remarked that the G20 members could still focus on ways to improve food security through investment in agriculture. At the conclusion of the Summit, the leaders issued a comprehensive Joint Statement. They recognised cooperation is irrefutably vital for global economic recovery, dealing with formidable global challenges and building the ""foundation for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth"". However G20 leaders appear to have overlooked some other dimensions. They met in Indonesia in the midst of multiple crises, with nearly 85 per cent of the world population expected to face austerity measures and severe budget cuts next year compounded by an insufficient response to the Covid-19 pandemic in global South countries. The G20 summit motto was ""Recovering Together, Recovering Stronger"" yet the Joint Declaration appears to have failed to deliver any alternatives to the wave of austerity engulfing the world. Economic analysts have also noted that the summit blocked any progress towards the negotiations of a UN Tax Convention that would address the issues of corporate tax abuses and illicit financial flows. Maira Martini from Transparency International in this context has observed that the G20 members ""in recent years have dragged their feet, unable to agree on key measures and failing to implement even those to which they had already committed. In the meantime, the corrupt have consolidated wealth and power, allowing them to attack everything from sustainable development to global security to democracy."" However, there were undeniably views that conflicts need to be avoided to meet and overcome the global cost-of-living crisis and many other socio-economic challenges that are growing because of climate variability. It was also underlined that international law must be upheld. The communique also stressed that the ""use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible"" and urged the ""peaceful resolution of conflicts through diplomacy and dialogue."" Nevertheless, according to economic strategic analysts-- question remains as to whether the G20 Summit has missed the opportunity to effectively tackle the evolving problem of the sharp rise in the cost of living globally.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh237","Climate Change: Are we heading towards extinction?","August 21, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Aug. 21 -- Due to the increasingly visible consequences of climate change, governments are finding it difficult to downplay the warnings of scientists. Among the consequences of the climate change are worldwide record-breaking high temperatures as well as droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, hurricanes and also severe impact on biodiversity. Forest fires have swept areas in France, Spain, Portugal and the United States. In fact, Europe including the United Kingdom is going through its fourth heatwave this summer. We have also seen how recent floods in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have led to massive destruction of housing, roads and communication links and also agriculture. These developments have pulled hundreds of thousands below the poverty line and created a scenario where many climatologists are remarking that we are thoughtlessly working together to ensure extinction of not only the human species but also that of many other species currently endangered due to human activities. In this context one needs to note that the annual global summit on biodiversity, COP15, has been delayed by two months to December and will now be hosted in Canada instead of China, according to environmental charities. This is due to concerns that the Chinese government might postpone the event for a fourth time into 2023 because of Covid-19. It may be recalled that the conference was originally due to be held in 2020. This summit has potential significance because it is expected to provide governments a chance to come up with a long-term plan to reverse the threat to life on Earth. Many might question why biodiversity is considered so important. This is so because biodiversity is the variety of all life on Earth-- animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms like bacteria. Animals and plants are particularly important because they provide humans with what is needed to survive, including fresh water, food, and medicines. Plants are also very important for improving our physical environment by cleaning the air we breathe, limiting rising temperatures and providing protection against climate change. Mangrove swamps and coral reefs can also act as a barrier to erosion from rising sea levels. Climate analysts and environmentalists have made certain interesting observations in this regard. According to them it is normal for species to evolve and become extinct over time - 98 per cent of all species that have ever lived are now extinct. The anxiety has however arisen that the extinction of species is now happening considerably quicker than expected. In this regard the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has maintained a ""red list"" of threatened species since 1964. Apparently, more than 142,000 species have been assessed and now 29 per cent are considered endangered, which means they have a very high risk of extinction. Biodiversity loss is occurring worldwide, but it has been found by the Natural History Museum in London that Malta, UK, Brazil and Australia have experienced the biggest changes due to pollution, rapid industrialisation and over use of water. Due to the increasingly visible consequences of climate change, governments are finding it difficult to downplay the warnings of scientists. However, this emerging dimension has led many governments and representatives of civil society to underline the need for the world to agree on a long-term action plan that will be known as the post-2020 Biodiversity Framework. Observers have stated that the key aim of such an initiative will be to slow down the rate of biodiversity loss by 2030, and to make sure that by 2050, biodiversity is ""valued, conserved and restored in a manner that will be delivering essential benefits for all people"". The post-2020 framework being discussed in this regard has four goals: increased conservation, resources used as sustainably as possible, more equal sharing of natural resources and increased financial support for biodiversity protection. It also wants greater use of trees and plants to absorb carbon dioxide and balance out greenhouse gas emissions. In order to achieve these targets governments and private organisations are pledging to give at least US Dollar 200 billion per year by 2030 - with 5 per cent going to developing nations. This small figure in terms of potential assistance for developing nations has, however, quite correctly led to justifiable disagreement, particularly in certain affected areas in Africa, Latin America and also in certain areas in Asia. Joseph Chamie has drawn notice to the growth of world population but has also underlined that this dynamic has slowed down from its peak levels in the second half of the 20th century. It continues to increase, currently at about 70 million annually and is projected to reach 9 billion by 2037 and 10 billion by 2058. In this context attention has been also drawn to the fact that if CO2 emissions from fossil fuels continue to rise like that of the past several decades, the annual level of the same in 2058 when the world's population is expected to reach 10 billion would be more than 50 per cent higher than what is today, or approximately 60 billion tonnes. Warnings that rising carbon emissions are dangerously heating the Earth have been clearly conveyed to governments. In particular, scientists have emphasised that the burning of fossil fuels is already heating up the planet faster than anything the world has seen in 2,000 years. In 2020 five countries produced approximately 60 per cent of the world's annual CO2 emissions. In first place was China with nearly one-third of the annual CO2 emissions. The list also includes United States with 14 per cent, India with 7 per cent and Russia with 5 per cent and Japan with 3 per cent. It may also be noted that China has the greatest number of coal-fired power stations of any country in 2022. Likely consequences of such a course of action include warmer temperatures with increased frequency, intensity, and duration, impacting oceans, seas levels, coral reefs, fish levels, glaciers and ice and snow cover. Also, changes in patterns and amount of rainfall are expected to result in increased droughts and desertification as well as flooding. Analysts have observed that climate change's worsening of air and water quality is expected to contribute to the spread of diseases accompanied by increased malnourishment, higher mortality, as well as the deteriorating ecosystems impacting numerous plant and animal species. Climate change will also likely contribute to the increased displacement of people as well as illegal migration of millions seeking to escape the consequences of global warming and environmental degradation. Various measures have consequently been recommended to address the climate change emergency. Among those measures are stabilising or reducing the size of human populations, eliminating the use of fossil fuels, moving to renewable energies, reducing air pollutants, restoring ecosystems, shifting from meat to mainly plant based diets, and transitioning to sustainable GDP growth. The upcoming November COP27 conference in Egypt is expected to follow the usual pattern of previous sessions with an adoption of a negotiated final report. However, that outcome is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve the internationally established goal of limiting the increase in global warming to a maximum of 1.5 celsius. Climate strategists have however indicated that despite more than two dozen annual COP sessions, various international agreements, and enumerated goals, a binding international agreement to address the climate change emergency is lacking. In addition, an authority that would impose climate change policies is not likely to be established, particularly given the supremacy of national sovereignty. Nevertheless, some progress to address climate change has been achieved over the past several decades. The international community of nations adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, and the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some efforts to implement emission reduction pledges have however slightly slowed down CO2 emissions. It has also enhanced energy efficiency, slowed deforestation rates, and accelerated the use of renewable energy. In addition, scores of governments are adopting additional commitments to address climate change. President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has been tireless in his efforts to persuade other countries to raise their ambitions on climate change. The United States, for example, has recently passed a historic legislation aimed at addressing climate change and clean energy-- part of an effort within a broad based of U.S. dollar 369 billion. Consumers will get incentives under the bill to purchase new and second-hand electric cars, to warm their homes with heat pumps and even to cook their food using electric induction. Electricity generators will get ten years of tax credits to supply more wind and solar power, which will lead to more renewable energy being supplied to the market. This will displace emissions-heavy gas and coal. Taken together with measures to penalize methane leaks and $20bn to cut emissions in agriculture, the whole package will likely cut US emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. This has led Joseph Chamie, a consulting demographer, previously associated with the United Nations Population Division to observe that ""it is time for governments, especially the major contributors to global warming, to implement bold actions to address the climate change emergency."" Dire environmental consequences are happening in Africa and measures and initiatives are being attempted in this regard by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) within the theme 'Only One Earth'. Communities around the globe have observed World Environment Day on June 5 by putting environmental concerns in the spotlight. This effort is now considered as the UN's primary platform to promote action for the protection of the environment by raising awareness on issues such as human overpopulation, marine pollution, global warming, wildlife crime and sustainable consumption. Celebrated annually by more than 150 countries worldwide, the day is a global platform for environmental outreach, to also showcase initiatives at the country and global level in the promotion of environmental health. Climate analysts Jasper Kimemia and Wanjiru have in this context warned correctly that it is the poor and vulnerable that will have to bear the brunt of ongoing environmental decline and unless correctly handled such a matrix can only lead to developing countries not being able to reduce poverty and inequalities.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh238","Gender parity and socio-economic upliftment","October 2, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Oct. 2 -- Economic gender parity as well as social parity ensures gains not only for economies of developed countries but also developing countries. They can build momentum because empowering women is no longer just an ethical issue. They are essential particularly for developing countries to be able to achieve sustainable development and a sustainable future. Analyst Gurib Fakim has significantly pointed out that ""all institutions have their role to play. Private companies can tackle issues both externally and internally. Internally, they can work on the changes of the gender split in board rooms, correcting the gender pay gap, working to end discrimination, and creating a work culture that empowers women. Externally, companies can invest in projects that directly support the development of women as well as form partnerships with charities and communities to give girls and women the education, skills and opportunities they need to succeed."" In this context it is hoped that funds pledged at COP26 will go towards local communities and grassroots women's groups in Asia Pacific to challenge gender inequalities, and will assist women and girls to adapt to the impacts created by climate variability. As key contributors to communities, as carers and activists, as well as in local food systems and in the home, women are in a unique position to drive longer-term climate resilience and assist in efforts towards mitigation and adaptation. However, if they do not get the required institutional support, it is feared at least 12.5 million girls in lower-income countries may be deprived from completing their education. It has also been observed by some women civil activists that the effects of climate change have put women at increased risk of hunger, food insecurity and violence. Women's vulnerability to climate change is social, economic, and cultural. Women in climate vulnerable nations tend to be highly dependent on local natural resources for their livelihoods, particularly in rural areas where they shoulder the responsibility for household supplies. However, women must not be seen as passive victims of climate change but as active and effective agents of change. This is threatening women's income, health and way of life, particularly, in Africa, parts of South Asia, and many developing countries. Entire households most of the time depend on them to provide food, fuel and water which is expected to become scarcer as temperature rises. Recent electronic media programmes have highlighted how they sometimes have to walk miles to fetch water from distant water sources. Mary Robinson in this regard has correctly observed that women have long been the custodians of the environment in many traditional societies. It is women who are often the providers of food, the stewards of seed banks, and the decision-makers at household level. It is often women who are the early adopters of new techniques and who are frequently the first responders in disaster situations. Our world is also full of remarkable women leading the way as climate scientists, litigators, community organsers, business owners, policy-makers, inventors and more. One needs to recall the many pledges and promises made on gender-just climate action, like the ones made at COP26 and earlier in 2021 at the Generation Equality Forum. These were important decisions but unfortunately most of them have not been transformed into action. We must understand that equitable and inclusive decision-making means not only ensuring that women and girls are always at the decision-making table but also that women and girls from particularly marginalised groups such as indigenous and rural communities also take part. We need to ensure that COP 27 will be more inclusive. Given the importance and magnitude of the global challenges that different areas of the world face, we have to focus on harnessing the leadership, ability and aptitude of women. While doing so, we need to take into account their unpaid care and domestic work, and ensure gender-responsive economic policies for job creation, poverty reduction and sustainable, inclusive growth. It must be remembered that they are not just housewives but also home makers. Yet, women continue to be marginalised. It has been noted by Fakim in this regard that despite their significant role, they have small representation in the Boards of international financial institutions- only about 19 per cent of IMF and World Bank boards and less than 30 per cent of most national Parliaments. The gender pay gap also continues to be an issue. Worldwide, women share 35 per cent of the global income, an increase of only 5 per cent since 1990. Analysts have also observed that the ability of women to financially provide for themselves and their families is being affected in a massive manner within the matrix of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This is particularly being noticed within this paradigm where over 60 per cent of women are employed in labour-intensive activities, unpaid or poorly remunerated. The gender gap in agricultural productivity exists because women often have unequal access to crucial agricultural inputs such as land, labour, knowledge, fertiliser and improved seeds. This has implications for the income, health and nutrition of both women and children. It has also been observed by some women civil activists that the effects of climate change have put women at increased risk of hunger, food insecurity and violence. This in turn has threatened women's income, health and way of life. It would be fair at this point to also refer to some observations made by Dr. Claudia Sadoff, associated with CGIAR about measures undertaken in Bangladesh for women empowerment. These came out in the first half of March this year when International Women's Day was being observed. She has noted that the increased empowerment of rural women in Bangladesh over the past 10 years has not been an accident. It was carefully planned. She has noted that a decade ago, not even one in four rural women could be said to have been ""empowered"" across five key metrics, a figure that surprised even those working on the ground with the country's poorest. By 2015, this had risen to more than two in five, or 41 per cent, with continued gains in recent years. Apparently, an important reason for this rise was the systematic effort to measure empowerment among rural women in real terms using measurements that were directly related to their daily lives, including farming and fishing. It seems that these findings have guided and motivated action towards a more targeted approach to improving women's participation and decision-making in food systems. Analysts, while checking the data, because of efforts to achieve MDG goals, were also in agreement that this has been possible because of not only greater gender equality but subsequent improvements in nutrition, health, and productivity. This gradual reduction in the gender gap is apparently helping Bangladesh as it is climbing the ladder towards a lower-middle-income status. Dr. Claudia Sadoff has also remarked that currently ""Bangladesh has demonstrated that unlocking the multiple benefits that gender equality can bring begins with first quantifying the level of empowerment and gender parity among rural women and their communities"". It may be recalled that Bangladesh was the first country to carry out a national household survey that included Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) in 2012. One component of the index provided the first measure of women's empowerment across five key domains: decisions about agricultural production; access to and decision-making power about agricultural resources; control of use of income; leadership in the community, and time allocation. In addition, another aspect measured gender parity, or the percentage of women who are empowered or whose achievements have been at least as high as the men in their households. This appears to have allowed women's empowerment to become a litmus test for agricultural productivity, nutritional status, and public health. All these dimensions and factors encouraged the relevant authorities to take the required next step-- government-backed programmes that addressed the mutual links between women, agriculture, and food security. This measure in turn persuaded the Bangladesh's Ministry of Agriculture to seek partnership with international institutions pertaining to agricultural training and nutrition behaviour change, communication and gender sensitisation training. This effort has notably increased the production of crops other than rice and improved the quality of household diets. This success has been taken note of by many countries who are now also urging WEAI to guide and help them pertaining to formulation of policy, investment decisions and suitable steps related to women's empowerment that could be leveraged as a gateway towards a healthier, more inclusive and fairer world. It is clear from the above that the governments also have a critical role to play in investing in collecting and reporting on empowerment indicators and working alongside development partners by seeking their data gathered through research. This can then be shared effectively with others through the digital process. If gender inequality can be gradually reduced and eventually removed, targeted and effective action will bear fruit for every country, particularly in terms of children's household diets and long-term nutritional status in every affected region or sub-region.

"COP27","Bangladesh","COP27_Bangladesh239","Challenges the UN has to overcome","September 25, 2022 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Sept. 25 -- Very correctly, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during the opening of the 77th UN General Assembly session has not only warned that the world is in peril from multiple threats but that there is need for solidarity and cooperation amongst the Member States. In this context he has also highlighted that to move forward we need to work together ""to advance peace, human rights and sustainable development."" Guterres has also referred to the parameter of development, healthcare and education being affected because of conflicts, climate variability, broken global financial system, poverty, hunger, inequality and divisions within the geo-political paradigm. The impact of all these factors, as we all know, has been compounded because of the osmotic effect of the Covid pandemic. In this context, he has drawn attention to the scenario where the current UNGA session will be a high-level event and will be attended by dozens of Heads of State and Government from around the world. It may be mentioned that the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina will also be participating in this important session after her brief stop-over in London for the Queen's funeral. Analyst Kerry Boyd Anderson has appropriately stressed that during the on-going tough times during this year's UN General Assembly, delegates will face both old and new challenges. Since last year's meeting, the world has entered a different phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and has felt the consequences of the turmoil created in Ukraine. Consequently, while the list of threats and problems facing the UN are diverse, a few global trends and developments pose particularly pressing short and long-term challenges. Climate change is already having serious impacts around the world and climate variability is also presenting longer-term risks that are affecting socio-economic development as the dimension evolves on our Earth over the next fifty years. Furthermore, climate change is a threat multiplier, increasing political, health care, social, economic and security risks around the world. Consequently, one can only hope that the severity and lasting nature of climate change with its potential direct and indirect consequences will persuade Members of the UN to give more attention towards mitigation and adaptation needs in areas which have been identified as vulnerable. Furthermore, climate change will increasingly force people to leave their homes, driving flows within countries and across borders. These trends will increase the need for UN humanitarian aid. We will have COP-27 soon but a more serious geo-strategic action on the part of the UN Members during the UNGA Session is necessary. Other analysts have also been drawing attention to the UNDP's annual Human Development Report (HDR) and Index (HDI) released this September and have noted that results of the survey has indicated that for the first time in 32 years of calculating the world's well-being, nine out of every 10 countries have fallen backwards in health, education, and standard of living. The organisation has mentioned that although there are many reasons for the degradation, continuous effects of back-to-back crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic are the most to be blamed. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator has also pinpointed areas showing that human development has fallen back to its 2016 levels and that world leaders find themselves collectively paralysed in making changes. Steiner added that the current state of regress might thwart the UN's 2030 deadline at achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Other draining factors include the exorbitant increase in cost of living, unemployment, artificial intelligence chosen over human activity rather than using it to maximise existing tasks. It has also been noted that digitalisation has emerged in some countries as - ""a double-edged sword for mental wellbeing."" Speaking during the launch of the HDR, U.N. Secretary General observed that the current crisis has created an uneven economic recovery from the pandemic and is further exacerbating inequalities. According to him it is also ""triggering spikes in food and energy prices, driving up inflation and drowning vulnerable countries in debt"". As a result many under-developed nations in South America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia appear to have been the hardest hit. For example, Pakistan - which already had a very low rating on the index, has fallen 7 places lower. It now ranks 161, on the HDI, out of 192 countries, while Afghanistan rings in at the 180th position. The UNDP report also depicts a totally overwhelmed global society staggering from crisis to crisis. Steiner has added, ""This risks heading towards increasing deprivation and injustice and in a world defined by uncertainty, we need a renewed sense of global solidarity to tackle our interconnected, common challenges."" Like other analysts Anderson has also referred to another huge challenge for the UN that has stemmed from the intertwined issues related to human migration, refugees and global demographic imbalance. Many advanced economies are experiencing aging and even shrinking populations, while many developing countries have young and growing populations. For the next two to three decades, the world will see a widening disparity between declining populations in wealthier countries and growing populations in developing countries. Interestingly, demographers have also drawn attention to another aspect. Many of them think that in the longer term, Africa will play a key role as population growth slows in much of the world due to effective family planning. The United Nations has, according to Anderson, gone on to project that ""more than half of global population growth between now and 2050 is expected to occur in Africa."" It is being anticipated that such an evolving structure of imbalance might create a scenario where there could be a drive towards large flows of migration, as people flee from violence, natural disasters and poverty and seek out economic and other opportunities, by attempting to reach the Global North from the Global South. Economists are pointing out that this changing demographic scenario might induce a situation, where there could be a growing need for cheaper labour in the developed industrialised countries However, such efforts towards migration may also intensify harsh political and social response to such a dynamic from the population living in the destined countries. We have already witnessed political and social changes and the rise of the extreme right forces as a counter-measure in this regard in some parts of Europe, the USA and Canada. The United Nations need to take anticipatory measures to avert disaster that could definitely affect the equation of global security, economics, social needs and politics in the coming decades and will also pose a serious type of threat to the fundamentals of the UN as an institution, as well as practical problems for global cooperation. Conflict situations, absence of observing human rights, as has been happening in Myanmar, Syria and Afghanistan is also likely to enhance the flow of refugees as people flee in search of safety. Furthermore, climate change will increasingly force people to leave their homes, driving flows within countries and across borders. These trends will increase the need for UN humanitarian aid. The UN has been working to address these shifting realities, but it is a challenging task. The UN is the most important institution that is capable of promoting the type of cooperation that is necessary to successfully manage global movements of people-- with agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration, the UN Refugee Agency, the UNDP, the UNHCR and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Nevertheless, Bangladesh has noticed over the past five years how the UN efforts have failed not only to resolve the important humanitarian crisis that has resulted in more than 1.1 million Rohingya refugees seeking sanctuary in Bangladesh from Myanmar, but also their repatriation to Myanmar because of the misuse of the power of veto vested with the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council. Some of them appear to be concerned with only their national interests. This issue will be raised during this session of the UNGA because despite all efforts undertaken by Bangladesh, the refugees are now creating instability within different refugee camps and also getting involved in different types of illegal activities. This, in turn, is affecting the security of the citizens living in close proximity of the Rohingya refugee camps. The United Nations needs to intensify its efforts for their repatriation to Myanmar so that they can once again live in their homeland. Another massive challenge being faced by the UN is sustainable funding for its diversified operations. The US has always been the largest donor to the Organisation. However during Donald Trump's Presidency, his Administration reduced its funding for the UN, particularly targeting peacekeeping operations and specific agencies. US President Joe Biden with the help of the US Congress is fortunately trying to restore much of that funding that the Trump Administration had cut. Nevertheless, one hopes that his Administration will be able to overcome on-going difficulties despite the evolving international political state of affairs. This could enable the different UN Agencies to keep pace with growing challenges and needs. While climate change, great power competition, migration and funding are top challenges facing the UN today, many other global concerns also demand UN attention. These include the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of future pandemics, the availability of vaccines for mutation varieties, setbacks in progress for women and girls, multiple conflicts around the world, nuclear weapons proliferation, food insecurity, and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. One can only hope that this UNGA session will be able to find least common denominators so that the world can move forward, find areas of cooperation for peace and development and emerge from inequity, lack of justice and lack of accountability that has unsettled lives in a troubled world.

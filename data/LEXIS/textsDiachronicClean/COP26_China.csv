[Photo/Agencies]Decisions make 'critical steps forward' but developed world yet to honor pledgeClimate experts say that the Glasgow Climate Pact, signed at COP26 over the weekend, achieved key progress on international global warming policy, but did not go far enough on addressing the impacts of climate change in the developing world.Negotiators from nearly 200 countries and regions signed on to the pact at the 26th United Nations Conference of the Parties, or , in the Scottish city on Saturday. Reaching a consensus was not guaranteed and was an achievement in itself, and parties reached landmark agreements in a number of areas including deforestation and fossil fuel reduction.But scientists have pointed out that collective emissions reductions targets, which are known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, are not enough to keep global average temperatures to within 2 and 1.5 C this century, a target laid out in the Paris Agreement.The pact itself recognizes that a gulf remains between what countries have pledged and what is needed to keep Paris goals in sight, and the text urges nations to come back to the table with improved NDCs.Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London, said he is ""proud, hopeful, and deeply concerned"" about the outcome of COP26.At COP26, negotiators finally agreed on key outstanding aspects of multilateral climate policy, including the finalization of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which concerns carbon markets.""I'm deeply concerned, because climate change is raging and is worsening each year we wait,"" Rogelj added. ""The progress at was the best the world was willing to do at this stage-kudos to the UK COP26 team-but it is not enough, not by far.""The Glasgow pact is the first to explicitly call for the ""phasing down"" of unabated coal projects and ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies this decade. An earlier version of the text, which requested for the ""phasing out"" of coal, was amended following opposition by developing countries.Dann Mitchell, a climate science professor at the University of Bristol, said that the pact ""is more than we expected, but less than we hoped"".""While it is clearly disappointing that at the 11th hour India challenged the phrase 'phasing out of coal', their entire infrastructure is highly dependent on coal, something the richest countries used to become the global superpowers they are today,"" Mitchell said. ""India's per capita carbon dioxide emissions are an order of magnitude lower than the highest-emitting countries, and clearly India felt that not enough was done to support their transition to green energy.""During COP26This finance is meant to support developing countries adapting to the impacts of climate change, as well as provide ""loss and damage"" compensations for those impacts that are not preventable. The Glasgow pact expressed ""deep regret"" that rich nations had missed finance goals and urged them to increase funding.""With respect to climate justice (COP26) is a failure though, with the $100 billion from the developed countries still not committed and no real financial support for loss and damage,"" Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said.Alyssa Gilbert, director of policy and translation at the Grantham Institute, said that loss and damage was a ""bigger and clearer discussion in this COP"" than it was at previous conferences, though the issue was ""still not addressed head-on"".""This topic will remain essential to developing nations and an international compromise is not clear yet,"" Gilbert said.\l"

The world\' s oldest and longest-reigning monarch stayed overnight in hospital yesterday after undergoing  preliminary investigations for an unspecified but not COVID-19 related ailment.Aides gave no details on what had prompted the medical attention, which followed the cancellation of a visit to Northern Ireland, and some royal correspondents said they hoped the official version of events painted the full picture.She carried out her first official engagement since the hospital stay earlier on Tuesday, holding two virtual audiences to welcome new ambassadors to Britain from South Korea and Switzerland.Elizabeth, who is queen of 15 other realms including Australia, Canada and New Zealand and next year celebrates 70 years on the throne, is known for her robust health.She is still carrying out many public duties. Last Tuesday she hosted a drinks reception at Windsor Castle for billionaire business leaders, including Bill Gates, attending a green investment conference ahead of COP26.News of the cancellation is likely to raise concerns about her health.

"COP26","China","COP26_China6","Why progress at COP26 is crucial","November 3, 2021 Wednesday 4:46 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","COP26, which is taking place in Glasgow, is the latest in a series of meetings through which the world\' s governments attempt to deal with climate change.COP stands for  Conference of the Parties : these 197 parties are the United Nations member countries, plus a few small non-UN member countries and the European Union, all of which support the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This was set up in 1992 to organize a global response to what most people then called the  greenhouse effect. It\' s COP26 simply because this is the 26th meeting.The location of COP meetings changes each time. The last meeting was in Madrid in 2019. There was no COP in 2020 because of Covid-19. The most important COP so far was the 2015 meeting in Paris, which HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreementagreed to  limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees, over pre-industrial levels.It\' s possible to set a target like this because scientific research has recognized a HYPERLINK https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxideclose relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide in the global atmosphere and its average temperature. In order to achieve the target of  well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees, the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK committed to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century. The main task for COP26 is to follow through on this commitment and produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that hold 21st-century global warming as close to 1.5 degrees as possible.As you can imagine, getting 197 different countries, all with their own circumstances and interests, to agree to such plans isn\' t exactly straightforward: After all, it took 23 years to get to the Paris Agreement. Most famously, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement when president, although it returned after Joe Biden\' s election. So there is some uncertainty about how successful COP26 will be.The main method for reducing emissions is the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country: These are individual countries\' climate action plans. For example, the UK\' s HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-nationally-determined-contribution-communication-to-the-unfcccmost recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.The main problem facing COP26 is that the combined NDCs of all the parties aren\' t enough to meet the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement. If you combine all the current plans and promises contained in the NDCs, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, and if you look at actual emissions now, they would lead to a global temperature increase HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/of 2.9 degrees by 2100.So there is a need for much-improved NDCs, plus effective ways to ensure that countries actually cut all the emissions they pledged to. One of the most important ways is for wealthy countries to provide https://theconversation.com/wheres-the-money-climate-fight-podcast-part-1-transcript-169287financial support to enable less wealthy countries to cut emissions, which was an important part of the Paris Agreement but hasn\' t been fully acted on yet.Why this mattersCOP26 matters because the window is quickly closing on the Paris Agreement\' s 1.5-degree target: If emissions don\' t fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will have been added to the atmosphere to keep the temperature from rising higher. Current emissions need to be HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/halved by 2030 to have about a 50:50 chance of keeping to 1.5 degrees. The longer the world delays before cutting emissions, either the harsher the cuts will need to be to meet the target, or the target will be missed altogether.The Paris Agreement matters because a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/what-will-the-world-actually-look-like-at-1-5-c-of-warming-687631.5-degree world is safer than a 2-degree world. For example, the proportion of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every five years is almost three times as high at 2 degrees compared with 1.5 degrees. The reduction in corn (maize) harvests in the tropical regions is more than twice as great at 2 degrees, and HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/insights/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15c-and-2c-warmingcoral reefs would be largely eliminated.If COP26COP26 as part of the long-term project to keep Earth as safe and habitable as possible for all its people, and the more successful it is, the easier that will be.This article is republished from HYPERLINK https://theconversation.comThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations climate change conference concluded here Saturday after a one-day extension, with negotiators agreeing on a new global pact to tackle climate change. Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Some encouraging progress was made. Agreement was finally reached on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which relates to carbon market mechanisms, paving the way for effective implementation of the Paris deal to cut emissions through market-based approaches. Negotiators also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation. It is the first explicit mention of fossil fuels in a COP agreement. During COP26, more than 100 countries have promised to end deforestation by 2030. In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing actions on climate change in the 2020s, which are widely welcomed and believed to galvanize global collective actions. The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action this decade to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries as well as multilateral processes. As COP26 wrapped up, however, some stubborn issues, notably climate funding, remain uncertain. There were commitments to significantly increase financial support through the Adaptation Fund as developed countries were urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. However, it remains to be seen whether developed countries, whose development is responsible for most of today's climate change impacts, will heed the set timeframe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023.

So let\' s take a look at the summit\' s defining issues.Weak 2030 targetsThe goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 . Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters.But HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1 \- or 2.4 if only 2030 targets are met.Despite the Australian government\' s recent climate HYPERLINK https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/australia-welcomes-positive-outcomes-cop26announcements, the nation\' s 2030 target HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/All.aspx.remains the same as in 2015. If all countries HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/targets/adopted such meager near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3 .Technically, the 1.5 limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year\' s time. However, as Sharma said,  the pulse of 1.5 is weak. And as Australia\' s experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022.

And the 1.5 global warming target has taken center stage, with the recognition that reaching this target will require rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions of HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma3_auv_2_cover%20decision.pdf45% by 2030, relative to 2010 levels.What\' s more, the pact emphasizes the importance of mitigation of nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity.

"COP26","China","COP26_China16","2nd LD: COP26 concludes with new global deal on climate","November 14, 2021 Sunday 6:44 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations climate change conference concluded here Saturday after a one-day extension, with negotiators agreeing on a new global pact to tackle climate change. Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Some encouraging progress was made. Agreement was finally reached on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which relates to carbon market mechanisms, paving the way for effective implementation of the Paris deal to cut emissions through market-based approaches. Negotiators also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in the process of electricity generation. It is the first explicit mention of fossil fuels in a COP agreement. During COP26, more than 100 countries have promised to end deforestation by 2030. In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing actions on climate change in the 2020s, which are widely welcomed and believed to galvanize global collective actions. The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action this decade to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries as well as multilateral processes. As COP26 wrapped up, however, some stubborn issues, notably climate funding, remain uncertain. There were commitments to significantly increase financial support through the Adaptation Fund as developed countries were urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. However, it remains to be seen whether developed countries, whose development is responsible for most of today's climate change impacts, will heed the set timeframe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. COP26, which kicked off on Oct. 31, is the first climate change conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015. The Egyptian city of Sharm El Sheikh will host COP27 in 2022. Enditem\l"

Photo: VCGUS President Joe Biden, who showed up at COP26 empty-handed, has tried to turn the summit into a ""political show"" by repeatedly name-checking Chinese and Russian leaders, so he is the real culprit in ceding the effect of negotiations, analysts said, in response to Biden's repeated criticism of the Chinese leader's absence at the summit.In addressing climate change, what we need are firm commitments and continued action. What we don't need are empty slogans, ever-changing policies, luxury motorcades and entourage, irresponsibly exposing numerous people to infection, Zhang Jun, the permanent representative of China to the UN, tweeted on Wednesday.Zhang's remarks were made after Biden, speaking at the end of the second day of COP26 in Glasgow, lashed out at both Chinese and Russian leaders for their absence at the climate summit.Biden also said that China has walked away from the biggest issue of our time, according to the New York Times.In response, Zhang said that ""the Chinese leader addressed the meeting [via video link] to share China's solutions on climate change.

""The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps. But unfortunately, the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions,"" he said in a statement on the conclusion of COP26. ""Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade, specifically, a 45-percent cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions, even if fully implemented, will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels,"" he said. He welcomed the agreement between the United States and China in Glasgow that pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s. To help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, there is a need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how. This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies, he said. ""I want to make a particular appeal for our future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage,"" said Guterres. ""Adaptation isn't a technocratic issue, it is life or death. Protecting countries from climate disaster is not charity. It is solidarity and enlightened self-interest."" ""We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe. Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility. That means finally delivering on the 100-billion-dollar climate finance commitment to developing countries. No more IOUs. It means measuring progress, updating climate plans every year and raising ambition ... And it means, beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement, establishing clear standards to measure and analyze net-zero commitments from non-state actors."" He said COP26 created some building blocks for progress: commitments to end deforestation, to drastically reduce methane emissions, to mobilize private finance around net-zero emissions. And the texts today reaffirm resolve toward the 1.5-degree goal, boost climate finance for adaptation, recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage. And for the first time they encourage international financial institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights.

Combined, the three agreements call for global cooperation in speeding up adoption of zero-emission cars, vans, and medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks, and creating charging infrastructure. BYD and the other signatories pledge to align public policy and funding as well as private business strategy, production and investment toward achieving ambitious zero-emission vehicle adoption goals. Isbrand Ho, managing director of BYD B.V., offered his expertise at panel discussions on zero-emission transportation infrastructure entitled  Nothing Moves Without It at the COP26 conference. In signing the first agreement, drafted by representatives of the United Kingdom, BYD will join the push for global sales of new cars and vans being zero-emission by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. The agreement calls for governments at all levels to make policies and investments to support EV sales. The agreement also calls for private businesses, such as BYD, to align their business strategies to reach this ambitious goal. BYD also signed an agreement endorsing a global memorandum of understanding calling for countries to have 30 percent of its new medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles to be zero-emission by 2030 and be 100 percent by 2040. BYD is joining government, businesses and environmental organizations to make the transition to zero-emission vehicles easier and more cost-effective by removing strategic, political and technical barriers, and accelerating EV adoption and deployment. This agreement was drafted by the Netherlands and CALSTART, a nonprofit seeking to build a high-tech clean-transportation industry. The third document signed by BYD calls for accelerating the creation of a comprehensive network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The document offers a set of recommendations to reach this goal, including developing e-mobility roadmaps, prioritizing investments in electricity network infrastructure, encouraging private investment, removing financial barriers to the installation of charging infrastructure, and developing charging networks that are open, user-friendly and scalable. BYD ADL pure-electric buses played a prominent role at COP26.

More than 100 countries HYPERLINK https://www.globalmethanepledge.org/pledged to reduce methane emissions 30 per cent by 2030.

Photo: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing Street, via Flickr. The reality of the pact\' s value going forward is probably somewhere between empty words and the end of coal, although much closer to the former. United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres \- hardly an activist, but clearly someone greatly concerned about climate change \- declared at the end of COP26 that the world is  HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/sgsm21022.doc.htmstill knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. The pact  resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees, although at the same time it  reaffirms the goal of limiting it to  well below 2 degrees (the latter being more realistic but justification for Guterres\' s warning of climate catastrophe). The pact calls on countries to accelerate the  phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, wording that is open to wide interpretation and amounts to going slow on cutting back on coal.The pact also recognizes that protecting ecosystems must be an integral part of mitigating climate change. It notes agreement on rules to standardize the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions, limitations and trading (a boring topic for laypersons, to be sure, but one that has major importance because so many countries tend to cook the books when reporting their emissions).United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres at the COP26 climate summit. Photo: Karwai Tang/ UK Government. via Flickr. The pact mentions that funding to help poor countries adapt to climate change is insufficient and  notes with deep regret that financing to help those countries mitigate their emissions remains below what developed countries have promised for more than a decade. The pact  urges developed countries to double their financial aid packages and calls on the private sector to do its part. \~Importantly, despite strident demands from poor countries, the pact failed to create a fund to pay reparations for the harm that they are experiencing due to climate change.The Glasgow Climate Pact was HYPERLINK https://enb.iisd.org/Glasgow-Climate-Change-Conference-COP26-summaryhailed by some as a breakthrough because it is the first climate agreement to mention fossil fuels. That\' s one way to interpret the first-time explicit reference to coal, but the pact says nothing about the rising production of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Another interpretation is to see this belated reference to one fossil fuel as a devastating indictment of decades of climate summitry: it took 30 years before governments agreed to mention, let alone implement, the desirability of cutting back on the biggest cause of the climate crisis.While the pact demonstrates growing concern around the world about climate change, and growing willingness to take action, it also showcases the enduring power of vested interests, not least those of powerful industries that are most addicted to coal and other fossil fuels, and which do not wish to forgo the benefits \- the profits \- that come from burning them.Photo: Karwai Tang/ UK Government, via Flickr.

One of the supposed bright spots of the summit was a HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/declaration by China and the United States that they intend to cooperate on climate change.

The two countries have made similar declarations in the past, most prominently in HYPERLINK https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/11/us-china-joint-announcement-climate-change2014. Alas, there is little evidence that those declarations restrained China\' s emissions. The latest declaration is unlikely to be any different. It includes plans to reduce methane emissions, but China\' s failure to join the Glasgow methane pledge suggests its real intentions.More generally, China is likely to interpret the China-U.S. declaration to mean whatever it wants it to mean, just as it has done with many other international agreements. Some proof seemed to come surprisingly quickly. Only three days after the Glasgow summit, Presidents Biden and Xi had a short virtual summit, during which Xi apparently HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/world/asia/biden-xi-usa-china.htmlreaffirmed what Chinese officials have been HYPERLINK https://hongkongfp.com/2021/07/21/beijing-ties-climate-cooperation-to-health-of-us-relations/saying for months: that improvement in bilateral relations on other issues is a precondition for Chinese cooperation with the United States on climate change.

Neither an explicit commitment on countries\' carbon neutrality by 2050 nor a promise to end fossil-fuel subsidies was made, which had been placed high on the agenda of COP26. Given that 82% of the world\' s greenhouse-gas emissions were generated by G20 countries as of 2020, the very weak consensus at the Rome summit clearly does not bode well for COP26 and, more important, the world\' s action against climate change. One needs to realize that the largest  blockers on climate issues are either the world\' s largest emitters (China, the US and India) or the largest exporters of HYPERLINK https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiN9KaFj_nzAhUHzzgGHeN5AMsQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBrown_energy&usg=AOvVaw1ASQGYwFPms0h6Hntp5UfBbrown energy (Australia, Russia or Saudi Arabia). China and Russia have pushed their net-zero targets to 2060, and India even further, 20 2070. This is much later than the mid-century target thought to be necessary to keep the increase in global warming over pre-industrial levels to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Australia has only recently pledged net zero by 2050 under mounting peer pressure, while Saudi Arabia aims for 2060, but will still try to retain its primacy in oil production.\~Beyond the still relatively late commitments for carbon neutrality and the lack of concrete plans for the use of coal in the energy mix, two important issues seem to have been absent from the discussion so far. One is the decarbonization of global supply-chain plays given that eight key supply chains account for 50% of total emissions. One potential path would imply greening but also shortening supply chains toward a more regional rather than global model, which obviously has important economic but also geopolitical consequences. The second missing point is a strategy for global carbon pricing. While the momentum for carbon pricing is increasing, with an extension to new sectors in Europe but also a new national-level emission-trading system in China since July, it is still far from complete. Beyond increasing the scope (with the US as a huge missing point), it is also important to coordinate these efforts, so as to avoid carbon leakage.\~\~Two more issues to explain the very minimal consensus reached on climate by the G20. First is the increasingly serious power crunch in Europe and China, and now moving beyond those regions. The second issue is geopolitics, as shown clearly in the absence of key leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping from the summit, notwithstanding their crucial roles in reaching a coordinated solution to climate change. In short, the limited breakthroughs at the G20 Summit foreshadowed the difficulties of reaching consensus at COP26. Beyond the obviously different national interests, the power crunch is clearly not helping, let alone the very tense relations between the US and China. Moving forward, COP26 could mark a change in strategy as regards finding a solution to climate change by moving from a cooperative approach to one based on leverage. In that scenario, one should not dismiss the possibility of an alliance among the US, the UK and the European Union on taxing carbon, including overseas carbon, following the steps of the EU\' s newly approved HYPERLINK https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2021/july/cbam-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-eu-explained/Carbon Border Adjustment MechanismAlicia Garcia Herrero is senior research fellow at Bruegel and chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis.Junyu Tan is an economist at Natixis specializing in Asia thematic research.\l"

The COP26 or the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement on climate change reached in 2015, kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland. Global leaders are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions at the meeting delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with Xinhua, Dilhan Fernando, CEO of Dilmah Tea, said that Sri Lanka has suffered multiple economic challenges, and he called for international support in the form of climate finance and technology transfer to build renewable energy options, strengthen waste-to-energy systems, upgrade electricity distribution, or modernize public transport. In his opinion, Sri Lanka and other climate vulnerable countries are anticipating a major breakthrough at COP26. ""Without exaggeration, therefore, everything depends on COP26 ... Some of the collaboration and actions proposed in COP26 are critical for Sri Lanka,"" Fernando said. Sri Lanka is a signatory of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the current government has committed to generating 70 percent of energy supply from renewable sources by 2030. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced in September that the South Asian country would suspend building new coal energy capacity and target achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Fernando noted that Sri Lanka has a low per capita carbon emission of around 1.02 tons and a cumulative global contribution at 0.03 percent, but it ranks among the countries at very high risk of extreme weather events according to the Global Climate Risk Index. Fernando is also director of Dilmah Conservation, which is actively involved in advocacy for biodiversity conservation in Sri Lanka and has undertaken projects to create eco-friendly tea gardens and encourage sustainable energy generation. Fernando said that he thinks climate change threatens Sri Lanka's economic development in a range of sectors including agriculture, fisheries, livestock, and tourism. He believes that urgent intervention is needed to enhance climate resilience. ""The tourism appeal of Sri Lanka is significantly connected with its biodiversity, particularly where luxury or ecotourism is concerned. Sri Lanka's wealth lies in its beaches, forests, national parks, and culture which is intertwined with nature,"" Fernando said.

Mnangagwa said COP26 was coming at an extraordinary time in world history when many countries were still battling the COVID-19 pandemic while having to undertake immense changes to their economies to meet climate goals. The discussions at COP26 were going to be an important step in agreeing to a collective way forward, he added. ""For Zimbabwe, we feel the impact of climate change more than others. Our temperatures have risen by approximately 2 degrees Celsius over the past century - which has seen a significant increase in extreme weather. ""In the past two decades alone, we have had to deal with 10 droughts. If the world doesn't step up, we will see jobs lost, livelihoods destroyed, and people will lose their lives. ""That is something we must avoid and why Zimbabwe is coming to the table with ambitious plans to tackle climate change,"" he said. The Zimbabwean leader in September also warned that thousands of Zimbabweans would lose their jobs, and even their lives, if climate change was allowed to continue at the current pace. He said then that COP26 should be about action and the fulfillment of decisions of the past, while concrete financial support was essential to combat climate change beyond mere rhetoric. Enditem\l"

[Photo/Agencies]Details of Paris Agreement need to be ironed out at UN's summit in GlasgowIt will be more difficult to reach a climate-change deal at the United Nations' COP26 summit than it was finding consensus for the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the man in charge of the gathering that starts on Oct 31.Alok Sharma, the United Kingdom Cabinet minister who is also president of COP26, told The Guardian newspaper he is under no illusions about the size of the task ahead.""What we're trying to do here in Glasgow is actually really tough,"" he told the paper. ""It was brilliant what they did in Paris, it was a framework agreement, (but) a lot of the detailed rules were left for the future.""""It's like, we've got to the end of the exam paper and the most difficult questions are left and you're running out of time; the exam's over in half an hour and you go, 'How are we going to answer this one?'"" he said.National leaders and negotiating teams will be trying to find ways to limit the emission of greenhouse gases, to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5 C more than pre-industrial levels. Most greenhouse gases are attributed to the burning of fossil fuels, so finding ways to limit that will be a major part of the talks. But, with nations consuming more fossil fuels today than ever, and with less-developed countries pointing out that developed nations may want to compensate them for forgoing their industrial revolutions, there will likely be much compromising.""This is definitely harder than Paris on lots of levels,"" Sharma told The Guardian. "" (But) what we have going for us is that there is an understanding that we need to deal with this.""The UK published its road map to reducing its carbon footprint last week. Its net-zero strategy calls for $90 billion of mainly private-sector investment to be directed at its environmental initiatives.With Sharma highlighting the difficulty of the task ahead, high-profile climate activist Greta Thunberg told the BBC people should not pin all their hopes on governments improving the situation.

""This COP must be a moment of solidarity. The 100 billion U.S. dollars a year climate finance commitment in support of developing countries must become a 100 billion dollars climate finance reality,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his speech at the World Leaders Summit at COP26. ""This is critical to restoring trust and credibility,"" he said. In 2009, developed countries, who built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and have contributed most to the climate crisis, pledged 100 billion dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge. Recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. Guterres added that beyond the 100 billion dollars, developing countries need ""far greater resources"" to fight COVID-19, build resilience and pursue sustainable development. ""Visions will come true only when we act on them,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a written statement. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Xi said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country hosts the two-week climate gathering, said, ""while COP26 will not be the end of climate change, it can and it must mark the beginning of the end.""

"COP26","China","COP26_China34","Xinhua Headlines: COP26 ends with new global pact, developed countries urged to pay climate debt","November 14, 2021 Sunday 4:42 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Xinhua writers Xu Feng and Guo Shuang GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- As extreme weather events hit more frequently and the specter of a disastrous temperature rise looms, the just-concluded United Nations climate change conference has brought the world renewed hope. Nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which concluded Saturday after a one-day extension. Meanwhile, developed countries, whose industrialization is responsible for most of today's climate change impacts, were urged to pay their fair share. CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE ACTION COP26 was held at a time when the world has gone through a rapid-fire onslaught of climate change-related weather disasters, from severe flooding to wildfires. ""The climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. After six years of discussions, COP26 completed the technical negotiations on the so-called ""Paris Rulebook,"" which fixes the transparency and reporting requirements for all countries to track progress of their emission reduction targets. The rulebook also includes the Article 6, which establishes a robust framework for countries to exchange carbon credits and is expected to facilitate emissions reduction. ""COP26 resulted in the completion of the Paris Agreement rulebook and kept the Paris targets alive,"" the European Union said in a statement. The Glasgow Climate Pact ""will help kick-start a new journey of global efforts to tackle climate change,"" Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP26, told Xinhua. ""The new global deal, especially the finalization of the rulebook of the Paris Agreement, bears great significance for defending multilateralism and the implementation of the Paris Agreement,"" said Zhao, who is China's vice minister of ecology and environment. Negotiators at COP26 also agreed to phase down coal, the dominant source of carbon dioxide emissions in electricity generation. It is the first explicit mention of fossil fuels in a COP agreement. During COP26, more than 100 countries have promised to end deforestation by 2030. In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing actions on climate change in the 2020s, which has been widely welcomed and could galvanize global collective action. The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action within this decade. DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' CLIMATE DEBT Developed countries in 2009 pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not lived up to their promises. Recent reports indicate that this goal could be pushed back to 2023. In the new climate deal hammered out by COP26, there are commitments to significantly increasing financial support through the Adaptation Fund, with developed countries urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025. ""There is some progress. However, it still falls short of expectations. There remain lots of regrets. The developed nations have failed to well address the core concerns of developing countries over such issues as adaptation, finance and technological support,"" Zhao said. Guterres also urged developed countries to honor their climate finance commitment to restore political trust. ""No more IOUs,"" he said. ""We've been coming to the COP meetings ever so often. What we have seen is the leaders are making such good speeches ... but we cannot see commitment,"" Charles Nyambura, from Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, told Xinhua at COP26. ""It is not about giving us money. It is about paying climate debt. We want to see our people supported to build their resilience to tackle climate change,"" he said. It is ""pretty disheartening"" that the developed countries have failed to deliver their promises under the Paris Agreement, which has damaged the trust required for ""a real partnership,"" Federica Bietta, managing director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, told Xinhua. Instead of pointing the finger at others, Western countries should change their behavior, cut out fossil fuels and improve their energy efficiency, Carlos Martinez, a British author and political commentator, told Xinhua. ""Furthermore, they should actually be providing finance and assistance to developing countries."" CHINA WALKS THE TALK China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. As a country known for walking the talk, China has translated its commitments into real action. China's carbon intensity in 2020 was 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, which means that China had more than fulfilled its commitment of achieving a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from 2005 levels by 2020. The drop in carbon intensity means a total reduction of about 5.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2020, and demonstrates that China has largely reversed the rapid growth of its carbon dioxide emissions. Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, explained that the measures countries around the world have been taking to cut emissions usually include improving energy efficiency, optimizing the energy mix, developing renewable energy, adjusting its industrial structure and developing forest carbon sequestration. ""China's contribution in these said areas accounts for about 30 percent to 50 percent of the world's total,"" Xie said. According to the World Bank, China has accounted for more than half of the world's entire energy savings since 2005. China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, according to official statistics. The country is also the world's biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranking first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation, and has the largest nuclear power generating projects under construction. ""It's very clear China has been taking green sustainable development very seriously for many years, and has developed the concept of ecological civilization,"" said Martinez, the British commentator. ""China's been putting significant resources into all of these projects."" Martinez said that China's targets on carbon peaking and neutrality are ""very ambitious"" and China ""will continue to make remarkable progress towards the goals."" ""China is a country which has taken probably the biggest U-turn in the world by shifting towards this concept of eco-civilization, which is based on low carbon development, which is based on nature-based recovery,"" Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam told Xinhua during COP26. ""What China is doing and the whole concept of eco-civilization is not talk,"" Aslam said. ""It is action.""

More broadly, there are two main obstacles to attaining the world's stated climate goals. The first is geopolitical, exemplified by Russia's HYPERLINK use of natural gas as a strategic tool to divide Europe between those using nuclear power as an energy-transition technology and those using gas.

Universal owners such as large pension funds, for example, are increasingly aware of the systemic risks posed by climate change. In any case, the financial sector is coordinating to align itself more closely with the global climate agenda, as demonstrated by new initiatives such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, chaired by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

""I think the Glasgow COP26 is a turning point for the world. And it's the moment when we have to grow up and take our responsibilities,"" Johnson told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York following the closing of the Informal Leaders Roundtable on Climate Action. Calling on the rich countries to honor their pledge to provide each year 100 billion U.S. dollars for the climate action in the developing countries, the prime minister said that ""it is the developing world that is bearing the brunt of catastrophic climate change in the forms of hurricanes and fires and floods and the real long-term economic damage that they face."" ""It's the developed world that over 200 years has put the carbon in the atmosphere that is causing this acceleration of climate change and, say, it really is up to us to help them,"" he added. Earlier, Johnson told the roundtable that ""history will judge"" the world's richest nations if they fail to deliver on their pledge to commit 100 billion dollars in annual climate aid ahead of COP26.

"COP26","China","COP26_China43","Opinion: U.K., China Must Unite in Achieving COP26 Goals","November 5, 2021 Friday 3:55 AM GMT","Caixin Global","This autumn, global attention is focused on Kunming and Glasgow; with China hosting the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (COP15) last month, and now the U.K. welcoming the countries of the world to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) this week.These two events coinciding is a once in a generation opportunity to get the world back on track to address the enormous threat of climate change and biodiversity loss. It is also a demonstration of the vital leadership role that both the U.K and China have in addressing the climate emergency that humanity is facing.The U.K. has demonstrated its support for China's COP15. We had the strongest presence of any country, including an appearance and speech from His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. Both Prince Charles and President Xi made critical points around the need to protect and live in harmony with nature.The challenge posed by climate change is huge. But we know what we need to do; because China, the U.K. and the global community have already agreed on what we're aiming for. In 2015, the world signed the Paris Agreement, an international deal to tackle the climate crisis. That agreement commits us to limit global temperature rises to well below two degrees, aiming for 1.5 degrees, because the science tells us that would avoid the worst effects of climate change.However, since these targets were set, not nearly enough has been done. Estimates are that even if countries keep to their current emissions reduction targets, we are still on course for average temperature rises of 2.4 degrees.The stakes couldn't be higher. In the U.K., we are seriously concerned about the increased risks from flooding and extreme weather. I know that the Chinese people too were tragically affected by extreme weather events this year. Climate change is not simply a threat to future generations; it is a live issue affecting peoples' lives in the here and now.The recovery from Covid-19 presents us with a huge opportunity to reimagine our economies; and build a better future through green jobs.Over the past 30 years the U.K. has achieved the fastest decarbonization rate in the G-20 (44%) whilst growing our GDP by 78%. The U.K. and China can work together to make the case globally that greening our economies is not only the right thing to do for humanity, but also makes sound economic sense. As I said in my speech at China International Fair for Trade in Services, climate change could be the greatest commercial opportunity of all time. Global trade in low-carbon goods and services is expected to grow to over \£35 trillion by 2050.All of this is what makes the United Nations COP26 climate conference in Glasgow so critical.The U.K, China and the global community must unite behind four key goals this .First, we must work globally to put the world on a path to driving down emissions, until they reach net zero by the middle of this century. The U.K. and China must show leadership on this, and push for action on the most polluting sectors of our economies. The U.K. welcomes President Xi's commitment to stop building new coal projects abroad. If we are serious about the Paris Agreement goals, Glasgow must be the moment we consign coal power to history, and signal the end to polluting vehicles.China's expertise on this will be crucial - and its commercial relationship with the U.K. is key. China is already the world's largest electric vehicle market - the cost of electric vehicles is falling rapidly, in large part thanks to China's innovation in the sector. On offshore wind, the U.K. is home to the largest global market and has welcomed Chinese investment into this sector. The U.K. continues to partner with China to encourage growth of the domestic wind industry.Our second goal is to protect people and nature from the worst effects of climate change. The climate crisis is already with us and we must build flood defences, warning systems and other vital measures to minimize, avert and address the damage caused by climate change.The U.K.'s work with China under the Newton Fund is developing cutting edge techniques for simulating the future climate, building our understanding of future extreme weather scenarios. This helps the U.K. and China, and ultimately the global community manage risks, and predict events like typhoons up to a year in advance.Our third goal is finance, without which the task ahead is near impossible. Developed countries must deliver the $100 billion a year they promised to support developing countries. The U.K. is leading by example, having committed \£311.6 billion between 2021 and 2025.We must also make finance easier to access and increase the sums available to protect people and nature. The U.K. and China have maintained long-standing partnerships on green finance since 2015, supported by the vice-premier level U.K. China Economic and Financial Dialogue. At the 10th Dialogue the U.K and China reiterated their recognition of each other as their primary partner in green finance, and capital raising.Fourth, we must work together to deliver on these goals. That includes building consensus among governments. We must bring businesses and civil society on board behind our COP26 goals, and build international collaboration in critical sectors. Our engagement with 200-plus Chinese businesses in the run up to COP26 has led to four major Chinese companies joining the U.N.'s Race to Zero Initiative.Collaboration between China and the U.K on climate change already showcases some of the best achievements of our bilateral relationship.Last month saw the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China taking up the Chinese seat at the U.N. Both of our countries occupy a position of responsibility in the multilateral system; and we must therefore show leadership. The U.N.'s COP26 is the best opportunity we've had in a generation to do so. The world hopes to see the highest levels of leadership and commitment possible from China.Carol"

The amount of CO produced when a given fuel is burned is largely a function of the elements it\' s comprised of. Natural gas is mostly carbon and hydrogen. This combination has a very high energy content relative to other fuels, and so, it produces relatively less CO emissions for each unit of energy burning it generates.Impurities such as sulphur, which are common in coal, increase how much CO is generated for each unit of heat. This means even the highest quality coal produces double the CO emissions of natural gas per unit of energy.Energy demand is closely linked with productivity. As economies like China and India rapidly grow and develop, their energy demand is expected to HYPERLINK rise in tandem. But their ability to follow the UK in switching from coal to natural gas as a primary source of electricity generation is limited because they have comparatively less natural gas.

The ""Road to Renewables"" bus tour set off from Northumberland Park bus garage in north London, one of Europe's largest overnight charging garages for electric buses. The vehicle used on the tour is a pure electric double-decker, built in Britain by Chinese clean energy car maker BYD, and the UK's largest bus and coach manufacturer Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL). It has a range of 160 miles, meaning it could get from London to Sheffield on a single charge. It is the UK's best-selling electric double-decker bus, and one of 1,000 BYD ADL electric buses already on the road or on order. The bus will reach Glasgow three days before the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference begins in the Scottish city. On the tour, participants will meet green engineers at a 500MW offshore windfarm at Greater Gabbard, the UK's most easterly point, as well as the businesses and local authorities driving the decarbonization of cities like Oxford and Peterborough. A fleet of ADL-BYD's electric single-deck vehicles will serve as shuttles for delegates at the COP26 conference. Trudy Harrison, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Transport, said the bus tour launch event on Monday was ""a wonderful example of the collaboration and innovation"" required to reach emissions targets that came just before COP26. The British government has recently pledged further investment to support the switch to cleaner vehicles. Paul Davies, ADL's President and Managing Director, told Xinhua that by working with BYD, one of the biggest battery companies in the world, it has been able to bring world-leading technology to the UK and fast-track zero emissions agendas for clean energy buses. ""Before BYD the bus battery technology in the UK was very immature,"" he explained. ""China has been the starting point for new energy vehicles. We're very proud to partner with them here in the UK for electric buses."" The cooperation has been very successful, he added: the two companies have delivered 500 electric buses since 2016, and by the end of this year the number will reach 1,000, which is ""incredibly fast."" Green energy buses are also playing an important role in achieving net zero (emissions) targets, by supporting thousands of skilled green jobs.

While more than 450 banks and other financial institutions have signed up, major Chinese, Russian and Indian ones have not, and Chinese banks are the biggest investors in coal. However, returns on investments in renewables are now said to exceed those for fossil fuels, and reports indicate that green investments this year outranked those of fossil fuels for the first time, so the tide may be shifting. Away from the speeches, the meetings and the negotiations of COP26, the world's media were just as interested in what was happening on the streets of Glasgow. Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old Swedish activist, was one of thousands of young people who skipped school and marched in the Scottish city to demand change. They took to the streets on the first Friday of the conference in honour of the Fridays for Future movement that swept Thunberg to global attention. With protest marches being held across the globe, the activists put forward an agenda far more radical than the incremental steps being haggled over by bureaucrats. Brandishing banners with slogans such as ""End Climate Betrayal"", they called for the abandonment of fossil fuels and, as Thunberg memorably put it, an end to ""blah, blah, blah"". Keeping the global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels was a central aim of the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1937837/historic-paris-deal-climate-change-signed-175-statesParis Agreement adopted in 2015. Research released during COP26 indicated that even when pledges at the event were factored in, a 2.4 \'b0C rise was likely - with all the consequences, such as more HYPERLINK extreme weather events, that go with it. ""Many countries are taking action and are cutting emissions or limiting them more than they would've done if we had carried on with business as usual,"" said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeClimate Change and the Environment. ""[But] there needs to be greater ambition and more concrete action being taken on the ground to give people confidence these pledges are going to be delivered by 2025 or 2030."" For an event with a name that includes two acronyms, it is perhaps appropriate that a dizzying array of initials were employed at COP26 (26th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, or United Nations Framework Convention on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeClimate Change). As well as GFANZ, the banker-turned-UN-climate-envoy Mark Carney was promoting the Taskforce on Scaling up Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), which encourages the private sector to invest in carbon offsets. Other Glasgow initiatives included the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA, aiming to end oil and gas), the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM, which focuses on phasing out coal) and the First Movers' Coalition (FMC, which promotes climate-friendly research and development). Add to these many non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), which released a report saying that meat and dairy consumption reductions were essential to limit HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change. Coal is the biggest offender among the fossil fuels when it comes to climate change, being responsible for about 14 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020. Ahead of COP26, the G20 pledged to stop financing coal abroad by the end of this year, while in Glasgow, 46 nations agreed to phase it out, with developed nations to end its use by the 2030s and other nations by the 2040s. Non-signatories included, however, some of the biggest coal users: HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/japanJapan, HYPERLINK India, the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-statesUnited States and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/chinaChina, which is home to about half the planet's coal-fired power generation capacity. Japan has not committed to phasing out coal, although it plans to get less than one fifth of its electricity from the fuel by 2030, down from 30 per cent now. There may be hints of movement in China, which back in September promised to stop financing foreign coal projects. ""President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/xi-jinpingXi Jinping has started talking about controlling coal consumption in China,"" Ward said. Speaking of hints of movement, Wednesday's surprise announcement that the US and China would boost climate cooperation over the coming decade could herald further shifts by the world's two biggest emitters. A joint declaration included commitments to cooperate on cutting methane emissions; protecting forests; improving technology and information exchanges; and ramping up the use of renewable energies. It also promised the establishment of a working group tasked with enhancing climate action in the 2020s. Both sides were keen to play the agreement up, having faced criticisms throughout the conference of doing too little. John Kerry, the US climate change envoy, described the declaration as ""only the beginning"", while Xie Zhenhua, China's chief climate negotiator, vowed the countries would ""jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation"". However, the declaration offered little in the way of new quantitative targets, prompting some scepticism over how much of a breakthrough the declaration really represents. Negotiations on how to trade emissions reduction units have continued into the final days of COP26, highlighting the difficulties linked to an issue that has remained unresolved since the Paris Agreement. Referred to in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, carbon markets will become increasingly important as countries look to achieve net zero while continuing to burn fossil fuels. Many of the roadblocks to agreement concerned how to deal with historical units and those that fell outside each country's nationally determined contributions - their submitted proposals for limiting carbon emissions. There is also the issue of how to prevent double counting, which could happen when emissions reductions are transferred between nations. ""It's clear there's widespread acknowledgement double counting would be a bad idea,"" said Ward. Additional reporting by Owen ChurchillCopyright (c) 2021. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

The goal to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, highlighted in the Paris Agreement on climate change and driven home at last November\' s COP26 gathering in Glasgow, is now on  life support and  in intensive care, the UN chief told the Economist Sustainability Summit.According to the top UN official, while some progress was made at COP26 last year,  the enormous emissions gap underscored the fact that  the main problem was not solved  it was not even properly addressed.  Keeping 1.5 alive requires a 45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by mid-century, he said.Based on current national commitments, however, global emissions are set to increase by almost 14 percent in the next eight years.Last year alone, global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 6 percent  to their highest levels in history, Guterres said, as coal emissions surged  to record highs.  In our globally connected world, no country and no corporation can insulate itself from these levels of chaos. Noting that developed and emerging G20 economies account for 80 percent of all global emissions, he drew attention to a high dependence on coal but underscored that  our planet can\' t afford a climate blame game. No finger pointingReferring to developed countries, Guterres said they must not put the onus on emerging economies to accelerate their transition nor should emerging economies respond by saying:  You exported carbon-intensive heavy industrial activities to us in return for cheaper goods.  We can\' t point fingers while the planet burns. Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use, Guterres insisted.  This is madness.

Setting out the plans, the British government said it would support 440,000 well-paid jobs and leverage up 90 billion pounds in private investment by 2030, meanwhile reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels which has put the country at risk of global price spikes. Supporting the delivery of the strategy, Britain's first Net Zero Research and Innovation Framework was also revealed on the same day, which sets out key net zero research and innovation priority areas for the UK over the next 5-10 years.

There are proposals to reduce the use of fossil fuels which are not favoured by the oil and coal producing countries, which do not wish to compromise their commercial interests. This was quite evident recently in the US Congress grilling oil producers and the remarks of the Norwegian government in response to demands made by some environmentalists to cut down oil exploration. Rather than phasing out fossil fuels and unsustainable HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3138312/avert-climate-crisis-governments-need-reinvent-meatmeat production, some countries are using every opportunity to protect their corporate interests and continue with business as usual while the planet burns. The other stumbling block to achieve any fair and equitable global policy is the issue of per capita consumption of energy. There is about a thousand-fold difference in the per capita consumption of electricity of the richest and the poorest countries. According to the Climate Transparency report, the G20 countries are responsible for 75 per cent of global emissions. The issue that would probably receive the most attention are the financial subsidies from developed nations to developing nations that were promised during COP15 in Copenhagen and COP21 in Paris, and which have not yet been honoured.

She also made a plea to the world leaders ""to turn pledges into action."" ""If western leaders listen, engage and act decisively on what science demands of them, there is still time to make COP26 the success it desperately needs to be,"" she wrote in an article published by British daily The Financial Times Monday. ""The inconvenient truth of our times is that while action on climate change has never been more urgent and achievable, governments are not cutting emissions fast enough to keep nations such as mine safe,"" Hasina wrote in her article titled ""Bangladesh PM: We need a global 'climate prosperity plan' not empty pledges."" She was critical of the western world ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, which is slated to be held in Glasgow, Scotland between Oct. 31 and Nov. 12. The developed nations are not taking seriously the needs of the countries most immediately affected by climate change, she said. In the north of Bangladesh, millions depend on fresh water stored every year in the Himalayan ice fields, ""which warming air is now destabilising."" In the south, sea level rise is exacerbating the threat from coastal flooding. Falling crop yields are another destructive change ""we can anticipate"", she said. Earlier this year, Hasina said that her government cancelled plans for 10 coal-fired power plants but that was a relatively small step. ""Subsequently, with COP26 in view, we developed the world's first national 'climate prosperity plan' -- a vision under which we will enhance resilience, grow our economy, create jobs and expand opportunities for our citizens, using action on climate change as the catalyst."" Under the plan, she said, they will obtain 30 percent of energy from renewables by the end of the decade. The plan is expected to simultaneously prevent up to 6.8 percent of the economic damage that would otherwise come not only from climate change but also increasingly uneconomic fossil fuel infrastructure. ""I believe more developing nations will adopt such plans in the coming months and years, led by members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum,"" Hasina wrote. ""This year's COP26 summit in Glasgow is the best opportunity we will ever have to make one,"" she mentioned. Although recent net-zero pledges from the European Union, the United States and others are welcome, she said that the 100 billion U.S. dollars per year finance pledge made 12 years ago remains unfulfilled. ""Nor is their repeated refusal to take seriously the needs of those nations most immediately affected. Agreement to support the poorest in dealing with the losses and damages caused by climate change is far removed from implementation,"" she continued. ""If developed nations wish to help they must address this. Cutting the cost of capital will substantially accelerate decarbonisation across the global south, yielding worldwide benefits."" ""If western leaders can not see the logic of this, perhaps recent events in their own backyards will help - for what were the extreme forest fires seen in North America and Australia or Germany's recent lethal floods, if not alarm bells clanging in regions of the world most responsible for climate change?"" she wrote.

US-China relations have been fractious in recent years, and whether they can cooperate on climate action is crucial to success at COP26 and beyond.US progress on climate change went backwards under the Donald Trump administration, but President Joe Biden has brought the nation back to the table. Biden wants to cooperate with China in this critical policy sphere, raising hopes of a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/trumps-trade-war-what-was-it-good-for-not-much-147247less adversarial bilateral relationship.Throughout 2021, however, US-China relations have become increasingly strained.

He will pursue ambitious national initiatives and international cooperation, including with China.On again-off againIn April this year, Biden sent US climate envoy John Kerry to China to discuss collective climate action. During the visit, the two countries released a HYPERLINK joint statement declaring a commitment to cooperation.But by September, China\' s tune had changed. Last month, during Kerry\' s second visit to China, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi HYPERLINK declared that cooperation on climate change cannot be divorced from the overall situation of China-US relations.This statement implied that China would withhold cooperation on climate change until the US gave ground on https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/during-latest-exchange-china-presents-us-with-2-lists-of-grievances/broader strategic issuesBut as ever, the relationship is complex. Shortly after Kerry\' s visit to China, Biden and Xi HYPERLINK https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1906035.shtmlspoke on the phone covering topics including climate change. Two weeks later, Xi announced that China will no longer build new coal-fired power projects abroad.But we cannot deduce from this announcement that China has decided to cooperate with the US on climate. China has been scaling back its financing of coal-fired power stations abroad HYPERLINK https://pekingnology.substack.com/p/guest-post-does-chinese-funding-reallyfor years.Fork in the roadCooperation between China and the US will remain highly unpredictable. The key question is whether competition between the two nations on climate action will be constructive or destructive.Under a HYPERLINK https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3826681constructive scenario, the US and China would compete to ramp up their investments in clean energy, advance their technological capabilities and build internationally competitive industries. They would also compete to help emerging countries reduce their emissions.China and the US would both seek to prove the superiority of their respective governance models by making rapid progress on climate change. In other words, does China\' s party-state, quasi-communist model offer the most desirable path forward? Or is the US model of democratic capitalism the better option?By contrast, destructive competition between the US and China would have dire consequences for the climate. First, it would make the international flow and diffusion of green technologies difficult. For example, the US controls advanced semiconductor technologies required for electric vehicles while China is leading the world in EV battery technologies. If the nations began restricting tech exports to each other, advancement in electric vehicles would significantly slow.It may also become more complex to establish global standards for new major clean energy technologies such as offshore wind systems. Global markets for particular clean energy technologies would become fractured and much smaller than they would otherwise be.With a reduced market size, new climate technologies and products would then take longer to become affordable, slowing their global uptake.Second, an effective system for global climate governance requires most nations, if not all, to participate. Yet without trust between the US and China, such a system would be untenable.Finally, the domestic climate actions of both the US and China may be adversely affected if tension between the two countries intensifies.In the US, HYPERLINK https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-plays-the-climate-card-john-kerry-wang-yi-11630620246hawkish politicians and mediaThe ruling CPC would likely face rising nationalist sentiment against further climate actions which would be viewed as caving in to US demands.

[Photo/Agencies]COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow at the end of October, claiming global COVID vaccine distribution makes attendance unequal.The talks, delayed by a year because of the pandemic, run from Oct 31 to Nov 12, and aim to help countries progress toward the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, in a bid to limit the impact of climate change.Usually, such a gathering would attract delegates from nearly 200 countries, but with so many places still facing major COVID-19 crises, or having limited vaccine programs, protesters calling themselves the Climate Action Network (CAN) say it is wrong for the summit to go ahead.""Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks,"" CAN Executive Director Tasneem Essop told the Reuters news agency.With the issue of climate change having been so visibly demonstrated by extreme weather conditions all over the world this year, the issue's already high stakes were raised further this summer by a report from the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, compiled in conjunction with 234 authors and 195 governments.It said it was now a ""statement of fact"" that humanity is damaging the climate, and it is ""unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land"".UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the findings a ""code red"" warning for humanity and said it increased the burden of responsibility on those taking part in the Glasgow summit. ""There is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success,"" he added.In response to the vaccine protest, a spokesperson for Guterres said the proven urgent nature of the COP26 agenda meant that there was no way it could be delayed any further.""The global scientific community has made clear that climate change is now a global emergency and only an urgent and major step-up in climate action can keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach and protect the most vulnerable countries and communities from worsening climate impacts,"" he said.The British government has begun delivering vaccines to conference delegates to enable them to be vaccinated in time for the event to take place, but CAN said it has not acted fast enough.Alok Sharma, the British government representative overseeing the summit, said anyone needing to quarantine would have their costs paid by the government, so the talks could go ahead as planned.""Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority ... if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow,"" he said.\l"

Officials see the G20 Summit as ""setting the tone for Glasgow"" and a key venue for world leaders to meet informally and iron out differences ahead of COP26. ""[Xi's absence] would definitely undermine the potential for a transformational outcome in Glasgow and the G20 agreements needed to support it,"" said one climate negotiator, who did not wish to be named. An EU official involved in preparing for COP26 said it would not be ideal, but not cataclysmic, given that normal arrangements had been shelved during the pandemic. The official said that from Brussels' perspective, the momentum was there for progress, but ""summitry is a delicate interplay of factors"" that could easily be derailed. The sources said EU climate chief Frans Timmermans had built up a good rapport with China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and Vice-Premier Han Zheng over working-level discussions and that rapport continued even as the US killed climate dialogue with China during the Trump era. At the Conservative Party conference last week, new British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""It is important that China is part of the solution on HYPERLINK climate change, of course it is, and you know we want them to be engaged on that, but I can't comment on the precise attendance of COP26."" HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change, COP26 and the G20 Summit may also be a missed opportunity to help repair ties between China and the United States and European Union. Both Western powers have sought face time with Xi this year but may have to make do with phone calls instead. ""The absence of certain leaders is unlikely to impact the G20 Summit outcome. It will, however, prevent progress on a number of other important bilateral issues that would normally occur during the breaks,"" said Kelly Ann Shaw, lead US negotiator on the US-China phase one trade deal, and G7 and G20 Sherpa under the Trump administration. ""It was on the margins of the 2018 G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, for example, that the US and China agreed to launch trade negotiations. Without the G20 or COP26, it's not clear when President Xi and President [Joe] Biden will meet, or what that means for how the world's most important economic relationship will unfold next,"" said Shaw, now a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells.

""It's a really good opportunity to talk frankly and openly and to develop the conversation as you go."" Experts recalled former US president Barack Obama's dramatic intervention in climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 as an example of what could be done when leaders were on the ground, rather than on screen. Obama burst into a closed-door meeting of leaders from China, India and Brazil to force a climate agreement late in the day, despite the objections of officials from the three countries. ""At the end of the day, Xi is the one who gives the political green light, and at some stage the top guys have to decide,"" former EU trade chief Herv\'e9 Jouanjean said. ""They make the decisions and they have information that you as a negotiator do not have. At big summits like this, it often comes down to the top guys."" Jeff Moon, former US consul general in Chengdu and now head of consultancy China Moon Strategies, pointed to the early exchanges between former leaders Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon that led to the normalisation of relations, despite the tense geopolitical times. ""Mao said to Nixon, you may hear some anti-American stuff but don't worry about it. I don't know what the analogue is now, but I can imagine there are topics that are extremely sensitive,"" Moon said. ""Being on screen is better than nothing, but it's not one to one. The number of staffers looking and hearing is very large. And one-to-one, with only their top aides, is a really important way to communicate your priorities."" The meetings also come as China's reputation in the West is at its lowest point in 30 years. Opinion polls across Europe and the US show growing distrust in China's role in global affairs, even as Beijing itself has tried to take a leading role in climate change initiatives. An EU official said the distrust undermined China's recent decision to HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3149686/china-halts-new-coal-fired-power-plants-abroad-boost-climatestop overseas funding for coal-fired plants, as well as its announcement in September 2020 that it would become carbon neutral by 2060.

As the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, the US and China need to ""show the way"", Kerry said. ""We need to raise ambition and we need to take action in this decisive decade."" The joint declaration also announced the establishment of a working group tasked with enhancing climate action in the 2020s. The group will meet regularly to discuss ""concrete actions"" such as technical exchanges, meetings of governmental and non-governmental experts, and scrutiny of how the joint declaration's provisions were being instituted. Wednesday's agreement was the result of more than 30 virtual and in-person meetings between US and Chinese climate officials over the past year, Xie Zhenhua, China's chief climate negotiator, said. Both sides committed to ""enhanced climate action in the 2020s under the framework of the Paris agreement,"" Xie said, telling reporters that a ""gap"" remained between current efforts by China and the US and the goals laid out in the 2015 agreement. Under the Paris accord, countries committed to keep global temperature increases between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. ""We will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national circumstances to accelerate a green, low-carbon transition and technological innovation, in order to fill the gap,"" Xie said. The declaration also includes a commitment by China to develop a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" plan on methane reductions before the COP27 summit, expected to take place in Egypt next November. But it does not include an updated commitment by China to reach peak emissions before its current target of 2030, which Kerry has previously said is too late. While the joint declaration offered little in the way of new quantitative targets, it was seen as a boon to efforts to secure an ambitious outcome from the Glasgow meetings, where negotiations are under way to develop new rules to keep HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change in check. ""The announcement is indeed important and the significance is that it happened at all,"" said Kelly Sims Gallagher, academic dean and director of the climate policy lab at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ""The fact the two countries could find a way to release a joint statement at a time when the bilateral relationship is so strained sends an energising signal to the COP26 negotiators because it demonstrates that these two major emitters can still work together,"" she said. UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres welcomed the declaration, posting on Twitter: ""Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction."" Cecilia Han Springer, senior researcher at Boston University's Global China Initiative, called the agreement ""quite comprehensive"" but said the stand-out provisions were those concerning the methane cuts. ""Methane is really the key and exciting area to see this cooperation, because both countries are facing major problems from greenhouse gas emissions, and methane in particular,"" she said. ""There's a lot of technical exchange that can be done."" The surprise announcement came despite repeated warnings from Chinese officials that Washington should not expect their cooperation on issues like HYPERLINK climate change and nuclear non-proliferation while tensions remain in other areas. Such tensions flared again last week when US President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/joe-bidenJoe Biden accused China of having ""walked away"" from the climate issue, after Chinese President Xi Jinping chose not to attend the COP26 summit in person. Asked whether US concerns about forced labour in China's solar energy supply chain had come up in talks ahead of the joint statement, Kerry said that the Biden administration had been ""honest"" and articulated its differences with China, but indicated that he hoped to keep climate talks insulated from such grievances. ""My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward,"" he said. Kerry likened US-China collaboration on climate action to efforts by Washington and the former Soviet Union to scale down their nuclear arsenals during the Cold War, even as then-President Ronald Reagan called the USSR an ""evil empire"". While the US would not ignore its grievances with China, Kerry said that the climate agenda ""must be free of that in order to be effective"" and induce more countries to take needed actions.

The ongoing negligence and lack of decisive steps from governments and politicians should be identified or even penalised if proper action is not taken to avert the destruction of our planet. We are not talking about hypothetical delusions, such as the threat of being invaded by aliens, but the actual consequences of our own unrestrained consumerism that are literally set to kill us. Sadly, the neoliberal set at the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/cop26COP26 climate conference in Glasgow decided to engage in, to quote Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, ""a two week celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah"" - at a huge cost to UK taxpayers.

With 45,264 of the 53,374 tonnes of carbon dioxide generated at past COP conferences coming from air travel to the meeting, and streets around the venue clogged with chauffeur-driven vehicles, many with their engines idling, according to a reporter at the scene, the summit would have been better off opting for a virtual format. Nevertheless, US President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/joe-bidenJoe Biden and the rest of the Western political class portrayed Chinese President Xi Jinping HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3154634/xi-jinping-makes-big-mistake-not-showing-cop26-says-bidenas a villain for not attending the event, although Beijing had a delegation on the ground and announced a HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3153785/china-issues-plan-path-peak-emissions-and-carbon-neutral-goalnew action plan ahead of COP26. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change requires unbending determination and sustained action, not empty slogans, unchanging policies, luxury motorcades and crowded entourages,"" said Zhang Jun, China's senior envoy to the United Nations. The US-China joint declaration agreed at Glasgow is far more important than COP26 itself, especially as, according to Gideon Rachman at the Financial Times, ""the UN climate process is designed to fail"". In fact, while the UK government sought to host ""the most inclusive COP ever"", environmental activists have labelled the event ""the most exclusionary ever"" in part because of the lack of participants from the Global South. The two biggest economies and polluters, the US and China, have a responsibility to the rest of the world. While the two countries seem to prefer to clash with each other, a pattern repeated in the first week of the summit, we are now at a point when they must cooperate to save not only themselves, but also those who are indirectly dependent on them. In other words, they need to prove their global leadership. This should include helping Africa, which according to the World Metrological Organization, HYPERLINK https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/climate-change-triggers-mounting-food-insecurity-poverty-and-displacement-africahas warmed at a faster rate than the global average. Notably, Africa's 54 nations contribute only about 3 per cent of global emissions, while the Group of 20 countries are responsible for almost 80 per cent of global greenhouse gases and an equal amount of carbon dioxide. The Global North HYPERLINK https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30196-0/fulltextaccounts for 92 per cent of excess carbon emissions since the dawn of the industrial age. It is unfair to allow those who have done the least to cause HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change to suffer most from its impact. Since developed nations have so far been reluctant to acknowledge financial responsibility for the years of emissions that contributed to climate change while they rose to economic prosperity, the US and China should take a lead in raising the needed funds. First, they should immediately address the shortfall in the US$100 billion a year that rich nations pledged in 2009 to provide for developing countries by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change. The US and China should ensure that developed countries immediately scale up their aid efforts. The world does not have the luxury of waiting until the new date of 2023 for a promise that was made years ago. Second, vulnerable nations should be offered compensation for climate-linked losses and damage, as initially promised in 1992 in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The International Mechanism for Loss and Damage was introduced in 2013 at COP19 in Warsaw, and a group responsible for providing technical assistance to countries making damage claims, known as the Santiago Network, was created in 2019 at COP25 in Madrid. However, the network seems to be inactive. Although it is difficult to estimate how much would be needed to cover economic losses arising out of climate devastation, one study suggests it could amount to US$580 billion each year by the end of 2030, and could rise to US$1 trillion by 2040. While the cost of averting climate injustice is high, the cost of further inaction is significantly higher and the damage irreversible. Progress on these issues can be made through the US and China's joint economic clout, yet it requires the political will on both sides to put their differences aside. As F\'e9lix Tshisekedi, chair of the African Union, warned, the global fight against climate change ""can't be won unless it is won in Africa"", inhabited by 1.3 billion people. Washington and Beijing plan to establish a working group that will ""meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade"". Policymakers in both capitals would be well-advised to take Tshisekedi's words to heart. Indeed, ""every step matters"" - as US climate envoy John Kerry put it - in this long journey to save the planet and the human species.

"COP26","China","COP26_China69","World Insights: 3 key issues to watch out for COP26","October 31, 2021 Sunday","People's Daily Online - English","As the United Nations (UN) climate conference, billed as a ""turning point for humanity,"" begins in Glasgow on Sunday, several issues are considered by environment experts to be critical: global carbon market, climate finance, and actual implementation. During the delayed 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change (COP26), which is the first conference after the five-year review cycle under the Paris Agreement inked in 2015, global leaders are expected to review overall progress and plan future actions. The conference, lasting two weeks, also comes at a time when the world has gone through a rapid-fire onslaught of climate-change-related weather disasters, from severe flooding to wild fires. To make the climate gathering meaningful, progress has to be made on such fundamental issues as finalizing the rules for the Paris Agreement's market mechanism, wealthy countries' unmet finance pledge to the developing countries, and the ability of the world's governments to transform words into action. ""PARIS RULEBOOK"" In 2015, COP21 in Paris passed a climate deal uniting almost all countries across the world in agreeing to cap global warming at well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. While Paris climate agreement was hailed as ""historic, durable and ambitious,"" negotiators have failed to agree on Article 6 of the deal, which is about some technical details of the implementation of the deal in building the market mechanisms, especially the global carbon market. COP25 in Madrid failed again to reach an agreement on Article 6. Without working out final details of what has been referred to ""The Paris Rulebook,"" the world's governments lack the necessary market-based approaches to attain the grand goals laid out in the Paris Agreement. ""Getting these rules right is critical for fighting climate change: depending on how they are structured, Article 6 could help the world avoid dangerous levels of global warming or let countries off the hook from making meaningful emissions cuts,"" said the World Resources Institute, a global research non-profit organization. ""I see a COP that is being pushed by developing nations. They want solutions, they want the rule book to be complete to start implementing the Paris Agreement,"" Gibson Mwangi, an expert on climate change from Kenya, told Xinhua. Discussions around Article 6 have long been dominated by issues like how to avoid double counting of emission reductions. All eyes are on COP26 to see if it will solve them and produce the much-needed Paris Rulebook. CLIMATE FINANCE Developed countries built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and have contributed most to the climate crisis, from which lower-income countries now disproportionately suffer even though they have done little to cause climate change. To pay their climate debt, wealthy countries in 2009 pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on the pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023. The Tursday-published Foreign Affairs magazine said in an article that the wealthy countries' commitment reflected in part a recognition of ""the deep injustice at the heart of the climate crisis."" A UN-appointed independent expert group on climate finance said in a report published in December that this commitment is ""the bedrock of the entire international climate finance system."" ""We hope the western countries would meet their financial pledges, and we all hope that this conference will succeed because it will bring good to the whole world,"" Magdy Tawfik Khalil, professor of environment at Ain Shams University in Cairo, told Xinhua. He explained that people in North Africa are concerned about future ice melt due to global warming that would raise the level of the Mediterranean Sea or any sea, which in turn would submerge coastal areas and many cities. ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION As COP26 gets underway, experts have underscored the importance of translating high ambitions into concrete actions. ""The climate summit in Glasgow is the last attempt to avoid a catastrophe and reach an agreement on climate change,"" Ivana Antunovic Jovic, editor at Croatian Television, told Xinhua. ""There have already been many similar gatherings, but there are no results, and the consequences of climate change are becoming more visible,"" she said. ""In recent years, we have witnessed the United States ignoring the (climate) problem during the former administration. I hope that the new administration will understand the problem and try to solve it,"" Croatian climatologist Tomislav Peric told Xinhua. In his phone conversation on Friday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China is unwaveringly committed to accelerating green and low-carbon development, and has always walked its talk. China submitted two documents on its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and long-term emission control strategies to the UN this week. It aims to strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Last month at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, China also pledged that the country will not build new coal-fired power stations overseas. It is never easy for a developing country with a population of more than 1.4 billion that has not completed industrialization or urbanization to make such promises. China will complete the world's most dramatic reduction in carbon emission intensity, and realize carbon neutrality from carbon peaking in the shortest time in global history. But the actual results have showed that China is serious about pursuing green development, and is honoring its pledges with an aim to contribute to humanity's better shared future. For example, the country's carbon intensity in 2020 was 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, exceeding its commitment of achieving a reduction of 40-45 percent in carbon intensity during the same period. ""The pandemic has really raised the urgency. We recognize now more than ever that human well-being and planetary well-being are intrinsically linked with each other,"" Akanksha Khatri, head of Nature and Biodiversity at World Economic Forum, told Xinhua. ""The real negotiations, of course, take place behind closed doors. I hope everyone at the table can get over their tensions, in the interest of the whole Earth,"" said Leo Meyer, former project leader at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and current director of Dutch-based ClimateContact Consultancy.\l"

Pillars of the financial establishment such as Wall Street titan Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, are coming round to this way of thinking.

Either that, Fink added, or they must ""reinvent existing multilateral development banks"" such as the World Bank. They must do this, he argued, because private and public financial institutions are not mobilising anywhere near enough money to get the job done in time. Former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz has said much the same. ""A new global climate institution could both manage risks better, catalyse projects, and help facilitate a significant increase in the flow of funds that will help the emerging markets economies, developing countries face HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change,"" the Columbia University professor suggested. It is not only developing nations - China and India especially - that need such intervention, however. The United States, Japan and Russia are also at the top of the big league of carbon dioxide emitters.Even advanced economies lack the authority and institutional structure to marshal funds behind saving our planet from the ravages of HYPERLINK global warming. There is no global climate tsar to oversee economic transformation. No one is in charge - and that is a recipe for confusion and disaster. This has been highlighted as the world finds itself facing a ""winter of discontent"" with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3151021/asia-braces-fallout-china-and-europe-face-energy-crunchglobal power shortages HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3153028/chinas-power-crisis-beijing-draws-plans-increase-coal-outputstep up coal outputFor this reversal, we should blame not only China but the uncoordinated rush by many nations to cut coal and nuclear power generation while relying on still-inadequate supplies of natural gas and alternative energy such as solar and wind power. Global energy shortages and soaring prices are the result. The world is putting its faith in COP26, yet such gatherings are in reality a cop-out because they do not recognise the need for concerted action. Countries are no more capable of acting alone in the borderless world of climate change than companies.

Almost anything labelled ""green"" - be it ESG, SDGs, impact investing, ethical investing or whatever - is eagerly sought after by investors and vigorously promoted by asset managers. But it is little more than a diversion. That people like Fink are urging intervention by multilateral development banks such as the World Bank is tacit acknowledgement of this, given that BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and others have untold billions invested in ESG stocks and sustainable investments.

"COP26","China","COP26_China73","UAE must learn from UK\u8217 s COP26 when it takes climate leadership","November 18, 2021 Thursday 5:33 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","With hindsight it seems incredible that, until now, ever since COP1 in 1995 the words  coal and  fossil fuel have failed to make the cut in the final reports of any of the Conferences of the Parties to the UN\' s Framework Convention on Climate Change.That would be like a report by the World Health Organization on the global response to Covid-19 failing to mention the SARS-CoV-2 virus \- unthinkable.As every schoolchild in the world surely knows, the climate-change catastrophe looming over the planet has been generated by the unfettered burning of fossil fuels \- coal, oil and gas \- since the dawn of the coal-powered Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.The annual failure of COP delegates to acknowledge the fossilized elephant in the room has, of course, been the product not of ignorance, but of the myriad social and economic pressures, experienced by multiple countries at different stages of development.Forget elephants, the animal present at every COP for the past quarter of a century has been a giant ostrich, with its head buried deep in the ground. At Glasgow, the ostrich was finally allowed to raise its head, albeit only for a brief peak at reality. Even then, attempts to overthrow King Coal were watered down by last-minute interventions from its loyal subjects, China and India.What the world needs now, more than anything else, is compelling leadership.One\~announcement\~to come out of Glasgow was that COP28 in 2023 would be staged in the United Arab Emirates,\~home to the UN-created International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). This isn\' t the first time the COP roadshow has traveled to the Middle East \- in 2012 COP18 was held in Doha \- but a decade on the climate-change landscape has changed utterly.Doha was not insignificant. It was one of a series of dull but necessary COPs that paved the way toward the Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was the first time that developing countries signed up to a legal obligation to reduce their emissions.The Paris Agreement was to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To achieve that, the world needs to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 26 billion metric tons every year between now and 2030. To say that the total emission-reduction pledges scraped together in Glasgow of just over 6 billion tons fell short is to understate the huge gap between ambition and commitment.It highlights the monumental scale of the challenge for the country presiding over these conferences. That the UK\' s president Alok Sharma was almost in tears as he announced the watered-down deal goes some way to illustrate the personal and institutional commitments required by the host. The kind of leadership needed to rally the world\' s nations and their disparate interests to commit to an agreement often appears beyond possibility. Then there is the task of making sure the outcomes and expectations of any COP event are stuck to.The UK had to draw deep on its resources and global leadership experience just to make Glasgow happen. With more than 25,000 delegates descending on the city, the policing bill alone was estimated at the equivalent of more than US$300 million. The pandemic brought big challenges to hosting the event, but it also gave Sharma\' s team an extra year to prepare after was pushed back from 2020. The UK won the bid to host the event in September 2019, but Sharma was only appointed president in January 2020 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson fired his predecessor Claire Perry O\' Neill. The jostling showed the escalating importance placed on the herculean task of cajoling global powers into alignment on saving the planet. While many have called the COP26 outcomes a failure, Sharma won praise for his balanced leadership that involved building relations with small island states most at risk from rising sea levels while handling tricky meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing.It is some of these\~skillsets\~that the UAE will have to draw upon as it prepares to take the reins in 2023. The Emirates has been entrusted to host the event based on its existing commitments toward the environment and renewable energy, including investing heavily in the new sciences of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and nuclear energy.Yet the UAE has more to lose than many countries from the inevitable transition to sustainable fuels, but much more to gain than most in shaping the elements of tomorrow\' s energy market \- and, thanks to its oil and gas revenues, it has the necessary funds to invest in the future today.But forging its own path is very different to consensus-building between nations with conflicting interests. What lessons can be learned from previous COP hosts and how the UAE can build on their efforts yet bring its own style of leadership is yet to be seen.Doubtless many voices will be raised protesting that handing control of COP28 to the UAE is akin to asking a fox to beef up the security of a chicken coop. Fingers will also be pointed at comments this week from the group chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) that  the oil and gas industry will have to invest over $600 billion every year  until 2030  just to keep up with expected demand. But to express alarm at this is to misunderstand the nature of a global energy system undergoing dramatic change.None of the world\' s countries can  simply unplug abruptly from fossil fuels. The world is recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and demand for oil and gas is rocketing \- in the process creating the essential wealth in the Persian Gulf region necessary to fund and drive the transition to renewables.For the UAE and countries such as Saudi Arabia, much of the profit being drawn out of the earth now is being plowed directly into the type of research and development that ultimately will save the planet.The UAE is working hard to curb its own domestic consumption of fossil fuels. Last month, it announced it was aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 \- an ambitious target on a par with those of the UK, the US and the European Union.How? Well, it turns out that oil was not the only economic blessing bestowed on the fossil-fuel-producing countries of the Middle East.Sunlight is the resource that gives on giving and, in the Gulf, is available for the greatest part of the year. The UAE is already leading the way with domestic solar power plants and investing in solar technology.\~COP28 in 2023 will put one of the world\' s biggest producers of fossil fuels in charge of negotiations to wean the world from its addiction to fossil fuels. It will put the UAE under a global spotlight that will require an exemplary level of leadership and diplomacy if the climate\~negotiations will continue\~to move forward.And as the outcome of the UK meeting demonstrated, progress is incremental.\~This article was provided by HYPERLINK Syndication Bureau, which holds copyright.Jonathan Gornall is a British journalist, formerly with The Times, who has lived and worked in the Middle East and is now based in the UK.\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China74","Roundup: Egypt signs deals to boost production of green energy","April 21, 2022 Thursday 4:46 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has signed on Wednesday two major commercial agreements to boost the country's production of green ammonia in the Ain Sokhna region of Suez province, east of capital Cairo, as the country aspires to upgrade its environment-friendly industry. The Egyptian cabinet said in a statement that the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU), worth 3 billion U.S. dollars, with a consortium of EDF Renewables and ZeroWaste for the production of 350,000 tonnes of ammonia annually. Ammonia is widely believed to be a promising substitute for the mainstream heavy fuel oil that can cut carbon emissions significantly. The statement said that in the pilot phase, the project plans to produce 140,000 tonnes of ammonia using green hydrogen from desalinated seawater and renewable energy, and the capacity will be gradually raised to 350,000 tonnes a year. The construction work of the facility will be launched in 2024, with commercial operation planned to begin in 2026. Also on Wednesday, the country signed an agreement with AMEA Power, a company based in Dubai, to produce up to 390,000 tonnes of green ammonia a year in Ain Sokhna. The project will be established by end of 2022, with the commercial operations scheduled by the end of 2025. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the deals signed on Wednesday are ""part of several projects that Egypt has agreed on to tap the country's huge potentials for green hydrogen and ammonia production and turn the country into a regional hub for green energy."" The prime minister added that Egypt ""is keen to sign more deals for boosting its transition to the green economy."" Madbouly also noted Egypt boasts a unique geographic location and an abundance of green energies such as solar and wind, so it has attracted international companies to boost investment in the green industry in the country. SCZone Chairman Yehia Zaki said that SCZone signed several deals in the field of green energy recently to enforce Egypt's national strategy on a green economy and for expanding its investments to carry out eco-friendly projects to improve the quality of life for its citizens. Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh will host in November the 27th edition of the UN climate change conference (COP27) as announced by the international organization during COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. On March 10, Egypt signed a five-billion-U.S. dollar MoU with Scatec, a Norwegian renewable energy company, to build a green ammonia project in the SCZone. On March 28, Egypt signed with Maersk an MoU to produce green ammonia for fuelling 12 ships with goals to attain zero carbon emission by 2040. The government seeks to raise the percentage of green projects to 50 percent of the budget allocated for investments in 2024. Enditem\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China75","COP26 stokes optimism, but action must follow","November 12, 2021 Friday","China Daily","By Arvea Marieni | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-12 09:05A general view of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 11, 2021. [Photo/Agencies]It has become clear at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26, in Glasgow, Scotland, that the climate challenge is perceived as global.The tone has changed, as noted by Youssef Nassef, director of the UN Adaptation Division of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, who said that in the history of the conferences, ""there has never been such a large number of voluntary initiatives"".The question is whether this consensus is also reflected in global determination to substantially reform the economic system. That is a different order of challenge that is nothing less than civilizational. As Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said right before COP 26, ""We are changing the economic system.""The focus rests on how to bring to the mainstream the innovation to accelerate the transition to a post-fossil fuel economy. The first step, however, is to build a new system of rules for the ecological industrial system. New policies must be designed to ensure the scalability of solutions and the transformation of markets. A whole-economy carbon (and resource) price is what we need. This will transform our societies and the way we all live.However, in the history of climate negotiations, while environment ministers have made commitments to reduce carbon emissions, their colleagues in energy, agriculture and finance posts have promoted policies to support the production and consumption of fossil fuels. This contradiction has marked the entire long journey of the COPs.The global environmental challenge of climate change requires policies both to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy as well as to enhance natural carbon sinks. Energy, industry, transportation, agriculture, and taxation and incentives are the main sectoral policies to be involved in addressing climate change.To address environmental challenges, environmental management needs to shift toward social and industrial systems. We need to use carbon less intensively while bolstering the resilience of the environment by enhancing carbon sinks-things such as plants, soil and oceans that absorb more carbon from the atmosphere than they release.The rules of the new economy are simple: To bring climate regulation to the mainstream, we need to internalize the external environmental damage. Once these externalities are integrated into the market system, energy producers and national economies will have a level playing field. This industrial, economic and social revolution needs to happen quickly and globally.There is a sense of urgency. China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, believes that a broad deal on carbon markets is becoming possible.

"COP26","China","COP26_China76","COP26: Fashion brands face pressure to walk the talk on sustainability, new report says","November 12, 2021 Friday","South China Morning Post.com","Consumers and regulators are pushing apparel makers around the world to reduce carbon emissions, says KPMG reportBusinesses say they plan to increase transparency along their supply chains in the next few yearsThe adoption of sustainable practices remains a work in progress for the apparel industry, but fashion brands large and small are facing mounting pressure from shoppers and governments to do more than just talk the talk, according to a new report published on Thursday by consulting firm KPMG China and digital business-to-business platform Serai. To ensure sustainable practices along their supply chains, businesses need to fully understand what is happening at every point in the process, according to the report, but less than 20 per cent of companies that responded to a survey said they currently had full visibility across their supply chains, and only 15 per cent said their supply chains were fully traceable. While the fashion and footwear sector has been behind the curve when it comes to sustainability, shoppers are becoming more discerning about what companies are doing to meet environmental goals, Anson Bailey, head of retail and consumer at KPMG China, said in an interview.

""Consumers are now looking at [whether] companies are walking the talk, or if it is marketing speak. There's no escape. Consumers are now watching you and are now calling you out,"" said Bailey. Against the backdrop of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, where HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3155606/cop26-china-launching-enhanced-climate-plan-us-says-envoy-xiethe US and China just pledged to step up collaboration on climate action, companies also ""now realise that they have to ensure net zero [carbon emissions] a lot sooner"", said Bailey. At COP26, the UN Fashion Charter, an industry-wide initiative to collectively address HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change, updated its commitments on Monday, which called for companies to set science-based targets or cut their emissions by half by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions no later than 2050. This is more aggressive than the previous target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, according to a statement by the United Nations Framework Convention on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeClimate Change (UNFCCC). The industry is ""a long way"" from managing scope 3 emissions, which refer to all indirect emissions generated by partners along the supply chain of an organisation, said Vivek Ramachandran, chief executive of Serai. ""If you don't have visibility into who is in your supply chain, and you can't trace the materials going into it, then managing their carbon emissions, incentivising them with either cheaper financing, better contracts, bigger orders, all of that becomes impossible."" The updated UN Fashion Charter will push brands to do more, Delman Lee, vice-chairman at Hong Kong-based TAL Apparel, said on Wednesday during an annual meeting of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, a global non-profit fashion industry body. ""If [brands] are committing to switch their major fabric to sustainable fibre, [manufacturers] will have extra incentive to get this going as fast as possible,"" said Lee. ""More collaboration is important for the whole supply chain to become more sustainable."" Most apparel brand suppliers surveyed for the KPMG report said they plan to implement solutions to enhance transparency along their supply chains. Just over a third said they expected to do so within one to three years, while another third said they would in four to six years. Around 18 per cent of brands and 17 per cent of suppliers said they already have a solution in place, meaning that more than 80 per cent of respondents should have implemented a transparency solution by 2027. Companies also said they understand the importance of controlling the carbon footprint of their supply chains. ""Consumers are asking more questions about not just the place of manufacturing of a product, but also the raw materials that were used and where these came from. Being 100 per cent transparent will lead to more orders for suppliers,"" Edgar Tung, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based Esquel Group, said in the KPMG report. ""Covid-19 and the associated disruption across global supply chains have highlighted the need for greater collaboration in the industry. Having strong partnerships across our entire supply chain allowed us to weather this storm as a team,"" Anne-Laure Descours, chief sourcing officer at German sportswear maker Puma, said in the report.

Do the energy-hungry logistics of the event bring the world any closer to keeping the rise in average temperatures to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius? Consider, for example, US President Joe HYPERLINK Biden's motorcade, consisting of over 20 vehicles. These were not energy efficient models, but old-fashioned luxury limousines and gas-guzzling SUVs. This extraordinary motorcade, put in place to move one man from Air Force One to various venues and back, was pared down from the president's 85-vehicle motorcade when he HYPERLINK visited Pope FrancisYet Biden HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3154634/xi-jinping-makes-big-mistake-not-showing-cop26-says-bidentook exception to Chinese President Xi Jinping not being at the conference. ""It is a gigantic issue and they just walked away,"" he said, adding, ""How do you do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?"" But it seems neither fair nor in keeping with the scientific goals of climate mitigation for the US president to wag his finger at the leader of the country whose engagement in stemming HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming is crucial. Covid-19 also complicates the decision to travel. Despite Biden's claim, China did not walk away - its climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, met America's climate tsar John Kerry, and China did send a delegation, though it restricted its official list to 50 people. ""When we go back, we will have to isolate for 21 days,"" explained Wang Yi, a senior adviser to China's delegation. While quarantine protocol varies by country, Wang raises a good point. Why are so many people being enjoined to gather in a small, crowded venue as the pandemic rages on? What's more, the work of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change doesn't begin and end in Glasgow. One suspects that Biden attended this particular meeting because it dovetailed nicely with a larger European tour, but that doesn't mean only those in attendance showed ""leadership"". Biden, like many competent leaders, is good at delegating. He's missed plenty of meetings, but is skilled at finding subordinates to do the nitty-gritty work and attend meetings on his behalf, so who's he to say that showing up in person is a necessary quality of leadership? Instead of showing an understanding of how politics works, he chose to grandstand, hinting that he alone was a ""real"" leader due to the absence of Russia's HYPERLINK Vladimir Putin and China's Xi. The Centre for Biological Diversity has taken Biden to task for the ""whiplash of his rhetoric"". ""First he asks Opec to pump more oil, then describes his worry about the horrors of climate change,"" a representative of the centre told The Guardian. https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3153252/biden-sparks-confusion-commitment-taiwans-defence-if-beijingoff-the-cuff claim that the US is committed to protecting Taiwan in case of conflict. That's technically in violation of the spirit of the Shanghai Communique which has helped keep HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/us-china-relationsUS-China relations on track since 1972. Biden's comment on Xi's non-attendance at COP26 is reminiscent of how his predecessor Donald Trump and his supporters goaded Biden during the 2020 presidential election campaign. Trump was forever flying here and there, whipping up crowds and giving stump speeches while Biden stayed mostly out of sight. The few video calls he made from his home led to taunts that Biden should get out of his basement and campaign like a man. Biden wisely did not rise to the provocation. Yet he is now taunting Xi on a similar issue - whether you can phone it in or must show up in person. There's good reason to believe that summitry will not return to pre-pandemic levels of excess. Few of these expensive gatherings - the G20, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum or Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, the annual gathering of the world's rich at Davos, or even a well-meaning climate conference - are necessary or substantive. And singling out Xi, who was willing to take part via video link, but HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3154610/china-says-xi-jinping-didnt-get-opportunity-cop26-videowas denied such access by the British hosts of COP26 for poorly-explained reasons, sets a bad example. Given the pandemic, why shouldn't the leader of the world's second-largest economy whose participation weighs more heavily on the future of climate change than any other except perhaps for the US, be able to phone it in? Indeed, there's something to be said for a leader skipping the motorcades, banquets, grandstanding and handshaking inside elaborate security bubbles, not to mention the environmentally damaging flights, especially if it's just for show. Climate change is serious business, but it is diminished by politicians who use it to score political points. Philip J.

The challenge transcends politics, as was put by EU Commission Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans from Glasgow.The tone has changed, as noted by Youssef Nassef, director of the UN Adaptation Division of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, who said that in the history of the conferences, ""there has never been such a large number of voluntary initiatives"".The question is whether this consensus is also reflected in global determination to substantially reform the economic system. That is a different order of challenge that is nothing less than civilizational. As Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said right before COP 26, ""We are changing the economic system.""The focus rests on how to bring to the mainstream the innovation to accelerate the transition to a post-fossil fuel economy. The first step, however, is to build a new system of rules for the ecological industrial system. New policies must be designed to ensure the scalability of solutions and the transformation of markets. A whole-economy carbon (and resource) price is what we need. This will transform our societies and the way we all live.A key dimension of this failure is political. In the history of climate negotiations while environment ministers made commitments to reduce carbon emissions, their colleagues of energy, agriculture and finance promoted policies to support the production and consumption of fossil fuels. This contradiction has marked the entire long journey of the COPs, albeit in different ways over the year. The global environmental challenge of climate change requires policies both to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy as well as to enhance the natural carbon sinks: energy, industry, transport, agriculture, taxation/incentives, are the main sectoral policies to be involved in addressing climate change.To address environmental challenges, environmental management needs to shift towards social and industrial systems. Our society needs to use carbon less intensely, while we bolster the resilience of the environment by enhancing carbon sinks. The rules of the new economy are simple: to mainstream climate regulation, you need to internalize the external environmental damage. ""Cheap"" or ""expensive"" should be a calculation that involves extraction, production, and consumption. Once these externalities are integrated in the market system, energy producers and national economies will have a ""level playing field."" And this industrial, economic, and social revolution needs to happen quickly and globally. There is a sense of urgency. China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua believes that a broad deal on carbon markets is becoming possible. German State Secretary for the Environment Jochen Flasbarth said, ""The new normal of is speeding things up"". Eventually, how we build forward better, will make or break the success of the ecological transition. Even more than before, truly ecological standards are needed.What we need is an orderly transition. If rich states are unwilling to assume a fair share of the cost, in their own interest, we will all fail. In Glasgow, some steps have been taken to show support. To date, Glasgow has dealt with everything from green infrastructure for poor countries to the end of coal in South Africa to the water crisis. According to Prime Minister Draghi, money is not the issue here. But the main task lies with private and green finance. New mechanisms are needed to address this demand. Today, even the US Congress is talking about a carbon price. And technical negotiations, which revolve around clauses of the Paris Agreement are moving on in Glasgow, with China playing an active role. As declared by EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans, the Chinese ""are ambitious on the transition to renewables"".Beijing has put a concrete program on the table, and it has already been converted into law. If internal and geopolitical conditions allow, it will be improved. The EU is banking on collaboration. Geopolitical tensions could undermine collaboration and the common fight to save the planet's climate. Relations among big powers are not at their best, which affects complex negotiations around how to ensure that emissions are reported transparently and correctly, and to ensure negotiators to finalize the so called ""Paris Rulebook"".That China and the United States find common grounds in Glasgow has great geopolitical significance. The US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration is a good omen for the planet and bodes well for a reinforced global climate governance. The two sides declare that they are ""committed to tackling (the urgent threat of accelerated climate change) through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s.""For months, the world watches over the two largest economies seeking for a common position for COP26After the injection of optimism in Glasgow, it's time to move from words to deeds. The clock is ticking. China, which often under-promises and over-delivers, is moving towards an ecological civilization.Europe aims to become the world's first climate neutral continent. The EU moves a step forward by reaching a deal with the United States over their dispute on steel and aluminum, which links climate policy, problems related to overcapacity and dispute settlement under WTO rules. Joe Biden's USA has begun its journey to a zero-emissions economy.To paraphrase an Italian philosopher, ""the old world is dying, while the new struggles to be born.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping has committed China, the world's largest producer and consumer of coal, to hitting peak coal consumption in four years' time to support its 2060 carbon neutrality goal. He announced plans to stop building overseas coal power plants last month, and many observers expect China to make at least one more major environmental announcement during COP26.

Some provincial governments told factories to limit their power usage, curb output or even halt production until further notice, and some regions in northeast China even experienced residential power cuts. The crisis might cast a shadow over China's performance at COP26, raising uncomfortable questions if China does deepen its decarbonisation commitments at the event, according to Li Shuo, a global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia.

To alleviate the problem, the government has ordered power companies to secure energy supplies ""at all costs"", called on coal miners to boost production and allowed a small increase in imports of Australian coal. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also announced a series of measures to support coal production this month, including an acceleration in the construction of new mines and phased tax deferrals for coal-fired power plants. As coal-fired power production is ramped up aggressively to meet demand, some analysts are concerned that the measures will mean China having to sacrifice its environmental progress to ensure energy security, at least in the short term. ""Like other markets in Asia and Europe, China must perform a balancing act between the immediate need to keep the lights on - via more coal - and showing its commitment to increasingly ambitious decarbonisation targets,"" said Gavin Thompson, Asia-Pacific vice-chair of resource consultancy Wood Mackenzie in a newsletter earlier this month. ""But the short-term reality is that China and many others have little choice but to increase coal consumption to meet power demand."" The large number of post-Covid economic stimulus measures passed in China last year based on the buildout of infrastructure projects that consume a lot of steel and cement, along with a strong residential property market, put a great deal of strain on the supply of carbon-intensive commodities and increase the temptation to go back to coal, according to Danny Huang, director and China commodities lead analyst at S&P Global Ratings.

But Li also warned that while the joint statement may help calm tensions among negotiators and ""prevents the worst in US-China climate engagement - a decoupling"", it is ""far from saving the planet"". Last year Xi promised that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060, but has not responded to calls to agree to more aggressive targets. China's updated commitment to reduce emissions - known as its Nationally Determined Contributions - which was submitted to the UN ahead of COP26, only included a modest expansion of goals such as increasing the country's share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. Being the largest greenhouse gas emitter, China's actions were heavily scrutinised. At the start of the summit teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg told the BBC the country was ""out of touch with reality: as it continued to build coal power plants. Li said that China's Nationally Determined Contributions cast a shadow on global climate efforts. In light of the domestic economic uncertainties, the country appeared hesitant to embrace stronger near-term targets, and missed an opportunity to demonstrate action, he said. Xi's absence from the Glasgow summit was also criticised by Biden, who said China had just walked away from a gigantic issue at the start of the conference. Xi has not left China for almost two years since the start of the pandemic. Beijing has previously pledged to stop financing overseas coal power plants but is still building new ones domestically, approving a slew of projects last year in an attempt to help the recovery from the pandemic. The capacity of new coal plants being approved in 2020 was over three times that of 2019, according to the agency China News.

""China was still in a development phase but it has greatly reduced its peak carbon emissions. In fact, during the peak global emissions, the per capita emissions in developed nations are much higher than that of China,"" Xie said in a briefing last week. ""China has been working hard to manage climate change, by cutting down the peak carbon emissions and reducing the time frame.

"COP26","China","COP26_China85","Editorial: To Beat Climate Change, Thoughts Need to Turn Into Actions","November 8, 2021 Monday 9:59 AM GMT","Caixin Global","The two-week 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is underway in Glasgow, the U.K. As the largest climate conference since the 2015 COP21, COP26 has attracted worldwide attention. The climate conference is fraught with difficulties in negotiations and has been shrouded in a strong sense of crisis since the opening. This is precisely where the hope of mankind lies, turning this sense of crisis into practical actions to achieve the global climate goals.Climate change has driven mankind to form a real community with a shared future. The ""Paris Agreement"" reached in 2015 proposed to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 C compared with pre-industrial levels. COP26, which was originally scheduled to be held in November 2020 but was postponed because of Covid-19, is the first Conference of the Parties held since the implementation of the Paris Agreement. COP26 has two main focuses: The parties should update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and should improve the ""market mechanism,"" that was not agreed upon at COP25. The assistance of developed countries to developing countries has also received much attention.A few days before the opening of the conference, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report showing that under current emission reduction measures, the average global temperature will rise by 2.7 C by the end of this century, far higher than the goal set by the Paris Agreement.This would lead to catastrophic consequences. Many consider COP26 to be our last chance to prevent this, otherwise climate change and its consequences will be irreversible. However, at the G-20 Summit in Rome before COP26, the climate negotiations between the leaders of the 20 countries - which together are responsible for more than 80% of global carbon emissions - made little progress. U.K. Prime Minister and COP26 host Boris Johnson has said that the conference is very likely to end in failure. On the first day of COP26, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres flatly denied that the climate is improving. He said that all nations' addiction to fossil fuels must stop to ""save humankind"" because right now, ""we are digging our own graves.""His sharp words are not an exaggeration aimed at scaring people. Unless the representatives of the 197 Parties make more serious promises at COP26, the Paris Agreement will be a mere scrap of paper. Essentially, all this is caused by a flaw in the current global climate governance system - the ""lack of a compelling force."" Though the Paris Agreement proposed the goals for global climate governance, it has not allocated emission reduction tasks to each country. Instead, it is expecting each country to voluntarily submit their NDCs. On this basis, the results will be inspected every five years, as the goals are updated. The Paris Agreement does not have any compulsory constraints or punitive measures. Because of the hidden underlying problems in global climate governance, the rare cooperation between countries and their joint efforts under the framework of the Paris Agreement are highly commendable.The current sense of crisis highlights the urgency of the human response to climate change and the significance of the . This can be seen as an awakening and driving force of great significance. The key is each Party's willingness to act. still has a chance to bring about a positive change. As Johnson said, ""We have to move from talk and debate and discussion to concerted, real-world action on coal, cars, cash and trees."" As the climate crisis is getting increasingly serious, more and more countries start to take practical actions. However, some countries are still hesitating. Alhough they have made promises to follow their schedules of net-zero emission, they are not willing to give their words to the medium-term goal of 2030. This needs to change. Developed countries and large carbon emitters should lead the way in battling climate change.As the largest carbon emitter in the world, China has actively fulfilled its commitments and effectively showed its execution. On Nov. 1, President Xi Jinping pointed out in his written speech to COP26 that China expects reinforcing actions from each party to battle the challenges brought by climate change together with the rest of the world, making joint efforts to save the Earth - our one and only home. Recently, China submitted two documents to the Secretariat of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, and made its ""dual-carbon goals"" a formal commitment to its nationally determined contribution (NDCs). In addition, China has released the Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful Implementation of the New Development Philosophy and the Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030. It will also successively release implementation plans for key industries to form a ""1+N"" policy system for the two carbon goals. China's commitment and actions not only meet the needs of its own high-quality development, but also demonstrate its sense of responsibility as a major country.To tackle climate change and turn the sense of crisis into action requires the cooperation of all countries, especially the major carbon emitters. If they have any hesitation or bicker over historical responsibilities while taking little with no action, pointing to carbon emissions as something included in the ""right of development,"" we will lose our last chance. Further, climate issues cannot be used as a bargaining chip when it comes to other issues. The game between countries in dealing with climate change is reminiscent of the ""prisoner's dilemma,"" but no country can afford the consequences of opportunistic actions. No country can win if the Earth's ecosystem collapses.In the global action on climate change, it is vital to strengthen the cooperation between China and the U.S. Together, the two countries' carbon emissions account for more than 40% of the world's total. Given the current status of their relations, there is a lot of doubt whether they can finally cooperate to fight climate change and find an ""oasis"" in the ""desert"" of the China-U.S. relationship. Encouragingly, a few days ago, when the heads of the two countries spoke over the phone, the Chinese side specifically pointed out that the relevant departments of the two countries could continue the dialogue to promote coordination and cooperation on climate change and other major issues. The U.S. also said that they looked forward to strengthening communication and cooperation with China on climate change and other important issues to reach a wider consensus. This hard-won consensus should be reflected at COP26.COP26.

"COP26","China","COP26_China88","Britain 'needs clearer plan to achieve climate goals'","December 3, 2021 Friday","China Daily","By ANGUS McNEICE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-12-03 11:00A smoke billowing from a chimney is pictured, as the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) takes place, in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, in this Nov 6, 2021 file photo. [Photo/Agencies]The United Kingdom has some of the most ambitious emissions reduction goals in the world but lacks a plan to fully implement them, the UK Climate Change Committee has said in a new report, which called for the strengthened delivery of Britain's net-zero strategy.In a report assessing the outcomes of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November, the committee, also called the CCC, recommended that the UK focuses on taking concrete actions toward deliverable and achievable goals, instead of setting ever-tougher targets.In its report titled COP26: Key outcomes and next steps for the UK, the CCC noted that the UK's nationally determined contribution, or NDC, is ""one of the most ambitious 2030 targets for reducing emissions in the world"". ""What the UK doesn't have is all the steps in place to deliver it,"" Chris Stark, who is chief executive of the CCC, said on Twitter.Stark said that the UK's plans for agricultural and land decarbonization in particular are lacking. He then noted that the UK Net Zero Strategy, which the government published in October, did not emphasize consumer and behavior change, with little content on diet change and limiting aviation.He also said that the government has not yet agreed with the CCC recommendation of net-zero tests for new buildings, which Stark fears will leave the door open for emissions-intensive development. Stark also suggested that the UK Treasury department might review the role of the tax system in the net-zero strategy. He said that low pricing for fossil fuels is ""effectively a subsidy"", and that the Treasury should consider ""how higher and more consistent carbon prices"" can be achieved across the economy.""Some have called for a tougher UK 2030 NDC,"" Stark added. ""UK efforts should focus on strengthening delivery of the net-zero strategy, rather than inflating the gap between ambition and implementation. Steps to complete the strategy need to be brought forward, filling in the gaps.""This sentiment aligns with that expressed by Chinese delegates at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, who repeatedly called for ""sustained action, not empty slogans"" from participating nations, and pointed out that ambitions count for little if they are not implemented successfully.Following a September 2020 commitment to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2060, China released five key documents just before the COP26 conference detailing how it will achieve its goals.""Instead of pushing China for more ambitious targets, I think it's probably more effective to try to support China in terms of translating such goals into credible actions,"" Zhu Xian, vice-president and secretary-general of the Beijing-based International Finance Forum, told China Daily in a previous interview. ""China recently announced action plans industry by industry-that probably is more important than trying to place on China a more ambitious agenda.""Stark also said that the UK must play a key role in coordinating climate finance for the developing world, which was a major source of tension in Glasgow after rich countries failed to make good on a promise to raise $100 billion in annual climate finance by 2020.\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China89","Exclusive: Developed countries fulfilling funding promise key to building confidence in climate process: Chinese delegate","November 12, 2021 Friday","Global Times (China)","Editor's Note:Scheduled to close on Friday, the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties(COP26)in Glasgow, Scotland has entered its most intense time in its final hours. As the first conference after the Paris Agreement entered the implementation phase, what outcomes the conference could achieve might be crucial to the future of mankind. On Wednesday, China and the US released a joint declaration on tackling climate change during the ongoing COP26 in Glasgow, including setting up a working group and reducing methane and CO2 emissions, marking a significant move on global climate actions and sending strong positive signals for the success of the COP26. China has made great contributions to global climate governance through its green development, participation in international negotiations, and multilateral cooperation. During the COP26, the Global Times (GT) reporters Shan Jie, Chen Qingqing and Zhao Yusha talked with Xu Huaqing (Xu), a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation to understand China's position and expectations to the achievements of COP26. GT: What is China's main proposal and position at this conference? Xu: At , based on the principles including common but differentiated responsibilities, developed countries should fulfil their promises as soon as possible, discuss the solutions of global energy transition and security jointly and make greater contributions to the global climate governance system.The first is to promote the fulfilment of finance commitments. Developed countries fulfilling the promise could be a key to COP26 success, which will help build confidence in the climate process. Though during COP26, US President Joe Biden said he would ""double funds by 2024 to $11.4 billion per year to help developing nations deal with climate change,"" to achieve success of COP26 in finance issues, other developed countries such as Australia, Canada, and the UK must promise to add an extra annual finance of $2-4 billion. It also called for the trust and support of African countries, the least-developed countries, and Alliance of Small Island States.The second is to explore ways of energy transition. China has vowed to strictly control the coal-energy projects and to support low-carbon development in developing countries, providing its solution to the international society. Although President Biden emphasized at the COP26 that the US will invest in clean energy in the recovery of the economy, he did not announce substantive measures. Similarly, the technical assistance initiative proposed by the COP26 chair country's Energy Transition Council neither listed financial and technical support required for the transition.Xu Huaqing, a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International CooperationGT: China's commitment and practice in cutting emissions is gaining global attention. US President Joe Biden has chided China for not ""showing up"" on the climate issue. Do you feel the pressure of some Western criticism and what is your response?Xu: Climate change is a severe challenge faced by the whole humanity. Since the industrial revolution, human activities, especially from developed countries have skyrocketed the amount of greenhouse emission and hastened global warming. Thus those countries were asked to lead the task of cutting emission by accords such as the Paris Agreement, and provide developing countries with finance and technology to help them deal with the task. Hence, US and other Western countries' criticism against China's actions and policies on climate change and China's achievement in this field, is arrogant, prejudicial and impractical.\~China has unwaveringly stuck to a green, low carbon and sustainable development path, and contributed China's wisdom and plan of tackling global warming to the world. The country's roadmap of hitting peak emissions before 2030 and for carbon neutrality by 2060 is way shorter than that of the developed world. The word ""before"" in those two goals reflected China's scientific respect toward future uncertainties, and the courage and responsibility of China as a responsible developing country.\~Plus, China also actively participated in the global governance of global warming. It played an active role in pushing forward the Paris Agreement, and looking forward to conduct dialogues with US and European countries. It also joined the South-South cooperation in helping developing countries improve their capacity of dealing with climate change. In a nutshell, China is an important participant, contributor, and leader of global ecological rebuilding and international cooperation on climate change.\~China is a developing country with 1.4 billion people. We also have the responsibility of improving people's lives. Currently, China's emissions per capita are only half those of the US, and cumulative historical carbon emissions per capita account for only one eighths of those by the US. Meanwhile, China, as a world factory, also bears large amounts of carbon emissions for other countries as it supplies commodities to other countries.\~The COP26GT: Climate negotiations are always difficult, and it involves competition of interests. Western media and observers claim that there are not too many new goals or much new content in China's latest nationally determined contributions (NDCs). What are your thoughts on that?Xu: China recently submitted its updated nationally determined contributions with a number of specific targets such as peak emission, percentage of non-fossil fuel energy in energy consumption and installed capacity of renewable energy. Compared to the NDC submitted in 2015, the new targets on peak emission, decl"

Nothing of this magnitude will happen in Glasgow during COP26, the United Nations climate conference, of course. It's sad beyond redemption; the summit is about nothing less than the future health of this planet, if one is to believe the overwhelming scientific consensus, as one must - for if we give up on science, we give up on using our brains as a survival tool. But human nature is not just data-based; social scientists cannot immunise our body politic against national interest seeking the way medical scientists have a shot at ending global pandemics. The convocation in Glasgow has assembled with plenty of urgency but forgotten about the need for agency. At best, it's a messy mass of leaders forced into national interest silos no matter how majestic (or sincere) their climate visions.

With many mouths to feed and furnaces and stoves to fuel through the winters, governments simply are not going to let people freeze no matter how rational the negotiated carbon reduction goals. So even a reasonably solid and specific global consensus on a problem does not equate to global action on the solution. The short term is now, or the next election, or even the next climate conference; in the long run, as a famous economist once said, we are all dead. The notion of a functional world government is to be found solely in pristine university textbooks, in the occasional Security Council resolution taken under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, or in our sweet dreams of global peace and justice.

Methane is the second-most abundant human-caused greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide. It has an atmospheric lifetime of roughly a decade and a strong influence on the climate. Over a 20-year period, methane can warm the atmosphere 80 times more powerfully than carbon dioxide. Reducing methane emissions also helps to improve air quality since it is a precursor to ground-level ozone, a dangerous air pollutant. Countries recognised in the pledge that significant reductions in methane emissions must be achieved globally by 2030 if the world is to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of keeping HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, while pursuing efforts to limit such warming to 1.5 degrees. Successful institution of the pledge would help reduce HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming by at least 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2050, the COP26 statement said. Methane accounts for 17 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, particularly from three sectors - energy, agriculture and waste. In the energy sector, which accounts for more than a third of global methane emissions, emissions occur during oil and gas extraction, processing and distribution, as well as coal mining. The Global Methane Assessment report released by the United Nations Environment Programme in May found that currently available measures could reduce methane emissions from these major sectors by as much as 45 per cent this decade. The mitigation potential in different sectors varies among countries. For instance, the report noted, the largest potential in Europe and India is in the waste sector, while in China, the largest potential for reduction comes from coal production followed by livestock. China, the world's largest country with human-caused methane emissions, did not join the pledge. At a press conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin did not directly explain why China did not join the pledge but said developing countries generally had weak basic data and lacked monitoring technologies and effective measures. But he added that China would increase its efforts to control non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases - including methane and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as laid out in the country's 14th economic and social development plan through 2025. Relevant departments are formulating and implementing policies and measures to control emissions in industry, agriculture and waste disposal, Wang said. In its updated emissions reduction commitments, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted to the United Nations last week, China said it would implement an action plan to step up control of key non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. Climate envoy Xie Zhenhua told a financial forum in July that China's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 included non-CO2 greenhouse gases, but the country does not have near-term targets to reduce them. The plan for China to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, released last week by the State Council, does not include any targets for the reduction of non-CO2 emissions. According to a study led by scientists at Peking University last month, human-caused methane emissions in China increased by 40 per cent in the 2000s, contributing to 16 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions. Meanwhile, rising global temperatures are potentially enhancing the release of methane from natural sources, especially in the cryospheric regions - areas where water is in its solid form of ice or snow. A study by Chinese researchers in Nature in May found that high-elevation rivers on the Tibetan Plateau are major sources of methane delivery into the atmosphere. Maria Pastukhova, an energy analyst at the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change think tank E3G, said the next step will be to win the commitment of the top emitters by next year's COP27 conference. ""The pledge, made by countries emitting half the world's methane, is a positive and a long-overdue step forward, putting the second-biggest human-made cause of global warming in the spotlight,"" she said. ""Before COP27, the pledge must get the top three emitters - China, Russia and India - on board, supported by transparent governance and monitoring mechanisms."" Ani Dasgupta, president of the World Resources Institute, a global research organisation based in Washington, called on countries to increase their actions. ""The next step is for countries to put the pledge in motion with serious policies across agriculture, energy and waste. Solutions to tackle methane are readily available, cost-effective and bring wins for climate and development,"" he said. Teng Fei, deputy director of Tsinghua University's Energy Environment Economy Institute, said weak basic data and the difficulty of reducing 30 per cent of methane emissions by 2030 were the main reasons China did not join the pledge. ""We are not quite sure about the basis of some non-CO2 greenhouse gases and the uncertainty is relatively large. It is not quite serious to set an absolute emissions reduction target on this basis."" Teng said it was relatively difficult for China to achieve the target of a 30 per cent reduction in methane emissions by 2030 because of the country's style of agriculture. ""The top two sources of China's methane emissions are coal production and agriculture. Despite China's coal production declining, the methane emissions from abandoned coal mines are still unclear. And unlike the Western countries, China's livestock and paddy fields are owned by small households, which makes reducing methane emissions more difficult."" Copyright (c) 2021.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson then followed up in the recent Energy Strategy with plans to give the ""fields of the North Sea a new lease of life"" and greenlight new projects for offshore gas and oil.The surprise moves kept coming this week, when reports emerged that the UK may soon get its first new coal mine in 30 years. If given approval early in the summer, British company West Cumbria Mining will set about extracting coal from beneath the Irish Sea, The Telegraph reported on Tuesday.Environmentalists and opposition politicians have criticized this flurry of activity in the UK fossil fuel sector, which the government admits will do nothing to lower rapidly rising household energy bills.Prime Minister Johnson added in the Energy Strategy that ""net zero is a smooth transition, not an immediate execution, for oil and gas"". This represents a softening of rhetoric from November, when the UK urged other nations to scale back new fossil fuel projects at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow.It appears that for Johnson and his Cabinet, security has risen above the green transition on the energy agenda, at least for now. Earlier this month, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said that the conflict in Ukraine meant that the government should ""keep all possible energy generation and production methods on the table"".A return to fracking is controversial in the UK, which imposed a moratorium on the practice in 2011 and again in 2019 after drilling caused minor tremors.

The symposium, in celebration of International Women's Day 2022 (IWD 2022), was jointly hosted by the Center for China and Globalization and UN Women, an organization delivering programs and policies to uphold women's human rights.

Meanwhile, investments in fossil fuel infrastructure are being called into question, raising doubts about the net-zero emission pledges of a number of Asian economies ahead of the climate talks that kicked off in Glasgow on Sunday. According to a new report by Global Energy Monitor, a US NGO which catalogues fossil fuel projects globally, the planned US$379 billion expansion of gas infrastructure in Asia risks becoming ""stranded assets"" as the world turns away from fossil fuels. ""Coal is likely to be the elephant in the room at COP26. [It] has long been considered cheap and plentiful, with no supply chain issues, but in 2021 it is none of those things,"" said Matt Gray, analyst at climate think tank TransitionZero. To meet the 1.5 degree Celsius target set out in the Paris Agreement the world must shut down 3,000 coal plants, or one a day from now until 2030, according to TransitionZero. In the meantime, the production costs of renewable energy, including wind and solar, have continued to fall in recent years. Renewables accounted for almost 30 per cent of global electricity output in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Further, the cost of renewable energy projects has been cheaper than the cheapest coal-fired power plants since 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). ""The recent coal shortage reinforces the worries of risks of over relying on fossil fuel. This will inject further momentum into renewables development,"" said Yan Qin, lead carbon analyst at data provider Refinitiv. Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that the country would stop building new coal-fired projects abroad. In its framework on a path towards carbon neutrality released on Tuesday ahead of COP26, Beijing also said it would increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy consumption from less than 16 per cent in 2020 to 25 per cent by 2030, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3154134/china-sends-modest-climate-pledge-glasgow-cop26the year it promises to reach peak carbon emissions.China has included ambitious targets in the action plan, including more than doubling installed wind and solar capacity to 1,200 gigawatts (GW) from 535GW in 2020, expanding hydropower to 80GW, and increasing hydro energy storage capacity to 120GW by 2030. However, renewables are not without development challenges. Qin said the energy crunch is having the effect of shifting policy focus to energy security rather than climate policy. ""This also makes stakeholders more aware of the obstacles of green transition, such as challenges to integrate a high share of renewables before flexible generation and energy storage becomes widely commercially viable,"" said Qin. Renewable energies like solar and wind are less reliable and require more advanced control systems and energy storage technology in place to avoid an unstable power grid, experts say. Rising costs and supply shortages of lithium and rare earths, critical materials used in batteries and wind turbine permanent magnets that are key to supporting renewable energy, are also casting a shadow over the world's green energy ambitions. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a June report that there was a ""looming mismatch between the world's strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of critical minerals that are essential to realising those ambitions"". The power crisis in China, the world's biggest maker of solar panels and related parts, is also creating major supply chain cost pressures on solar panels as the cost of polysilicon, a core component in photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing, has seen a price increase of more than 300 per cent. The surging costs could threaten 56 per cent of global PV developments planned for 2022, according to an analysis by the consultancy Rystad Energy last month. ""The current bottlenecks are not expected to be relieved within the next 12 months, meaning developers and offtakers will have to decide whether to reduce their margins, delay projects or increase offtake prices to get projects to financial close,"" says David Dixon, senior renewables analyst at Rystad Energy. At the same time, the expansion of renewable energy is not happening fast enough. A 5-to-10 times acceleration in the speed of low-carbon technology investments is needed to mitigate HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change, according to Gaurav Modi, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan managing director at consultancy Capgemini. When it comes to distributed intermittent renewables such as wind and solar, this also means boosting electric grids and storage technology developments such as batteries and hydrogen. ""The only successful route will be made by increasing the low-carbon investments fast, while at the same time decoupling GDP growth and use of energy and emissions,"" said Modi. The current supply crunch is likely to be temporary and will return to equilibrium in the coming months, once energy prices stabilise and supply chain bottlenecks are cleared, according to Lin Boqiang, dean of the Xiamen University's China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy. ""The core question now is that when the proportion of renewable energy keeps increasing and network costs rise rapidly, how to deal with the impact of such cost on the entire economy while ensuring the stability of energy security supply,"" said Lin. The world added 278GW of renewable energy capacity in 2020 - amid a global pandemic - close to double the historical annual fossil fuel plant additions, according to Rystad. The right policymaking and technology advancements could help solve the current development problems and drive the expansion of renewable energy, according to Wang from Primavera Capital, which just announced a US$600 million investment in Envision Energy and Envision AESC, two subsidiaries of clean energy giant Envision Group. ""The Chinese government has been issuing policies to solve the problems in grid system and energy storage, and to build a new power system that adapts to the development of a high proportion of renewable energy,"" said Wang. ""New technologies such as sodium ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, pumped water storage, and flywheel energy storage also keep making breakthroughs and reducing the dependence on a single raw material. Technologies such as large-scale wind turbines, iterations of photovoltaic materials, smart grids, and distributed power systems are also further reducing the cost of renewable energy.""

The net zero target will not be enshrined into law and the government will achieve it largely through increasing the use of low-emissions technologies, including clean hydrogen. Reactions elsewhere were muted. President Alok Sharma said in a tweet he hoped ""Australia will build on this by submitting a more ambitious 2030"" target at the summit. Former Australian Prime Minister Turnbull, who is also attending COP26, said Morrison had missed an opportunity to set out more aggressive curbs and be a global leader in clean energy. ""If a wealthy country like Australia is not going to take serious action to cut emissions, then other countries will say, well, why should we bother to?"" said Turnbull, who was ousted by his party in 2018 when lawmakers opposed a planned energy policy, to Bloomberg Television. For decades, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/climate-changeclimate change has been the third rail of Australian politics, fuelling divisions and derailing careers like perhaps no other issue.

HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/chinaChina and other Asian countries, according to the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. ""Australia's fossil fuel industry has an outsize influence on Australian politics and this, in large part, explains why climate policy has been so vexed,"" said Tim Stephens, an expert in environmental law at the University of Sydney. ""Also of relevance is the power of News Corp which controls over 70 per cent of Australia's print media and has for decades questioned climate science and opposed policies to address HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change."" Attempts to take action on climate have cost a string of prime ministers and other high-profile politicians their jobs, including Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull, fuelling a policy inertia that has repeatedly left the country isolated on the international stage. Under John Howard in the early 2000s, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/australiaAustralia was the only major country besides the US to fail to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. In 2014 under Tony Abbott, the nation became the first in the world to repeal a carbon-pricing scheme. ""Australia has always struggled to act on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change because it is structurally reliant on fossil fuels, for both domestic consumption and in terms of export earnings,"" said Kate Crowley, an associate professor of public and environmental policy at the University of Tasmania. ""We have struggled to see past that, and to make early changes to renewables."" Australia's climate targets lag well behind those of developed countries such as the US and Britain, which have pledged to cut emissions by 52 per cent and 68 per cent, respectively, below 2005 levels by 2030. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change among more than 170 countries examined. Although polls show most Australians support bold action on climate change - including strong majorities in favour of carbon pricing and a ban on new coal mines - many regional communities fear the impact that a transition away from fossil fuels would have on their way of life. Amid coalition negotiations in the weeks leading up to COP26, Joyce, whose regionally-focused party shot down changes to the 2030 target, described the shift to renewables as a ""titanic change to where our nation is going"" that called for due diligence. Sue Moore, the mayor of Singleton, a town in the coal-dependent Hunter Region of New South Wales, said resistance to climate action in regional Australia came down to people's livelihoods. ""It simply all comes back to where their jobs will be,"" Moore said. ""On top of our residents, we have 8,000 people who travel to our area each day for work, either in mines or associated industries. These people come from all areas of Hunter. Renewables are not going to deliver that level of replacement jobs."" Nonetheless, momentum has shifted in favour of doing more on climate. Big business groups and even mining industry bodies such as the Minerals Council of Australia have all thrown their weight behind the target of net zero emissions by 2050. In a move that caught many by surprise, News Corp, which is known for airing voices sceptical of climate change, earlier this month launched a campaign to put Australia ""on a path to a Net Zero future that will not just benefit the environment but benefit our economy, create jobs and save households money"". Before pledging his support for net zero emissions by 2050, Morrison as Treasurer in 2017 famously brandished a lump of coal in parliament to mock the opposition's supposed aversion to fossil fuels. ""Fears about the economic downside of acting on climate change were stoked in the political contest,"" said Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at Australian National University's Crawford School of Public Policy. ""Now, however, it is becoming more apparent that Australia also has an economic upside in a low-carbon world economy, as a potential large supplier of energy and energy intensive commodities based on wind and solar power,"" he said. ""The mining industry may also benefit in the global shift to low-emissions systems."" Even so, climate experts' expectations remain low.

""Climate change has come ever more to the fore in our work with Chinese firms in the last few years,"" Keaveny told Xinhua during a recent written interview. ""China is well aware of climate change and the need to lower its emissions."" ""The country has a difficult path to tread in balancing growth and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, but I am confident that it can succeed,"" he said. ""We know this all too well through our work with Chinese partners in the UK-China Green Finance Taskforce, which continues apace in the wake of COP26."" On the market front, Keaveny noted that many Chinese institutions have utilized the platform offered by the London Stock Exchange to list sustainable bonds. ""We have seen strong commitments from Chinese financial institutions supporting the green agenda,"" he added. ""We welcome opportunities to work with Chinese financial institutions in supporting green investment into the UK and vice versa."" China and Britain enjoy a long-standing partnership on green finance, the mayor told Xinhua.

"COP26","China","COP26_China106","Clean up to cash in\u8212  COP26 message to business","November 16, 2021 Tuesday","Shenzhen Daily","THE hard-fought Glasgow Climate Pact sent a clear message to global companies and executives: reassess business strategies and carbon footprints to reap monetary rewards, or lag and risk losses. The deal announced late Saturday, ending two weeks of fraught negotiations between nearly 200 nations, pushes countries to do much more to curb climate-warming carbon emissions. That pressure will increasingly be imposed on investment and industry to bring emissions associated with their businesses in check. The Glasgow pact also delivered a breakthrough on rules for governing carbon markets, and took aim at fossil fuel subsidies. Beyond the political negotiations, the Glasgow gathering brought in many of the world\' s top CEOs, mayors, and leaders in industries, including finance, construction, vehicles and aviation, agriculture, renewable energy and infrastructure.  COP26 has unleashed a wall of new private sector money, said Gregory Barker, executive chairman at energy and aluminium company EN+ Group, by email.  For business everywhere, one thing is certain, big change is coming and coming fast. Two separate investment conferences on the side of the U.N. climate summit touted profits to be made for those who meet environmental conditions for the cash. Many deals were announced, including plans for a standards body to scrutinize corporate climate disclosures that will challenge boardrooms. Goal of 1.5 degrees With the pact reaffirming a global commitment to containing global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, along with  accelerated action in this critical decade, boards can expect tougher national pollution policies across all sectors, particularly in transport, energy and farming. That will leave the companies without a plan to adapt to a low-carbon economy looking exposed, U.N. High-level Climate Action Champion Nigel Topping said.  If you haven\' t got a net-zero target now, you\' re looking like you don\' t care about the next generation, and you\' re not paying attention to regulations coming down the pipe, Topping said.  Your credit rating\' s at risk, and your ability to attract and keep talent is at risk. Adding to the pressure, financial services firms with around US$130 trillion in assets have pledged to align their business with the net-zero goal. Increasingly, they will lean on the boards of corporate climate laggards. Carbon markets The summit\' s deal resolving rules for the global trading of carbon offset credits was applauded by business for its potential to unlock trillions of dollars in finance to help countries and companies manage the energy transition. Observers said the agreed rules addressed the biggest worries and would likely prevent most abuses of the system. The nonprofit We Mean Business coalition, which works with corporates on climate, said the rules  have the potential to unleash huge investments. By putting in place the framework for a global trading system, the pact also brings the world closer to having a worldwide price on carbon  demanded as a priority by investors and companies before the talks. A global price would allow companies to more accurately assess the value of assets, as well as costly externalities  driving more climate-aligned decisions on anything from where to build factories to which companies to buy or products to launch. With carbon offsets tied to efforts to preserve nature, more than 100 global leaders during the conference pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Companies and investors also said they would ramp up forest-protection efforts. Fossil fuels For the first time, the deal saw countries acknowledge that fossil fuels were the main cause of climate change, and called for an end to  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It did not say how to determine if subsidies could be justified. It singled out coal, the most polluting of the fossil fuels, though later switched from urging a  phase out in coal-fired power to a  phase down. The change in wording, following objections by coal-dependent nations, was seen by developing economies as an acknowledgement that industrialized nations are mostly responsible for the climate problem. But many in wealthy economies worried it could mean years more of unbridled emissions as developing nations grow. Calling the move  dangerous and damaging for the climate, Germany\' s biggest industry association warned it could hobble its industries as they are forced to abandon the cheap fossil fuel international competitors can still use.  This concentrates emissions in countries with less stringent climate measures and unilaterally wears on companies that already need to cope with large financial burdens, the Federation of German Industry said Sunday. Still, the very mention of coal and fossil fuels in the Glasgow pact was hailed as progress in U.N. climate talks, which for decades have skirted the issue. Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of the international business of asset manager Federated Hermes, said the result would put pressure on some oil companies that were  not as forthcoming as others. He also said  coal companies will have to think very carefully about their future plans. Meanwhile, the world\' s biggest economies are driving the shift. The top two, the United States and China announced plans to cooperate on climate action, including bringing down emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Elsewhere, six countries, including France, joined the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, committing to halting new oil and gas drilling. Twenty countries including the United States and Canada pledged to halt public financing of fossil fuel projects overseas, and 23 nations promised to phase out coal-fired power. A number of companies in sectors including transport are already betting big on increased electrification, with U.S. carmakers Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N) among those saying they will phase out fossil fuel vehicles by 2040. The Glasgow talks have  drawn attention to the great opportunities arising from a different form of development  stronger, cleaner, more efficient, more resilient and more inclusive, said climate economist Nicholas Stern. The breakthroughs  seek to make clean and green production competitive in all these areas by 2030. (SD-Agencies)\l"

As British peer and former energy minister Lord David Howell says, ""We can talk about 'green' solutions until we're blue in the face but that will not make a scrap of difference"" - particularly to emerging economies like China and India, which need intensive energy-driven growth. Something has to give. In the case of China at least, that will not be economic growth, as Chinese authorities from President Xi Jinping on down have made clear. What will give instead will be greenhouse gas emission targets that are based on science rather than political reality. This critical point was not acknowledged, at least publicly, at COP26 despite the presence there of 197 world leaders and some 40,000 official delegates and other attendees from the realms of government, business and society. Now that COP26 is over and many leaders have made ritual promises (aimed at winning plaudits internationally while not being taken seriously at home) to reduce carbon emissions, the business of "" HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/world/article/3153351/how-fight-against-climate-change-can-get-real-cop26getting real"" can begin - and this is where the revived nuclear debate comes in. Wider use of nuclear energy is emerging as a partial solution to the dilemma - that it is virtually impossible without nuclear power to achieve global equitable economic growth targets and also meet emission control targets capable of saving the Earth and its inhabitants. Active debate has begun in Japan where, until recently, this appeared to be a wildly improbable scenario given the opprobrium that nuclear energy earned after the HYPERLINK Fukushima reactor meltdown in 2011Instead, debate has shifted to HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3163110/us-partner-japan-push-next-generation-nuclear-technologysmall modular reactorsJapan will bolster its development of next-generation nuclear power technology in cooperation with the US and others, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda announced on January 6. As part of its national energy plan, Tokyo will offer support for domestic energy companies to join an international scheme for testing fast reactors and small modular reactors developed by US companies. Japan and the US also agreed to work closely in other clean energy sectors such as hydrogen, ammonia fuel, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and carbon recycling. In Britain, Rolls-Royce is associated with developing small modular reactors, describing them as ""a truly innovative solution that will redefine methods of delivering low carbon power"". China, meanwhile, can claim to be the world's biggest proponent of new nuclear energy technology, having HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3160448/china-powers-fourth-generation-nuclear-reactor-steady-zeroconnected its firstChina Huaneng Group's 200-megawatt unit 1 reactor at Shidaowan feeds power to the grid in Shandong province.

Others take a glass half full viewIf there were a climate policy equivalent of an oven-ready casserole for world leaders to take to this week's climate talks in Glasgow, it has to be their carbon-pricing strategies. While a handful of experts continue to caution against an over-reliance on market mechanisms to slow HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/climate-changeclimate change, that has not stopped governments from hailing carbon pricing as the single most important way of reducing emissions. Whether through a carbon tax, where a fixed price is paid per tonne of greenhouse gas, or a cap-and-trade programme - which puts a cap on sectors' and firms' emissions - the mantra is the same: putting a price on carbon will provide the vital nudge towards lower-carbon alternatives.

A HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-nationsUnited Nations handbook on carbon taxation released this week said of 64 ""carbon pricing instruments"" being implemented globally, 33 were carbon taxes applied primarily at the national level. Among these jurisdictions are Asian nations such as HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/chinaChina, HYPERLINK Japan, HYPERLINK Indonesia and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/singaporeSingapore. Indonesia, whose President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/joko-widodoJoko Widodo is attending the UN HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeClimate Change Conference, also known as COP26, this month indicated it planned a carbon tariff of approximately US$2.10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Singapore, the first Southeast Asian nation to implement a carbon tax, meanwhile signalled it planned to raise its US$3.70 tariff per tonne, which Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said was ""too low"". The present tariff, effective from 2019 to 2023, is applied on firms that emit 25 kilotonnes of CO2 or more a year. Neighbouring HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/malaysiaMalaysia is planning to implement a hybrid model of carbon pricing that involves both a tax and a domestic cap-and-trade system. China, the world's biggest emitter, started operation of its emission trading system in July with an opening price of 48 yuan (US$7.51) per tonne. The HYPERLINK United States and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/indiaIndia, the world's second and third biggest emitters respectively, currently do not have national carbon pricing mechanisms, though some members of President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/joe-biden/newsJoe Biden's Democratic Party are keen on implementing a carbon tax. Carbon prices are currently disparate because national governments set the levels based on their own internal metrics, with caution exercised to avoid political backlash if rates are set too high too quickly. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/paris-climate-summit-20152015 Paris Agreement's HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Proponents of carbon pricing are hoping that key emitters, especially among the developed economies, will band together during to set a minimum carbon price. Businesses are rallying behind the strategy, too. Key corporate sector lobby groups in the US, Europe, Australia, Canada and Mexico this week jointly called on governments at the summit to agree on a ""effective and fair"" level for carbon pricing, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. Jessica Green, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who studies climate governance, told This Week in Asia that part of the current effusiveness about carbon pricing in general was down to the ""political convenience"" of the mechanisms. ""Governments can say 'look, we are doing something. We put a price on carbon'... there are a lot of people who are pushing for the commodification of carbon as the way to make capitalism commensurate with decarbonisation,"" Green said. MINIMUM PRICE, THEN WHAT?So just what kind of effect will there be if, on the off-chance, some major emitters do agree on a minimum global carbon price during the summit? Alice Pirlot, a research fellow at Oxford University's Centre for Business Taxation, said the immediate consequence would be some degree of limiting what is known as carbon leakage, whereby a country's climate policies lead firms to relocate to other parts of the world where they can continue to pollute at low cost. ""It's the same reason you have carbon pricing mechanisms at the domestic level... it gives you an incentive to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions, and you will reduce your greenhouse gas emissions where it is the most efficient to do so,"" Pirlot said. An agreement on the need for a minimum carbon price is just one aspect of the battle that lies ahead, however. Subsequently, there will undoubtedly be debates over the level of the benchmark price, and the extent of concessions or transfers that developing countries should be granted as a result of the new standard. The current global gap on carbon taxes spans from Indonesia's proposed US$2.10 tariff - to be imposed on coal power plants starting next year - to Sweden's US$137, the world's highest carbon price. The International Monetary Fund this year said the average global carbon price, now at just US$2 per tonne, needed to reach U$75 a tonne by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement goals. ""Maybe we will need some form of redistribution from developed countries to developing countries ... that question is also central to the negotiation of a minimum carbon price,"" Pirlot said. ""I think you cannot just stop the discussion of the carbon tax rate. We need to go a bit further and ask questions like, do we need some transfers between countries?"" REAL AMBITION OR FALSE SOLUTION?Despite the growing global momentum for carbon pricing, Green, the University of Toronto professor, is among sceptics who believe it may have a marginal effect in addressing HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change. Her quantitative evaluations of carbon pricing policies around the world since 1990 showed that both cap-and-trade and carbon taxes reduced emissions ""generally between 0 to 2 per cent per annum"". Green suggested the persistence of carbon prices remaining below the required level - even if they were incrementally raised - meant their effect was likely to remain limited. ""The reason that the current prices aren't high enough is not that people are stupid ... It's because there are powerful interests that are trying to make sure that the price is not high enough,"" Green said. Green said the more credible solution to cutting carbon emissions remained in government investment and ""old fashioned industrial policy"" that promoted clean energy. ""We need huge investments in public transportation, electrification and in housing - and those are not going to come from the private sector,"" the professor said. Pirlot, the Oxford University environmental tax expert, said she was firmly in the ""glass half full"" camp when it came to the efficacy of carbon pricing. ""Even if we don't reach 1.5, even if it's 1.6 or 1.7 or 1.8 degrees, it's way better than doing nothing and getting two-plus or three degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,"" Pirlot said.

The northern Italian city of Milan was the site of the pre-COP talks, the last and largest preparatory meeting before the COP26 conference, which will start on Oct. 31. The Milan talks focused on preparations for COP26 as well as input from youth participants, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who opened the talks on Thursday calling for major industrialized countries to ""match their words with action"" by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and raising billions of dollars to help poor and emerging countries adapt to climate change. There was also a large march in Milan on Saturday, calling for strong action in Glasgow. ""What we have seen in Milan is important because it illustrates the importance of taking stronger action than ever before to confront climate change,"" Nino Rossi, a climate researcher and analyst with the University of Florence, told Xinhua on Sunday. ""What is most important is that the people making the call are young people -- those who will suffer the most if action is not taken,"" Rossi said. Alok Sharma, a former British secretary of state for business and president-designate of COP26, agreed with those remarks, telling reporters in Milan that ""the energy that came forward from the youth did galvanize the ministers."" Sharma went on: ""As we go forward in the next few weeks and into the COP, we must always keep (those) voices in our minds."" Sharma said that delegates in Milan agreed to do more to keep the target of limiting global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels within reach and to deliver on a pledge to raise at least 100 billion U.S. dollars for adaptation efforts in poor and developing countries. Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission for the European Green Deal, said that the Milan talks helped ensure countries ""will arrive at COP26 with a game plan."" He went on to say that ""every government must take steps"" and that everyone has to work ""beyond their comfort zone."" Timmermans characterized the COP26 talks as ""a fight for the survival of humanity.""

"COP26","China","COP26_China112","\u8216 Unfair\u8217  for West to chide China, India on coal; developed nations must finance energy transition: experts","November 16, 2021 Tuesday","People's Daily Online - English","The West did not play fair by chiding China and India for changing the wording of a coal deal at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, climate scientists said, noting that many developing countries still don't have enough energy supply. To solve the divergence, wealthy countries must help finance the energy transition in developing nations. Western media heaped criticism on China and India for weakening their coal pledge. In the last-minute change,the coal commitment was changed from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"" at COP26. ""China and India are going to have to explain themselves to the most climate vulnerable countries in the world,"" UK lawmaker Alok Sharma, who led the COP26 negotiations, told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday. In response, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a Monday briefing talked about China's policies on curbing coal consumption, and said phasing down coal is a gradual process, during which developing countries' need for sufficient energy supply should be considered. ""We encourage developed nations to stop using coal first, and remember their promise to provide sufficient financial and technological support to developing countries in energy transition,"" Zhao said. Developed countries should understand developing nations, who are the biggest victims of climate change, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times. He said that it is impossible for China and India, the world's biggest developing countries, who are also developing their economies and encountering disasters brought by climate change, to phase out coal in the near future. China cut its coal use to 56.8 percent at the end of 2020, while coal accounts for over 70 percent of India's electrical output. ""Developing countries must have the opportunity to improve the lives of their people. This is where the 'stock' of greenhouse gas emissions matters. Developed countries have played the biggest role in causing climate change, and to let the rest of the world develop they have to acknowledge this,"" Kishore Mahbubani, distinguished fellow at the Asia Research Institute of the National University of Singapore, and a veteran diplomat, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview. ""It is simply unfair for those developed countries, which have been relying on coal to fuel its economic development unrestrained for centuries, to ask developing countries, who just started an economic take off, to abandon coal completely,"" said Lin. The expert said that the only way to solve this divergence is for rich countries to finance the energy transition of developing states. Yet even days before the COP26 convened, a report pointed out that developed countries are still lagging behind in meeting the $100 billion climate fund pledge, a key part of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Developed countries could have taken a big step toward this by fulfilling their pledge to provide $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing countries. Sadly, they have not done so, said Mahbubani, noting that ""by trying to shift the onus for climate on developing countries and not doing more to help them, they have neglected the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities."" Climate scientists said that China and India share a similar stance and requests on climate change negotiations. During the COP26, most of the developing nations sought at least $1.3 trillion per year from wealthy countries in climate financing starting 2030. Despite border disputes, China and India have been shepherding developing countries on climate issues, making sure developing countries stick to their own nationally determined contributions on climate, instead of being coerced by rich countries, Yang Fuqiang, a research fellow at Peking University's Research Institute for Energy, told the Global Times.\l"

Climate Change Conference (COP26), reportedly held ""candid, in-depth and constructive"" talks regarding arrangements for the meeting, and cooperation on climate change between the two nations.A constructive and in-depth approach is certainly needed. COP26, being held in Glasgow in November, offers an opportunity for leaders to act together to avert the worst impacts of global warming. The U.K. and China have pivotal roles to play. The U.K. is co-hosting the conference with Italy, so is responsible for setting the bar high and doing the diplomatic work in the run up necessary to ensure success. The U.K. also has to demonstrate it has plans in place to meet its own ambitious emissions reduction goal. And China, as a global superpower and a major emitter of greenhouse gasses, could set an example to other emerging economies of enhanced ambition and commensurate action to speed up the transition to a low carbon future.New HYPERLINK https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/09/climate-change-risk-assessment-2021 research from Chatham House This year alone, record-breaking floods have ravaged China, Germany, Belgium and Bangladesh, deadly wildfires have ripped through Australia, Siberia, the U.S. and Turkey, and heatwaves have claimed lives in southern Africa, southern Europe and central and western U.S. According to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, weather disasters are striking four to five times more often and causing seven times more damage than in the 1970s. Climate change is here and it is set to get worse.The current pace of global decarbonisation efforts put the world on track for at least 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, which would have devastating consequences. Without a radical change to the status quo, by the 2030s, 400 million people a year are likely to experience heat so extreme that they are unable to work outside; the number of people exposed to temperatures so hot that they are life-threatening is likely to surpass 10 million a year; and by 2040, some 3.9 billion people will probably experience major heatwaves annually, 12 times the historic average.By 2040, almost 700 million people each year are likely to be exposed to droughts of at least six months' duration, nearly double the global historic annual average. No region will be spared, but East and South Asia will be worst-hit - with, respectively, 125 million and 105 million people a year likely to be affected.When it comes to food and the world's ability to feed a rapidly growing global population, the scale of the crisis is evident.

"COP26","China","COP26_China115","Xinhua Commentary: Joint actions, not empty talks, imperative to ensure successful Glasgow climate conference","October 30, 2021 Saturday 11:01 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Xinhua writers Gu Zhenqiu, Jin Jing GLASGOW, Britain, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- With the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) set to open on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, the high-profile international gathering is widely expected to be a crucial opportunity for reaching new consensus on further curbing carbon emissions. The two-week event, which was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, comes amid a lack of progress among some parties to narrow a worrisome financial gap to tackle climate change. For instance, a long-standing pledge by developed countries to channel 100 billion U.S. dollars a year to developing ones has not been honored so far, undermining trust and engagement at forthcoming climate negotiations. The stalled progress has raised concerns about COP26's chance of success and sparked warnings that the conference may end in empty talks. At present, few can deny that climate change is a challenge facing all of humanity, and that it is imperative to successfully tackle the problem for the future of the planet. This extensive global consensus has been built for decades following melting glaciers and polar ice, record-breaking heat waves, droughts and rising sea levels, which are threatening the lives of billions of people and potentially wrecking economies across the world. In the face of the grave impacts, COP26 participants should take the global gathering as an opportunity to bring hope, rather than despair, to the effort of fighting the war that human beings cannot afford to lose. Just as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in October, ""COP26 must be a turning point"" of climate actions. To achieve that, all parties at COP26 should first of all translate climate goals into specific policies, and complete negotiations on the implementation details of the Paris Agreement to ensure that global climate governance continues on the right track. Adopted in 2015, the agreement aims to limit the global temperature rise in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to even further pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Second, the Glasgow conference should deliver a breakthrough in climate adaptation. Together with emissions reductions and financing for climate actions in developing countries, climate adaptation is one of the three key elements of the political package that Guterres has urged to be delivered at COP26. As climate disruption is affecting more and more lives and livelihoods worldwide every year, especially among the most vulnerable, building resilience and adaptation must be a priority for all. Third, the success of COP26 lies on all parties' commitment to true multilateralism and genuine respect for specific national conditions of each and every developing country, on the basis of which the Paris Agreement was reached in the first place. To be specific, those developed countries with a few hundred years of industrialization and ecological debt should take the lead in climate actions, and stop pinning responsibilities on conscientious developing nations, such as China. As the world's largest developing country with a population of more than 1.4 billion that has not completed industrialization or urbanization, China has nevertheless honored its ambitious pledges to tackle climate change despite the difficulty. For years, China has voluntarily adopted nationally determined contributions and supporting policy measures, and actively taken part in global climate governance. Though facing other innumerable social and economic priorities, China has announced that it will strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, which means that the country has to realize an unprecedented reduction in carbon emissions and move from peak carbon to carbon neutrality faster than any nation in history. China has laid out a concrete road map towards greener development and means what it says. Therefore, any worry that it might fail to achieve its goal is unfounded, and any attempt to smear China's resolve to mitigate climate change and its progress in this regard will prove futile. No one is safe until all are safe. As the window of opportunity to prevent the worst climate impacts is rapidly closing, it is time for the international community, developed countries in particular, to show their joint determination to address this mighty challenge facing mankind. Taking collective, effective and prompt actions at the Glasgow conference is key for future success. Enditem\l"

""We need to do something, and that something I believe, is to give confidence to our people that it is possible to have a better tomorrow,"" said the UNGA president during a recent interview with Xinhua, who is going to convene a high-level meeting themed ""Delivering Climate Action: for People, for Planet and for Prosperity"" on Tuesday. Before moving to Glasgow, Shahid said that efforts must be made to ensure that the United Nations, composed of 193 countries, gives itself one last chance ""a push"" to make sure that ""we go to Glasgow united."" ""We go to Glasgow knowing that we have the courage to take that important step to correct our path. And that is why I'm convening this event on 26th of October,"" he said. ""That together, humanity has the capacity to rise from this,"" the president said, noting that his presidency is the ""presidency of hope."" ""The (COVID-19) pandemic has really taken a toll on all of us. We have all lost loved ones within family, friends, coworkers. People have lost their jobs,"" he said. However, Shahid said that ""we have to celebrate the fact that we have been able to achieve a vaccine in record time. Humanity has today launched the largest ever vaccine rollout in human history."" Therefore, the international community should do more and ""we should communicate this to our people, give people the confidence that together humanity has the capacity to deal with this situation"" facing all countries. By displaying the success of developing COVID-19 vaccines in a very short period, the president expressed the hope that countries, if united closely, could also find good solutions to the deteriorating climate change situation. ""We are seeing the devastation, the wrath of nature, unleashed on us, like it has never before. We are seeing floods. We are seeing forest fires. We are seeing... you name it. We need to face this,"" he said. ""Once again, as I have been saying, humanity has the scientific knowledge, has the technology,"" he said, noting the only problem is the ""lack of courage."" He pointed out that he is expecting that there will be a great number of countries represented, a great number of heads of state and government ""joining us virtually"" at the coming high-level event. Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the General Debate of the 76th UNGA that China would not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. Last year, Xi said that China would achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. Shahid warmly welcomed China's pledges. ""China, as one of the largest countries, the largest economies in the world, is ready to step up to the plate,"" he said, adding that ""the fact that President Xi came out with this commitment is encouraging."" According to Monica Grayley, the UNGA president's spokesperson, Tuesday's meeting will focus on the gap between current and required technical and financial capacities to achieve the 1.5-degree Celsius target and how that gap can be met through showcasing best practices. The meeting will also take stock of the ambition-raising initiatives from member states and stakeholders. Enditem\l"

"COP26","China","COP26_China118","Xi calls for stronger actions to tackle climate challenge","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","Shenzhen Daily","CHINESE President Xi Jinping on Monday called on all parties to take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge. Xi made the remarks in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland in the U.K., from Monday to yesterday.  I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all, he said. The adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action, he said. Xi made a three-pronged proposal to address climate challenge, including upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions, and accelerating the green transition.  When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription, he said. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow, he added. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Xi said. In terms of green transition, Xi said it is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern. Guided by the vision of a community of life for man and nature, China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development, he said.  We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects, he said. He added that China will speed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. World leaders Monday also called for concrete actions to tackle the challenges of climate change at the COP26. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country hosts the two-week climate gathering, said,  While COP26 will not be the end of climate change, it can and it must mark the beginning of the end. Admitting that developed nations\' support for developing countries is  still falling short, U.S. President Joe Biden said,  there\' s no more time to hang back or sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves.  This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes; the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases, he said. Seychellois President Wavel Ramkalawan said he is  scared of the impact climate change will have on his country as  the beautiful archipelago of 115 islands may be reduced to less than 50 islands as the coral islands disappear.

Many countries, including China, source hard wood and other forest products from the DRC. CAFI had threatened to cut funding after the Congolese government breached an agreement it struck with the initiative to conserve the forest in return for international aid money by awarding new contracts. Although Tshisekedi did not expressly mention Chinese companies - which play a major role in other sectors such as mining - they are big players in the timber business, especially for rosewood, which is in high demand for luxury Chinese furniture. This demand has made the Central African nation a key source for timber, which environmentalists say is illegally sourced - often from protected areas. At least two Chinese companies are known to have been awarded logging rights in 2018, and according to an international development consultant there are also many illegal operators, some of them Chinese, logging rosewood. ""The first verifications revealed the illegality of many contracts, including those signed in September 2020 which awarded, to a single company, six concessions with a total area of 1,376,375 hectares in violation of the law,"" a statement released after the council meeting said. The DRC law limits the area controlled by a single firm to 500,000 hectares. The Congolese president asked the ministry of environment ""to make a technical and financial inventory of all forest concessions in the DRC, to suspend all doubtful contracts pending the outcome of the audit"". Early this year, non-governmental Organisations initiated a legal action against former environment minister Claude Nyamugabo over claims that Chinese firms were illegally granted logging permits for two million hectares in 2018. The case is still pending before the Council of State. A 2019 report by WWF said while most industrial logging companies are backed by Swiss, Belgian and Lebanese capital, the main export market for most of them is China. ""The increased presence of Chinese operators in the Congolese forestry sector coincided with a process of review of existing logging concessions in 2006, leading to a process of reconversion (renewal) of those deemed compliant with the 2002 Forest Law in 2008,"" said the WWF study. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, about two thirds of the DRC's rough wood is exported to mainland China, with France, Taiwan, Portugal and Japan also being major markets.

He also formed a commission to investigate the reserves at the Tenke Fungurume Mining copper and cobalt project, which is majority-owned by China Molybdenum. Christian-Geraud Neema, an international development consultant based at the International University of Japan, said the DRC wants to demonstrate its willingness and determination to play an essential role in the fight against HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming ahead of COP26 by preserving its forest. ""As much as there is a will to play that role, at the same time in Kinshasa there is a sentiment that DRC has never been fully rewarded to the extent of its potential,"" Neema said. He said the political or military authorities had previously collaborated with several illegal operations in the forestry sector, and ""among these illegal operators, there are many Chinese who exploit the rosewood which is very popular in China"". Neema said the poor governance that plagues the sector had also allowed the award of new concessions of operations to several companies in 2018, including Chinese ones. However, contrary to the mining revision process, ""I do not believe that this audit is targeting explicitly the Chinese. It just happens that Chinese are also present in the illegal logging in the DRC"", Neema said. He said COP 26, where the DRC is expected to ask for hefty compensation, is a more likely explanation for the government's actions than anti-China sentiment. ""So, by showing a willingness to 'clean-house', the Congolese government can legitimately ask for more from the international community,"" he said. ""We already know that its willingness to lift [a 2002 logging moratorium] has sparked some concerns among NGO and civil society, let's see if this might help DRC position itself in the coming COP 26."" According to Global Forest Watch, between 2001 and 2020, the country lost some 15.9 million hectares of tree cover, or 8 per cent of the total. Colin Robertson, senior forest researcher at Global Witness, said the moratorium on handing out new logging concessions in the DRC has held back some of the worst impacts of logging.

Let\' s be clear  there is a serious risk that Glasgow will not deliver, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told leaders of the Group of 20 rich nations last week.  Even if recent pledges were clear and credible  and there are serious questions about some of them  we are still careening towards climate catastrophe. The existing pledges to cut emissions would see the planet\' s average temperature rise 2.7 degrees this century, which the UN says would supercharge the destruction that climate change is already causing by intensifying storms, exposing more people to deadly heat and floods, killing coral reefs and destroying natural habitats.The signals ahead of COP26 have been mixed. A new pledge last week from China, the world\' s biggest polluter, was labelled a missed opportunity that will cast a shadow over the two-week summit. Announcements from Russia and Saudi Arabia were also lackluster.The return of the United States, the world\' s biggest economy, to UN climate talks will be a boon to the conference, after a four-year absence under president Donald Trump.But like many world leaders, President Joe Biden will arrive at COP26 without firm legislation in place to deliver his own climate pledge as Congress argues over how to finance it and new uncertainty about whether US agencies can even regulate greenhouse gas emissions.Leaders of the G20 meeting in Rome this weekend will say they aim to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees, but will largely avoid firm commitments, according to a draft statement.The joint statement reflects tough negotiations, but details few concrete actions to limit carbon emissions. The G20, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the US, accounts for about 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but hopes the Rome meeting might pave the way to success in Scotland have dimmed considerably.Adding to the challenging geopolitical backdrop, a global energy crunch has prompted China to turn to highly polluting coal to avert power scarcity, and left Europe seeking more gas, another fossil fuel.Ultimately, negotiations will boil down to questions of fairness and trust between rich countries whose greenhouse gas emissions caused climate change, and poor countries being asked to de-carbonize their economies with insufficient financial support.COVID-19 has exacerbated the divide between rich and poor. A lack of vaccines and travel curbs mean some representatives from the poorest countries cannot attend.COVID-19 will make this UN climate conference different from any other, as 25,000 delegates from governments, companies, civil society, indigenous peoples, and the media will fill the event venue.World leaders will kick start COP26 today with two days of speeches that could include some new emissions-cutting pledges, before technical negotiators lock horns over the Paris accord rules.

The science on rising sea levels cannot be ignored in Asia. Millions of people live along coastal waters. For Vietnam, the Mekong River Delta is a vast spread of fertile riverbeds, islets and mangrove swamps at the end of the Mekong River. It is now among the most vulnerable regions in southern Vietnam. The delta is home to more than 20 million people, who produce almost half of the country\' s rice harvest. A million hectares of land is regularly affected by flooding due to ocean tides. Crops and people\' s livelihoods are at stake.Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has frequently warned that climate change threatens world security. In an earlier speech at the UN, he sought improved implementation of the HYPERLINK http://un.org/en/chronicle/article/un-role-climate-change-action-taking-lead-towards-global-responseUN Charter in international relations and climate adaptation. Vietnam plans to borrow around US$2 billion to fortify the Mekong Delta with sustainable development in the face of climate change.\~\~There is international agreement that rising sea levels must be considered a challenge to international peace and security. The US National Security Council and the Pentagon have warned that climate change will result in food shortages in some countries that could lead to unrest, along with skirmishes over water.\~\~The most recent report from the United Nations\' HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), prepared by more than 100 scientists from more than 80 countries, describes a worrying scenario. Their evidence confirms that even if there are drastic cuts in carbon emissions, nations like Vietnam will be impacted by high tides. Over the past five decades, Vietnamese farmers have seen sea levels rise by about 20 centimeters. Also, climate change has made natural disasters, especially typhoons, floods, and droughts, more severe. In short, global mean sea levels will most likely rise between 30 and 110 centimeters by the end of this century.Ho Chi Minh City, home to more than 9 million people including migrants, continues to experience regular flooding due to increased storms, intense rainfall, and upstream discharges. Of the city\' s 322 communes and wards, about half have a history of regular flooding, with 40-50% of land in the city less than a meter above sea level.What\' s clear is that rising sea levels amplify storm surges and bring in additional chronic threats of tidal flooding. Riverine flooding becomes even more severe with increases in heavy precipitation. The World Economic Forum has described Vietnam\' s economy as a  miracle of growth, since it has expanded 6-7% a year over the past decade. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Vietnam\' s gross domestic product dropped 6.17% on the year for the July-September period, as draconian lockdowns in key areas, including Ho Chi Minh City, led to the first decl"

Last month, a new IPCC report said it was still possible to limit https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming to 1.5 degrees with an immediate, rapid and large-scale reduction of all greenhouse gases, triggering the latest push for action this decade to avoid devastating climate disasters.

China, along with other parties to the agreement, will update its 2030 targets before the summit and has also promised to submit revised short-term and long-term targets.

The team also for the first time found that sea surface temperature variations could be used to help forecast variations in global atmospheric methane.The study will be part of an implementation of China's efforts on methane emissions control and reductions in the 2020s, which was included in the China-US Glasgow declaration jointly issued during the COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021, Liu Yi, one of the authors of the study and professor with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.\~The study was published on Wednesday in Nature Communications.\~ Liu said that CH4 is the primary non-carbon dioxide (CO2) greenhouse gas, and the global warming potential of CH4 is 84 times that of CO2 on a 20-year scale. The emission reduction of methane can help in restraining rapid global warming in a short time.\~Methane concentration in the atmosphere has more than doubled since the pre-industrial era, contributing to 20 percent of human-induced global warming. Tropical terrestrial methane emissions, as the main contributor to methane concentration in the atmosphere, represented about 60 percent of the global totals and described 84 percent of the global annual mean growth variation in the 2010s, according to Liu.Using greenhouse gases observing satellite methane retrievals from 2010 to 2019 and surface measurements from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) observations network, scientists found strong seasonal correlations in sea surface temperature anomalies over the tropical oceans and regional variations in methane emissions (via changes in rainfall and temperature) over tropical South America and Africa, Liu said.\~For the first time, we find an existing predictive skill for sea surface temperature variations that could be used to help forecast variations in global atmospheric CH4, said first author Liang Feng from the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.\~""Currently, there is still an ongoing debate about Chinese methane emissions and its variations. In the future, the team will further use multi-platform observations to report Chinese methane emissions to provide scientific and technological support for China's goal of carbon neutrality,"" Liu said.During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, China will promote the implementation of China's methane emission control actions in combination with the formulation and implementation of relevant plans and policies, Lu Xinming, a vice director at the Department of Climate Change of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said at a press conference in November 2021, after China and the US announced the signing of the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s.Lu said China will strengthen the monitoring, accounting, reporting, and verification systems for methane emissions in key areas, promote the collection and analysis of methane emission data in key facilities, and carry out the evaluation and tracking of methane emission reduction effectiveness in key enterprises in major regions to improve the quality of methane emissions data.\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China130","Striving for a just energy transition","December 2, 2021 Thursday","Beijing Review","Like any other part of the world, Africa has witnessed the devastating impact of climate change. The effect has been felt even more in Africa because of the continent\' s relatively poor infrastructure and large agricultural economy.As recent as June this year, floods believed to have been driven by climate change devastated parts of Kenya. They killed people, destroyed crops and threatened food security in the East African nation.This forced the Kenyan Government to move affected people to higher ground after they were submerged in the water. More than 1,619 hectares of land was reportedly swept over in the districts of Busia, Migori and Kisumu. There is evidence that climate change has negatively affected the continent, which is agriculture-based. The unpredictability of the weather has negatively affected the continent. But that\' s not unique to Africa. The extent to which climate change affects a continent depends on its level of development. We are affected because we don\' t have infrastructure. We are affected because we are not in control of our own technologies. We have been underdeveloped for a long period of time, said Chris Malikane, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.Malikane said climate change wreaks more havoc in Africa largely due to poor infrastructure than the forces of nature themselves. Even the most advanced economy on the continent fails to do the elementary things like cleaning the water pipes in the cities and unblocking them. When climate change happens, we see flooding in the cities, and we say climate change is wreaking havoc in Africa; [but the reality is] that it\' s because of lack of infrastructure. If we had infrastructure, the impact of climate change would not be great. It would be similar to what you find in Europe, he added.A worldwide concernThe impact of climate change, and how to reduce emissions, again came under the spotlight at the recently concluded 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, the UK. After intensive and protracted discussions on how best to tackle climate change and who must fund such programs, more than 200 countries reached an agreement which urged  developed countries to at least double their collective climate finance for adaptation in developing countries from 2019 levels by 2025, to ensure a balance between adaptation and mitigation. To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced to net zero by 2050, according to the United Nations. In his closing remarks, UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said,  The outcome of COP26 is a compromise. It reflects the interests, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. It is an important step, but it is not enough. A classic example of the COP26 contradictions Guterres is referring to is the $8.5-billion finance deal South Africa signed with Western powers aimed at speeding up its move away from coal-fired power stations.According to the deal, the U.S., the UK, France and Germany would mobilize the funds over a period of up to five years through a combination of grants and concessional financing.For its part, South Africa would push through its revised goal of reducing domestic carbon emissions to between 350-420 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, in l"

We are not the one who withdrew from the Paris Agreement,"" Zhang tweeted. ""The US however has back-pedalled its climate policies many times. Instead of blame shifting, what it should do now is to shoulder responsibility and take concrete actions.""He also responded to criticism about the absence of President Xi Jinping from the summit, saying China had delegations attending the meeting and the country had published climate action plans and policies.""The Chinese leader \£daddressed the meeting to share China's solution to climate change. The Chinese delegation attended the meeting in person,"" he tweeted. ""China has announced its carbon peak & neutrality targets, and released action plan and policies. Our achievements are widely recognised.""Last week, China issued plans for its path towards peak carbon emissions by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The documents listed several sectors intended to reach peak emissions by 2030, including steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials and petrochemicals. Meanwhile, China will start cutting coal consumption from 2026 and its oil consumption is expected to reach a plateau during 2026-30.Zhang's comments came after Biden lashed out at Chinese and Russian leaders for their absence at the Glasgow climate summit.""I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China - with \£drespect to China not showing up,"" Biden said in a press conference at the end of the second day.""They've lost an ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP - the same way, I would argue, with \£dregard to Russia,"" he said.Xi has not left China since the outbreak of Covid-19 \£dalmost two years ago.

"COP26","China","COP26_China132","We may have to depend on nuclear power to save world","January 24, 2022 Monday","South China Morning Post","Stand back for a nuclear reaction. I'm not talking about another Fukushima-style reactor meltdown or an attack involving nuclear weapons (hopefully), but the beginning of a renaissance of nuclear energy to help save the world from the threatened dark age of climate change. In an energy-hungry world, this will involve rethinking the role of nuclear power in generating electricity. It is a development that has considerable commercial and economic significance for Japan and China (plus perhaps India), as well as for the United States, Britain and others. Since the COP26The shift in thinking is also driven by the realisation that renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and hydropower cannot always be relied on to supplement fossil-fuel-generated energy to the extent required if energy supplies are not to suffer, by virtue of their dependence on weather patterns. Something has to give. In the case of China at least, that will not be economic growth, as Chinese authorities from President Xi Jinping on down have made clear. What will give instead will be greenhouse gas emission targets that are based on science rather than political reality. Now that COP26Wider use of nuclear energy is emerging as a partial solution to the dilemma - that it is virtually impossible without nuclear power to achieve global equitable economic growth targets and also meet emission control targets capable of saving the Earth and its inhabitants. Active debate has begun in Japan where, until recently, this appeared to be a wildly improbable scenario given the opprobrium that nuclear energy earned after the Fukushima reactor meltdown in 2011, and Germany's subsequent rejection of nuclear power. Discussion now is not about whether to start building large and hugely expensive installations in disaster-prone places. Instead, debate has shifted to small modular reactors of the type pioneered in China and which are being researched in the US, Britain and Japan. These are said to be safer than conventional nuclear fission reactors, and much cheaper and easier to operate. Japan will bolster its development of next-generation nuclear power technology in cooperation with the US and others, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Koichi Hagiuda announced on January 6. As part of its national energy plan, Tokyo will offer support for domestic energy companies to join an international scheme for testing fast reactors and small modular reactors developed by US companies. Japan and the US also agreed to work closely in other clean energy sectors such as hydrogen, ammonia fuel, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and carbon recycling. In Britain, Rolls-Royce is associated with developing small modular reactors, describing them as ""a truly innovative solution that will redefine methods of delivering low carbon power"". China, meanwhile, can claim to be the world's biggest proponent of new nuclear energy technology, having connected its first small modular reactor to the power distribution grid at the end of last year. China Huaneng Group's 200-megawatt unit 1 reactor at Shidaowan feeds power to the grid in Shandong province. It is the world's first ""pebble-bed"" modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, using helium instead of water to drive turbines. It is designed to shut down passively, in contrast to systems that may not be able to trigger safety measures if power fails. As with Fukushima, safety will be the determining factor for nuclear power and maybe for the climate debate, too.

HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/3029919/damning-new-un-climate-report-points-potential-catastrophe-earthA UN report published earlier this year warned that there was a 50-50 chance global temperatures would rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next two decades. It warned that without immediate and rapid efforts to cut emissions, limiting HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming to 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century would be beyond reach, and said countries needed to take aggressive action to curb carbon emissions beyond 2030. Meanwhile, countries have to submit new or updated emissions reduction commitments, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions, before COP26. ""Globally there is no question that 1.5 degrees Celsius is what we need to be seeking,"" said David Waskow, the director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute (WRI). Under the Paris agreement, countries agreed to keep HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming below 2 degrees Celsius, and try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. But some developed and vulnerable countries have urged the international community to go further, by limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century and reaching net-zero emissions by around 2050. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2019 showed a number of climate change effects could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, for example between 10 and 30 per cent of coral reefs would survive, while virtually all would be lost with a two-degree rise Meanwhile, another report by the IPCC in August warned that global warming was already causing record numbers of droughts and floods around the world and that the situation would only get worse without action.

""It also reflects Beijing's doubts about the US ability to fulfil its carbon reduction and climate finance targets. There's real fear that Washington's empty words will intensify an already unfair global climate order."" Domestic concerns may also have been a factor following the recent HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3153998/5-things-you-need-know-about-chinas-power-crisispower crunch that affected more than half of China's provinces and highlighted the difficulties of moving away from fuels such as coal. The cuts prompted the government to HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3153028/chinas-power-crisis-beijing-draws-plans-increase-coal-outputmove to safeguard coal supplies and boost production. In mid-October, the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planning agency, said the country's coal output had hit its highest levels this year - at 11.6 million tonnes a day. Reuters calculated that the total coal output could reach an all-time high this month if the existing pace of production continued. Li also warned that the US might only be able to offer ""rhetorical leadership"" if President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/joe-bidenJoe Biden could not get the country's two main pledges - to halve emissions by 2030 and to double climate finance to developing countries by 2024 - through Congress. ""The US' biggest problem is rhetorical leadership, and whether it can turn this rhetorical leadership into leadership in action depends on the Congress,"" he added. The increased rivalry between China and the US has also made climate engagement harder, according to observers. ""Back in 2015 when the Paris Agreement was adopted, the US and China were in a honeymoon period and the two countries were willing to reach a consensus and make breakthroughs on climate issues,"" Li said. ""Now these political conditions no longer exist."" The underlying question is how to make progress. Unlike some developed countries, China has not offered clear support for the 1.5-degree target - a stance that may be down to its own levels of economic and industrial development. ""We do not actively promote the revision of this target, nor do we oppose it,"" Wang Mou, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said on Tuesday. ""From China's stage of development as well as its future development demands, I think it is unnecessary for us to actively promote the 1.5 degree process."" Wang also said that China's target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 was more ambitious than the two-degree target. Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China, said his institute had concluded there was a high chance that China would reach peak emissions by 2025 after analysing provincial data from 2010 to 2018. Research carried out by the WRI last year reached a similar conclusion - that China could reach peak emissions by 2026 - and could benefit economically over the long term by strengthening its climate and energy policies now. ""China is correct that nations must focus on implementation. That does not alter the fact that China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, needs to do more.

(PHOTO / XINHUA)COP26, to find ways to ensure that the world meets its climate targets have been invited to put their faith in banks and global investors to save the planet.In an initiative that has been greeted with skepticism from climate campaigners, a coalition of banks, insurance companies and investment firms committed$100 trillion of private capital to help the world meet net-zero carbon emissions targets by 2050.The idea is that these big spenders  they include some of the biggest international banks  will direct their clients' money toward planet-saving investments and shun the fossil fuels that are contributing to global warming.So far, 450 financial institutions, spread across 45 countries, have signed up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a coalition convened by the UN in April under the leadership of Mark Carney, the UN's special envoy on climate action and finance.Carney, the Canadian former head of the United Kingdom's central bank, said, ""We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account.""The theory behind the idea is that governments alone do not have the resources to fund the energy transition and that private money is vital to ensuring its success.However, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero has been the target of criticism from climate campaigners because it allows the loophole of continuing to finance fossil fuel extraction during the transition.Carney believes big investors will have an interest in funding a clean energy transformation because that is where future profits lie. He said there is no reason investors backing low-carbon projects should have to make do with lower returns.Despite this lure of future profits, big banks were reported ahead of COP26 to be resisting any commitment to end financing of all new oil, gas and coal exploration projects this year.Putting big investors in charge of saving the planet might seem tantamount to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse.Anyone who lived through the 2008 financial crisis can recall that it was prompted by the reckless mortgage investments of big banks looking for easy profits. It was left to governments to use taxpayer money to bring the world financial system back from the brink.Left to its own devices, investment money inevitably seeks out the most profitable projects, regardless of the implications for wider society. Big tobacco and big oil are among the sectors that have sought to maximize their profits by resisting pressure to limit the damage they cause.Developed capitalist societies have also tended to prioritize the concept of shareholder value, in which returns on investment are seen as more important than the goods and services any given company produces or the way it treats its employees and customers.That raises the question of whether the world can rely on the goodwill of asset managers and big corporations to do the right thing when it comes to the climate issue, or whether legislation will be required instead.COP26""This includes carbon pricing, bans on internal combustion vehicles, national targets to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and mandatory climate-related financial disclosures,"" he wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times.He invited investors to assess who was part of the proposed$100 trillion green transition revolution and to ask whether it includes their bank, insurer, mutual fund manager or pension fund. His remarks were an invitation to investors themselves to keep the banks and asset managers to their commitments.Investors and the corporations they finance have had to burnish their green credentials in recent years, reflecting pressure from ethical investors who demand societal benefits as well as a return on their money.COP26 in part to convince customers and investors that they are doing their bit for the planet.Some climate campaigners have dismissed such tactics as ""green-washing"", a phenomenon linked more to image building than to genuine climate action. Activists challenge the credibility of banks that continue to finance fossil fuels.While the jury is still out on whether COP26 will be judged as a success, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and her supporters have already declared it a failure. Perhaps with the banks in mind, she declared: ""It should be obvious that we cannot solve the crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place.""The author is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK.The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.\l"

(ALASTAIR GRANT / AP)COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland.The declaration, which is called the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, was announced on Wednesday evening by China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, and US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry.The move took many onlookers in Glasgow by surprise, with the media alerted to a joint news conference just an hour before it started. Several world leaders have labelled this year's COP as the most important since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, and a US-China declaration is sure to send a strong signal to all delegations in attendance.Xie said that the problem of global warming is ""increasingly urgent and severe"" and that climate change threatens an ""existential crisis"".""In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between the US and China than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation,"" Xie said. ""As two major powers, both China and the US shoulder international responsibilities and obligations. We need to think big.""Kerry said the current time represents a ""critical decade"" in the fight to combat global warming.""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get things done,"" Kerry said. ""We cannot reach our goals without countries working together, and China and the US in particular, as the two largest emitters in the world, both have to help show the way.""As two major powers, both China and the US shoulder international responsibilities and obligations. We need to think big.Xie ZhenhuaChina's Special Envoy for Climate ChangeIn the joint declaration, both sides reaffirmed their commitment under the Paris Agreement to ""hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 C"".The two countries also agreed to cooperate closely during the next 10 years on a range of climate-related issues, including methane emissions, fossil fuel reduction, and clean energy technologies.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the declaration an ""important step in the right direction"".""I welcome today's agreement between China and the US to work together to take more ambitious climate action in this decade,"" Guterres said on Twitter. ""Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity.""European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said on Twitter that bilateral cooperation between the US and China ""should boost negotiations at COP26"".China and the US said they intend to establish a Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which will meet regularly to ""address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade"".In the declaration, the US cited domestic targets to reduce methane emissions, and China announced its own plans for a ""comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane"", aiming to achieve significant emissions control and reductions in the 2020s.Also on Wednesday, COP26 President Alok Sharma published a first draft of the proposed Glasgow agreement, which parties will aim to reach at this year's conference, after further negotiations.The draft called on countries to accelerate the phasing out of both coal and fossil fuel subsidies, neither of which has been mentioned in previous COP agreements. The document also included stronger language on the warming target of 2 to 1.5 degrees, which was set in Paris six years ago.The draft ""recognizes that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to 2 degrees, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees"".Wang Yi, a senior scientific advisor in China's delegation at COP26, told China Daily on Wednesday that adjusting this target could have a disruptive knock-on effect.""If we decrease the indicator, the target, to 1.5 only, that means we must change the whole Paris Agreement,"" Wang said.Last week special climate envoy Xie said it is important to honor what was decided on in Paris, calling the agreement ""science-based, rule-based, inclusive and realistic"".Sharma said that the draft is not offering decisive language on the target.""I also want to be clear we are not seeking to reopen the Paris Agreement,"" Sharma said on Wednesday.

CUI CHAOQUN/CHINA DAILYThe China-US joint declaration on climate changes has cleared the way for more effective negotiations at COP26 in Glasgow, said Wang Yi, a senior scientific adviser in China's delegation.In a surprise development that sent shockwaves through the conference center in the Scottish city on Wednesday evening, China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry unveiled the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, a document that will form the basis of cooperation on the global warming crisis over the next decade between the superpowers.Wang said that such key bilateral deals have had a major impact on the outcomes of previous United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COPs.""Before the Paris Agreement, we had joint statements with the US and Europe. Paris showed that bilateral agreements can push through the multilateral negotiations,"" Wang said. ""My view is that the document will have a leveraging effect to encourage other cooperation.""Wang said he is optimistic that having a ""consensus between the two biggest emitters"" will inspire other delegations in Glasgow.Wang, who is vice-chair of China's National Expert Panel on Climate Change, said that key areas of negotiation still remain at COP26, which is officially due to close on Friday, though previous conferences have run over.He said progress is needed on transportation, climate adaptation, finance, and the completion of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which involves carbon markets and other cross-border mechanisms designed to reduce emissions.""We've talked about some of these issues for 10 years and we still do not have a resolution,"" Wang said.Developed nations failed to meet a target of raising $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries last year, which seriously impacted mutual trust among negotiators, China's climate envoy Xie said last week.COP26 President Alok Sharma said that he is hopeful that rich countries will deliver a cumulative $500 billion in climate finance over the next five years.On Wednesday, Sharma also released a draft version of the Glasgow agreement, which parties will negotiate further over the final days. The draft included stronger language on average global warming targets. The Paris Agreement stipulates that countries should aim to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably toward 1.5 degrees.While Sharma made clear that he does not wish to reopen negotiations on the Paris Agreement, the draft document encouraged countries to ""pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees"".Wang said that he would not support a move to make this language decisive, as backtracking over previously agreed measures could stall progress.""If the target is increased to 1.5 C, that means you must change all the supporting policies and actions,"" Wang said. ""If we increase the indicators, that means we must change the whole Paris Agreement.""Wang said it is more important to deliver concrete action than to set ever more ambitious targets. He made a distinction between countries that have supplied detailed plans in the lead up to COP26, and those who have set vague and distant goals.China released five documents heading into Glasgow, outlining its pathway toward previously-set targets of peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and reaching neutrality by 2060.""This Chinese government is making a balance between ambitious targets and pragmatic actions,"" he said.Wang said that China and the US achieved the joint declaration in large part because both countries provided one another with comprehensive long-term strategies.""In my opinion, China is the only country with such detailed documents, sector by sector,"" he said. ""And we have over 30 documents coming soon, for key sectors and key areas, including technology, innovation, green finance, and international cooperation.""\l"

Photo: XinhuaOn the same day when the highly expected COP26 convened, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed at a G20 session that concrete actions are essential for international community to properly respond to outstanding global challenges of climate change and energy issue, and developed countries should honor their green commitments and provide financial support to developing countries.\~President Xi called for G20 members to take the lead in promulgating the application of advanced technologies, and countries should fully, effectively implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.The group adopted ""Rome Declaration,"" on Sunday night, agreeing to help developing countries increase the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, key medical products and raw materials, and address related supply and financing constraints.The declaration also says the G20 members look forward to the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Beijing, hailing them as an important opportunity for worldwide athletes to compete and a symbol of human resilience.As COP26, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP), started in Glasgow on Sunday, the world's attention will focus on how leaders and delegations from more than 190 countries will deliver on their climate change promises.\~Developed countries need to lead by example on emissions reduction, fully accommodate the special difficulties and concerns of developing countries, deliver on their commitments to climate financing, and provide technology, capacity-building and other support for developing countries, Xi told another G20 session on Saturday. This is critically important for the success of the upcoming COP26, he noted.\~As a major contributor and participant in global climate governance, China has submitted an updated climate pledge, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UN days ahead of the highly expected meeting. It also issued a white paper last week to share with the world its dedication and experience in tackling global warming, which said China's target of achieving peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 marks the world's highest reduction in carbon emission intensity and the shortest time in achieving the goal of going from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in global history.\~China's responsibility on climate change is demonstrated by the pledges it has made so far, including reiterating that China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. A policy guidance released on October 24 added that the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption would increase to about 25 percent in 2030 and more than 80 percent by 2060, something that is not easy to achieve, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told Global Times on Sunday.\~The Chinese President highlighted the need for lowering the cost of reducing emission through technologies, and developing countries' need for help from developed countries, as they have to tackle climate change while ensuring livelihoods, Lin noted.\~Xi also said on Sunday that environmental protection and economic development must be coordinated and climate change must be addressed while people's wellbeing is ensured, adding that major economies should strengthen cooperation in this regard.US President Joe Biden left on Thursday for the G20 leaders meeting in Rome and was expected to head to Glasgow later on Sunday. His departure to Rome was delayed as he had to attend the House Democratic Caucus meeting on Thursday, in what was likely to have been an attempt to secure the backing of progressive lawmakers for his agenda, after the failure to reach an intraparty agreement on the $1.5-2 trillion spending plan aimed at addressing issues including climate change. It means Biden will probably attend COP26 without a final US climate deal, driving doubts over whether the US agenda to cut emissions enough to give Biden credibility at COP26.\~Despite the ongoing tensions between China and the US, Lin noted that there's still a lot of room for the two countries to cooperate on this issue, as both are the largest emitters in the world and have to work together to address climate change. Without efforts from both sides, it's impossible to achieve any ambitious goal internationally.\~COP26 has been described by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson as ""the world's moment of truth."" World leaders, delegations and experts agreed on the importance of the two weeks of meetings in fighting climate change as it would also be the moment for countries to take concrete steps in reducing emissions since they signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, under which countries agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and aim for 1.5 degrees Celsius.""This year's COP meeting will generate various formal documents, as it is the first meeting that is endowed with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Dan Tehan, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, declared that Australia cannot afford to be left behind as the world rapidly moves to ""decarbonize"". ""There is no doubt that when I've been in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, the US or Europe, the world is moving to decarbonize,"" he said, according to the Guardian Australia on Friday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that he will travel to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, also known as the COP 26 which begins on Oct. 31 and runs until Nov. 12 in Britain. While he is expected to take a 2050 net-zero emissions target to Glasgow, the Liberal and National parties, which together form the governing Coalition, haven't reached an agreement over the issue. Morrison, leader of the Liberals, has been working towards a net zero commitment since Joe Biden became the U.S. president and brought his country back to the Paris agreement. But the Nationals have expressed concerns that such a target will jeopardize regional jobs. Tehan said that committing to net zero will allow Australia to be ""at the table"" to push back against ""protectionist forces"" or countries, who may disrupt the global efforts to address emissions reductions. ""My concern is if we're not at the table, signing up to net zero by 2050, then we're not there making sure that this is going to be done the right way and that those protectionist forces can't disrupt the approach that we think should be taken to addressing emissions reductions,"" he said.

Ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, WHO released its COP26 special report, ""The Health Argument for Climate Action."" The ten WHO recommendations highlight the urgent need, and numerous opportunities for governments to prioritize health and equity in the international climate regime and sustainable development agenda. Above all, the WHO urges governments to commit to a healthy, green recovery from COVID-19. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the intimate and delicate links between humans, animals and our environment. The same unsustainable choices that are killing our planet are killing people,"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own interests,"" he added. The report comes as unprecedented extreme weather events and other climate impacts are taking a rising toll on people's lives and health. Increasingly frequent heatwaves, storms and floods, have killed thousands and disrupted millions of lives. Changes in weather and climate are also threatening food security, driving up disease, and negatively affecting mental health. ""Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity,"" the report says. ""While no one is safe from the health impacts of climate change, they are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged."" As well as recovery from COVID-19, the report also puts health and social justice at the heart of the UN climate talks. It calls for a fair and inclusive transition to renewable energy, particularly from coal combustion, and promotes sustainable, healthy urban design and transport systems, as well as more affordable, nutritious diets. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said COP26 is a crucial opportunity to fulfill the promise of the Paris Agreement. That means reducing emissions to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; providing 100 billion U.S. dollars each year to the developing world for climate action, and financial support for mitigation and adaptation, the UN chief said at a ministerial meeting in Milan, Italy, via a video link last month.

Britain hailed the commitment by more than 100 countries to end deforestation in the coming decade as the first big achievement of the conference in the Scottish city of Glasgow, known as COP26 - but experts noted such promises have been made and broken before. More than 120 world leaders were heading home after two days in which they received stark warnings about the state of the Earth from Johnson, naturalist David Attenborough, Queen Elizabeth II and - most powerfully - the people of countries and regions already facing climate upheaval. Johnson said at a news conference that it was important to ""guard against false hope,"" but added that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the outcome of the talks. The conference aims to keep the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - the goal set at the Paris climate conference six years ago. Johnson had a message for negotiators from around the globe who will strain over the next 10 days to turn politicians' climate promises into reality: ""The eyes of the populations of the world are on you."" The U.K. said it has received pledges from leaders representing more than 85% of the world's forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Among them are several countries with massive forests, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States. More than $19 billion in public and private funds have been pledged toward the plan. Experts and observers said fulfilling the pledge will be critical to limiting climate change, but many noted that such grand promises have been made before - to little effect. ""Signing the declaration is the easy part,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said on Twitter. ""It is essential that it is implemented now for people and planet."" Alison Hoare, a senior research fellow at political think tank Chatham House, said world leaders promised in 2014 to end deforestation by 2030, ""but since then deforestation has accelerated across many countries."" Forests are important ecosystems and provide a critical way of absorbing carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas - from the atmosphere. But the value of wood as a commodity and the growing demand for agricultural and pastoral land are leading to widespread and often illegal felling of forests, particularly in developing countries. Indigenous peoples are often among the hardest hit. ""We are delighted to see Indigenous peoples mentioned in the forest deal announced today,"" said Joseph Itongwa Mukumo, an Indigenous Walikale and activist from Congo. He called for governments and businesses to recognize the effective role Indigenous communities play in preventing deforestation. ""These are billions in investment towards environmental preservation, but it's very difficult for this money to reach Indigenous communities, reach traditional communities,"" said Chief Ninawa, a leader of the Huni Kui people from the Amazon attending the summit. Some campaigners said the forests pledge was a step forward. Luciana Tellez Chavez, an environmental researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there were ""quite a lot of really positive elements.""

They do not need to be told that climate change is important, that everybody has to do more.""They are under severe stress in the midst of this pandemic, of economic regression, of growing poverty rates. It is critical that the UK is able to echo the genuine and legitimate concerns that developing countries articulate.""The summit would be deemed a success if the financial concerns of poor countries are prioritized, he added.""COPs have succeeded when no group of countries had a reason to feel they were overlooked, ignored or dismissed. Inclusiveness is critical. There are countries that feel they were promised financial support and it has hardly materialized. Knowing those sensitivities is part of being well prepared,"" he told the paper.More than 120 world leaders, along with 25,000 delegates, including negotiators and journalists, are expected to take part in the summit, which runs until November 12. It is estimated tens of thousands of campaigners and businesses representatives will also be there to hold events, to network, and to protest, said the BBC.Participating nations will be expected to sign up to a declaration of commitment on plans to reduce emissions at the end of the conference.Developing countries experience some of the worst effects of climate change and need money to help reduce their emissions, says the UN.""Accelerating a climate implementation plan requires additional investment, and that money is simply not easily found,"" said Steiner. ""Recovery (from the COVID-19 crisis) can actually happen faster, (if you) create jobs with green transitions, but you still need capital to invest, whether private, public or concessional.""The Guardian noted that in 2009 poor countries were promised $100 billion a year from the private and public sector sources of the richest nations by 2020, but this goal has not been met. However, the target is still achievable by 2023, said a recent report, the Climate Finance Delivery Plan, commissioned by the UK as host of COP26.The summit would be a disappointment if developing countries were not given the assurances they required, and its success depends on how the UK as host can cultivate constructive discussion among participating nations, he said.He added: ""There has to be some palpable sense of shared purpose and unity.

The move took many onlookers in Glasgow by surprise, with the media alerted to a joint news conference just an hour before it started. Several world leaders have labeled this year\' s COP as the most important since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, and a U.S.-China declaration is sure to send a strong signal to all delegations in attendance. Xie said that the problem of global warming is  increasingly urgent and severe and that climate change threatens an  existential crisis.  In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between the U.S. and China than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation, Xie said.  As two major powers, both China and the U.S. shoulder international responsibilities and obligations. We need to think big. Kerry said the current time represents a  critical decade in the fight to combat global warming.  The U.S. and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get things done, Kerry said.  We cannot reach our goals without countries working together, and China and the U.S. in particular, as the two largest emitters in the world, both have to help show the way. In the joint declaration, both sides reaffirmed their commitment under the Paris Agreement to  hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The two countries also agreed to cooperate closely during the next 10 years on a range of climate-related issues, including methane emissions, fossil fuel reduction, and clean energy technologies. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the declaration an  important step in the right direction.  I welcome today\' s agreement between China and the U.S. to work together to take more ambitious climate action in this decade, Guterres said on Twitter.  Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity. European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said on Twitter that bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and China  should boost negotiations at COP26. China and the U.S. said they intend to establish a Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which will meet regularly to  address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade. In the declaration, the U.S. cited domestic targets to reduce methane emissions, and China announced its own plans for a  comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane, aiming to achieve significant emissions control and reductions in the 2020s. Also on Wednesday, COP26 President Alok Sharma published a first draft of the proposed Glasgow agreement, which parties will aim to reach at this year\' s conference, after further negotiations. The draft called on countries to accelerate the phasing out of both coal and fossil fuel subsidies, neither of which has been mentioned in previous COP agreements. The document also included stronger language on the warming target of 2 to 1.5 degrees, which was set in Paris six years ago. The draft  recognizes that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to 2 degrees, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Wang Yi, a senior scientific advisor in China\' s delegation at , told China Daily on Wednesday that adjusting this target could have a disruptive knock-on effect.  If we decrease the indicator, the target, to 1.5 only, that means we must change the whole Paris Agreement, Wang said. (Xinhua)\l"

Xi, who has not left China since the coronavirus \£dpandemic began, is listed on the schedule as one of the speakers at the summit, but was to deliver his address in a written statement - the only leader to do so.Biden earlier expressed disappointment that Russia and China ""didn't show up"" in terms of \£dclimate change commitments.The US continued the pressure yesterday with National Security adviser Jake Sullivan chiding China as one of the ""significant outliers"" as nations aligned to fight the climate crisis. Sullivan said the US believed that China, ""who will not be represented at leader level at COP26"", had ""an obligation to step up to greater ambition as we go forward"".""We'll keep pressing on that,"" he said, calling the contrast \£dbetween US efforts under Biden to fight climate change and what he said was China's \£dpassive stance ""confounding"".The COP26 summit, which will run until November 12, is seen as the world's last best chance to curb global warming and avoid catastrophic damage. Some key issues are expected to be finalised \£dincluding carbon market mechanisms, climate finance and ""nature-based solutions"" that emphasise the role nature plays in combating climate change.The Glasgow conference comes on the heels of a two-day summit of the Group of 20 in Italy. Leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies made a compromised commitment in Rome on Sunday of reaching carbon neutrality ""by or around mid-century"".In the final communique, leaders of the G20, whose economies account for 80 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, called for taking accelerated \£dactions across mitigation, adaptation and finance during this \£dcritical decade.For the first time, leaders committed to halting international financing for building new unabated coal-fired power plants abroad. They also re\£daffirmed the commitment to mobilise jointly US$100 billion per year by 2020 and annually until 2025 to aid developing countries - which richer nations failed to meet on time.In a video address delivered at the G20 summit, Xi told the leaders that developed nations should ""set an example"" on emissions \£dreduction and help developing countries fight climate change. Helen Mountford, vice-president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said success at COP26 was largely dependent on rebuilding trust.""In many ways, success at the Glasgow climate talks hinges on rebuilding trust - trust that the promised financial support will be delivered to developing countries, trust that major emitters will make bold emission cuts and trust that new corporate commitments are transformative rather than PR stunts. The world will be watching to hold their leaders to account,"" she said.Jennifer Tollmann, senior policy adviser at think tank E3G, said the Rome meeting helped set the stage for Glasgow. ""By committing to accelerate action across mitigation, adaptation and finance, the G20 is expected to lay a foundation for an £cceleration outcome' at COP26. Recognising the need to reach a balance of mitigation and adaptation finance and the need ... to increase support for adaptation speaks to concerns that will be front of mind in Glasgow,"" she said.""What's missing?

Gibson Mwangi, a climate change expert noted that China has demonstrated commitment to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, thereby boosting transition to a green, inclusive and resilient future for humanity. He said that leveraging China's resources, expertise and technological prowess is key to boost climate response in developing countries that have borne the brunt of global warming. ""China is way ahead of developing nations in mitigating and reducing carbon emissions,"" Mwangi said in a virtual interview with Xinhua during the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) slated for Glasgow, Scotland from October 31 to November 12. He noted that technology transfer facilitated by China combined with capacity building and sharing of best practices can be harnessed to help developing countries cope with negative impacts of climate change. China's wealth of experiencing in tackling extreme weather events like droughts and floods could be useful in development of a global climate response strategy, said Mwangi, who is currently in Glasgow for the COP26 meeting. He added that developing countries can also tap into expertise from Chinese scientists in their quest for a climate-resilient future. The former head of Climate Change Unit in Kenya's Ministry of Water and Irrigation said that investments by Chinese companies domiciled in the Belt and Road Initiative have also contributed positively to climate response in the global south. Mwangi said that African countries are keen to join hands with China at the global climate summit to push for a just and fair deal to hasten green transition. He revealed that the group of 77 that include 134 developing countries has resolved to negotiate as one bloc together with China in order to realize positive outcomes at the Glasgow climate summit. Mwangi said that African Group of Negotiators attending COP26 are keen to involve China in deliberations aimed at delivering climate justice to a continent reeling from a series of extreme weather events. He noted that both China and Africa are united in the quest for low carbon development, adding that there is a consensus among the long-standing partners on the need to improve adaptive capacity of local communities. Mwangi said that in the absence of solid commitment from the industrial north to help Africa tackle the climate crisis, China could fill the gap through showcasing its best practices in dealing with severe weather patterns.

It is not a number for negotiation,"" said Satyendra Prasad, Fiji's ambassador to the UN.Many vulnerable countries have campaigned for years with the slogan ""1.5 to stay alive."" But the world is slipping off track.""Overshoot is very likely unavoidable,"" said Johan Rockstr\'f6m, director of the Germany-based Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.Deep cuts in emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels - twinned with mass plantings of trees that soak up carbon, and novel technologies for extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - could eventually turn down the global thermostat.""We have this delicate dilemma that it's really important for policymakers to aim for 1.5 - but that does not mean that we lose the world's future at 1.6 or 1.7,"" Rockstrom said.The Earth might be able to tolerate a brief overshoot, he said, before irreversible changes set in, such as the meltdown of Antarctica's ice sheet or mass collapse of coral reefs.""Every tenth of a degree matters,"" he said, adding that people, especially the young, would have ""every reason to be angry"" if temperatures rise 1.5 C.On the COP26 conference's website, the main goal listed by Britain is to ""secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach.""Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted at the start of the summit ""Let's keep 1.5 alive #COP26.""

Before the 2015 Paris climate conference, he noted that one scientific projection showed the world was on track for a catastrophic 6 C of warming. After pledges for emissions cuts in Paris, that fell to about 4 C, he said.And last week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said new commitments in recent days, such as by India to reach net zero emissions by 2070, meant warming could be limited to 1.8 C by 2100.The IEA added a key caveat that the projection would require all national goals to be met ""in full and on time,"" after years of failed promises.On Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker, a scientific research group, estimated the world was on track for a far higher 2.4 C of warming by 2100, based on national pledges for 2030 that are the building blocks of the Paris Agreement.""There is a massive credibility, action and commitment gap"" at COP26, it said. ""Targets for 2030 remain totally inadequate.""The UN says emissions would have to fall 7.6 percent a year this decade to get on track for the 1.5 C goal. Such a pace is unknown except during wartime, pandemics, recessions, and the smokestack industries.Greenhouse gas emissions tumbled by 5.4 percent in 2020 during lockdowns to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, close to the UN's recommended amount, but are on track to rebound by 4.9 percent in 2021, according to the Global Carbon Project.Technology illusion?Some environmental groups say the idea of overshooting the 1.5 C goal, and then reversing course, is a fantasy.""People who are talking about overshoots and having more time aren't serious about 1.5,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.""Technologies that don't exist yet are not a way to keep it alive,"" she said. Emerging technologies include machines to suck carbon from the air, or to capture and bury emissions from power plants.Mohamed Adow, head of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, said the world should keep working for 1.5 C, even if temperatures overshoot.""I can't imagine a time when we say we've given up on 1.5,"" he said.But all agree the opportunity to keep it in sight is shrinking fast.""Overshoot is not endless - probably 1.6, 1.7 maximum to get back down to 1.5 by the end of the century,"" said Niklas Hohne, founding partner of the NewClimate Institute.He added that governments were doing too little to curb emissions - putting the crucial target at risk.""For me, 1.5 would be dead if we continue on this trajectory for another five years, maximum,"" he warned.Reuters\l"

"COP26","China","COP26_China160","Mobilizing money for net-zero goals","December 6, 2021 Monday","China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)","The climate conference has come and gone. Both the public and private sectors, as well as the media, around the world are now ardently assessing the summit's achievements or lack of thereof. The talks in Glasgow witnessed firsthand the passion of youth demanding governments to act with greater urgency, while their country representatives worked extra hours to find common ground on the details of the agreement.COP26 did not unveil a treaty on par with the 2015 Paris Agreement but exhorted countries to take steps to keep global temperature increases to 1.5 C until the end of the century. Leaders of developing nations demanded a trillion dollars annually over the next three decades from developed countries to help the developing world adapt to and mitigate the climate change. Advanced countries, whose carbon pollution over generations caused the problem, agreed to this funding commitment with the goal of eventually achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.The Glasgow Climate Pact put in place measures for countries to enhance their climate targets next year and phase down coal power; and it resolved key rules of the Paris Agreement. It fell short in other areas, such as insufficient provisions on carbon markets, social protection, and aligning public investments. Outside the negotiations, COP26 made encouraging commitments to cut methane emissions, halt and reverse deforestation, and align private investments to the net-zero goal.Delivering on climate finance is the stickiest point of contention between developed and developing countries. Because most of the nationally determined contributions in regard to emissions cuts are conditional to the availability of adequate financial support. Mobilizing $1 trillion every year seems a daunting task. But COP26 witnessed extraordinary support from the global finance industry. The world's largest investors called for a robust, transparent and fair climate deal, promising that they will make money flow. And banks promised to find ways to promote and channel tens of billions into low-carbon investments.But private finance will not flow in a vacuum. There is a close relationship between the way in which incentives are handled and increased climate investments. The public sector needs to focus on efficiency of the finance industry to help channel private savings into investments which will not just give investors a return in the short run, but will ensure that those returns are economically sustainable in the long term.The good news is that the financial industry is not short of savings. At the global level, some $300 trillion is represented in capital markets, a little more than half from commercial banks, and the rest from insurance and institutional investors. Against this, the clean $1 trillion looks quite modest. But financial markets still have not got enough money flowing in support of a net-zero economy.One of the reasons is that motivation for private financing of low-carbon infrastructure is not strong. If a carbon intensive investment gives a greater return than that of a clean and green alternative, investors cannot ignore the business case of making profits. That is why over 300 financial institutions have urged the world leaders to reach an agreement on climate financing. They are ready to pay a price for carbon if it makes their investment relatively more attractive. These institutions have not suddenly become climate activists. They gradually understood that unless the climate is stable, the economy in which they invest will be at risk.Moreover, most private investments on climate change mitigation in developing countries in Asia are not made by financial institutions but by big corporations. Huge economic reward could be gained if they are directed towards low-carbon investments by pricing the carbon in the markets.Though a lot of activities are taking place in finance systems, there is a long way to go to mobilize the $1 trillion. A major cause is that financial institutions themselves are not well structured to accelerate financial flows in the right direction. They inadvertently give preference to carbon intensive investments over low-carbon ones.The same is true for accounting standards. Even though they claim to be prudent, they do not question the value of stranded assets. The risk measures used to manage banks are backward looking and are ill-adapted to foresee climate risks which lie ahead. Investment institutions, which owe a fiduciary duty of care towards their stakeholders, often ignore the effects of climate change on the population for which investment decisions are made. Shareholders, citizens and policymakers need to ensure that financial systems are fit for the purpose to achieve net-zero targets. In short, significant, coordinated effort is necessary to compel future investments towards climate change mitigation and adaptation.The following are some possible initiatives that have been successful in several countries: ensure that crediting agencies offer ratings which incorporate long-term climate risks into their evaluations; encourage companies to report openly on their carbon intensity, and agree to declare their improvement plans; create standards of reporting for all companies that can raise money through public stock exchanges; get banks and financial institutions to manage and minimize value at risk through proper screening and make them safer, and steer them away from carbon intensive activities.Also, trustees of investments funds could be encouraged to accept fiduciary responsibility; equity investors urged to integrate climate considerations into their engagement with companies and voting for boards; and insurance companies assisted in identifying and creating climate resilience. And donor, public and multilateral banks must significantly increase their climate portfolios and intensify their efforts to help countries advance the net-zero goals.Each of these is but one of many small steps. But taken together they would put the world on a very different course in mobilizing the clean $1 trillion.The author is director of research strategy and innovation at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.

"COP26","China","COP26_China162","Roundup: Glasgow climate conference attendees face ""high hurdle"" in booking hotel rooms","October 22, 2021 Friday 6:05 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Xinhua writer Gu Zhenqiu LONDON, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- As the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change, also known as COP26, is set to open in 10 days in Glasgow, an accommodation crisis is sweeping the Scottish city, as thousands of people are still looking for a hotel room ahead of the high-profile international event. As the event is expected to gather more than 30,000 people from around the world, it has pushed hotel prices up to above 600 pounds (nearly 828 U.S. dollars) a night in Glasgow at present. The hiking hotel prices highlight the hardship COP26 attendees have to face in securing a bed in the host city amid mounting health risks brought by COVID-19, which is described by The Financial Times as ""the most difficult hurdle of all."" An eye-popping example reported by the British media is that one room which normally costs 42 pounds (nearly 58 dollars) was advertised at 1,400 pounds (1,931 dollars). What's more surprising is that the price of a standard room for one person at a hotel in Argyle Street has rocketed to 6,540 pounds (9,018 dollars) -- almost five times more than the cost of a 10-day stay on the same dates a month earlier. During COP26, negotiations and workshops often run through the night. Staying close to the conference center is no doubt a top priority for participants. However, many cannot afford the exorbitant room prices in Glasgow, and are not prepared to confront the thorny problem. A shortage of affordable accommodation even forced some to book rooms more than 200 km away from the conference venue, according to local media. The soaring prices of hotel rooms in the largest Scottish city have also prompted local residents to open their houses and cash in. The hot wave even spread to Edinburgh, about 70 km east of Glasgow, and further. The lack of beds has become so dire that two cruise ships are berthed on the River Clyde to be makeshift dormitories for people working at the UN conference. At the same time, the costs of renting COP26 pavilions and space for hosting workshops, panels discussions and keynote speeches during the conference are considerably higher than they were at COP25 in Madrid, Spain, in December 2019. Already postponed by one year due to COVID-19, the conference designed to seek joint solutions to climate change, an urgent common challenge for all mankind, should not be held up again by hurdles caused by human faults. Fair-priced hotel rooms are crucial for the extensive participation of all parties related, especially developing nations. The widespread bed hunting in Glasgow has also drawn much criticism to the British government for a ""shambolic preparation"" for the UN conference. The Guardian described the Glasgow conference as ""confusing and expansive"" and many British people fear the upcoming UN gathering would be ""the most exclusionary COP ever."" The overly high pricing of everything in Glasgow soon sparked concerns that smaller nations would be priced out of hosting pavilions, as one organization was quoted to have spent nearly 50,000 pounds (6,897 dollars), and another was forced to scale back space for their pavilion. The UN has called on developing countries affected by the high conference costs to speak to the UK government, as it is obliged to ensure equitable and safe participation by all nations. Embassies and businesses have also been contacting the Downing Street for being unable to get hotel rooms, according to local media. Enditem\l"

Photo: AFPWorld leaders attending the COP26 UN climate summit should focus not only on abandoning fossil fuels but also on setting ambitious goals to end deforestation - and expand funding and rules to drive forest protection, environmentalists are urging.More than 100 world leaders have confirmed they will attend November's COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow, the UK in person.One key aim for the conference is moving finance out of polluting fossil fuels - especially coal - which are responsible for the lion's share of climate-heating emissions.But green groups say the importance of carbon-storing forests in curbing global warming is being overlooked by many nations - especially in their climate funding - with limited progress in transforming economies to become deforestation-free.In 2015, about 195 countries agreed to limit the rise in global average temperatures this century to ""well below"" 2 C and ideally to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels.""COP26 provides a great opportunity to establish forests at their rightful place, high on the climate agenda,"" said Frances Seymour, a distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a US-based think tank.""We need to start thinking about tropical deforestation the way we think about coal: We have to phase it out as quickly as possible, otherwise the goals of the Paris Agreement will remain out of reach,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Cutting down forests has major implications for global goals to curb climate change, as trees absorb about a third of carbon emissions produced worldwide, which they release if they rot or are burned.Forests also provide food and livelihoods, help clean up air and water, support human health, are an essential habitat for wildlife, aid tropical rainfall and offer flood protection.But in 2020, tropical forest losses around the world equaled the size of the Netherlands, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch.Of the world's original rainforest, about a third has already been completely destroyed, while another third is in a degraded condition, said Toerris Jaeger, secretary general of the Oslo-based Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN).Lack of attentionForests sequester over 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually - 1.5 times more than that pumped out by the US, the world's second-largest emitter, said Danny Marks, assistant professor of environmental politics and policy at Dublin City University.But emissions from forests have been increasing recently.""If we want to address climate change, we need to stop deforestation,"" said Marks. ""Unfortunately, compared to reducing fossil fuel emissions, forests are not getting the attention they deserve ahead of COP26.""That must change, he added, pointing to the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests for their livelihoods.He also noted that the potential for forests to mitigate carbon emissions is higher than other solutions because preserving them avoids their carbon stocks being released, while as restored forests grow, they also capture carbon from the air.Stopping deforestation, alongside other efforts to protect natural systems like mangroves and wetlands, could get the world more than a third of the way to limiting warming to 2 C, he said.It is also cost-effective as it does not require expensive or unproven technology like carbon capture and storage for reducing emissions from industrial processes, he added.In Indonesia, home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, conservationists are using cheap audio sensors to listen out for chainsaws to tackle illegal logging, while ex-loggers are being trained to fight forest fires, for example.Marks said less than 3 percent of funding for measures aimed at reducing emissions is devoted to forest protection.Money to communitiesIn the run-up to COP26, governments and businesses have shown growing interest in providing financial support to protect nature and forests - and green groups expect that to continue.Private donors in September pledged a record $5 billion to help safeguard the planet's plants, animals and ecosystems.But without placing the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities at the core of the response to tropical deforestation and allocating direct funding to their efforts, the forests will not be saved, said RFN's Jaeger.In 2020, for example, one indigenous community in Brazil helped protect the Amazon by negotiating with illegal gold miners to stop operations and remove their equipment.Globally, about 35 percent of protected natural areas are traditionally owned, managed, used or occupied by indigenous and local communities, yet they are rarely considered in the design of conservation and climate programs, researchers say.The people of Guyana's South Rupununi region are already experiencing worsening climate-change impacts - such as flooding and heat waves - said Immaculata Casimero, co-founder of the Wapichan Wiizi Women's Movement, a local advocacy group.Governments should issue legal titles to indigenous people for their lands and territories, given their positive role in curbing global warming, she said.Deforestation DriversConservationists blame the production of commodities like palm oil and minerals for much of the destruction of forests, as they are cleared for plantations, ranches, farms and mines.Over the last decade, pressure from consumers and green groups has pushed major brands that grow, trade or buy commodities to pledge to end deforestation.Many have promised to only buy supplies certified as sustainable, and have teamed up with green groups to root out deforestation from supply chains, including by investing in technologies to track what is happening on the ground.Environmentalists urged countries at the COP26 climate summit to consider removing subsidies that are harmful to forests, and to introduce trading rules that exclude companies or investors linked to forest destruction.Reuters \l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China164","Expected absence of Xi to dash European hopes","October 12, 2021 Tuesday","South China Morning Post","It is a long weekend that has the potential to shape the future.Leaders of the world's most powerful nations will meet in Rome for the Group of 20 Summit, then head to Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to cement climate commitments with other countries.But with reports that President Xi Jinping will not travel to Europe for either event, Western observers are downgrading their expectations of how much can be achieved. According to Bloomberg, Chinese diplomats have \£dalready informed G20 nations that Xi will not attend the Rome \£dsummit in person, citing China's tough Covid-19 quarantine rules.That means Xi will also probably miss the Glasgow talks, efforts seen as critical to safeguarding the Paris accord commitment to limit global warming to ""well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius"" and securing a deal on climate funding for developing countries.Officials see the G20 talks as ""setting the tone for Glasgow"" and a key venue for leaders to meet informally and iron out differences ahead of COP26. ""[Xi's absence] would definitely undermine the potential for a transformational outcome in Glasgow and the G20 agreements needed to support it,"" said one \£dclimate negotiator, who did not wish to be named.An EU official involved in \£dpreparing for COP26 said it would not be ideal, but not cataclysmic, given that normal arrangements had been shelved during the pandemic. The official said that from Brussels' perspective, the momentum was there for progress, but ""summitry is a delicate interplay of factors"" that could easily be derailed.The sources said EU climate chief Frans Timmermans had built up a good rapport with \£dBeijing's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and Vice-Premier Han Zheng over working-level discussions and that rapport continued even as the United States killed \£dclimate \£ddialogue with China during the Trump era.At the Conservative Party \£dconference last week, new British \£dForeign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""It is important that China is part of the solution on climate change, of course it is, and you know we want them to be engaged on that, but I can't comment on the \£dprecise attendance of COP26.""COP26 and the G20 Summit may also be a missed opportunity to help repair ties \£dbetween China and the US and European Union. Both Western powers have sought face time with Xi this year but may have to make do with phone calls instead.""The absence of certain leaders is unlikely to impact the G20 Summit outcome. It will, however, prevent progress on a number of other important bilateral issues that would normally occur during the breaks,"" said Kelly Ann Shaw, lead US negotiator on the US-China phase one trade deal, and G7 and G20 Sherpa under the Trump administration.""It was on the margins of the 2018 G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, for example, that the US and China agreed to launch trade negotiations. Without the G20 or COP26, it's not clear when President Xi and President [Joe] Biden will meet, or what that means for how the world's most important economic relationship will unfold next,"" said Shaw, now a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells.At the launch of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council in Pittsburgh late last month, EU \£dofficials were keen to impress the importance of face-to-face talks in sealing the deal.""It's so much easier to talk when you're not on Zoom and I think it's quite rare when you have these principals sitting down with each other, not for just like 10 minutes in an airport lounge or a half hour somewhere, but for a full day,"" an EU official said, asking not to be named. ""It's a really good opportunity to talk frankly and openly and to develop the conversation as you go.""Experts recalled former US president Barack Obama's dramatic intervention in climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 as an example of what could be done when leaders were on the ground, rather than on screen.Obama burst into a closed-door meeting of leaders from China, India and Brazil to force a climate agreement late in the day, despite the objections of officials from the three countries.""At the end of the day, Xi is the one who gives the political green light, and at some stage the top guys have to decide,"" former EU trade chief Herv\'e9 Jouanjean said.""They make the decisions and they have information that you as a negotiator do not have. At big summits like this, it often comes down to the top guys.""Jeff Moon, ex-US consul \£dgeneral in Chengdu and now head of consultancy China Moon Strategies, pointed to the early \£dexchanges between former \£dleaders Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon that led to the normalisation of \£drelations, despite the tense geopolitical times.""Mao said to Nixon, you may hear some anti-American stuff but don't worry about it. I don't know what the analogue is now, but I can imagine there are topics that are extremely sensitive,"" Moon said.""Being on screen is better than nothing, but it's not one to one. The number of staffers looking and hearing is very large. And one to one, with only their top aides, is a really important way to communicate your priorities.""The meetings also come as China's reputation in the West is at its lowest point in 30 years.Opinion polls show growing distrust in China's role in global affairs, even as Beijing itself has tried to take a leading role in \£dclimate change initiatives.Andrew Mertha, director of the China Studies Programme at Johns Hopkins University, agreed. ""It works at cross purposes with China's ongoing international campaign of trying to supplant the US as the principal global partner for stakeholder \£dnations, and - rightly or wrongly - calls into question China's hard-earned reputation for responsible global behaviour, in the non-strategic realm, at least, going back to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 and beyond,"" Mertha said.""The optics are that Beijing is attempting to be too clever by half, which is not a great look for the trajectory China currently \£doccupies.""Additional reporting by Robert Delaney\l"

(VINCENT THIAN / AP)Climate change may be an abstract issue for many, but environmental anthropologist Serina Abdul Rahman points out how erratic weather patterns are threatening the livelihoods of vulnerable populations, citing the case of a coastal community in Johor that is grappling with reduced fish catches.Serina, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, works with fisherfolk in the southern Malaysian state and has seen first-hand how stronger typhoons and rising sea levels have brought home the crisis for people dependent on the ocean for their survival.""In the past, some of these changes could be assumed to be the result of coastal development. But in 2021, this does not apply as everything had ground to a halt due to COVID-19. Yet we see a drastic reduction in fish catch,"" she said.Serina said this is why it is ""incredibly important"" to promote a green post-pandemic recovery for economies to ensure sustainability and protect livelihoods.""The writing is on the wall. If we don't slow down our carbon emissions, the glaciers will melt faster. If we dredge marine areas, we release more carbon from seagrass beds. The same applies to mangrove forests which are often cleared for coastal development,"" she said.As Asian nations slowly recover from the pandemic, conducting mass vaccinations and reopening their economies, it is important for policy-makers to include climate adaptation and mitigation measures in their policy planning, analysts said.Decarbonization of the economy was in fact a key theme at recent high-level talks in the region. At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting hosted by New Zealand, the leaders' summit ended on Nov 12 with a declaration acknowledging the need for ""urgent and concrete action to transition to a climate-resilient future global economy"".At the Nov 16 virtual meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, Xi said climate change can well become a new highlight of China-US cooperation. The two countries agreed to boost climate cooperation during the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, that concluded on Nov 12 in Glasgow, Scotland.The COVID-19 pandemic taught us to recognize that many of our assumptions on what is essential in society need re-configuration.

He said it is also the poor who are suffering from the impact of climate change.The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said in its Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2021 that over the past 50 years, natural hazards in the region have affected 6.9 billion people and killed more than 2 million. In East Asia, the frequency of heatwaves and tropical cyclones is increasing while Central Asia is suffering from drought. Floods, droughts, and cyclones have intensified in Southeast Asia and South Asia.Saleemul Huq, director of the Bangladesh-based think tank International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said a climate-resilient economic rebound is important given that Asia is not only one of the most vulnerable to climate change but also among the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters.He said his country, Bangladesh, is among the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, so ""we are taking adaptation and building resilience as a major pathway"". Saleemul cited the Bangladesh energy ministry's decision to cancel plans to build 10 coal-fired power plants and how the nation is developing wind power plants.Other Asian countries are likewise shifting to renewables and gradually reducing their use of fossil fuel to reduce emissions and fulfill their commitments to the Paris climate treaty. Delegates to the COP26 also agreed to phase down coal and committed to end deforestation by 2030.Xi said in his APEC speech that China will ""advance green transition"" and contribute to ecological conservation in the Asia-Pacific region. He reiterated China's plan to hit peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his nation will achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 and that renewable energy sources will account for about half of the country's power generation by 2030.

GLASGOW, Britain, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States on Wednesday released the China-U.S. Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s here at the ongoing 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Noting that they have further recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis, the two countries said in the declaration that they are committed to tackling the crisis through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s, as well as through cooperation in multilateral processes, including the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process, to avoid catastrophic impacts. The two sides also stressed the vital importance of closing the gap between efforts being made around the world and those that need to be taken to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. They declared their intention to work individually, jointly, and with other countries, in accordance with different national circumstances, to strengthen and accelerate climate action and cooperation aimed at closing the gap, including accelerating the green and low-carbon transition and climate technology innovation. In this aspect, their intended cooperation fields include regulatory frameworks and environmental standards related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the 2020s, maximizing the societal benefits of the clean energy transition, policies to encourage decarbonization and electrification of end-use sectors, as well as key areas related to the circular economy, such as green design and renewable resource utilization. Recognizing specifically the significant role that emissions of methane play in increasing temperatures, both countries considered increased action to control and reduce such emissions to be a matter of necessity in the 2020s. On the other hand, to reduce CO2 emissions, the two countries said they intend to cooperate in such areas as policies that support the effective integration of high shares of low-cost intermittent renewable energy, transmission policies that encourage efficient balancing of electricity supply and demand across broad geographies, distributed generation policies that encourage integration of solar, storage, and other clean power solutions closer to electricity users, as well as energy efficiency policies and standards to reduce electricity waste. With respect to COP26, both countries expressed support for an ambitious, balanced, and inclusive outcome on mitigation, adaptation, and support.

The white paper was released by the State Council Information Office. This marked the second time for China to have released a white paper on climate change, said Ye Min, Vice Minister of Ecology and Environment. The white paper fully demonstrates China's progress and achievements in coping with climate change, as well as the country's remarkable contributions to the global climate governance, offering a systematic description of China's proposal, wisdom and solution in dealing with climate change, Ye explained. As an active promoter and staunch follower of climate action, China in recent years has implemented a national strategy for actively responding to climate change, adopting a series of policies and measures such as upgrading industrial structure and energy mix, reinforcing efforts in energy conservation and greater energy efficiency, establishing market mechanisms, and enhancing forest carbon-sink, Ye introduced, adding that positive progress has been achieved. Greenhouse gas emissions have been effectively controlled. China\' s carbon intensity in 2020 was 18.8 percent lower than that in 2015. The figure was also 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, which means that China had more than fulfilled its commitment to the international community \- to achieve a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from the 2005 level by 2020. It demonstrates that China has largely reversed the rapid growth of its carbon dioxide emissions. Energy structure has been optimized.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his Chinese social media account to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to think again about invading Ukraine. ""We are on the edge of a cliff, but President Putin still has time to step back and think,"" Johnson said in a Chinese-language post on Tuesday night. ""We urge everyone to engage in dialogue - the Russian government should avoid making decisions that would be disastrously wrong for their country."" The Russian embassy in China responded to Johnson yesterday afternoon - via Weibo - calling the statement ""absurd"". ""This statement is designed to further inflame the hysteria surrounding the so-called imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine and is absurd,"" it said. ""The continued military development in Ukraine supported by Nato countries through the supply of large amount of weapons to the country is an example of the escalation of the situation."" Johnson's message had received 1.1 million likes by noon yesterday. However, Weibo users did not appear to share the British leader's concerns. ""He's on the edge of the cliff. Just push him off,"" wrote one social media commenter, tagging the Russian embassy in China. Some were confused, asking ""does Putin know Chinese?"" Others took an opportunity to ask the British prime minister for news of BBC TV series Sherlock Holmes, last broadcast five years ago. ""How about the [next season] of Sherlock Holmes?"" one user said, with another echoing, ""this is a really serious issue Mr Prime Minister should take into consideration"". Johnson made his debut on Weibo in 2020, using the account set up by the prime minister's office. He last posted on the platform in November during the COP26 summit when China and the US issued a joint pledge to act on climate change. In a meeting last week with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, Johnson said the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine was the ""biggest security crisis that Europe has faced in decades and we've got to get it right"". There were signs on Tuesday night that war may have been averted, with the Russian defence ministry saying it was pulling back some of its troops from the border with Ukraine, after they had completed military exercises. Hours later, during a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Moscow, Putin denied he was planning to invade Ukraine. Russia is ready for talks with the US and Nato on missile limits and military transparency, but had not yet received positive answers to its security demands, he added. Also on Tuesday, in a national address from the White House, President Joe Biden said the US had not verified if some Russian troops were moving back from the border.

When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription. The UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow.Second, we need to focus on concrete actions. Visions will come true only when we act on them. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures. Developed countries should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better.Third, we need to accelerate the green transition. It is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade our energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern, promote a greener economy and society, and explore a new pathway forward that coordinates development with conservation.Xi Jinping emphasized, guided by the vision of a community of life for man and Nature, China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development. We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects. We will speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. Recently, China released two directives: The Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful Implementation of the New Development Philosophy, and the Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030. Specific implementation plans for key areas such as energy, industry, construction and transport, and for key sectors such as coal, electricity, iron and steel, and cement will be rolled out, coupled with supporting measures in terms of science and technology, carbon sink, finance and taxation, and financial incentives. Taken together, these measures will form a ""1+N"" policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with a clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint.Xi Jinping pointed out, ancient Chinese believe that ""successful governance relies on solid action"". China hopes all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all.The World Leaders Summit was held on the sidel"

The goal is to identify solutions at scale to further progress on eliminating commodity-driven deforestation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that 23% of global GHG emissions are associated with land use, including11% of global GHG emissions from deforestation and the conversion of natural ecosystems. The commitment from these companies builds on the existing initiatives to define a pathway to meet the 1.5C targets, working with other supply chain actors and governments. This collaboration will focus on how to scale up support and incentives for smallholders and farmers, increase traceability to indirect suppliers, and better track scope 3 emissions.The joint statement is supported by the Tropical Forest Alliance hosted by the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Ongoing collaboration continuing to COP27 will be supported by these actors.Alongside the announcement from these ten companies, a joint statement from 28 governments will be announced at via the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue Roadmap for Action. This joint statement calls for governments to increase sustainable Agri-commodity trade while protecting forests and other critical ecosystems.Recent evidence shows that there is no pathway to the 1.5C targets set out in the Paris Agreement without halting forest loss and improving the livelihoods of producers. The joint statement signals a recognition of the critical role played by businesses working in agricultural commodities.Source: COFCO\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China181","The climate bill comes due","December 3, 2021 Friday","China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)","The world continues to inch closer to climate catastrophe but thanks to the 26th Session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change, or COP26, we now know a couple of things.One, the path to a catastrophic outcome is pretty well marked out. Two, the rich countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of this big global mess that we are in, are not wholly committed to cleaning it up or settling the overdue payment for cleaning it.An obvious conclusion that emerged from COP26, which was held from Oct 31 to Nov 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, is that the world needs to take immediate, drastic, sustained and multilateral action to limit the worst impacts of climate change. The world cannot afford to have any single country not participate.This may not be fair but, as it turns out, only the people on the wrong side of fair seem to be most worried about this. Everyone else is particularly concerned with saving cash.The unfairness built into all multilateral solutions is plainly visible if you take a look at history. In all the fear and talk about the dark future for the world, the past is often overlooked.Global warming did not start this year, this decade or even this century. The ramping up of human-caused climate change began when people started imposing their will upon nature by building cities, mass-producing all manner of goods, burning things, extracting resources, clearing tracts of land for agriculture and all the other things people do to generally improve their lives.A drastic uptick in emissions started in the 1950s. Emissions have doubled over the past three decades and quadrupled in the last six.Since 1850, people have pumped a cumulative 2.5 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By various estimates, that leaves another 500 billion tons for global warming to stay within 1.5 C above preindustrial levels. By the end of this year, we will have burned through about 86 percent of our global ""budget"", according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.A relatively small number of people in developed countries have accounted for a disproportionally high share of all those emissions.An analysis of historical emissions by Carbon Brief  a UK-based website that covers climate science, climate policy and energy policy developments  points out that the United States has, by far, been the largest producer of atmospheric carbon dioxide.The US, which under former president Donald Trump backed out of the Paris Agreement of 2015 on climate change and ramped up fossil-fuel extraction, accounts for about 20 percent of the CO2 in the atmosphere, even though it is home to a little more than 4 percent of the world's population.By one roundabout calculation, every person in the US basically took away the ability of four other people elsewhere to produce any kind of greenhouse gas and allow the world to stay within its ""budget"".China, with about four times as many people as the US, is second at 11 percent. China's ramp-up in emissions is relatively young and the country accounts for about 18 percent of the global population.Russia, Brazil and Indonesia come in third, fourth and fifth place, respectively, but in large part this is due to their large landmass and the way their land produces CO2.Apart from the US, other rich nations, mostly in Europe, have also fared badly in terms of emissions. The United Kingdom has produced 3 percent of global emissions with less than 1 percent of global population, excluding emissions from its colonies when it had them.The agreement reached at COP26 is basically a watered-down compromise that aims to burn less coal instead of targeting all fossil fuels and sets global rules for trading carbon credits. However, the agreement does note that countries will need to cut emissions in half over the next decade.None of the three criteria that the UN had set to determine the success of the conference were met, including $100 billion in financial aid annually from rich nations to poor ones for efforts to adapt to climate change.The rich world basically agreed to talk about paying for the climate damage it caused, but ultimately failed to make any reparations.The climate mess is still there.

"COP26","China","COP26_China183","Climate crossroads","November 1, 2021 Monday","China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)","(ZHONG JINYE / FOR CHINA DAILY)The stakes are stratospherically high heading into the 26th United Nations climate change conference, or COP26, which kicks off in Glasgow on Oct 31.A diplomatic meet, a trade expo, and focal point for demonstration all rolled into one, the conference will see world leaders as well as industry heads, academics, celebrities, and climate campaigners convene in the Scottish city for two weeks of heated debate on global warming.Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that climate change is ""nature's alarm bell for humanity"", and there is a broad consensus among the attending delegations that this alarm is now deafening. United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, acting as host for COP26, has described the conference as a ""turning point"" for mankind, and United States climate envoy John Kerry dubbed the meeting as ""the last best chance"" to avoid environmental catastrophe on a global scale.At the conference, leaders will negotiate how best to achieve and accelerate goals that were laid out in Paris in 2015, when an agreement to keep global warming to ""below 2, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius"" was struck.COP26In the lead up to COP26, most nations submitted their own domestic goals for emissions reductions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs. And during negotiations in Glasgow, there will be a 20 gigaton elephant in the room, since the sum of these NDCs is not sufficient to close the so-called emissions gap.The Climate Action Tracker estimates that to stay the course for 1.5 degrees warming by mid-century, the world must collectively reduce annual emissions by 20-23 billion tons by 2030. The NDCs submitted so far in 2020 and 2021 will serve to narrow this gap by just 4 billion tons, according to the tracker.Separate estimates released this week by the UN found that a total emissions reduction of 55 percent by 2030 is needed to keep the 1.5 degree target in sight, while current NDCs have the world on course for a mere 7.5 percent reduction.""Over the last year most major emitters have committed to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century,"" Aidar Turner, a member of the UK House of Lords and chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, or ETC, told China Daily.""We are getting closer to that objective. But if you look at the NDCs, which have been submitted ahead of COP26, they are far from adequate to give us even a 50/50 chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees or a 90 percent chance of limiting it to 2 degrees.""The secretary-general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has called for ""more ambition from every country"" in their NDCs, as current targets have set the world on a ""catastrophic pathway"" of 2.7 degrees of global heating.""This must stop. This must be reversed,"" Guterres said during the recent Pacific Islands Forum.Some of the world's major economies have made ambitious emissions reductions pledges, including net-zero targets, in the months leading up to the conference. The UK aims to reduce emissions in 2030 by at least 68 percent compared to 1990 levels, the US has committed to halving emissions by 2030, and China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2060.China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said during a virtual news conference on Oct 19 that China will ""fight its hardest"" to achieve emissions and neutrality targets over the coming decades. He said that COP 26 provides an opportunity to construct ""road maps for actionable policies and measures"" and to ensure that countries ""honor words with real deeds"".A climate march in Brussels, Belgium, on Oct 10, ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. (PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY)On Oct 26, the State Council, China's Cabinet, released an action plan for carbon dioxide peaking before 2030. By 2030, the share of non-fossil energy consumption will be around 25 percent, and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will drop by more than 65 percent compared with the level registered in 2005, according to the plan.Asher Minns, executive director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia in the UK, said net-zero pledges will have an impact despite being voluntary and non-binding.Australia, for example, was criticized for submitting an NDC in 2020 that was unchanged on its previous commitments. This week, the nation has committed to a net-zero target for 2050, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying that modelling detailing emissions reductions will be released ""eventually"".ETC chair Turner said that the net-zero pledges are ""very important"" as ""once a government has committed to a net-zero target, company commitments follow"".He used the example of China Baowu Steel Group Corp, which committed to achieving emission neutrality in 2050, immediately following China's 2060 net-zero pledge.""The company is now developing clear plans to get there, with progress already in the 2020s,"" Turner said.Ajay Gambhir, a climate economist at Imperial College London, noted that the absence of pledges from the world's third largest emitter, India, would surely be a talking point at COP26. Delegates at the conference will also be charged with negotiating cross-border action on climate change. Patricia Espinosa, who is executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has stated that COP26 can only claim success if global climate finance targets are met.In 2015, developed nations agreed to raise $100 billion of annual finance by 2020 in order to support developing countries mitigate the effects of climate change and phase out fossil fuels. That target is yet to be met, and delegates are expected to negotiate a new 2025 target from a floor of $100 billion.""This money is critical,"" Gambhir said, ""As even though there's a clear rationale for tackling climate change, there are still costs to be borne. If there aren't clear and credible plans to finally provide this money, and then increase it later in the decade, then we won't be on track to steer emerging economies off fossil fuels and that makes 1.5C much harder.""Turner said that there also needs to be ""greater clarity on the $100 billion commitment"", as this figure does not encapsulate all that is needed.""The total financial flows required by developing countries are far higher, more like $500 billion, but most of the finance required is not a gift but debt and equity investment that will get a return, delivered by development banks and the private sector,"" Turner said. ""What China does, for example via the China Development Bank, is more important than any 'developed country' promise.""A further point of international cooperation that remains unresolved is Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which covers carbon markets and other mechanisms to incentivize emissions reductions. Failure to reach agreement on Article 6 cast a shadow over negotiations at COP25 in Madrid.""This was a must-do in Madrid, yet didn't get done,"" said Gambhir. ""There's always another chance in the next COP, but it will be disappointing and disheartening if Article 6 doesn't get fully agreed."" Some commentators have questioned if the article needs a rethink altogether, since there is such a lack of consensus on the best way to achieve a workable system for carbon markets.""I am not personally convinced that Article 6 is nearly as important as some people suggest, and indeed we have to recognize dangers in the Article 6 approach,"" Turner said. ""If the only way we get finance to flow from rich to poor is because rich countries take less action to reduce their own emissions, and instead buy credits from other countries, we will take the pressure off developed countries to drive the technologies which will lower the cost of decarbonization for everyone.""In the view of China's ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Zeguang, developed nations must respect the varying situation in different countries, especially those nations still undergoing industrialization and urbanization. ""Developed countries should take the lead in reducing emissions. They should not pin all the responsibilities onto China and developing nations,"" Zheng said.Laurent Fabius, who was chairman of the Paris COP21, said that putting a price on carbon ""is probably the most efficient tool to use for our common goals"".""What strikes me is that on all these issues, carbon pricing is one of the keys, and maybe the key,"" Fabius said during a recent virtual meeting of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and the Chinese International Finance Forum. ""But it is true to say that carbon pricing will not be discussed as such in Glasgow, mainly because there is no international agreement on this very important question.""Several nations and regions, including the European Union and China, have moved ahead with their own carbon trading mechanisms. Vitor Gaspar, director of the Fiscal Affairs Department of the International Monetary Fund, said that even if a comprehensive international agreement was untenable, a carbon pricing mechanism involving the six largest emitters ""would be enough to get us on track"".A carbon market that takes into account the signatories of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, has been suggested by Zhang Jianyu, executive director of the BRI Green Development Institute.""Belt and Road countries account for over 60 percent of global carbon emission,"" Zhang said.

""The task cannot be achieved by governments alone -- it will require industries, markets, policies, and technologies working together,"" read the report. ""Much of the technology and many of the tools needed are available now."" The Australian government's emissions plan, released ahead of the COP26 Glasgow climate summit, fell under criticism for being vague, lacking concrete policy decisions, and being overly reliant on technology. The plan revealed that 70 percent of emissions reductions would come from technological developments, 15 percent of which was to be the result of ""further technology breakthroughs"" or, technology that doesn't yet exist. Tony Wood, Grattan Institute Energy and Climate Change policy director and lead author of the report, said that achieving net-zero could require ""the biggest economic transformation Australia has seen outside of wartime."" ""Getting to net-zero by 2050 will be hard, but there is more to be gained than lost as Australia's economy transforms,"" said Wood. Wood said in order to minimize the cost and impact of Australia's transition, the government would need to stop propping up companies that are uncompetitive in a net-zero global economy, and rather attract investment to those that are conducive to it.

TAN KAIXING/FOR CHINA DAILYWhile important progress was made at the recent COP26, just keeping alive the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, developing countries have expressed disappointment at the lack of commitment on financing for transition and climate damage. Developed economies have grown on the back of fossil fuels for 200 years, and the developing world needs help to reduce emissions while dealing with low living standards and over-stretched government finances.Climate activists had hoped that a strong commitment would be achieved on phasing out fossil fuels, with coal the first target. However, to get a global agreement that could be ratified needed a watering down of action on coal to a phasing down in use, not a phasing out. Aspirations had met harsh realities about the practicalities of both transitioning to clean energy sources and the technologies needed for green transport and heating, two of the major emitters.Electricity is essential to power the world, and sources to generate electricity need to preserve the requirements for stability and security of supply, affordability and portability. The reality is that both coal and oil are readily transportable, whereas the clean energy from nuclear and wind power, solar and tidal are more area-specific. Changes in weather patterns can diminish the output from green sources. Fossil fuel producers still see a need for their contributions in global energy balance for the next few decades.There is a similar reality in the production of petrol-engine cars. While some major automobile manufacturers committed to end combustion engine production by 2040, several major companies, VW, BMW and Toyota, refused to join the declaration. Again the reality was that in markets in some countries, they felt they would be left producing cars that no customers would buy.Without strong infrastructure to supply reliable electric vehicle (EV) charging points around a country or technological breakthroughs, which hugely extend the range an EV can travel, developing countries won't see much demand. Equally, EV prices would need to fall for locals to be able to afford them.In reality, such policies would force drivers to continue to maintain aging petrol-driven vehicles with the associated emissions, whereas a new generation of low-emission petrol-engine cars would be more efficient and more affordable. Again, a realistic balance is needed in transport.Of course, as individuals, we can commit to using public transport, with clean energy buses and trains where available, to cycling and walking more, to working from home if permitted, to recycling waste and, as consumers, favoring environmentally conscious businesses. Yet, we need governments to set the agendas, change the rules, and provide the incentives for climate protection.Climate damage is a truly global issue, and any country's own policies can only do so much. Commentators have said that to some extent ""kicked the can down the road"". Equally though, commitments made by leaders now for completion in 2035 to 2050, are not commitments those leaders will be in power to deliver, and there have to be regular checks on progress and mechanisms for fulfillment. One aspect that is predicted from COP26's ""lukewarm"" response to the climate challenges is that climate activists will be more energized to campaign for more progress and hope for more decisive actions at COP27 in Egypt next November.

Because of the adjustments required, the CBAM will be phased in gradually and will begin by targeting imports that have historically seen a high risk of carbon leakage, such as iron, steel, aluminum and electricity.\~CBAM will also result in greater reporting requirements for both importers and exporters, which will now be held accountable for documenting their carbon emissions. As it stands, the state of carbon reporting is a very manual process that relies on traditional tools such as Excel, even when HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/09_resource_guide3.pdfreporting emissions to the United Nations. Without uniform standards on how these data are collected and what software is used, human errors and lack of trust in reporting processes could give ground for EU trade officials to claim that carbon emissions have not been  adequately offset in the market(s) where a particular good was produced.\~\~Singapore as a carbon neutralizerSingapore is already home to HYPERLINK https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/carbon-services-and-climate-finance/more than 70 organizationsThe current tax of S$5 (US$3.60) per metric ton of emissions is HYPERLINK https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2022-singapores-carbon-tax-could-increase-to-80-per-tonne-of-emissions-by-2030-in-accelerated-net-zero-emissions-bidset to increase to between S$50 and S$80 per ton according to Singapore\' s HYPERLINK https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/2030 Green Plan. This local expertise will place it in good stead as ASEAN producers look for leadership in this space in the run-up to 2026.Thanks to its status as a trading and logistics hub, Singapore is well positioned to help producers in countries across the region to navigate the complexities of trade with the EU as CBAM implementation approaches. However, there is currently little indication that the EU will acknowledge non-EU carbon pricing initiatives. How can Singapore enable Asian businesses and producers to overcome this hurdle?The solution is to spearhead the development of high-integrity carbon measurement and reporting. Singapore can lead the charge by providing services that enable producers to certify their carbon footprint according to standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), such as the global benchmark HYPERLINK https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:14097:ed-1:v1:enISO 14097:2021. This accreditation could then be certified by leading European certification firms such as the British Standards Institute (BSI), allowing businesses to establish the credibility of the carbon footprint of these producers. By reducing or negating the carbon emissions involved through emission-reduction efforts such as energy-efficiency products and renewable energy substitution, producers can minimize the tariffs imposed on them once their products enter the EU.\~Furthermore, Singapore can provide neutralizing services for individual products, providing the seal of approval for import into the EU. Using  voluntary emission reduction credits (VERs), businesses can obtain high-integrity carbon-neutrality certificates, certified according to European standards by Singaporean or European certification firms such as Singapore Test Services and BSI, will help to achieve an international standard of carbon neutrality under HYPERLINK https://www.bsigroup.com/en-SG/PAS-2060-Carbon-Neutrality/PAS 2060 (soon to be HYPERLINK https://www.iso.org/standard/43279.htmlISO 14068). These carbon-neutrality certifications would account for the carbon emitted throughout the entire production supply chain, including transshipment through Singapore.\~By offering and streamlining this process for businesses, Singapore can position itself as the linchpin of the global carbon-trading operations to complement its status as a major logistics and trading hub. This would not only greatly help Asian producers to prepare themselves best and most economically for the CBAM so that their products shipped to the EU can be reliably trusted as carbon neutral, but would also further enhance Singapore as a trade hub in the new era, where the flow of materials, money, and carbon will be more profoundly intertwined.\~To secure this position, Singapore needs to tackle a significant issue plaguing the VER market: the challenges surrounding Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). As part of the Paris Agreement, all countries \- both developed and developing \- committed to specific emissions-reduction plans based on NDCs. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement established a cross-border system that puts a greater burden on developing nations to achieve their own NDCs while selling carbon credits to developed countries.The Singapore government\' s emphasis on sustainability and a booming tech entrepreneurial spirit have prepared the city-state to evolve into a green finance center for the region, one with services designed to ease the burden on developing nations.Frms such as MetaVerse Green Exchange (MVGX) are offering an innovative Carbon Neutrality Token (CNT ) \- a digital VER that certifies and tracks carbon credits to ensure that it has all the integrity to meet the highest carbon neutrality standards without encroaching on NDCs issues for developing countries. This allows ASEAN countries to keep to their commitments toward net-zero emissions, while exporting digital VERs to Singapore for Asian businesses to purchase so they can ensure that their products are verifiably carbon neutral before they head to the EU \- all with the assurances that there is no double-counting and that they are directly impacting green projects.\~This private-sector solution verifiably enables carbon neutrality at scale, and when applied by Singapore to global trade flows, will enable fellow Asian governments to accelerate and further their commitments as they work toward net-zero emissions in 2030 under COP26\' s Glasgow Climate Pact, while helping Asian producers mitigate the challenges posed by CBAM.Reading between the l"

There is so much distrust of authority that many are cynical. Elections seem to solve nothing because when the majority margin is wafer thin, coalition governments cannot make tough decisions. We become like Josef in Franz Kafka's book The Trial, in a faceless court facing charges and accusations we cannot understand with no idea how to get out of the predicament. Kafka describes very well how many feel alienated, hopeless against a faceless bureaucracy, frustrated against the system and lost in an absurd reality. Many hark back to a lost golden era, which causes identity conflict between race, religion and cultures. Politicians at both ends of the spectrum from democracies to autocracies understand the power of mass movement. People have always been mobilised by powerful storytelling. Either we unite against an enemy or we strengthen the institutions and shared interests that bind us. No one seems to have found the right narrative to unite us in confronting a frightening future of climate catastrophe. COP26 showed how the climate warming story changed over the years. In 1972, the Club of Rome built a pioneering model warning about the limits of growth. Hardly anyone believed it. In 1988, amid the hottest year on record, Nasa scientist James Hansen declared that HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeglobal warming was upon us. That year, the United Nations established the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3144337/climate-change-unchecked-gas-emissions-make-earth-hotter-and-sooner-unIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to determine the scientific basis of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change and its political and economic impact.

Video, tweets and social media matter far more. Most people no longer have the patience or interest to go through very complex and technical scientific evidence. They need simple stories with clear-cut options. Thunberg is very effective because she speaks the language of the young. To get the story right, four elements are required. Clearly identifiable characters - villains, victims and heroes; a political context that is believable; a moral theme that shows options and outcomes; and, finally, a riveting plot. This week, I passed through the Spanish village of Guernica, which has a mural painted by Pablo Picasso of the horrendous bombing of the village destroyed in the Spanish civil war. In a single mural, Picasso evoked emotion worldwide that the violence and suffering of war is futile.

We do not as yet have that story, video or event, nor a hero or heroine. The war between Troy and Sparta was never really about Helen's beauty, but about power and glory. The destruction of humanity by climate heating is either too catastrophic or too remote to be believed. Perhaps human beings will only move like a murmuration of starlings when attacked by a hawk. One will make the first move, some others will follow and then mass movement begins like a symphony. The hawk may kill a few starlings, but the mass survives. We should never doubt the power of imagination to spark change, which is why stories are ingrained in the human DNA. We need that spark to set our imaginations free - and the leadership to make the mass move to save ourselves. Andrew Sheng writes on global issues from an Asian perspectiveCopyright (c) 2021.

""So even if it does cost us a little bit now, we do have to do that in order to stop so much economic damage in the future, let alone people losing their lives,"" she said.

If we don\' t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow. Observers had hoped a weekend meeting in Rome of leaders of the G20 nations, which between them emit nearly 80 percent of global carbon emissions, would give a strong impetus to the Glasgow COP26 summit, which was postponed for a year due to the pandemic.The G20 major economies committed on Sunday to the key goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels  the most ambitious target of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.They also agreed to end funding for new unabated coal plants abroad  those whose emissions have not gone through any filtering process  by the end of 2021.But this did not convince NGOs, the British prime minister or the United Nations. While I welcome the G20\' s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled but at least they are not buried, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Twitter. We\' ve inched forward (at the G20). We\' ve put ourselves in a reasonable position for COP in Glasgow but it\' s going to be very difficult in the next few days, Johnson said before warning:  If Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails. The Glasgow gathering, which runs until November 12, comes as an accelerating onslaught of extreme weather events across the world underscores the devastating impacts of climate change from 150 years of burning fossil fuels.The current commitments of the signatories of the Paris agreement  if they were followed  would still lead to a  catastrophic warming of 2.7 Celsius, according to the UN.COP26 marks the  last, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach, summit president Alok Sharma said as he opened the meeting on Sunday.

China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, Zheng said.China is also the biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranks first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation, and has the largest nuclear power generating projects under construction, he noted.Meanwhile, China is taking concrete actions to address climate change, said Zheng, adding that China has announced the goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060, and rolled out a whole set of concrete measures to achieve these targets.China has high expectations for the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow, said Zheng.""We hope all parties will work closely together, give priority to completing the negotiations of the Paris rulebook, make arrangements for issues of major concern to developing countries including financing, technology and capacity building, and push for the implementation of their respective declared objectives,"" he said.China hopes to promote cooperation with Britain on green development, said the ambassador.There are huge potentials for practical cooperation in green finance, green technology, renewable energy, civilian use of nuclear energy, electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. For such potential to bear fruit, however, the governments of both countries need to create a favourable political environment, he said.""Economic and trade issues should not be politicized. When willful restrictions were imposed on businesses based on geopolitical or ideology reasons, you are not practicing free trade, you are going against the rules of the WTO (World Trade Organization), you are not attracting FDI (foreign direct investment), and you are doing a disservice to global cooperation on green development,"" he said.""I hope China and the UK could strengthen practical cooperation on green development in all sectors rather than resorting to mutual restriction,"" he added.

Several years ago he invested in a conversion of his 51-year-old DB6 to run on a blend of 85 per cent bioethanol and 15 per cent unleaded, also known as E85, which in his case is indeed largely made from surplus British wine and a by-product of cheesemaking.

Get the answers with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Charles has been a passionate tree-hugger for as long as I can remember. Years before the public at large became aware of the problems our pollution created, he was concerned about the build-up of plastics and was an early adopter of solar power. He also revealed in the interview that he has given up fish and meat two days a week now, and forgoes dairy on one day so as to reduce his personal carbon footprint. All credit to Charles, but his solutions are niche, and although the heir to the throne of one of the world's most prominent royal families is very passionate about the green cause, he is considered an eccentric gentleman without clout, having lost support over the years with the very public scandals in which he became entwined. COP26 sounds very important. It's the latest big climate conference, the biggest summit ever hosted by the United Kingdom, billed as the ""turning point for humanity"", and the event where, according to Prime Minister HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/boris-johnsonBoris Johnson, we should all ""grow up"". He was promising to bring the globe together to solve the climate crisis in the biggest event since the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/paris-climate-summit-20152015 Paris AgreementA FAMILY BUSINESSThe UK is the perfect host for the climate conference, as it has made some very solid strides forward in decarbonisation, particularly through offshore wind power, which on a good day provides 30 per cent of the nation's needs. This business is accommodated by Charles' mum, for a fee, as the seabed to 12 miles offshore is a family heirloom owned by the Crown Estate. Offshore wind power is the perfect showcase for the event, with one turn of a modern UK turbine blade generating enough juice to power a house for two days. However, Johnson, who has very passionately promoted the conference, may be starting to get worried about whether it will be a success given that Chinese President HYPERLINK Xi Jinping seems to be giving it a swerve and frenemy HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/vladimir-putinRussian President\~ HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/vladimir-putin/newsVladimir Putin is not going to turn up either. That means the leaders of two of the world's largest polluters will be absent, even if there are representatives in their place or they address it via video-call. Rather than an anti-climate stance, this is perhaps more a reflection of how much they've fallen out with Western democracies. After all, HYPERLINK China and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/russiaRussia have net-zero targets in place for around 2050-60. Perhaps they simply don't feel like running into angry mobs of activists, would-be assassins, and hysterical world leaders right now, with so many other problems to deal with. As the West gangs up to oppose policies that it sees as distasteful, China still has most of the globe over a barrel, being both the biggest customer for many nations and the largest producer of consumer goods. For its part, Russia has a stranglehold on the natural gas Europe needs. The negatory RSVPs from the Chinese and Russian leaders were swiftly followed by reports of considerable resistance from countries with vested interests in fossil fuels, raw materials and meat production. These included HYPERLINK Japan, whose new prime minister, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/fumio-kishidaFumio Kishida, distanced himself from the event. Perhaps he saw little upside for him politically after declaring himself hawkish on China anyway and his early popularity rating at home looking somewhat wobbly. I suspect COP26To make the potential fiasco even worse, Scotland is threatening to go on strike during the conference. Demanding more pay, over 200,000 public workers, including dustbin men, are threatening to walk out and leave piles of stinky rubbish around. Oh, and the railways will be on strike too. In the run-up activists are unhelpfully gluing themselves to roads around Britain to block traffic, and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/news/global/article/3069718/climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-named-times-personGreta Thunberg is stirring up the youth to get involved and join in the overall disruption, which will add to policing costs billed to the British taxpayer. It's getting messy. Nicola Sturgeon, first minister for Scotland, is now billing the conference as a Covid-19 spreader event, as if to dissuade attendance. I am starting to wonder if anyone is onside here. So perhaps the show that Johnson has touted as the ""turning point for humanity"" is about to misfire badly, failing to gather the top leaders of all the world's super-polluters at one round table. As a refresher: China produces 29 per cent of global carbon emissions, the US 14 per cent, India 7 per cent, Russia 4.6 per cent and Japan 3.5 per cent. Of course, China's pollution largely comes from making products the rest of the world uses, so emissions figures by country basis are enormously skewed. In any case, it seems Mother Earth will have to tolerate our polluting habits a while longer, even as she lashes us with increasingly violent weather according to the United Nations. WHY BOTHER?COP26 could only be a success if the world's super-polluters fully engage: China, the US, https://www.scmp.com/topics/indiaIndia, Russia and Japan would need to put their other differences aside and tackle the collective global emissions head-on. Unfortunately, that may be off the table now, and it will be back to our individual small-scale efforts, or localised efforts by smaller nations or states for the next couple of years until the next conference. We'll be reminded to buy solar panels, cleaner cars and give up the sausages a couple of times a week. Which takes us back to Charles and his son William. The UK's royal family will be visiting Glasgow in force: Charles, William, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, will all be supporting Johnson's attempts to hold it together and no doubt tout the benefits of wind power. With the UK now being a tiny polluter in the global scheme of things, perhaps we should wonder ""why bother?"" if no one is serious about cleaning up. Although emissions control may have become something of a sideshow at the climate conference, Britain's role in kicking all this off some 250 years ago with the industrial revolution may be putting something of a moral obligation on the royal family to do something useful and lead the world out of it. Given that they are making a few quid for the family coffers in the process, why not? Unfortunately, the queen will not be going to COP26. But at 95 years old and under the advice of her physicians, she is understandably excused and can stay home to catch up on Netflix's to see if Charles becomes king. If the throne skips a generation to the more popular Prince William, as some people speculate it might, it would give the family more clout internationally. His taking a pop at billionaire space tourists to fix the mess on this planet before going elsewhere suggests he has his head squarely on his shoulders and will take up the baton from his dad at some point.

Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College of London, made the remarks as a week-long series of events to discuss China's role in tackling climate change was launched here on Monday. The China Week event, hosted by the Lau China Institute, consists of high-level panel discussions, webinar, film screenings, book launches, essay competition and photography exhibitions. The theme of China Week 2021 is climate change and the environment, with a particular focus on China's role in driving national and international climate action. ""We decided to hold this series of events just before the COP26 summit on climate change and the environment, to highlight the key importance of China and global cooperation so far on this issue, and to deepen the dialogue so that we can take action going forward in deciding what we can do, together,"" Brown told Xinhua.

"COP26","China","COP26_China211","Interview: China plays key role in development of green tech: Polish expert","October 29, 2021 Friday","People's Daily Online - English","WARSAW, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- China plays a key role in enabling large scale and lower cost production of green technologies that support the energy transition, contributing to the combat against global warming, the head of a leading Polish think tank told Xinhua ahead of COP26 in Britain. According to Piotr Arak, director of the Polish Economic Institute (PIE), China's production capabilities have already contributed to lowering the cost of solar panels to one eighth of what it was in 2008. ""If you have technological advantages and can bring down the marginal price of green energy products for the end consumer, it would give us the possibility to adapt to possible spikes of energy use in the future,"" he said. Arak said that decreasing prices for consumers would help the greening of the general energy mix as well. ""For both China and Poland, countries with a similar energy mix, meaning with a limited access to gas and the like, it could solve some of the challenges going forward."" More affordable technology would be a great help for Poland, whose energy transition would be one of the most challenging in Europe. Even using transitional sources, attaining the COP26 goals would mean Poland would need to invest 136 billion euros (157 billion U.S. dollars) by 2030, and over one trillion euros (1.16 trillion U.S. dollars) by 2040. ""Poland needs to do a more rapid energy transition than any other country in Europe,"" he said. It is important for Poland to meet its climate goal, which is to eliminate coal as an energy source as quickly as possible. Around 80 percent of the country's power production is sourced from coal, according to figures from the Polish Geological Institute. Coal is also a mainstay fuel to heat Polish houses, especially in suburban and rural areas, Arak said. ""It has an enormous influence on the air quality."" However, replacing coals with pure renewables is not realistic for Poland, Arak said. ""We don't get enough sunlight, wind or hydropower for that. Renewables can therefore only be a part of the energy mix here, at least at the current technology level.""\l"

Physicists think that hydrogen constitutes 75% of the universe\' s matter. And if things go to plan, hydrogen might save the planet from global warming too.The H2Zero initiative ranked as one of the main achievements at the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow. A group of global energy companies led by BP, EDF, Iberdrola, Shell and TotalEnergies agreed to accelerate the usage of decarbonised hydrogen in helping the world move towards net-zero energy systems. And although there were no Chinese signatories to the deal, the country\' s leading oil and gas refiner Sinopec has just announced the world\' s biggest renewables-to-hydrogen power project as part of its own clean energy drive.Over the next few years we\' re likely to hear a lot more about fuel cells that produce electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms. We will also get a better understanding of the different hues of hydrogen, the chemical element that ranks as number 1 on the periodic table.In its natural state, hydrogen is a colourless and odourless gas. But a colour scheme flagged at COP26The plan is to switch to using much cleaner forms of energy to make the gas, however, relying more on carbon capture (\' blue\' hydrogen) or best of all, renewables (known as \' green\' hydrogen).By 2025 Sinopec is targeting annual production of 500,000 kilotons of green hydrogen, some of it from a new 10,000 mt/year hydrogen electrolyser facility in Xinjiang. This will break water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from a 300 MW photovoltaic power station. Starting production in 2023, the power facility will service Sinopec\' s nearby petrochemical plant.The energy giant has two similar projects on the launch pad in Inner Mongolia: a 10,000 mt/year wind and solar project in Ordos and an even bigger 100,000 mt/year renewables-based hydrogen plant in Ulanqab. Overall, the company has announced Rmb30 billion ($4.71 billion) in investment to build up its green hydrogen business through to 2025. About half the total will go into hydrogen refuelling stations, with the remainder allocated to hydrogen purification facilities and materials development.Recharge magazine estimates that Chinese entities have ploughed Rmb110 billion into 35 hydrogen refuelling station and fuel cell projects during the first five months of this year alone. Sinopec already has 20 hydrogen refuelling stations but says it will have installed 1,000 by the mid-point of the decade.As of June this year, Japan had 147 hydrogen fuelling points nationwide, compared to 80 in Germany and 45 in the US.Tesla founder Elon Musk has chastised hydrogen-powered cars as  extremely silly , not least because of how combustible the gas is. But the China Hydrogen Alliance (CHA), an industry body, released a white paper recently setting out ambitious plans for 100 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030. To put that figure into perspective, there is currently 76 MW of global hydrogen production capacity through electrolysers, according to International Energy Agency figures.China accounts for 25 million tonnes of the 70 million tonnes of hydrogen production already in play. But nearly two-thirds is from coal gasification. One of the major challenges in the transition to greener hydrogen is the higher costs of production compared to use of coal and natural gas. The CHA is calling for more government subsidies to stimulate growth in green hydrogen output, speeding the path to cost parity in the energy grid in the same way other energy technologies like wind and solar power were encouraged.\l"

Their reasoning is that investment in any market, particularly one as complex as China, needs to be a long-term commitment, according to a new report by the Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI). Firms dismissed the notion they had been naive about doing business in and with China, \£dsaying they had assessed the risks and were not overexposed to the market, the report said. Some - like Woodside, one of Australia's largest LNG producers - said they also liked working with China because of its ""commitment to cleaner energy"".\~ Woodside's chief representative in China, Kristine Leo, told ACRI that not only was ""China's commitment to cleaner energy a factor in ensuring a continued market for Woodside's LNG"" but the firm and its Chinese partners shared common climate goals.\~ ""We have strong existing relationships with joint venture partners and other stakeholders in China aimed at furthering mutual development goals to support climate targets and the supply of cleaner energy,"" Leo said in the report.\~ ""China's future economic growth and recently announced emissions targets mean it is expected to have strong demand for lower-carbon energy, such as LNG."" China is on track to become the world's largest LNG (liquefied natural gas) importer, overtaking Japan, according to commodities intelligence service ICIS. Chinese imports this year are forecast to leap by 21 per cent.\~Gas is a cleaner fuel than traditional sources of energy like coal. Australian businesses' engagement with China on climate change and Beijing's commitment to the issue - which took centre stage at the recent COP26 summit when Beijing and Washington agreed to boost \£dclimate cooperation - has highlighted\~a relative lack of action on Canberra's part.\~ Australia, which released its net zero 2050 plan only a week before COP26 last month, has not signed up to the US-China plan to reduce methane and end support for new coal projects.\~ Another Australian company, and one of the world's biggest iron ore producers, Fortescue Metals also said it had committed to tackling decarbonisation problems with China, its biggest customer.\~ A continued relationship with China, the world's biggest consumer of iron ore, was crucial to its green goals, Fortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines told ACRI. ""Collaboration will be key to achieving global emissions \£dreduction goals, and this includes ongoing engagement with our customers in the crude steel \£dmanufacturing industry in China to learn about the challenges they face in decarbonising their operations,"" Gaines said.\~ The Australian China Business Council said\~Australian businesses\~showed interest in collaborating with China on climate change projects. Cooperation would not only help China and Australia contribute to the fight against climate change, but provide an opportunity for the two countries to reset ties, its national president David Olsson said. The council and the China Chamber of International Commerce will host a virtual meeting next week to explore opportunities for Australia-China collaboration on carbon reduction goals in the mining, energy and resources sectors.\~ ""The\~council has identified the growing global commitment to address the climate crisis as a unique chance to reframe Australia's relationship with China,"" he said.\~ More, however, could be done by the Australian government to steer this along, said global advisory ICF lead climate specialist Huw Slater.

"COP26","China","COP26_China230","COP26 Nations compromise on coal to strike UN climate agreement","November 15, 2021 Monday","Macau Daily Times","Almost 200 nations accepted a compromise deal yesterday [Macau time] aimed at keeping a key global warming target alive, but it contained a last-minute change that watered down crucial language about coal. Several countries, including small island states, said they were deeply disappointed by the change promoted by India to ""phase down,"" rather than ""phase out"" coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe."" Nation after nation had complained after two weeks of U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, about how the deal did not go far or fast enough. But they said it was better than nothing and provided incremental progress, if not success. In the end, the summit broke ground by singling out coal, however weakly, by setting the rules for international trading of carbon credits, and by telling big polluters to come back next year with improved pledges for cutting emissions. But domestic priorities both political and economic again kept nations from committing to the fast, big cuts that scientists say are needed to keep warming below dangerous levels which would produce extreme weather and rising seas capable of erasing some island nations. Ahead of the Glasgow talks, the United Nations had set three criteria for success, and none of them were achieved. The U.N.'s criteria included pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030, $100 billion in financial aid from rich nations to poor, and ensuring that half of that money went to helping the developing world adapt to the worst effects of climate change. ""We did not achieve these goals at this conference,"" Guterres said. ""But we have some building blocks for progress."" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said the change will make it harder to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times - the more stringent threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said governments had no choice but to accept India's coal language change: ""If we hadn't done that we wouldn't have had an agreement."" But he insisted the deal was good news for the world. ""We are in fact closer than we have ever been before to avoiding climate chaos and securing cleaning air, safer water and healthier planet,"" he said later at a news conference. Many other nations and climate campaigners criticized India for making demands that weakened the final agreement. ""India's last-minute change to the language to phase down but not phase out coal is quite shocking,"" said Australian climate scientist Bill Hare, who tracks world emission pledges for the science-based Climate Action Tracker. ""India has long been a blocker on climate action, but I have never seen it done so publicly."" Others approached the deal from a more positive perspective. In addition to the revised coal language, the Glasgow Climate Pact included enough financial incentives to almost satisfy poorer nations and solved a long-standing problem to pave the way for carbon trading. The agreement also says big carbon polluting nations have to come back and submit stronger emission cutting pledges by the end of 2022. Negotiators said the deal preserved, albeit barely, the overarching goal of limiting Earth's warming by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial times. Governments used the word ""progress"" more than 20 times Saturday, but rarely used the word ""success"" and then mostly in that they've reached a conclusion, not about the details in the agreement. Conference President Alok Sharma said the deal drives ""progress on coal, cars, cash and trees'' and is ""something meaningful for our people and our planet.'' Environmental activists were measured in their not-quite-glowing assessments, issued before India's last minute change. ""It's meek, it's weak and the 1.5 C goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters,"" said Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan, a veteran of the U.N. climate talks known as the Conferences of Parties. Former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking for a group of retired leaders called The Elders, said the pact represents : the pact represents ""some progress, but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster [...]People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty."" Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav argued against a provision on phasing out coal, saying that developing countries were ""entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels."" Yadav blamed ""unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns"" in rich countries for causing global warming. After Yadav first raised the specter of changing the coal language, a frustrated European Union Vice President Frans Timmermans, the 27-nation EU's climate envoy, begged negotiators to be united for future generations. Kerry and several other negotiators said that good compromises leave everyone slightly unsatisfied and that countries had more work ahead of them over the coming years. ""Paris built the arena and Glasgow starts the race,"" the veteran U.S. diplomat said. ""And tonight the starting gun was fired."" Chinese negotiator Zhao Yingmin echoed that sentiment. ""I think our biggest success is to finalize the rulebook,"" Zhao told the Associated Press. ""Now we can start implementing it and delivering it on our achieved consensus."" As negotiators left the final session after congratulating themselves, they passed a young lone protester who sat silently with red blood-like writing on crossed arms that said: ""We are watching.""SETH BORENSTEIN, GLASGOW, MDT/AP https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21316460645092.jpgLink to Image\l"

The Congo Basin is home to the world's second-largest rainforest after the Amazon with 375 million hectares.Many countries, including China, source hard wood and other forest products from the DRC.CAFI had threatened to cut funding after the Congolese \£dgovernment breached an agreement it struck with the initiative to conserve the forest in return for international aid money by awarding new contracts.Although Tshisekedi did not expressly mention Chinese companies - which play a major role in other sectors such as mining - they are big players in the timber business, especially for rosewood, which is in high demand for \£dluxury Chinese furniture.This demand has made the Central African nation a key source for timber, which environmentalists say is illegally sourced - often from protected areas.At least two Chinese firms are known to have been awarded logging rights in 2018, and according to an international development consultant there are also many \£dillegal operators, some of them Chinese, logging rosewood.""The first verifications revealed the illegality of many \£dcontracts, including those signed in September 2020 which awarded, to a single company, six \£dconcessions with a total area of 1,376,375 hectares in violation of the law,"" said a statement released after the council meeting.The DRC law limits the area controlled by a single firm to 500,000 hectares. The president asked the ministry of environment ""to make a technical and financial inventory of all \£dforest concessions in the DRC, to suspend all doubtful contracts pending the outcome of the audit"".Early this year, NGOs initiated a legal action against former \£denvironment minister Claude \£dNyamugabo over claims that Chinese firms were illegally granted logging permits for 2 million hectares in 2018. The case is still pending before the Council of State.A 2019 WWF report said while most industrial logging companies were backed by Swiss, Belgian and Lebanese capital, the main export market for most of them was China.""The increased presence of Chinese operators in the Congolese forestry sector coincided with a process of review of existing logging concessions in 2006, leading to a process of reconversion (renewal) of those deemed compliant with the 2002 Forest Law in 2008,"" said the WWF study.The Observatory of Economic Complexity said about two-thirds of the DRC's rough wood were exported to the mainland.Tshisekedi recently ordered a review of a US$6 billion deal \£dcovering infrastructure and minerals signed in 2008 with Chinese companies led by Sinohydro and China Railway Engineering Corporation. He also formed a commission to investigate the reserves at the Tenke Fungurume Mining copper and cobalt project, which is majority-owned by China \£dMolybdenum.Christian-Geraud Neema, an international development consultant based at the International University of Japan, said the DRC wanted to demonstrate its willingness and determination to play an essential role in the fight against global warming ahead of COP26 by preserving its forest. ""As much as there is a will to play that role, at the same time in Kinshasa there is a sentiment that DRC has never been fully rewarded to the extent of its potential,"" he said.But, contrary to the \£dmining revision process, ""I do not believe that this audit is targeting explicitly the Chinese"", he said. Neema said COP26, where the DRC was expected to ask for hefty compensation, was a more likely explanation for the government's actions than anti-China sentiment.\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China232","The right words","January 16, 2022","South China Morning Post","""It's not climate change"", declared writer-activist Margaret Atwood in 2015 - ""it's everything change."" This certainly includes the language used in framing our thinking on climate and sustainability. An articulation of the impact of human activity on global climate patterns has been present since the 19th century. The phrase ""climate change"" was first used in 1854 in an American popular-science magazine querying if observed changes might be ascribed to large-scale agri\£dcultural practices. The ""greenhouse effect"" was described by French mathematician Joseph Fourier in 1827, with the expression first applied to this atmospheric phenomenon by English physicist J.H. Poynting in the 1900s. In the 50s, the prospect of - and term for - ""global warming"" started receiving attention. As environmental concerns became more urgent in the 2000s, so, too, did the terms adopted by climate scientists, activists, organisations such as the United Nations, and major press outlets: in place of ""climate change"" - too passive, too gentle - the terms ""climate crisis"" or ""climate emergency"" were adopted. Their use increased 20-fold and 76-fold, respectively, between 2018 and 2020, with ""climate crisis"" increasing 40 per cent in usage last year, compared with previous years, according to data from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and the Cambridge English Corpus. The phrase ""global heating"" - preferred now to ""global warming"" - was used 15 times more in the first half of 2021 than in 2018, and recently added in the OED. Such expressions serve to convey a sense of imminent threat, reflect a negative emotional stance, and invoke an urgent call to action. But consider alternative narratives to those of the global north. Scholars have long recognised that indigenous languages encompass traditional ecological knowledge, including strategies for sustainable living, offering unorthodox inspiration for tackling our environmental crisis. For the 2021 COP26 global climate summit, in a plea to Western leaders to shift their thinking to focus on humanity's integration with and dependency on the natural world, the artistic project ""living-language-land"" identified 25 words from indigenous languages that underscore communities' ties to the land. The Quechua chalay ""the practice of barter and exchange"", for example, embodying the Andean concept of reciprocity, highlights the ancestral non-monetary economic system valuing ecology, relationships and the sacred nature of food. The International Decade of Indigenous Languages (2022-2032) lying before us is an opportunity to recognise and harness such value in pursuing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In a word: the Maori kaitiakitanga - recently added to the OED - refers to the human duty or responsibility of environmental stewardship, a reminder that we are all agents in creating a sustainable future.\l"

Get the answers with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Alok Sharma, Britain's president of the COP26 meeting, says he wants to use the summit to ""consign coal to history"". Yet, world coal prices are at record levels, up 35 per cent so far this year; HYPERLINK China and India are scrambling desperately for coal for their thermal power plants wherever they can find it; and natural gas prices in Europe are up 10-fold since January amid uncertainties over Russian supplies. Oil prices, meanwhile, are heading for above US$80 a barrel as Opec leaders resist pressure to boost production, and British drivers are panic buying petrol as pumps run dry. And, in an untimely piece of divine intervention, Europe and Britain suffered falls in renewables after a summer of below-average wind and sunshine. Just as Europe's economies cranked up demand for power as the Covid-19 recovery began, so the renewables needed to deliver us from our unsustainable dependency on fossil fuels have fallen short, and reminded us that until we have better batteries to store fickle wind and solar power supplies, then our reliance on traditional power sources will remain strong. With global fuel prices unlikely to fall soon, and shortages a concern, policymakers are now braced for these inflated costs to bleed through into the price of everything from petrol and winter heating bills to a wide range of consumer goods. Fears of ""greenflation"" are compounding inflationary forces inevitably linked with the world's emergence from the pandemic to make many economists speculate that high inflation rates will be less temporary than most central bankers have planned for. The starkest message of late has been that the transition away from fossil fuels is going to be messier and more costly than most people realise. It is likely to force political leaders to confront unpopular choices that most are desperate to avoid. And it is likely to involve more significant lifestyle changes than many people are willing to swallow. It will involve huge and sustained additional costs that governments seem unwilling - or unable - to bear, at a time when they are juggling unprecedented mountains of debt, lower tax revenues and a long list of competing claims on hard-pressed budgets. The HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3134443/climate-push-g7-agrees-stop-international-fundingInternational Energy AgencyIt says the pledges made ""fall well short of what is required"". It says investment in clean energy must triple, to US$4 trillion a year by 2030, and that unabated oil and coal power plants must be gone by 2040. By 2040, global oil demand must be cut to 50 per cent of last year's consumption level, and by 2050, 90 per cent of electricity must come from renewable sources, with annual additions of 630GW of solar power and 350GW of wind power. It says 86 per cent of cars must be electric by 2050, compared with 1 per cent today, with massive investment in national electric-vehicle battery-charging infrastructure. It says we will need breakthrough innovation in batteries, hydrogen power, and air capture and storage, but, in a more recent report released in October, is concerned that just 17 governments worldwide have any hydrogen strategy in place. From 50,000 tonnes of hydrogen produced worldwide a year, we need to aim for 80 million tonnes by 2030. Above all else, the IEA says we need ""unprecedented international cooperation"" for a realistic chance to reach net zero by 2050. As I look back at how well world leaders have worked together over the past two years through the global pandemic, and how productively the US and China are cooperating, the temptation ahead of COP26 must surely be to throw in the towel. Despite improving cooperation on carbon pricing, both to encourage the transition from fossil fuels and to fund new investment in renewables, a yawning gap remains between the carbon prices we need, and what consumers are willing to bear. Sweden may be willing to pay around US$130 a tonne, and European companies around US$60, but China's present carbon trading scheme, which charges US$7.70 per tonne of carbon, is barely credible. And the US is balking at any scheme at all, with President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/joe-bidenJoe Biden still seeming to believe technological miracles will provide a silver bullet. If the IEA's work has value ahead of COP26, it must be to demonstrate that the hunt for a silver bullet will be in vain.

Xi made the proposal in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland. British author and political commentator Carlos Martinez said he ""essentially agrees"" with Xi's proposals during the conference. ""The essential thing we need to do is to uphold multilateralism. We need to start working together, stop playing blame games,"" Martinez said. He called on all parties to stick to the Paris Agreement and the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities to deal with climate issues. ""Let's coordinate around how we can support developing countries, especially the least developed countries that don't have the financial and infrastructure resources to reduce carbon emissions,"" he added. Antony Froggatt, deputy director of Environment and Society Programme Chatham House, a London-based think tank and also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said global cooperation and technical innovation are crucial for tackling global challenges like climate change. He gave an example of cooperation among the European Union, China and the United States, saying that there are great potentials for the three sides to work together in renewable energy industry such as solar energy and wind energy. ""It is these three blocs that not only deliver the world's biggest deployment of technologies, but by doing so, can enable falling costs, which enables other countries also to deploy these technologies,"" he said. Vice President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Danny Alexander said he believes that the green transition will be accelerated when addressing climate change. ""Green investment can be a crucial part of the economic recovery over the next several years after the COVID-19 pandemic,"" as there is a huge need for clean energy and urban projects such as subways, light rails, water and sanitation projects, he noted. ""Every project now has to also be able to be adapted and resilient to climate change in the future,"" he added.

Photo: AFPGovernments which enact climate legislation risk being sued for trillions of dollars by fossil fuel companies seeking compensation for lost revenue and stranded assets, according to data that campaigners warn threaten pledges made at COP26.Energy experts predict that more ambitious climate action from world leaders will significantly increase companies' use of a tribunal mechanism that has already awarded billions to the heavy industry.Trade agreements such as the Energy Charter Treaty and NAFTA contain investor arbitration clauses, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), that allow foreign companies to sue governments over actions they say hit profits or investments.Campaigners say that energy companies are increasingly turning to this type of arbitration to recoup investments as governments accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels.Jean Blaylock, trade campaigner at Global Justice Now, tells AFP these corporate courts - ""the global trade system's dirty little secret"" - could ""make a mockery"" of commitments generated at the COP26 summit.""We're seeing the fossil fuel sector use investor-state dispute settlement to hold climate action to ransom,"" she says.""These companies have made unfathomable profits from fueling the climate crisis, we cannot let them demand even bigger pay-outs.""AFP has obtained excerpts from a presentation given at a September trade event by consultancy firm Berkeley Research Group (BRG), which predicted that climate legislation would lead to a rise in private lawsuits.""Increased climate policy ambition [eg CAT Ratings] will drive the policies behind climate-related disputes,"" said an excerpt.\~CAT refers to Climate Action Tracker, which ranks national emissions plans on their compatibility with the Paris climate deal.The presentation suggested that the ""scale of energy transition policy"" could ""unleash a wave of international investment and/or commercial arbitration to adjudicate claims.""Responding to a request to comment, Christopher Goncalves, chair of BRG's Energy and Climate practice, told AFP that dispute resolution was ""likely to remain a critical component of the energy transition process.""""It is not possible to make any generic conclusion as to whether such legal disputes accelerate or impede the energy transition,"" he added.History of awardsThe BRG presentation said if governments legislate to limit heating to 2 C by 2050, $3.3-6.5 trillion in upstream fossil fuel assets would be at risk, as well as $650-700 billion in coal power assets and $900 billion in oil reserve write-offs in a 1.5 C scenario.Blaylock said $9 trillion in upstream fossil fuel and oil reserve write-offs are at risk of litigation - a little over a tenth of the global economy.Energy and mining firms have a long history in winning large settlements. In 2006, Occidental Energy sued the government of Ecuador for terminating an oil contract. It was awarded $1.77 billion, which was later reduced to $1 billion.In 2012 Tethyan Copper sued the government of Pakistan over a gold mine, and in 2019 was awarded $5.9 billion - roughly 2 percent of the country's GDP.ISDS decisions are internationally binding and courts have in the past ordered the seizure of state assets when countries have refused to pay.Five current cases, brought by energy firms identified by Global Justice Now, are seeking $18 billion from governments.These include a dispute involving the cancellation of the Keystone Pipel"

The 10 ASEAN countries recognized ""the potential contribution by developing countries in the form of emissions avoidance, reductions, and carbon stock enhancement, dependent on the support provided by developed countries as guaranteed by the Convention and the Paris Agreement,"" according to the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change to the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP26), issued at the 38th ASEAN Summit. ASEAN leaders urged developed countries to ""undertake a clear and comprehensive evaluation and stocktake of the pre-2020 commitments on mitigation and adaptation and finance to understand the progress made and to build mutual trust for post-2020 climate action."" They also called upon developed countries to continue and further scale up the mobilization of climate finance ahead of initiating deliberations on the setting up of a new collective quantified goal from a floor of 100 billion U.S. dollars per year, which takes into account the needs and priorities of developing countries including ASEAN member states. The developed countries were also asked to take the lead by enhancing mitigation ambition, including setting net-zero emission targets with concrete policy and implementation, recognizing that enhanced support for developing countries will allow for higher ambition in their actions. ASEAN countries urged developed country parties to enhance international cooperation and assistance, on the provision of timely, effective, adequate and predictable support to ASEAN member states and other developing countries for financing, the development and transfer of environmentally sound technology, scientific research, and capacity building, for mitigation and adaptation measures, as stipulated under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.

A year of forest fires, record heat waves and devastating floods in various parts of the world has further fostered the fear that doomsday is already here and that the best hope now is to try to limit further damage.The formal aim of the Glasgow summit is to receive updated plans from national governments on cutting emissions and to agree on how to implement the terms of the Paris climate accords that were agreed upon six years ago.The ultimate objective is to hold the global temperature rise to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, a target that may already be beyond reach.The pre-summit tactic of some participants has been to talk up the existential cost of failure at Glasgow while talking down the prospects of success.Summit host Boris Johnson, the United Kingdom's prime minister, has warned that lack of action on climate change could mean the end of civilization, while also warning that the chances for progress at COP26 are ""touch and go"".It is a potentially perilous approach in the face of an often confused public desperately looking for rational and unified international responses to a global problem.Queen Elizabeth II, who might seem to be a rather unlikely spokeswoman for the average man or woman in the street, summed up the view of many when she was recorded in a private conversation criticizing those in charge for being ""irritating"" when ""they talk, but they don't do"".Perhaps she was reflecting the widespread public desire for implementation of a coherent, science-based plan in which empty rhetoric is translated into action.There has been progress in tackling the climate crisis in recent decades, including a gradual switch to cleaner fuels, even if most agree that it has not been enough.Climate scientists and activists have, at the same time, succeeded in raising public consciousness about the scale of the crisis while pushing the dwindling cohort of so-called climate deniers and climate skeptics to the margins.However, to get their message across, the most vociferous climate campaigners have sometimes presented the crisis in black and white terms that do not always reflect the complexity of the crisis and its resolution. Some of their proposals, such as an immediate shutdown of investment in fossil fuels, might create more short-term problems, particularly in the developing world, than they would solve.Similarly, exhortations about flying less and cutting back on meat are scarcely relevant to people already on the margins in regions of the poorer Southern Hemisphere.Sadly, the reality of past procrastination in pushing ahead with climate adaptation does not mean that ""magic bullet"" solutions can now be instituted overnight.The switch to cleaner energy must certainly be sped up in accordance with an agreed-upon plan, but not in such a way as to generate further economic and societal breakdowns in the impoverished south, which is already feeling the harshest impacts of climate change.What people around the world demand of COP26 is that it should come up with a sober and doable strategy that also spells out the inevitable costs and sacrifices involved in reaching net-zero carbon emissions, as well as a commitment to the burden being equally shared.Already, the pre-summit rhetoric has included the all too familiar name-calling among national political leaders failing to play their part in the war on global warming.There has also been unconstructive speculation about which global leaders would be personally attending the Glasgow summit when COVID-19 concerns might be legitimately keeping them at home.For the summit to succeed, and for a climate road map to proceed with any prospect of success, politicians may have to go against their natural instincts and ring-fence the climate issue from all the other political issues that divide them.They should agree that any other political conflict, whether ideological, economic or territorial, should not be allowed to disrupt a jointly approved program of action.States inevitably have differences that can hopefully be resolved over time. But these cannot be used as an excuse for politicians to falter in their response to an existential threat that confronts everyone.If they fail, present and future generations will not forgive them.The author is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK.The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.\l"

Climate Change Conference (COP26), similar preparations are being made in Kunming for the second part of the U.N. Biodiversity Conference (COP15) next year.The impact of both summits will be far reaching and will demand cooperation on an historic scale. The twin crises of climate change and nature loss are intertwined and must be tackled together. We need nature to mitigate climate change and nature needs us to manage climate change to avoid its collapse.There must be no doubt, we are at a pivotal moment and collective international action is needed.COP15 needs to ensure that actions taken by all levels of government contribute towards national and global targets for nature over the coming decade. And COP26 must mobilize the ambition, finance, resources and joint working needed to deliver on the Paris Agreement goals.During the Covid-19 pandemic, actions which previously seemed impossible became achievable. People changed their behavior to protect themselves and each other. We now need to summon the same urgency we have shown in the face of a pandemic to safeguard our planet.Countries and provinces of all sizes must play their part, and in Scotland we are determined to lead by example. We have more than halved our emissions from 1990 levels, and over the decade to 2030 we aim to half them again. By 2045, we are committed to achieving net zero. Across Scottish business, communities and public organizations there is a significant amount of work underway to become more sustainable and respond to the global climate emergency.Partners in China and Scotland are working together. The China-U.K. Low Carbon College, a joint initiative of the University of Edinburgh, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Lingang City, is focused on green development strategy.We have established the TUS-ORE Catapult Technology Research Centre, a leading renewable energy technology research and development hub with links to both Scotland and China.

"COP26","China","COP26_China244","China deserves praise for difficult climate pledges","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","Global Times (China)","China, US Illustration: Chen Xia/GTEditor's Note:The 26th UN Climate Change Conference, known as the COP26, started on Sunday in Glasgow, UK. This meeting has been widely portrayed as the most important global climate talks since the 2015 Paris climate accord. Ahead of the summit, there were many discussions on how China-US tensions will impact the negotiations at the COP26 as well as the global fight against climate change. Can climate change become a breakthrough to improve China-US relations? How to promote cooperation between the two countries on climate change? Sourabh Gupta (Gupta), a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, shared his insight over these issues with Global Times (GT) reporters Yu Jincui and Lu Yuanzhi.GT: What do you expect for the COP26? What goals do you think should be achieved?Gupta: I expect a modest but positive outcome at the COP26, with a broad consensus arrived at with regard to 2050/60 net zero targets, the formalization of moves toward the elimination of coal from the energy mix, and an increasing ambition on near-term nationally determined contributions to reduce greenhouse gases. The conference will certainly not be a failure. All the major emitters, with the exception perhaps of a few, such as India, are pulling in the same direction. Of course, the resounding success that one had hoped for a couple of months ago, going into the COP26, will not be achieved. And the global community will still remain quite some distance away from the pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\~GT: China's aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 have been described as ""an arduous task."" But many Western countries and media outlets are attempting to pressure China to achieve more ""ambitious"" emission goals. What's your take in this regard? Do you think China's aims are consistent with the pace of its development?Gupta: China's carbon dioxide emissions-related aims are not just consistent with its pace of development; they exceed its pace of development. China deserves commendation, not criticism, for the difficult pledges that it has taken on and their concerted translation into action. The stock of global cumulative emissions from the Industrial Revolution onward emitted by the US and Europe is almost four times that of China's. It is high time that these advanced countries learn to take greater responsibility for this negative externality unleashed on the planet and in particular, aim to achieve carbon neutrality at an early date not just on the production side of their economies but also the consumption side of their economies. At minimum, the common global effort to arrest the pace of climate change must not be allowed to become a ""second colonialism"" inflicted on the developing world, with the burden of adjustment borne primarily on the back of the developing world's development-related aspirations.\~GT: In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, you said China's aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 have ""helped inject energy and vitality back to global climate change talks, with other countries - mostly in East Asia - also following in China's wake and laying out ambitious climate change targets."" How do you evaluate China's efforts for global climate change? What have other countries demonstrated?Gupta: President Xi's pledge at the UN General Assembly session in September 2020 on a peaking date (2030) and a carbon neutrality date (2060) was hugely instrumental in breathing life back into major country climate change politics and pledges - just as the US-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change and Clean Energy Cooperation of November 2014 had set the wheels in motion on the important Paris Conference outcomes. Japan's Yoshihide Suga and South Korea's Moon Jae-in followed soon thereafter with ambitious pledges too.\~It is important to note that China has continued in its reformist, climate-conscious vein in 2021, pledging to peak coal emissions during the 2026-30 period, inaugurating its nationwide emissions trading scheme, and recently releasing its detailed Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030 across a range of industries and sectors. More to the point, China has laid out an all-of-government-and-society-wide emphasis on combating climate change as well as framed the challenge through the lens of commercial opportunity in areas ranging from new-energy vehicles to smart cities. China should continue on this positive track, treating its neutrality and peaking date targets, especially its ""peak coal"" date, as a floor rather than a ceiling and attempt to pull them forward as best possible. And just as importantly, if other major global emitters can also summon the same level of ambition as China has displayed, the planet could be in a much better place in terms of hitting its 1.5 C global warming target.GT: How do you see the US' prospect to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050? Republicans have often resisted cutting emissions. Former US president Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement. If Trump or the Republicans get elected again, how will it affect the US' commitment in reducing emissions and the joint efforts by other countries to tackle climate change?Gupta: I would not count on the US' prospect of achieving climate neutrality before 2050, despite the habitual nay-saying of the present-day Republican Party. The Biden administration unveiled an ambitious set of near-term targets to decarbonize its transport and electricity grids in April this year. At the state and local levels, where the effects of global warming are most felt, governors and mayors have shown an admirable commitment to fighting climate change. The state of California in particular has been a trailblazer, literally stripping out carbon-intensive fuels as a feedstock for electricity generation. Countries and states/provinces around the world would do well to study the California example.\~You are correct on the point though that if half the political spectrum in this country (the US) is unwilling to admit - let alone shoulder - our collective responsibility to address climate change, we will all be poorer off. It is doubly unfortunate that a small sliver of Democrats too are unwilling to do the needful on climate change, as a result of which President Biden has had to strip out a significant amount of congressional funding to ""green"" the US electricity sectors. And this therefore begs the question: Shouldn't there be enforceable penalties on countries that fail to hit their nationally determined greenhouse gas reduction targets? During the Trump-era bilateral trade and investment negotiations in early-2019, the US side had insisted that China commit to memorializing its liberalization commitments in national legislation, rather than merely in the State Council directives and regulations. Perhaps, it is time for the shoe to be on the other foot and have Washington memorialize its COP26 greenhouse gas reduction commitments in Congressional legislation too.GT: Some analysts say that geopolitical tensions between China and the US will affect the cooperation in climate change. It has been reported that the Biden administration is divided over its China policy. US special envoy for climate John Kerry told Biden that he wouldn't achieve his goal of tackling climate change, a key administration priority, unless the US-China relationship improved. But national security advisor Jake Sullivan said, ""We are not in the business of trading cooperation with China on climate change as a favor that Beijing is doing for the United States."" Can climate change become a breakthrough to improve China-US relations? How to promote cooperation between the two countries on climate change?Gupta: It is an unfortunate fact of life that geopolitical tensions between China and the US have seeped into climate change collaboration. There is a sub-optimal, path dependency that has crept into their respective relationship-related equations. Washington seeks selective cooperation with Beijing on an a la carte basis (including on climate change) that is framed within a broader structural context ranging from coexistence to outright adversarial relations with China. For its part, Beijing prefers a more structured relationship, where bilateral cooperation (including on climate change) is preceded by the restoration of guardrails to the overall China-US strategic relationship. Between these two approaches, it is unfortunately cooperation on climate change that has seemingly fallen through the cracks. At this time, the best that can be hoped is that both countries individually reflect on the gravity of the climate challenge ahead and find avenues for concerted cooperation - at the sub-national level initially, and hopefully as relations stabilize, at the presidential level.GT: In terms of climate change, you said in April that, ""both the United States and China can rise above their differences and cooperate together in the better interests of all."" Are you still optimistic about the prospect of the cooperation between China and the US on climate change?Gupta: Well, I am not as optimistic about the prospect of cooperation at this time. The momentum going into Paris 2015 was furnished by the historic US-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change and Clean Energy Cooperation in November 2014, followed by the US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change in September 2015. By contrast, going into Glasgow 2021, bilateral relations are simply not where they were going into Paris, or for-the-matter should be. That said, their differences should not hold China or the US back from pulling in the same direction individually on this potentially existential challenge to our global community.\~Separately, China should also aim to coordinate its climate change actions, going forward, with the European Union rather than wait interminably for a change of heart at the US' end. This is already the case in the trade and investment arena where China and the European Union have completed the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment negotiations. With its national emissions trading scheme already off-the-ground, Beijing should now gradually seek out complementarities with Europe's own emissions trading scheme across carbon-intensive sectors and industries, such that these two major economic areas can blaze a common pathway forward on trans-continental emissions trading, carbon pricing and greenhouse gas reduction.\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China245","Stepping up to the plate","October 22, 2021 Friday","China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)","(JIN DING / CHINA DAILY)The world has reached a critical moment in history. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have an opportunity to create a safer and more prosperous world by pursuing a new model of sustainable, inclusive and resilient economic development and growth.This new form of growth offers the chance to make the global economy cleaner and more efficient based on strong investments and innovation. It will allow us to effectively tackle the global threats of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation.We will be able to create new jobs and new markets for products and services as we develop and deploy the technologies of the future. Critically we will be able to transform our energy systems away from wasteful and polluting forms of generation and consumption that are based on fossil fuels.Instead we can power our economies with alternatives that do not damage lives and livelihoods.The World Health Organization estimates that more than 7 million people die each year worldwide from local air pollution, mostly due to the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. Many rapidly growing cities of developing and emerging market countries are suffering severe social and economic harm because workers and their families become sick or die from breathing dirty air.In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its latest assessment of the science of climate change, and concluded that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are now affecting every part of the world, particularly by making many extreme weather events more frequent and intense.This summer we have witnessed heat waves, flooding and wildfires across the world that have been made more severe by a rise in global temperature of just 1 C. The lives and livelihoods of millions of people are being damaged and destroyed. No country is too rich to be affected, but we also know that the poorest people are least able to protect themselves from these impacts.In November, countries will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, at the COP26 United Nations climate change summit to accelerate efforts to tackle climate change. The United Kingdom eyes keeping within reach the goal of limiting the rise in temperature by the end of this century to no more than 1.5 C.As the IPCC has pointed out, beyond this level of warming there are dangerously rising risks of potentially catastrophic impacts, such as destabilization of the polar ice sheets and profound disruption of both river flows from the Himalayas and of the monsoon season.To have a reasonable chance of limiting warming to a rise of 1.5 C, global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, will need to be eliminated by the middle of this century.Many countries have now committed to a target of net zero emissions where the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere each year is reduced to the same level as the amount removed annually through planting more trees and vegetation or technologies such as direct air capture.The success of COP26 is not guaranteed. The developed countries have not yet honored their commitment to mobilize $100 billion annually from public and private sources to support climate action by the developing countries.The developed countries must demonstrate that they have kept their promise ahead of COP26 and should lay out plans to increase financial support in subsequent years. They could, for instance, commit to providing $60 billion from bilateral sources and $90 billion from multilateral sources each year by 2025.But the new pledges for emissions cuts by 2030 submitted ahead of COP26 are collectively too weak and only consistent with a pathway to a potentially catastrophic warming of 2.7 C by the end of the century, according to the UN.China is already showing global leadership on climate change. President Xi Jinping made a truly historic announcement in September 2020 at the UN that China will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Similarly, it was extremely significant that President Xi declared at the UN General Assembly recently that China will end all financial support for new coal power plants overseas.China can also show other countries how a large economy can be transformed by moving away from fossil fuels. Although it remains heavily dependent on coal, the nation is rapidly developing alternative sources of energy, such as renewables, and investing strongly in forms of transport such as electric vehicles that rely on clean power.As it makes that transformation, China will also benefit in the medium term from a diversification of energy sources, which will make market crises less likely.Xi has also indicated that China will control the development of its domestic coal power, and will strictly regulate projects that result in both high energy consumption and high carbon emissions.

"COP26","China","COP26_China247","Chinese envoy puts forward four-point proposal on global climate cooperation","October 28, 2021 Thursday","People's Daily Online - English","UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Tuesday put forward a four-point proposal for global climate cooperation. China attaches great importance to tackling climate change and is ready to work with all parties to make the upcoming 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) a success so as to promote the comprehensive, effective and sustained implementation of the Paris Agreement, Zhang told a UN General Assembly high-level debate on climate action. The first proposal he made is to follow the rules. Zhang said that it is necessary to uphold the status of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as the main channel in global climate governance and implement the objectives, spirit, and principles of the Paris Agreement in a comprehensive and balanced manner. All parties should firmly uphold multilateralism, complete negotiations on outstanding issues concerning the details of rules in the Paris Agreement, and lay a solid political foundation for global climate cooperation. The second is to earnestly implement the commitments. All parties should move beyond political slogans and taking actions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, and capacity-building so as to promote significant progress at COP26 on issues of finance and adaptation. Developed countries should take the lead in significantly reducing emissions and effectively fulfilling their commitments to providing financial, technological, and capacity-building support to developing countries, Zhang further said. Thirdly, Zhang said, countries should adhere to the principle of each doing its maximum. Countries should respect each other's national conditions and abilities, follow the arrangements of Nationally Determined Contributions and give their best. Developing countries are facing the severe impact of COVID-19 and the arduous task of poverty alleviation. So, there should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to emission reduction. The fourth is to accelerate green transformation. Zhang said that the international community should vigorously promote the transformation and upgrading of economic, energy, industrial, agricultural and forestry structures, encourage the innovation of technologies and business models and achieve a win-win situation to combat climate change and attain sustainable economic and social development. To this end, there is a need to provide strong support and create a favorable environment for developing countries. Zhang said China keeps its word on climate change and has already exceeded its target of climate action for 2020 ahead of schedule. China is resolute in curbing the blind development of projects involving high energy consumption and high emissions. China has also launched the world's largest onl"

How do we translate commitments into tangible actions and a solid road map with clear key performance indicators? That's where capital markets come in: they have a crucial role to play in driving companies along the path to net zero. Global financiers and investors have shown they are ready and willing to finance companies that want to build a better future.

Morrison has called for the election on May 21 against a backdrop of missteps and controversies that pundits believe will affect his chances. Yet, in the May 2019 election, Morrison lagged behind in opinion polls before pulling off a win. He is the first Australian leader to face two consecutive elections in almost 15 years, after a decade of political chaos in the country where prime ministers were regularly replaced by their own party over internal leadership spills. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. On May 21, all 151 lower house or House of Representatives seats will be up for grabs. The party or coalition holding a majority in the lower house will choose the new PM and form the new government. Voting is compulsory for about 17 million Australians, who must register when they turn 18. Those who do not vote face a fine of A$20 (US$15). We take a look at the issues that have dogged the government and how they might emerge during the campaign. How is Morrison framing this vote?At a press conference on Sunday, Morrison played up economic uncertainties and security threats, saying this was not the time to hand the reins to someone untested, like opposition Labor leader, Anthony Albanese. He highlighted the country's strong economic growth and national defence and is expected to continue reminding voters of his government's series of spending measures to help soften the impact of inflation. He will try to characterise the Labor party as ""a risk"" to Australia's economy and security, said Anne Tiernan, one of Australia's leading political scientists and an adjunct professor of politics in the Griffith Business School. ""Ordinary voters are looking at an economy that seems to be pretty bulletproof ... Morrison's got that on his side,"" political analyst and professor at ANU's Australian Studies Institute Mark Kenny said. Integrity is indeed a sore point for Morrison, said Kenny. There have been leaked text messages from his own party calling him a ""horrible horrible person"" and his own deputy, Barnaby Joyce, calling him a hypocrite and a liar. Morrison's relationship with the premiers of Australian states and territories has not been sterling during the pandemic. Few expat Australians would forget how borders were shut for about 21 months, leaving them stranded abroad and the country earning the moniker ""Fortress Australia"". Several lodged a United Nations petition against the government for the ""right to return home"". Those within the country who needed to leave also faced immense challenges to do so and then return. Morrison was also criticised for delaying the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines and the shortage of rapid antigen tests during a recent Omicron outbreak. There was also unhappiness over his refusal to make rapid test kits available for free. Neither did his handling of the Black Summer bush fires in the state of New South Wales (NSW), that ran for over six months from 2019 to early 2020, inspire confidence. Ex-NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said in private text messages that Morrison was ""actively spreading lies and briefing against me re fires"". After Australia backed out of a submarine deal with France last year in favour of joining up with the US and Britain in the Aukus security pact, French president Emmanuel Macron accused Morrison HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3154393/aukus-fallout-frances-macron-says-australia-pm-morrison-lied-himof lying. Recently, two female Liberal Party members came out to attack Morrison's character. Outgoing Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells described Morrison as ""an autocrat"" during a speech in parliament and called him ""a bully with no moral compass"" who was pretending to be a man of faith, while MP Catherine Cusack last week accused Morrison of bullying and said she would not vote for him or the party at the federal election. Morrison, a Christian, has distanced himself from his friend Brian Houston, the founder of the global HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/3143975/australian-founder-global-hillsong-church-allegedly-concealedHillsong Church after allegations of the latter's inappropriate behaviour towards women surfaced. His decades-long friendship with Tim Stewart, a high-profile supporter of the far-right conspiracy cult HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3156444/qanon-shaman-sentenced-41-months-jail-us-capitolQAnon has also raised eyebrows. Tiernan said these matters bolstered growing voter perception that Morrison and his government were focused on short-term politics. ""Some of this started with the PM being in Hawaii on holidays during the Black Summer bush fires. His infamous 'I don't hold a hosepipe, mate' [remark] became emblematic of his failure to accept responsibility and tendency to blame others,"" she said. Additionally, the government has failed to deliver a Federal Integrity Commission, or adequate action on climate change, Tiernan said. This past week, the Prime Minister did a backflip over a relief package. He had at first agreed to go halves with the Queensland government on a US$741 million package to help Queenslanders rebuild their homes but later changed his mind saying Queensland was crying poor. He later relented after drawing the ire of the Queensland public. With both parties likely to try and target the swing votes of the undecided public, already such issues around bush fires and floods had galvanised support for ""independents in key marginal seats"", Tiernan said. The extreme weather events faced by Australians in recent years have been unnerving; however, Morrison has maintained there is no evidence that links the country's carbon emissions to bush fires. He faced criticism for his slow actions on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3154189/australias-morrison-cut-climate-deal-ahead-cop26climate change during the HYPERLINK COP26 meeting last year. Why will he struggle to win over women voters?In February and March last year, government staffer Brittany Higgins alleged she was raped by a colleague in Parliament House in 2019. The alleged rapist was sacked but little was done to support Higgins and punish the perpetrator sparking an outcry of a ""boys club"" culture, systemic misogyny and victim blaming in the Morrison government. A decision on whether the court trial currently set for June would go ahead will be laid down in coming weeks. Around the same time, then Australian Attorney General Christian Porter denied he raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988. Porter resigned from the front bench of the Morrison government last September. This week, more sex scandal allegations emerged. Independent journalist Friendly Jordies revealed several federal politicians were involved in procuring prostitutes for sex in the prayer room of Parliament House. The Morrison government has not responded to the claims. How does China - and race - feature in this election? HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/article/3148517/frenemies-or-foes-chinas-relationship-australia-has-unravelled-just-overAmid tense Canberra-Beijing relations, China has been portrayed as a threat to Australia, with growing allegations of foreign interference and even spying by Chinese-Australians, who also faced discrimination during the pandemic. Last October, the furore over ""loyalties"" of Chinese-Australians reached a crescendo after Liberal Senator Eric Abetz launched a HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3105689/senator-insists-chinese-australians-condemn-ccp-inquiry-diasporaMcCarthyist-styled attackSeveral parliamentarians also started stoking voter fears over the possibility of war with China. When asked if concerns over China disrupting Australia national security would win points for Morrison, Kenny was not so sure. He said while Morrison's increased defence spending in the name of national security would hold him in good stead with some people - mainly male voters - it was not certain whether more voters would buy it. It was also unclear if voters were persuaded by the idea that the Morrison government was tough on China whereas the opposition Labor party was not, election analyst and publisher of the Australian politics website pollbludger.net William Bowe said. ""Polls have shown Liberal and Labor to be rated about evenly on handling the relationship with China. Furthermore, foreign policy has not traditionally been an important factor in swaying voters at Australian elections,"" Bowe said. Veteran Labor Party pollster John Utting said Morrison was throwing the kitchen sink at staying in power with the focus on defence and security. ""Take away all the super heated rhetoric, there is no real Chinese threat to Australia at all if you look at it objectively,"" he said. Tiernan agreed Morrison's labelling of Albanese as pro-China had fallen flat, particularly after security and intelligence chiefs criticised the government for politicising the issue.

As a result there is pressure on big polluters such as China, the United States and India to set tougher targets, and on the rich world to do more to help poor countries. One measure of how the world is responding to the challenge is the performance of rich countries in meeting their commitments to compensate poor nations for the development costs of forsaking cheaper but emissions-heavy fossil fuels. They promised in 2009 to channel US$100 billion a year to less wealthy countries by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and reduce emissions. After still falling short by US$20 billion in 2019, they will not reach the target until 2023, according to the Climate Finance Delivery Plan to be submitted to the summit. Climate finance will be central to the success or failure of the summit, with China's environment vice-minister Ye Min saying the biggest obstacle to negotiations had been the disappointment of developing nations with progress on finance and climate change adaptation. Hopefully, developed nations will reach a deal to offer more help. There is a need for global leadership.

Premier Li \£dKeqiang also announced a series of measures to support coal production this month, including an acceleration in the construction of new mines and phased tax deferrals for coal-fired power plants.As coal-fired power production is ramped up aggressively to meet demand, some analysts are concerned that the measures will mean China having to sacrifice its environmental progress to ensure energy security, at least in the short term.""Like other markets in Asia and Europe, China must perform a balancing act between the immediate need to keep the lights on - via more coal - and showing its commitment to increasingly ambitious decarbonisation targets,"" said Gavin Thompson, Asia- \£dPacific vice-chair of resource consultancy Wood Mackenzie in a newsletter earlier this month.""But the short-term reality is that China and many others have little choice but to increase coal consumption to meet power \£ddemand.""The large number of post- \£dCovid-19 economic stimulus measures passed in China in 2020 based on the buildout of infrastructure projects that consume a lot of steel and cement, along with a strong residential property market, put a great deal of strain on the supply of carbon-intensive commodities and \£dincrease the temptation to return to coal, according to Danny Huang, director and China commodities lead analyst at S&P Global Ratings.""The legacy from Covid and the power shortage is that there will be expanded coal power and industrial capacity that will be there and will take time to take offl"

Xi made the remarks in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Glasgow from Monday to Tuesday. ""I hope all parties will take stronger actions to jointly tackle the climate challenge and protect the planet, the shared home for us all,"" he said. The adverse impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, presenting a growing urgency for global action, he said. The Chinese president made a three-pronged proposal to address climate challenge, including upholding multilateral consensus, focusing on concrete actions, and accelerating the green transition. ""When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription,"" he said. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Parties need to build on existing consensus, increase mutual trust, step up cooperation and work together to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow, he added. Parties need to honor their commitments, set realistic targets and visions, and do their best according to national conditions to deliver their climate action measures, Xi said. The Chinese president stressed the responsibility of developed countries in tackling climate change, saying that they should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better. In terms of green transition, Xi said it is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern. Guided by the vision of a community of life for man and nature, China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development, he said. ""We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects,"" he said. He added that China will speed up the green and low-carbon energy transition, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. China has recently released an action plan for carbon dioxide peaking before 2030, as well as a document titled ""Working Guidance For Carbon Dioxide Peaking And Carbon Neutrality In Full And Faithful Implementation Of The New Development Philosophy."" Xi said the country will roll out specific implementation plans for key areas such as energy, industry, construction and transport, and for key sectors such as coal, electricity, iron and steel, and cement, as well as supporting measures in terms of science and technology, carbon sink, fiscal and taxation, and financial incentives. ""These measures will form a '1+N' policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint,"" he added.

In back-to-back news conferences at U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and U.S. counterpart John Kerry said the two countries would work together to accelerate the emissions reductions required to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. ""It's beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole that two major powers in the world, China and the U.S., shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations,"" Xie told reporters. ""We need to think big and be responsible."" ""The steps we're taking ... can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going, and help China and us to be able to accelerate our efforts,"" Kerry said. China also agreed for the first time to crack down on methane leaks, following the lead of the Biden administration's efforts to curb the potent greenhouse gas. Beijing and Washington agreed to share technology to reduce emissions. Governments agreed in Paris to jointly cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep the global temperature rise ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, with a more stringent target of trying to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius preferred. Both sides recognize that there is a gap between efforts taken globally to reduce climate pollution and the goals of the Paris deal, Xie said. ""So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations,"" he said. A U.S.-China bilateral agreement in 2014 gave a huge push to the creation of the historic Paris accord the following year, but that cooperation stopped with the Trump administration, which pulled the U.S. out of the pact. The Biden administration brought the U.S. back in to that deal, but has clashed with China on other issues such as cybersecurity, human rights and Chinese territorial claims. ""While this is not a gamechanger in the way the 2014 US-China climate deal was, in many ways it's just as much of a step forward given the geopolitical state of the relationship,"" said Thom Woodroofe, an expert in U.S.-China climate talks. ""It means the intense level of US-China dialogue on climate can now begin to translate into cooperation."" The gesture of goodwill comes just days after President Joe Biden blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping's and Russian President Vladimir Putin's failure to attend talks in person for the lack of more progress in climate negotiations. The U.S. and China will also revive a working group that will ""meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade,"" the declaration said. Both Washington and Beijing intend to update the world on their new national targets for 2035 in 2025 - a move that is particularly significant for China. The declaration also said China will ""make best efforts to accelerate"" its plans to reduce coal consumption in the second half of this decade. The announcement came as governments from around the world were negotiating in Glasgow about how to build on the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of global warming. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the move ""an important step in the right direction."" Some experts noted the deal was short on commitments that would significantly reduce heat-trapping gases. ""It's a good sign that the world's two biggest emitters can actually work together to face the biggest crisis of humanity but there's not a lot of meat there after the methane stuff,'' said Byford Tsang a China policy analyst for the European think tank E3G.

The pumps are used to water wild animals in the better northern part of the southern African country known for its magnificent flora and fauna and currently rely on diesel generators, said Botswana's Minister of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism Philda Kereng. ""To ensure consistent water availability for wildlife in the area, we are currently switching from diesel-operated pump systems to the more reliable, efficient and economical solar operated pump systems,"" said Kereng when addressing Botswana's House of Chiefs Friday.

In the video, Prashad accused Western countries of robbing the wealth and resources of developing countries through means such as colonialism and encouraging a reliance on fossil fuels among developing nations. After their journey to becoming fully developed nations, Western countries have doubled back to place the culpability of current pollution crises onto developing countries.Vijay Prashad Photo:Global TimesWhat made Prashad deliver such a speech in Glasgow? What is the essence of Western countries' behavior in his eyes? Why did he say India needs socialism today? And what is his understanding of China and India's relationship? Recently, the Global Times (GT) reporter Bai Yunyi conversed with Prashad (Prashad)\~\~to learn more about his experience and thoughts on such issues.What really mattersGT: What made you go to Glasgow and deliver that speech at the COP26 conference? Could you share more behind-the-scenes details with us?\~Prashad: I had reported a story in Mozambique about oil companies. One is a French company, Total; while the other is an US company, Exxon Mobil. They have found the biggest offshore oilfield and a natural gas field in Mozambique, Africa.People who lived just off the field in Cabo Delgado, which is the poorest province in Mozambique, started an uprising in 2017. They insisted that, ""we are so poor. We can see this natural gas development. We are getting no benefit."" They were upset. The French and American armies were to intervene. They didn't, but struck a deal with the Rwandan army which went in and crushed the uprising. I was very sad about this.So that morning in Glasgow, I was in the queue to get a PCR test. There were some oil company executives behind me. One of them saw my press pass. He said, ""What are you doing here?"" So I told him the Mozambican story.\~I said that I have seen poor people in the shadow of a natural gas field who will not even be able to eat. This upset me, so I had to come and talk about things of that nature.\~But he said something to me that triggered that speech. He said, ""You are right. But nobody cares. You're not lying. You're not wrong. Everything you say is correct, but nobody cares. They don't care about those people in Cabo Delgado.""That got me a little annoyed. And I have to tell you honestly, when I went back into the session, and they gave me my turn to speak, I thought, ""I'm going to just say what I believe.""GT: Your speech at the COP26 went viral on Chinese social media. Did you receive any feedback from your Chinese counterparts? All things considered, how do you feel about the speech in hindsight?Prashad: The truth is that this little segment you see is from a number of speeches that I made in Glasgow, which have gone viral everywhere including in India, on the African continent, in the Caribbean, and in Latin America with the use of subtitles.\~\~I went into a community in Venezuela. And a woman who is the leader of the community said to me, ""You're the climate change guy."" I thought ""Goodness, I'm 54 years old. I've done a lot of things in my life, and I'm going to be defined by this five-minute clip.""\~It's very exciting, to be honest, that so many different kinds of people are engaging with what I think is really important - the colonial structures and a neo-colonial mentality.It's not that I said something new, but that it was a matter of what people are already thinking. And it leads me to feel that lots of people are frustrated with the current world order. And we want something different.Arrogant 'lecturers'A view of Luanda, capital of Angola, which is considered one of the African?continent's oldest colonial cities. Photo:ICGT: As you said, a segment went viral on social media because it was a matter of what people are already thinking. What do you think the reason for the anger toward the West is? Why do so many people feel frustrated by the current world order?\~Prashad: I think that [is because] we are fed up with being told what to do by leaders from Washington, London, and Paris, who claim to be in a way better than we are. They claim they are the best judges of everything and have all the answers to human rights and democracy. Their attitude is very frustrating to people.Consider this: The US has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. Why do they still keep lecturing everybody else about human rights?We're all struggling to make better things happen. But they ""lecture"" us as if they have all the answers, and I think [that's why people] have been frustrated for such a long time.GT: You also talked about the ""permanent colonial mentality"" of West in your speech. Where do you think their colonial mentality comes from? Why do you think Westerners' attitudes toward developing countries today are still the same as they were in the 19th century?\~Prashad: Let's be frank. It's very difficult to get rid of the West's colonial mentality. It's like patriarchal mentality: Over the centuries and in many societies, men have thought they are superior to women. It has taken a long time to teach men that believing that women are inferior to men is a crazy idea. Similarly, it is going to take a long time to transform Westerners' colonial mindset, which has been there for five or six hundred years. For over 500 years, they thought that we are lesser people. They therefore think they can go and bully us, telling us what to do.In China there was the Opium Wars in the 19th century, which the British tend to call ""Anglo-Chinese Wars."" However, the Chinese ships didn't go and start a war in England, and the Chinese did not bombard England. They were the wars that the British imposed upon China. These were no ""Anglo-Chinese"" wars but British wars.\~I always get annoyed when Westerners say ""the Vietnam war."" There was no ""Vietnam war"" but a US war imposed upon Vietnam. There's no Iraq war but another US war imposed upon Iraq. It's very hard to get this attitude out of their heads.\~The West needs to recognize the history of colonialism. But they seemed to have amnesia about this - France, the UK, and the US - nobody ever accepts their past. The British, for instance, are currently very upset about what's happening in Hong Kong. But remember, the British held Hong Kong as a colony. There was no democracy there under British rule. Why don't they recognize that? When Chris Patten was the last governor of Hong Kong as a British colony, what democracy was there for Hong Kong people? And yet they are busy lecturing the Chinese, which sounds very interesting to me. They don't even possess self-awareness about their own history.\~The British directly ruled India for at least 200 years, during which time there was no democracy. When the British left India, only 13 percent of the Indian population was literate. So now don't lecture us about our government.The West's attitude toward us is that of infantilization. They feel they have to cajole us to make us behave. It's a long-term issue, and one that's going to take time to purge such attitudes from Western thinking.India needs socialismGT: You are a Marxism and socialism scholar. Can you tell us what it is like to be a Marxist in India? Prashad\u-230 India has a very long communist tradition. There are several communist parties in India. The largest communist party is the Communist Party of India, which has more than 1 million members. Until recently, Marxism was one of the dominant forms of thought in India. Especially in the field of economics, Marxism held its own.\~I have been reading Marx's works since long ago. As you can see, I have many books on socialism on my shelves, many of which I bought from the Soviet Union. When I was a little boy in 1981, like many of my contemporaries, I bought three volumes of Capital in Calcutta.\~However, then we were faced with the collapse of the Soviet Union, an event that made us feeldefeated for a while, and since then, there has been a lot of pressure to be a Marxist. To be honest, things are not easy in India for socialism today, because the government has a certain sort of religious perspective, regarding politics. I'm not in favor of religion in politics.However, this year, millions of farmers in India held protests against farm reform bills. In a way the farmers showed the vitality of Marxism because this was authentic class struggle.Indian activists and farmers try to stop a train at a railway station in Kolkata to protest against the central government's agricultural reforms on September 27, 2021. Photo: AFPIt has been a very powerful year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We had one of the world's largest mass movements in which the government had to repeal its laws. That means the farmers won. If you want to know what it feels like to be a Marxist in India, ask the people who has walked among the farmers.GT\u-230 Do you think today's India needs socialism?Prashad: What do we want as ordinary people? I want to live in a society where people are not hungry or illiterate, where people have shelter and access to high quality education, and access to the internet and electricity. But today, hundreds of millions of Indians don't have these things. If capitalism can provide them such living conditions, I would become a capitalist, but capitalism cannot do it. Only socialism can lift everybody up from the brink of starvation. We see that it has actually been done in the ""Chinese experiment"" I use the term ""Chinese experiment"" a lot because innovative Chinese people are constantly trying different things. I really appreciate that.\~I think that China's attempt to eradicate poverty is probably the most important thing that's happened in a long time in the world, because it showed countries like India it can be done in a poor country.I'm not Chinese, but I am proud of what the Chinese government has done. I think socialism is necessary in India. Is it easy to make socialism in India? No. Is it easy to make socialism in the US? No. It's going to be very difficult, but it worth the struggle.GT: Some Indian politicians and scholars see China as a big threat. They think India should stand with the US to confront China because of current border tensions between China and India. What is your view on this perspective?Prashad: I don't think the current border tensions are important. China had a border dispute with the USSR that was only resolved 10 years ago. And today, Russia and China have one of the closest global relationships. Border disputes can be solved. It's the underlying political problems that are important.Right now, the Indian elites are more interested in an alliance with the US. This is actually bad for the people of India, because India needs to get involved in the ""Asian era.""\~Why should we imagine the Belt and Road initiative (BRI) as being solely a Chinese project? We have to imagine BRI as being an Asian project. India needs to also be involved in this investment in infrastructure and so on.\~The elites, however, feel that the road to freedom comes through Washington. I think India needs to have a non-aligned foreign policy. India should take a neutral position. India is a great country and doesn't have to be in anybody's camp. Indian ruling elites should have a more open-minded attitude toward business, commerce, and human freedom.\l"

Sceptics say Riyadh's promise relies on untested carbon capture technology and a 'major caveat' regarding its exports. And yet, in a land with no shortage of sunshine, there remains a ray of hope for renewablesThere is probably no country on Earth where the economy is more tied up with hydrocarbons than HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/saudi-arabiaSaudi Arabia. About 42 per cent of the Gulf state's GDP is linked to oil and gas, according to a research centre linked to the authorities (the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Centre), while petroleum accounts for more than two-thirds of its exports. So, amid a flurry of announcements ahead of the COP26 UN HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeClimate Change Conference in Glasgow, Saudi Arabia's pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060 was particularly notable.

Get the answers with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. As the world grapples with the challenge of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the pledge from Saudi Arabia, which matches the 2060 commitments of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/chinaChina and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/russiaRussia, could be seen as another milestone. If a petrostate with annual per capita carbon emissions of about 15 tonnes of CO2 per year, more than three times the global average, can transition to renewables, surely any nation can. But whether it can in fact meet its eye-catching commitments is another matter - one that has prompted scepticism. While some progress undoubtedly has been made, experts say that hitting its target will still require a sea change for the kingdom, where some estimates foresee carbon emissions rising 45 per cent over the next 10 years. Some analysts say Riyadh, which lags regional rivals in the switch to green energy, is relying on unproven technology and ""false solutions"" to close the gap, while others point out that a ""major caveat"" in the Saudi commitment is that it does not cover the burning of its hydrocarbons abroad. ""Per capita emissions are very high. Saudi Arabia still has a very long way to go,"" said Professor Niklas H\'f6hne, a founding partner of the NewClimate Institute for Climate Policy and Global Sustainability in Germany. ""I found it very interesting that Saudi Arabia has put a net zero target forward. I did not expect that at all."" As well as pledging to reach net zero by 2060, Riyadh has also signed the Global Methane Pledge, which commits it to a 30 per cent cut in emissions of methane - which is over 100 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 - by 2030. According to figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) from 2018 - eight decades after oil was discovered in the country in significant quantities - oil makes up 53 per cent of the Saudi energy supply, and gas the remaining 47 per cent. This country of 35 million people uses black gold in ways that analysts say other countries would no longer consider. ""They burn oil to desalinate seawater. They burn oil to generate electricity - most of the world did away with that in the 1970s. It's a fuel they use in really low value ways,"" said Jim Krane, author of Energy Kingdoms: Oil and Political Survival in the Persian Gulf. ""Saudi Arabia has got some really heavy lifting to do in its industrial and electricity sector to decarbonise."" Saudi Arabia is comfortably among the top 10 oil consumers in the world despite being only the 41st largest in terms of population. Despite having vast swathes of desert and abundant sunshine, solar power and other renewables currently account for a tiny fraction of energy generation. But there are ambitious targets for ramping up the share that comes from them, and this year has seen activity increase. In April the country opened the 300 megawatt Sakaka solar power plant and, in August, the 400MW Dumat Al Jandal wind power facility. Even so, with Saudi Arabia having a total electricity generating capacity of well over 50 gigawatt, these two plants account for not a great deal more than 1 per cent of the total nationally.

It found that 46 percent of respondents identified Morrison as their preferred PM compared to 38 percent for Albanese. It is the tightest gap between the two since March 2020 and marks a major turnaround from February when Morrison led 61-26.

Albanese has been a fierce critic of Morrison's signature climate policy, describing it as a ""scam"" that lacks detail. The Labor leader promised that he would release his own climate policy before the end of 2021.

There are hopes of a WTO deal to cut harmful fisheries subsidies, which are estimated at US$14 billion to US$54 billion a year with China the biggest culprit. The recent G20 and COP26 meetings have also underscored the need for China and the US to take a clearer lead on practical action to reduce carbon emissions, and to accelerate recovery from the pandemic crisis through multilateral cooperation.

Hurricane Ida, a tropical storm that pummeled much of the eastern United States with lashing rain in August, killed at least 95 people and cost the U.S. economy US$65 billion. A month earlier, floods in Europe caused 240 deaths and an economic loss of US$43 billion, according to research published by U.K. charity Christian Aid. Floods in China\' s Henan Province in July killed over 300 and cost in excess of US$17 billion.  The costs of climate change have been grave this year, said Kat Kramer, Christian Aid\' s climate policy lead and author of the report.  It is clear that the world is not on track to ensure a safe and prosperous world. This year is expected to be the sixth time global natural disasters have cost more than US$100 billion, the report stated, citing insurer Aon Plc. All six of those years have happened since 2011. The report\' s authors estimated damages based on insured losses, meaning the true costs of these disasters are likely to be even higher. Calculations are usually costlier in richer countries due to higher property values and insurance, while some of this year\' s deadliest weather events hit poorer counties that contributed little to global warming. South Sudan has been struck by floods that forced almost a million people to leave their homes, while East Africa has been ravaged by drought. That highlights the injustice of the climate crisis, said Christian Aid, which warned that such events will continue in the absence of concrete action to slash emissions. Mohamed Adow, director of Kenya-based think-tank Power Shift Africa, said the continent has  borne the brunt of some of the deadliest, most expensive climate impacts. Severe droughts in East Africa, which are expected to last until mid-2022, are  pushing communities to the brink, Adow warned. The Paris Agreement on global warming, which aims to hold the increase in global temperatures to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, will not achieve its goals unless more urgent action is taken, according to the report. More needs to be done in 2022 to provide financial help to vulnerable nations, including a fund to deal with the damage caused by climate change, something that was not delivered at this year\' s global climate talks in Glasgow, according to the study.  It was bitterly disappointing to leave COP26 without a fund set up to help people who are suffering from permanent losses from climate change, said Nushrat Chowdhury, Christian Aid\' s climate justice advisor in Bangladesh.

"COP26","China","COP26_China282","China needs Middle East oil to wean itself off coal","November 9, 2021 Tuesday 10:12 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","China\' s absence from the COP26 climate summit has drawn criticism from all corners. Given President Xi Jinping\' s lack of foreign travel since January 2020, his Glasgow no-show did not come as a surprise. China has already committed to achieving peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, so perhaps Beijing thought it had little more to offer at this stage. However, as the world\' s biggest carbon polluter, questions over how China aims to complete its climate commitments loom large.China\' s push toward carbon neutrality will have a major impact on the future structure of its energy sources. This in turn will eventually alter China\' s relationship with Middle East countries that it has depended on for crude-oil supply for decades. But carbon emissions from China\' s oil use are dwarfed by the damage done from burning coal, and it is cutting out coal, not oil, that is Beijing\' s immediate concern. While the end game for everyone is renewable energy, in the shorter term, the phasing out of coal-fired power stations will lead to China buying more oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Contrary to what many at COP26 might say, the push for net-zero is likely to strengthen relations between Beijing and the Middle East based on the supply of oil.China\' s need for more oil to see it through this transition squares with Riyadh\' s plans to maintain oil production while using methods like carbon capture and planting vast forests to reach net-zero carbon emissions. This approach has been labeled the  circular carbon economy, and continuing to serve oil to its biggest customer China has been factored into the plan. As China attempts to bring down coal consumption while maintaining its economic edge, its demand for Middle East oil is likely to increase rather than decrease in the foreseeable future.\~China is already facing a major energy crisis. The ambitious aim for carbon neutrality by 2060 was made a little more than a year ago at the UN General Assembly. At this year\' s event, China made a further pledge to stop building coal-fired power plants abroad. But these noble aims have already contributed to a severe shortage of electricity in the country this year. Millions of homes and businesses were hit with power cuts after China imposed targets for energy consumption and energy intensity. The coal-fired power plants were the first to take the hit. As winter approaches and more energy is needed, China has rushed to mine and burn more coal to ensure domestic consumption needs are met and to calm anger over power cuts. What it shows is that there is a limit to how quickly China can change its current energy-consumption structure. After all, Beijing has to rely on economic development and social stability for its legitimacy.\~This experience was a reminder of just how much China relies on coal and why it remains China\' s primary source of carbon emissions. In 2019, fossil fuels made up 85% of China\' s energy consumption, which is roughly the same as the rest of the world. But almost 58% came from coal \- a figure far exceeding the global average of less than 30%. Consequently, burning coal amounts to about 80% of China\' s total fossil-fuel emissions, followed by 14% from oil and 7% from natural gas. This highlights the challenge China faces in reducing coal consumption alone.\~The focus on coal temporarily eases the immediate concern to cut oil consumption, although in the long term oil will face the same fate. According to the Low Carbon Economy Lab (LCEL) of Tsinghua University, coal has almost peaked in China and will plateau for about a decade before it begins to drop sharply. Oil follows a similar graph to coal, but with additional, though limited, demand growth in the next decade, while natural gas has yet to hit its peak before it begins to decl"
"COP26","China","COP26_China283","Climate talks end with deal after late coal compromise","November 15, 2021 Monday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","THE UN climate talks ended on Saturday with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, even as coal-reliant countries lobbed last-minute objections.While the agreement won applause for keeping alive the hope of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, many of the nearly 200 national delegations wished they\' d come away with more.The two-week conference in Scotland delivered a major win in resolving the rules around carbon markets, but it did little to assuage vulnerable countries\' concerns about long-promised climate financing from rich nations.The British COP26 president, Alok Sharma, was visibly emotional before banging down his gavel to signal there were no vetoes to the pact, after the talks had extended overtime  and overnight  into Saturday.In the final days of the conference, China and the United States issued a joint declaration on enhancing climate change actions in the 2020s, which is widely welcomed and believed can galvanize global collective actions.The two countries agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action this decade to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries as well as multilateral processes. The Glasgow Climate Pact will help kick-start a new journey of global efforts to tackle climate change, Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP26, said. The new global deal, especially the close of the rulebook of the Paris Agreement, bears great significance for defending multilateralism and the implementation of the Paris Agreement, said Zhao, who is China\' s vice minister of ecology and environment.There was last-minute drama as India rejected a clause calling for the  phase out of coal-fired power. After a huddle between the envoys from China, India, the United States and European Union, the clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to  phase down their coal use.India\' s environment and climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the revision reflected the  national circumstances of emerging economies.  We are becoming the voice of the developing countries, he told Reuters, saying the pact had  singled out coal but kept quiet about oil and natural gas. We made our effort to make a consensus that is reasonable for developing countries and reasonable for climate justice, he said, alluding to the fact that rich nations historically have emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases. The approved texts are a compromise, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. The overarching aim he had set for the conference was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries said was too modest  to  keep alive the 2015 Paris Agreement\' s target to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say warming beyond this point could unleash irreversible and uncontrollable climate impacts).In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming.The talks also led to a breakthrough in resolving rules for covering government-led markets for carbon offsets. Companies and countries with vast forest cover had pushed hard for a deal, in hopes also of legitimizing the fast-growing global voluntary offset markets.The deal allows countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying offset credits representing emission cuts by others, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars for protecting forests, expanding renewable energy and other projects to combat climate change.Jennifer Morgan, executive director of the campaign group Greenpeace, saw the glass as half-full. They changed a word but they can\' t change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending, she said.  If you\' re a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome. The deal offered a promise to double adaptation finance by 2025 from 2019, but again no guarantees.\l"

Ultimately, demand for oil, coal and natural gas, and their prices, will fall. Currently, though, we are a long way from that.

Without tackling them, preventing global warming will not be possible. But it has never just been about that.Many other factors play a part, and many of these are of particular concern to the developing world. The global South has borne the brunt of climate change, and has done the least to cause it.This is a thorny issue and how to deal with it is still largely unresolved.At a landmark United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen 12 years ago, rich nations promised to channel $100 billion a year to less wealthy nations by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature.That promise was broken.The money has never been fully delivered, and the suspicion and resentment it has created has not yet abated.Global climate action needs trusted finance data. Compared to the investment required to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, the $100 billion pledge is minuscule. Trillions of dollars will be needed each year to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of restricting global warming to well below 2 C, if not 1.5 C, above pre-industrial temperatures.""We Pacific nations have not traveled to the other end of the world to watch our future sacrificed,"" Fiji's Prime Minister Josaia Bainimarama told his fellow heads of government in Glasgow. His country is in danger from sea level rises it has done nothing to cause.Delegates from the developing world pointed out that some countries are now having to spend more in addressing the effects of global heating than on educating their young.This is why many observers believe a decision by nearly 500 global financial services firms to align $130 trillion, some 40 percent of the world's financial assets, with the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement, including limiting global warming to 1.5 C, could well turn out to be by far the most important outcome of Glasgow.Mark Carney, the UN special envoy for climate action and finance, assembled the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a group of bankers, insurers and investors who have now committed to put climate change at the center of their work.""The core message today is that the money is there, the money is there for the transition, and it's not blah blah blah,"" Carney told delegates during a COP26 climate finance event.The commitment comes with a pathway by which the companies involved, including most of the major Western banks, must use science-based guidel"
"COP26","China","COP26_China287","Beijing opts out of methane pledge, but vows efforts to reduce greenhouse gases","November 5, 2021 Friday","South China Morning Post","More than 100 countries have signed a commitment to reduce their methane emissions by at least 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030 - but the pledge came without participation from the top three emitters: China, Russia and India.The Global Methane Pledge, initiated on Tuesday at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, covers nearly half of global \£dmethane emissions and 70 per cent of global GDP. It was first proposed by the United States and the European Union in September and supported by some top emitters, including Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and Argentina.Methane is the second-most abundant human-caused greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide. Over a 20-year period, methane can warm the atmosphere 80 times more powerfully than carbon dioxide. Reducing methane emissions also helps to improve air quality since it is a precursor to ground-level ozone, a dangerous air pollutant.Countries recognised in the pledge that significant reductions in methane emissions must be achieved globally by 2030 if the world is to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, while pursuing efforts to limit such warming to 1.5 degrees.Successful institution of the pledge would help reduce global warming by at least 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2050, the \£dstatement said.Methane accounts for 17 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, particularly from three sectors - energy, agriculture and waste. The energy sector accounts for more than a third of global \£dmethane emissions, which occur during oil and gas extraction, \£dprocessing and distribution, as well as coal mining.The Global Methane Assessment report released by the United Nations Environment Programme in May found that currently available measures could reduce methane emissions from these major sectors by as much as 45 per cent this decade.The mitigation potential in \£ddifferent sectors varies among countries. The report noted, the largest potential in \£dEurope and \£dIndia was in the waste sector, while in China, the largest potential for reduction came from coal production followed by livestock.China did not join the pledge. At a press conference, foreign ministry spokesman Wang \£dWenbin did not directly explain why Beijing did not join the pledge but said developing countries generally had weak basic data and lacked monitoring technologies and effective measures.But he added that China would increase its efforts to \£dcontrol non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases - including \£dmethane and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as laid out in the country's 14th economic and social development plan through 2025. Relevant departments were formulating and implementing policies and measures to control emissions in industry, agriculture and waste disposal, Wang said.In its updated emissions \£dreduction commitments, or \£dNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted to the United Nations last week, China said it would implement an action plan to step up control of key non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions.Climate envoy Xie Zhenhua told a financial forum in July that China's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 included non-CO2 greenhouse gases, but the country did not have near-term targets to reduce them. The plan for China to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, released last week by the State Council, does not include any targets for the \£dreduction of non-CO2 emissions.According to a study led by \£dscientists at Peking University last month, human-caused methane emissions in China increased by 40 per cent in the 2000s, contributing to 16 per cent of global \£danthropogenic emissions.The study noted that China's human-caused methane emissions stabilised over the past decade, mainly due to stabilised coal production.\l"

Alok Sharma, president of the summit, said the deal had ""kept alive"" the 1.5-degree target, but India and China should justify their actions.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres welcomed the deal but said it was ""not enough"".""Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread,"" he said in a statement. ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.""The European Union's climate policy chief, Frans \£dTimmermans, said the EU would have wanted to go even further on coal, describing the deal as a \£d""disappointment"".Citing the region's own history with coal, Timmermans said: ""We know that the longer you take to get rid of coal, the more burden you're putting on our natural environment, but also the more burden you put on your economy because coal is simply not a smart economic proposition either.""A commitment to reduce \£dmethane emissions by at least 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030 was signed by more than 100 countries, but China, Russia and India - the biggest emitters - were missing.China, which accounts for more greenhouse gases than any other country, also refused to go further than its existing pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions.However, a surprise joint statement by the US and China last week, in which they promised to boost their joint efforts to tackle climate change, was welcomed as a step in the right direction.Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace East Asia, said on Twitter last week that ""setting climate change aside from the more toxic bilateral issues is good for the world"".But Li warned that while the joint statement ""prevents the worst in US-China climate engagement - a decoupling"", it was ""far from saving the planet"".President Xi Jinping last year promised that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060, but he has not responded to calls to agree to more aggressive targets.China's updated commitment to reduce emissions, submitted to the UN ahead of COP26, only included a modest expansion of goals such as increasing the country's share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.Xi's absence from the summit was also criticised by US President Joe Biden. Xi has not left China since the start of the pandemic.Beijing has previously pledged to stop financing overseas coal power plants but is still building new ones domestically.The capacity of new coal plants being approved in 2020 was over three times that of 2019, according to Xinhua.Xie Zhenhua, the country's top climate envoy, defended the country's actions and said it had done a lot to fight climate change.""China has been working hard to manage climate change, by \£dcutting down the peak carbon emissions and reducing the time frame.

Both countries said they would recall their firm commitment to work together and with other parties to strengthen implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement.At the same time, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the Biden administration was gaining traction with China in talks over Beijing\' s compliance with the phase-one trade deal signed between the two sides in January 2020. Tai said the US was weighing all of China\' s shortcomings in the deal, including its lack of purchases of commercial aircraft.Despite these positive signals, Chinese state media continued to urge the US to show more  sincerity, which refers to the cancelation of tariffs imposed on Chinese goods and sanctions against Chinese companies, if it was genuine about peacefully coexisting with China.In early September, US climate envoy John Kerry made his second trip to China this year, urging the country to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After having virtual meetings with Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng and diplomatic officials, Kerry HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/special-presidential-envoy-for-climate-john-kerrys-visit-to-japan-and-the-peoples-republic-of-china/said he had told his Chinese counterpart that  climate is not ideological, not partisan, and not a geostrategic weapon. However, he was told by Beijing officials that climate change issues could not be separated from broader political disputes between the two sides.On September 10, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden held a 90-minute phone call and agreed to resume dialogue on a range of topics. Trade and diplomatic officials held several meetings last month but did not reach any agreements.

Mine is the generation in Singapore that witnessed the beginning and subsequent normalisation of rampant consumerism. The ancient Chinese were already mindful of the human impact on the natural environment. Thinkers such as Guan Zhong (died 645BC), the chief minister of a powerful feudal state, and Xunzi (died 235BC or 217BC), linked environ\£dmental protection with politics. Guan prohibited the levelling of hills, large-scale burning and felling of big trees in spring. ""If a lord cannot protect his mountains, forests, wetlands and grasslands, he cannot be king of all under heaven,"" he wrote. For Xunzi, a sage king was one who implemented laws to prohibit the destruction of vegetation during seasons when plants bore fruit. The punishments for violating laws governing the natural environment were harsh in ancient times.

The U.S. and others have urged Beijing to make bigger commitments, but Xi's administration has strongly implied those will only come in exchange for political concessions.

Both sides recognize that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris Agreement goals so we will jointly strengthen climate action, China\' s climate envoy Xie Zhenghua said. This document contains strong statements about the alarming science, the emissions gap, and the urgent need to accelerate action to close that gap, US special envoy John Kerry told reporters. It commits to a series of important actions now this decade when it is needed. A document outlining the agreement includes a focus on lowering methane emissions, which Kerry described as the  single fastest and most effective way to limit warming. It also says the two sides will meet regularly to  address the climate crisis. The document stresses the need to boost efforts to fight climate change in the short term  scientists have warned that slashing emissions before 2030 is crucial for halting catastrophic warming.The declaration said both countries  recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis, especially during the  critical decade of the 2020s. The US has said it plans to be carbon neutral by 2050, while China announced it has set a net-zero target for 2060. The US-China declaration shows that the two countries can cooperate to address the climate crisis, said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and, as France\' s top climate negotiator at the time, a main architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Now they must cooperate on ensuring an ambitious outcome to COP26, she added.  That means putting us on track to 1.5 degrees and delivering the vital support needed to those most vulnerable. The 2015 Paris accord commits nations to work towards limiting global temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C.The United Nations said that all countries\' carbon-cutting plans combined would still see Earth warm 2.7C by 2100.UN chief Antonio Guterres welcomed the US-China pact.

Xi joined remotely from Beijing, and two days later was again seen via a screen, at the United Nation's COP26 climate change summit, while more than 120 other national leaders showed up in Glasgow, Scotland, in person. Xi had already said the country - the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions - would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, but he was the only world leader who delivered remarks to COP26 in writing. ""The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,"" Biden said in Glasgow. Just as the Covid-19 pandemic has turned so many other things upside down, in-person inter\£dactions with the Chinese leader and many of the country's officials have become rare. Observers have said the trend could leave questions unanswered about Beijing's ambitions, especially given that there were widespread negative views of its actions on the global stage. China has maintained some of the world's toughest border and quarantine restrictions while much of the world has switched its approach to Covid-19 from one of containment to opening up and living with the coronavirus. While other countries' leaders have resumed travel, Xi has remained at home: his last trip abroad was in January 2020, to neighbouring Myanmar. He received visits in Beijing early in 2020 from the leaders of Cambodia, Mongolia and Pakistan, along with World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus - but since March of that year, none have been to see him. This means that in the almost two years since the coronavirus emerged, no more than a handful of foreign leaders have been able to meet Xi in person. ""Xi's decision not to attend summits such as the G20 and COP26 has also meant that Beijing has had to drop the opportunity to use these platforms to promote its policies and goals, as well as its narrative of being a confident global power at a time of growing geopolitical competition,"" Helena Legarda, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, said. Face-to-face meetings, according to Legarda, are an opportunity for leaders ""to speak more candidly and try to build personal connections, foster trust and strengthen ties"". ""The reduced international travel has complicated face-to-face meetings between leaders, denying helpful opportunities to manage tensions and overcome obstacles in negotiations that lower-level officials may not have the authority to handle.""

The two countries should maintain strategic communication, deepen mutual understanding, jointly manage differences, and push forward sound and stable development of bilateral ties, which not only serves the fundamental interests of the two countries, but also meets the common expectation of the international community. With differences in history, culture and development paths, it is normal for China and Britain to differ on some issues. The two sides need to carry out dialogue based on mutual respect and tolerance, seek common ground while reserving differences, strive to create positive momentum in bilateral relations, and provide a consistent outlook for the wider world.Wang Yi said that China and Britain enjoy distinct economic complementarity and huge potential for cooperation. The bilateral trade is expected to exceed 100 billion U.S. dollars this year. Chinese and British businesses are willing to engage in mutual investment, and there are broad prospects for bilateral cooperation in such fields as modern financial services, clean energy and digital economy. If sustained, such bilateral cooperation will surely provide strong support for the respective national development strategies of China and Britain. China supports Britain in hosting the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and hopes that the conference will achieve positive results.Wang Yi said that China expresses grave concerns over the establishment of the trilateral security partnership among the United States, Britain and Australia (AUKUS), and over their nuclear-powered submarine cooperation. This would be the first time that a nuclear-weapon state transfer nuclear-powered submarine to a non-nuclear-weapon state and offer it highly enriched uranium without being subject to international supervision and verification, which is bound to constitute a grave nuclear proliferation risk.Wang Yi stressed that the creation of a new military bloc in the region will trigger an arms race, provoke confrontation between major countries, and undermine regional peace and stability. China opposes the AUKUS, and urges the British side to handle the issue prudently and think twice before any further action, with the aim of maintaining the nuclear non-proliferation system.Truss said that for Britain and China, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, it is important to maintain regular communication. The two countries should strengthen high-level exchanges and strategic communication, deepen mutual understanding and practical cooperation in various fields, and push forward the development of their bilateral relations.

The changes would have better protected ancient woodland and meant there will be less sewage in rivers.The Greener UK coalition told the broadcaster the government's decision was ""hugely disappointing"", especially coming just before the climate summit.The bill, which was introduced in 2019, sets out to improve the quality of air and water, reduce plastic pollution, reduce global warming, and restore habitat.Also, days ahead of COP26, the United Nations has criticized the UK.

Xi also said China would speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations.Representatives of Chinese financial institutions, including the Bank of China (BOC), China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), said in a side event at COP26 that they had taken action to contribute to the country\' s green finance sector\' s development, but their carbon neutrality work should be implemented in an orderly manner to avoid creating credit risks.In March this year, Xi announced China\' s commitment to achieving its major targets on fighting climate change, including a carbon emissions peak in 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. On September 22, he reiterated the targets when speaking via videolink to the UN General Assembly in New York.Xi did not personally attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow, but on Monday delivered a statement to the international community via video link. He said China would foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a fast pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects.

These measures will form a \' 1+N\' policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with a clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint. On Thursday, the PBoC said in a statement that the HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/international-platform-sustainable-finance_enInternational Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), which has 18 members including the European Commission, China, Japan, India and the United Kingdom, had held a meeting during and released a green finance framework known as the  Sustainable Finance Taxonomy.

The PBoC said the taxonomy had an important meaning in terms of pushing forward the green finance cooperation between China and Europe, guiding cross-border climate-related investment and financing activities and lowering the costs of green product transactions. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Green-finance-seminar-in-Glasgow-.png?resize=780%2C439&ssl=1Link to ImagePrior to this, Ma Jun, chairman of China Green Finance Committee and former chief economist of the PBOC\' s research bureau, said at a seminar on Wednesday in Glasgow that an EU-China sustainable finance framework would help accelerate China\' s green transition. This common ground taxonomy identified about 80 climate mitigation activities that are recognized by both the EU and China, Ma said.  It\' s an important step towards enhancing the ability, interworking capability and consistency of financial standards and could inspire further work in this area. Ma also said the China Green Finance Committee and the City of London jointly launched the HYPERLINK https://www.ukchinagreen.org/green-finance/green-belt-and-road/text-of-the-gip/Green Investment Principles The GIP is now a major global network for global institutions and more than 1,000 supporting institutions. These organizations collectively managed US$49 trillion of assets and committed to their low-carbon investments in the Belt and Road region or emerging markets in general, said Ma.At the same event, several executives of Chinese financial institutions shared their views on China\' s green finance sector.CICC\' s chief executive Huang Zhaohui said the total investment demand for China to achieve its carbon neutrality target by 2060 would amount to 139 trillion yuan, including 22 trillion yuan between 2021 and 2030 and 117 trillion yuan between 2031 and 2060. The huge demand could not be satisfied only by public funding, Huang said.  We also need to rely on an open financial system and effective international cooperation. Huang said a globally recognized finance framework could help accelerate cross-border fund flow for green economic development. He said the CICC would continue to launch more carbon neutrality indices, support green bond issuance and set up green sovereign funds.BOC chairman Liu Liange said international financial institutions should jointly develop a global standard that could define, recognize and rate green finance products in order to boost cross-border fundings for sustainable activities.Liu said earlier this year that the BOC had joined the HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/Principles for Responsible BankingHe said the bank had also promised that from the fourth quarter this year it would stop providing finance to coal mining and coal-fired power generation projects overseas. Liu added that BOC would provide at least 1 trillion yuan ($156 billion) to support the green finance sector during the period of the 14th Five Year Plan between 2021 and 2025. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/China-Coal.jpg?resize=780%2C464&ssl=1Link to ImageAt the same time, Liu stressed that the BOC would only implement its green strategy step by step in an orderly manner. Green transition will create new industries but at the same time add a huge pressure on traditional sectors, Liu said.  The pain of transiting from traditional energy to new energy will not be reduced within a short period of time. Financial institutions must think carefully and find a balance point when they try to restructure their client bases.  People in the West are happy to see Chinese banks stop lending to coal mines and all the high-carbon sectors. But such \' stripping away\' is not like taking off your clothes or throwing away rubbish, said Fang Wenjian, the President of the BOC\' s London branch, adding that no country would like to pursue a green transition if the process created credit risks and social instability. We have to strike a balance here and promote low carbon transformation in a steady and an orderly fashion. It\' s important to bring our clients with us on this journey, instead of leaving them behind, Fang said.  We don\' t only mind our own businesses, but also mind our clients\' businesses in this process. Fang said sometimes financial institutions might have to increase lending to high carbon sectors so that companies could transform their businesses.Zhou Yueqiu, chief economist of the ICBC, said Chinese financial institutions should launch more innovative green products, but at the same time improve risk management and avoid overreacting to carbon reduction targets. Zhou said all carbon neutrality work had to be done safely and orderly.The seminar was co-organized by the Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking, the Beijing Institute of Finance and Sustainability and the C Team & Vanke Foundation.

Speaking to reporters via video conference, Mattiolo said that the discussions about climate change will assess progress made in the run-up to the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to be held in Scotland, while the health-related negotiations will focus on issues such as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ways to improve pandemic preparedness. The negotiators will also consider ways to strengthen the post-pandemic global economic recovery and to make economic growth more sustainable, according to Mattiolo. The G20 summit, slated for this weekend, will also aim to help confront global crises, including the coronavirus pandemic, and will assess the situation in Afghanistan following the collapse of the country's government. The long-standing ministerial-level talks on finance, labor, education, foreign affairs, development, environmental protection, energy, culture, trade and agriculture are also on the event's agenda. The highlights of the ministerial meetings this year include: the finance summit focused on the international tax reform; the labor talks focused in part on gender equality; the negotiations on education, including the impacts of the pandemic on the education systems; and the discussions on the environment and energy, in preparation for the upcoming COP26 climate summit. Each one of the series of talks held earlier in the year concluded with a final declaration that will be formally presented to the heads of state and government for its adoption. ""The big summit's main role will be to review and adopt the conclusions of the many working groups, task forces and ministerial meetings,"" Antonio Villafranca, research coordinator and head of the European Program at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a think tank, told Xinhua. ""In Rome, the leaders will assess what has been done and what can still be done."" One of the issues left to be decided, according to Villafranca, is whether the leaders would call for the curbing or elimination of the incentives that support the use of fossil fuels in the G20 countries. This decision will be significant since the G20 member states account for around 80 percent of the world's primary energy use, according to an ISPI report. If the leaders agree to reduce fossil fuel incentives it would also provide a boost to climate negotiations ahead of the COP26 climate negotiations, which get underway just as the G20 Leaders' Summit closes. But according to Raffaele Marchetti, an international relations professor at Rome's LUISS University, the effectiveness of the G20 should not be measured by its ability to make decisions. ""The correct way to look at the G20 is as a forum for conversations between global leaders on important topics,"" Marchetti told Xinhua. ""It's not necessarily a body for making major decisions. But those decisions can emerge from the discussions in the G20 context."" ""Other forums like the United Nations or the World Health Organization or the World Trade Organization are too large to be focused, and the G7 (Group of Seven) is too narrow and too dominated by western countries,"" Marchetti said. ""But the G20 includes eastern and western powers alike. In most areas, it's the best forum where the major powers -- the United States, China and the European Union -- are all involved."" Enditem\l"

For six years, Adani, Asia's second-richest person who heads coal-to-ports giant Adani Enterprises, was the only powerhouse player in India's renewables space. But now Ambani, Asia's wealthiest magnate who leads oil-to-retail juggernaut Reliance Industries, is making a determined push into clean energy with his firm Reliance New Energy. Reliance has been engaged in a frenzy of deal-making ever since Ambani announced a US$10-billion, three-year investment in June to build an end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem through solar, batteries and hydrogen. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. For Ambani, whose Reliance Industries gets 60 per cent of its revenues from petroleum products, the move to renewables is inevitable given the doomsday climate writing on the wall. ""The world is entering a new energy era,"" he told shareholders. ""The age of fossil fuels ... cannot continue much longer. The huge quantities of carbon emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth."" Underscoring the reputed rivalry between the low-profile billionaires, who both come from Modi's western home state of Gujarat, Adani quickly upped his game after Ambani unveiled his plans. Adani, who reinvented himself as a ""green-and-clean"" energy tsar after his ports-and-power assets looked to be struggling, said he would invest US$20 billion over 10 years in renewables and vowed to be the world's biggest clean-energy producer by 2030. ""Our actions clearly indicate we're putting our money where our mouth is: over 75 per cent of our planned [capital expenditure] until 2025 will be in green technologies,"" said Adani, who often hosted Modi on his private plane before he became prime minister. Adani said the US$20 billion would go on producing electrolysers to make green hydrogen, backward integration to secure solar-and-wind generation supply chains and AI-based industrial cloud platforms. In total, the conglomerate would invest US$50-US$70 billion across its energy value chain over a decade, he said. It also wants to tap into booming demand for data centres and run them on clean power. Ambani, while committing less money, is branching out widely, setting up a ""giga-complex"" in Jamnagar in Gujarat, home to his oil refinery, the world's largest. He is establishing one plant for solar modules to create 100 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030, representing a third of India's projected solar market; another to make batteries to store electricity; a third for fuel cells; and a fourth for building hydrogen electrolysers. Reliance has also been on an acquisitions spree. Last month, it bought Norway-based solar panel-maker REC Solar Holdings for US$771 million from China National Bluestar Group. Innovation-driven REC has 446 patents. Then, it signed a pact to acquire 40 per cent of Sterling & Wilson, an Indian solar-engineering firm valued at US$372 million. It also plans to invest US$29 million in Germany's NexWafe and use its technology to build large-scale photovoltaic solar-wafer plants in India and it is tying up with a Danish company to make hydrogen electrolysers in India. ""The manufacturing aspect of Ambani's solar investments is particularly important"" as India ""right now is almost entirely [dependent] on Chinese suppliers,"" said Alok Brara, editor of infrastructure magazine PowerLine. ""The Ambanis are well used to doing all sorts of large-scale plants. They'll also be going into green hydrogen. These are significant steps."" For his part, Adani said Adani Green Energy, already the world's largest solar generator, would triple its solar power generation capacity over the next four years. ""This is a rate of growth currently unmatched by any other company anywhere on the planet. Our renewables portfolio has reached the initial target of 25 gigawatts a full four years ahead of schedule,"" he said. That achievement is thanks to Adani's purchase last month of Japanese multinational Softbank's Indian solar unit for US$3.5 billion, one of the biggest renewables acquisitions globally. Many hundreds of billions of dollars more in investments will be needed to meet the 2070 net-zero carbon emission target set by Modi at Glasgow's HYPERLINK COP26 climate summit. But the financial commitments by the billionaires, known for their Midas touch, have given a fillip to India's renewables sector by sending a clear message to investors locally and globally that they're betting big on green energy and expect a payback. Investors see that Ambani, ""a businessman, who has a lot of capital, considers renewables to be the best way forward. That gives a very good signal about the business sustainability of renewables ... it's become mainstream,"" said Samrat Sengupta, who heads the renewable energy programme at New Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment, a think-tank. That signal, in fact, is crucial if India is to attract the private investment required to meet its climate targets. India's energy demands will triple over the next three decades as its economy grows and the country will need a staggering US$1.4 trillion over the next 20 years to get on a sustainable energy path, according to International Energy Association calculations. Modi told the Glasgow summit on November 2 that rich countries should provide as much as US$1 trillion in climate finance. On November 10, Indian officials clarified their demands. They want US$1 trillion in funds just for India by 2030 - 10 times more than the unmet US$100 billion a year for all poor countries sought under previous deals. Over a decade, that would mean advanced economies have to give India the same amount of funds they have promised for all poor countries. India was asking for such a large sum because it was also taking into account loss and damage, Environment Secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta said, referring to what poor countries see as a debt owed by nations who are responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere. Rich countries' current US$100 billion a year target is only meant to fund decarbonisation measures and infrastructure that helps protect against more extreme weather events. India also pushed back on proposed language in the final Glasgow agreement that countries would ""accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"". Gupta said the nation would only move away from the dirtiest fossil fuel if it received the financial support it was asking for. US climate envoy John Kerry said after a meeting with the Indian delegation in Glasgow that he ""wouldn't promise"" US$1 trillion for India, and still needed to look at the details. In the meeting, Kerry committed Washington to joining the International Solar Alliance which is headquartered in the Indian city of Gurugram. Given broken promises by the developed world to help poorer nations mitigate further temperature rises, ""we can't say anything will be given as charity. It will always be a business transaction,"" Samrat said. Until their clean energy forays, the two billionaires' activities didn't overlap in any major way. Some analysts reckon Adani, worth US$74.8 billion according to Forbes, enjoys a first-mover advantage that will help him compete against Ambani's New Energy vertical. But while Ambani is late to renewables, when he decides on a strategy, he is known for going all-out to achieve it, such as with his 4G telecoms firm he launched in 2016. Ambani, whose fortune Forbes pegs at US$93 billion, ruthlessly built scale, undercutting rivals on prices. Reliance Jio has won 450 million subscribers and bankrupted competitors to become India's largest mobile firm. Brokerage Jeffries said it saw Reliance Industries ""emerging as India's most credible RE [renewable energy] player"". Ambani calls his clean energy push his ""most challenging"" mission. If Reliance aggressively ramps up its renewables play - and it has room to do it with a debt-free balance sheet of US$183 billion - other potential entrants might hesitate. Some observers worry too that the low-profile billionaires, whose conglomerates span vast tracts of India's economy and who are skilled at navigating the country's tricky political and commercial landscape, might carve up the green energy market for themselves, resulting in a duopoly. ""There should be sufficient competition in the market so it doesn't consolidate ... We need other players to jump in for market efficiency and cost optimisation,"" Samrat said. India's greenhouse-gas emissions will peak only after the 2035-2040 period, experts say. (India's 2070 net-zero target is a decade later than HYPERLINK China's and 20 years beyond conference organisers' 2050 goal, seen as the climate-change tipping point). India with its 1.4 billion people, nearly a fifth of the global population, is already the third-biggest greenhouse-gas contributor after China and the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-statesUnited States. Coal remains the king of India's energy mix, supplying 72 per cent of electricity. Modi at the Glasgow summit pledged India would hike its renewable energy capacity to 500 Gigawatts by 2030 and satisfy 50 per cent of its power needs by then from non-fossil fuel sources. It was a big promise as renewables right now only have a 12 per cent share of the energy mix. Alarmingly, making the goal even more challenging, by 2030, India will be guzzling almost twice the electricity annually it was consuming at the start of the decade as more of the country's poor clamber out of poverty and into the middle class.

Stephen Ndegwa, a Nairobi-based policy analyst, noted that unlike some major powers, China has eschewed the finger-pointing and blame game but has taken bold steps to accelerate low-carbon development. ""A snapshot of the last ten years for instance shows that China has phased out 120 million kilowatts of installed coal-fired power generation capacity,"" Ndegwa said in a commentary published by The Star last week. He agreed with Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, who reiterated that tackling climate change requires solid commitment and concrete actions instead of empty slogans. Ndegwa said that the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties () to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, should be an opportunity for rich nations to honor their financial pledges to developing countries to help them cope with climatic stresses. According to Ndegwa, China has never dodged its responsibility to tackle climate change or environmental pollution amid rapid development. He said China has constructed the first batch of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a capacity of about 100 million kilowatts, amid efforts to realize carbon neutrality before 2060. China's commitment to the pursuit of ecological conservation and green development has been accompanied with actions, such as fostering ""a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace,"" controlling ""energy-intensive and high-emission projects,"" and providing ""financial incentives,"" the analyst expounded. ""Taken together, these (Chinese) measures will form a '1+N' policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with a clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint,"" he concluded.\l"

The North African country is currently implementing a series of green and environment-friendly projects in the sectors of energy, electricity, transportation, water, sanitation and irrigation. The projects include the Benban Solar Park, a complex of solar power stations in Upper Egypt's province of Aswan, which has recently been inaugurated by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi. Egypt's green projects in these sectors amounted to 30 percent of the state budget allocation for investments during the current fiscal year that ends in late June 2022, according to Minister of Planning and Economic Development Hala Al-Saeed. The government seeks to raise the percentage of green projects to 50 percent of the budget allocated for investments in 2024. ""The Egyptian strategy for the transition to a green economy is part of Egypt's 2030 strategy, as the implementation of projects under green economy regulations guarantees better financing opportunities for them from international institutions, and also improves Egypt's rating in relevant indicators,"" Egyptian economist Walid Gaballah told Xinhua. Gaballah, also a member of the Egyptian Society for Political Economy, Statistics and Legislation, added that green projects have become a tangible reality in Egypt that citizens are following and talking about, such as the projects of Benban solar power plant, the electric trains, the natural gas-fueled cars and others. ""Increasing the percentage of green public investments this much reflects the country's determination to achieve the requirements of its transition to green economy and motivate the private sector to go in the same direction, with an eye on becoming a pioneer in green economy in the region,"" the expert said. Egypt launched its national strategy on green economy in April 2016 during the African Ministerial Conference on Environment held in Cairo, and the Egyptian government vowed that the environment was one of the cornerstones of Egypt's 2030 strategy. The country's strategy for a gradual transition to a green economy was launched in partnership with the United Nations Environment Program and the Center for Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe. ""Egypt has made great strides in the field of green economy and is in the process of transferring its government to a new green administrative capital city that implements all the requirements of green transformation,"" Gaballah said. The Egyptian government has already held its first meeting with its full body at the newly built administrative capital city east of Cairo in late December 2021 as part of the gradual relocation of government offices to the new capital. Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh will host in November the 27th edition of the UN climate change conference (COP27) as announced by the international organization during COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. Experts believe the summit will be an opportunity to promote Egypt's green projects and attract more green investments to the country, which will boost the Egyptian transition to green economy. ""Egypt has been chosen to host COP27 due to its efforts environment-related issues. This will certainly enhance its orientation towards a green economy,"" said Egyptian economic expert Karim Al-Omda. Al-Omda, a lecturer at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, pointed out that the energy sector is the most investment-attractive in Egypt, noting that the country seeks to gradually cover 42 percent of its needs of electricity through renewable energy sources by 2035, compared to 20 percent at present.

The city's case numbers did significantly increase last winter. Thus, we should not be complacent this winter. To keep the community safe, the mask mandate must continue. A recent global study published in The BMJ found that wearing masks cuts Covid-19 incidence up to 53 per cent. This makes masking the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid-19. It is only a matter of time before the Omicron variant strikes the Hong Kong community. Europe crossed 75 million coronavirus cases and is bracing itself for the impact of Omicron during winter. Compared to the rest of the world, the Hong Kong government has done a decent job of tackling the virus, but we still have a long way to go. Tac Cheng, Tuen MunThe climate conference was a catalyst for global cooperation regardless of different ideologies. While globalisation has brought countries together, as the pendulum swings the other way, we may witness a rise of deglobalisation or decoupling of economies. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rightly compared the world's seemingly impossible mission of tackling https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change to a James Bond film in which 007 is strapped to a doomsday device. But in this case, the entire world is actually facing doomsday if we do not act collectively and quickly. Can we rely solely on the goodwill of countries around the world? If carbon-emitting economic development accelerates, doomsday will come earlier. The euphoria of COP26 is receding with some participating countries expressing discontent with the wording of the deal made. Many fear that wealthy countries will pay lip service to promises of financial assistance to poorer nations in dealing with the impact of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change. But it should not be surprising that one meeting alone cannot solve all the world's problems. The Bandung conference, held in Indonesia in 1955, comes to mind. At the time, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai advocated the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences. Today, the spirit of that conference needs to be renewed - we should seek common ground despite our differences.

Under the historic cross-party agreement, the conservative Coalition and Liberal governments in NSW and SA and left-wing Labor-Greens ACT government will help each other reach net zero emissions. ""Sub-national governments have a vital role to play in getting to net zero emissions because we have some of the most important levers such as transport, buildings and energy,"" ACT Chief Minister and Climate Action Minister Andrew Barr said. ""This forum will drive a more collaborative approach to developing the policies to get to net zero emissions."" The announcement comes in the wake of the landmark COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed Australia's plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the summit but was criticized over its lack of detail. The ACT is aiming to cut its emissions by 50-60 percent from 1990 levels by 2025 and NSW has announced a 50 percent reduction target from 2005 levels by 2030. A ministerial group will lead the forum, which will be chaired by NSW for the first 12 months. ""Taking action on climate change is an economic and environmental imperative, and this is about ensuring states and territories are working together to address it,"" Matthew Kean, NSW's Treasurer and Minister for Energy and Environment, said.

As we blithely destroy the ecosystems essential for the survival of everything, the BBC has come up with a worthy successor to The Blue Planet and its stablemates: The Green Planet, a five-part wildlife series presented from the perspective of plants. Four years in the making and filmed in 27 countries, its globe-spanning episodes are titled Tropical, Waterworld, Seasonal, Human and Deserts. Indicating the series' importance, the first instalment, Tropical, was shown at the opening of the recent Cop26 in Glasgow, where the real stars of the intensifying climate-change battle received due recognition. ""I don't think any series has looked at the plant world in the same level of detail that we have,"" episode producer Paul Williams says on a video call from London. ""We took a story approach, where we made individual plants into individual characters, as we do with animals. And we [jointly] built new robotic systems that allowed us to film plants in the wild in immersive ways, to show their growth and tell their stories up close."" That technology soon shows its value in the opening chapter, which visits the Malay Peninsula and the Bornean rainforest. Time-lapse images captured by a remote-control camera called the Triffid show the blooming of the world's largest flower, a species of Rafflesia, from inside and out. Luckily, they cannot transmit its repulsive odour - said to be of death. Fellow episode producer Rosie Thomas hopes viewers will take away from the series the same thing she did, ""a whole new understanding of the natural world. I walk into a forest now and see trees in a completely different way."" ""The realisation that there's an underground fungal network that connects all the trees and allows them to 'talk' to and help each other is a mind-blowing idea to me. Plants have memory, a sense of smell and a nervous system; being able to share those things with an audience is satisfying."" Executive producer Mike Gunton refers to that network as ""the wood-wide web"", an appropriate term catching on among scientists to describe ""this internet of the forest beneath our feet. There's this other world going on all around us that we just don't realise."" As we stumble from ""plant blindness to plant awareness"", Gunton sees clearly the path to survival humans must choose. ""These are our friends,"" he says. ""We need to cherish, protect and celebrate them because we need them - and they will do all the hard work for us if we just let them.""

Under the auspices of the United Nations, the system will provide for the allocation of carbon credits linked to projects and activities that reduce greenhouse gases - for example, renewable energy plants or the cultivation of forestry land. These credits will be set against a country's emission-reduction targets and/or sold to raise finance, providing an offset to carbon emissions in another country. Essentially the agreement provides a framework for a HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3155989/cop26-deal-reached-nations-seek-avert-climate-disasterglobal carbon marketTo illustrate simply how the system would work, we can imagine a new wind-turbine power plant being built in country A to replace an old coal-fired power station. The switch might reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 100 tonnes. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Once verified, country A would be granted 100 carbon credits which could directly be set against its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - the system developed by the UN to track global emission plans on a country-by-country basis to determine whether, collectively, we are on track to stop global temperatures from rising by more than HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3144337/climate-change-unchecked-gas-emissions-make-earth-hotter-and-sooner-un1.5 degrees CelsiusCountry A could thus count its carbon emissions as having been reduced by 100 tonnes, or it could sell some of the credits, say 20, to country B. The rules of the system mean that country A would be able to claim it had reduced emissions by 80 tonnes and country B would be able to offset 20 tonnes of its emissions through buying the carbon credits. It is feasible that some countries might be able to generate more carbon credits than needed to meet their NDCs. For example, Chile could exploit solar energy more efficiently than many countries because much of the country is at altitude, and the sun's rays are stronger there. It could build more solar power capacity than it needs and generate excess carbon credits. These could be sold, raising money for Chile to finance its green energy projects and other development goals, and allow other countries to offset their own - potentially more difficult to abate - carbon emissions. Many participants at COP26, particularly in the private sector, called for carbon prices to be used more effectively in the battle against https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change. There are different ways in which carbon can be priced - with taxes on emissions and cap-and-trade systems being the most effective. Yet we do not have anything yet that resembles a global system. The consequence is that in some countries, economic activity that produces carbon does so with no cost. The carbon trading system agreed in Glasgow will help with the visibility of carbon pricing but more needs to be done. Cap-and-trade schemes, also known as emissions trading systems, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3141549/chinas-emissions-trading-scheme-small-important-step-climate-changesuch as China's, essentially charge emitters for producing carbon dioxide above limits that are set with reference to the type of economic activity. Those limits are reduced over time, meaning that firms need to cut their emissions or pay more for the carbon they generate. Of course, the aim of carbon pricing and workable carbon markets is to ""price out"" activities that generate greenhouse gases. If carbon is priced effectively, then renewable energy, for example, becomes cheaper than power generated from fossil fuels. Higher prices, stemming from a carbon tax, might get passed on to consumers, easing a shift in demand towards greener products and services. Investors with an increased focus on sustainability will find more profitable opportunities in green products and services once more of the carbon-producing economy is subject to carbon pricing. An effective system would affect both production and consumption, and is a necessary tool in the transition to a net-zero economy. Carbon pricing will become more widespread. However, an effective system needs global collaboration to avoid carbon dumping. It will also come with broader economic implications, particularly with regards to inflation. Yet, we need effective market mechanisms to support the transition and that is what carbon pricing and a global market in carbon credit trading will bring.

State broadcaster CCTV reported that in the virtual meeting Xi and Merkel reviewed the development of China-Germany relations in a ""friendly atmosphere"" and exchanged views on issues relating to the relationship. The engagement between China and Europe follows last week's meeting between China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and the announcement of a security alliance between the US, the UK and Australia that has angered France.

As previously reported by the South China Morning Post, Xi will also hold a call with European Council President Charles Michel on Friday, in a week of top-level diplomatic exchanges regarded as efforts by China to improve fraying ties. It comes amid speculation that Xi will not travel to Europe for the G20 leaders' summit at the end of the month or for the COP26 climate talks in November, leaving no opportunity for face-to-face talks. A European diplomat briefed about the Xi-Merkel call said it had been arranged, at Xi's request, to discuss issues related to the summit. EU-China relations sank this year to arguably their lowest point in three decades with Brussels imposing sanctions on Chinese officials for their role in alleged human rights abuses in HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/places/xinjiangXinjiang - the first such action taken by the EU since the arms embargo that followed the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. China responded with sweeping sanctions on a host of EU ambassadors, parliamentarians and academics, leading the European Parliament to stall consideration of an EU - China investment pact that had been agreed to in principle at the end of 2020. Alarmed by the deterioration in ties, in recent weeks the European Union has also sought ways to improve the relationship. At an informal dinner in Slovenia last week, the bloc's 27 national leaders discussed China strategy for the first time in a year. An official who attended said they talked about a need to ""rebalance"" ties with China, while the EU's de facto foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell wrote in a blog post on Sunday that they ""agreed that we must remain strong in our approach, based on the 'partner, competitive, rival' tryptic"". ""We must encourage dialogue and cooperation in certain areas like climate policy,"" Borrell added. ""But we should also be ready to push back when Chinese decisions run counter to our views, notably on human rights and geopolitical choices."" The interaction between Xi and senior EU leaders comes during the fallout from the announcement of the Aukus alliance, which caused France to lose out on a lucrative submarine sale to Australia. French President Emmanuel Macron has redoubled his push for European ""strategic autonomy"" and his vision of the EU ploughing a furrow independent of both the US and China. ""The United States wants to confront China. The European Union wants to engage China,"" French Foreign Minister Bruno Le Maire told in an interview published on Tuesday, adding that the EU must be ""independent from the United States, able to defend its own interests, whether economic or strategic interests"". For Merkel, who has helped to foster EU-China ties during her 16 years as German chancellor, it will be one of her last official engagements with Xi before she steps down.

Australia has also long been much-maligned for refusing to set detailed targets for carbon neutrality, as one of the world's largest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas.Experts have pointed out that Australia's climate change performance is against their net zero goal, especially Australia's current reliance on coal. Experts have called on Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stop passing the buck and slamming China whose emissions per person are only around half of Australia's, and to better seek potential collaboration with China.\~Unconvincing goalMorrison announced a much-delayed climate plan only days before the summit, saying it would achieve net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 through the continuing 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels.\~This announcement took months of political wrangling, BBC reported, but nothing new compared to the target set under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott in 2016.Australia, the leading global coal and fossil fuels exporter drew large criticism for a far modest pledge than other rich nations' ambitions, with nothing more updated that the goal announced at the Paris climate conference in 2015.As one of the strongest emissions per head of population, it has long dragged its heels on climate action, though having seen direct influence over its own land such as extended bushfires, marine heatwaves, rising sea levels in Australia, and more frequent floods and drought.Its pledge was accused of being the weakest at COP26 among the G20's developed countries, while others including the UK and the EU accelerated aims in cutting greenhouse gas emissions by moving toward a 50 percent reduction from 2005 levels.Chris Bowen, Australia's shadow climate change minister, described the government's announcement as a ""scam"" with no new policy detail.Climate activists hold placards during a protest against Australia's energy policy outside the Australian Embassy in Berlin on January 10, 2020.

The media has reported on a batch of Torres Strait Islanders living in Australia's north coast who filed a lawsuit against the government, on the day the carbon emissions target was announced, for leaving the residents under the threat of floods and soil salinization as a result of global warming.Australia has already experienced 1.4C  much higher than the global average of 1.1C  of warming that could bring about more intense and frequent fire weather events and other extreme weather fronts. And this will continue to increase, with serious impacts if action is not taken to reduce carbon emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021.""This report shows Scott Morrison's 2030 targets are a death sentence for Australia,"" Australia Greens leader Adam Bandt said.\~Bandt called Morrison to double or triple the country's 2030 targets, saying that ""anything less than 75 percent emissions cuts by 2030 means giving up on the 1.5 degree goal in the Paris Agreement.""Published data by researchers at Monash University shows that Australians are almost three times more worried about climate change than COVID-19, with many showing signs of PTSD from past or future climate-related, catastrophic events.On August 10, a group of protesters sprayed the message ""climate duty of care"" on the concrete outside the Australian Parliament House and on a fence outside The Lodge before getting arrested.""Australians are very concerned about the impact of climate change on Australia.

""Reducing CO2 emissions hurts the interests of Australian domestic giants in these industries,"" he told the Global Times.Facing resistance from these interest groups, Australian administrations from the former Kevin Rudd's to current Scott Morrison's, have made little difference in reducing emissions, observers said.\~The National Party of Australia, a part of Australia's ruling Liberal-National Coalition, actually represent farmers, grazers, and miners, said Chen Hong, a professor and director of the Australian Studies Centre of East China Normal University. ""That leads to the very conservative attitude of the Morrison government [toward climate action],"" he noted.Also, inside the Australian government there are climate skeptics who don't believe that humans cause global warming, Chen told the Global Times. He mentioned former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a climate skeptic who is also infamous for interference in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan question. ""That's anti-intellectual,"" Chen said.Worse still, the Australian government has frequently pointed fingers at China on emission reduction issues, turning a blind eye to the fact that China's emissions per person (around 8.12 tons) are far lower than that of Australia (15.2 tons), observers have found.\~In his brazen defense, Morrison deflected blame onto developing countries, but it keeps absent in financing support to worldwide actions in climate change, as it has stopped contributions to the UN's Green Climate Fund and continues to fund the fossil fuel industry.In a speech delivered in August, Morrison said that climate change must be solved ""in developing nations such as China.""

Or is this all that can ever be on offer from the government?"" Siegert said. ""The government has certainly set its stall out clearly, and obviously can be judged on delivering on the strategy. If it doesn't work out, our pathway to net zero will be ever more difficult to reach by 2050.""Experts also pointed out that the government could have done more to exercise its regulatory powers in order to promote sustainable practices.Gavin Killip, a senior researcher at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said the heat and buildings strategy, which was designed to decarbonize homes and buildings, came as a ""big disappointment"".""The level of financial support is too small, and too many important elements have been ignored: no tighter regulations for building energy efficiency; no long-term support for the industry expected to do the installation and maintenance work,"" Killip said.

However, Turkey still refused its classification as a ""developed country."" Turkish parliament on Wednesday said in a statement that Turkey would ratify the agreement as a ""developing country,"" and would implement it based on ""equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and assigned capabilities."" Turkey has been a signatory to the Paris Agreement since April 2016, while it refused to ratify the deal by saying that it was unfair to place Turkey among the developed countries. Speaking at the UN General Assembly in September, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had not ratify the agreement ""due to the injustices related to state obligations and burden-sharing."" But following ""progress made within the framework of the agreement recently,"" Turkey would ratify the deal ""in conformity with the positive steps which will be taken,"" Erdogan added. Listed in Annex I by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, Ankara was obliged to provide financial help to developing countries. But Ankara defended that it had few responsibilities for greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, Turkey applied to the UNFCCC secretariat to have its name removed from the Annex I list and be included in the list of ""developing countries,"" which can benefit from climate change funds. Its proposal will be discussed at the COP26 on Oct. 31, which will be held in Glasgow, Scotland to help illustrate the urgency of the problem of climate change, where nearly 200 nations will address precautions for eradicating carbon gas emissions. As Turkey becomes a party to the agreement, it will be able to benefit from the UN's Green Climate Fund, access other funds that provide climate finance and will benefit from the opportunity to trade in the newly formed international emission markets. After Turkey stepped up to be part of the accord, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved the ""Green Economy Financing Programme"" project on Sept. 28, which will provide Ankara with more than 500 million Euros. Another motivation that lies behind Turkey's move to ratify the deal is the possible trade difficulties it would face in the lack of the climate pledge. On June 8, experts and representatives of the business chambers of Turkey briefed the Turkish lawmakers on the issue of climate change and warned that Turkey would face serious trade barriers if it did not ratify the Paris Agreement. Ahmet Saygin Baban from the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) told the lawmakers that ratification of the deal may mitigate some adverse impacts of the European Union's planned carbon border tax. He recalled that Turkey makes 60 percent of its exports to the G7 countries and Turkish businesses would face a very serious loss with the carbon tax at the border, increased financing costs, along with loss of competitiveness. Moreover, the country would not be able to sign free trade agreements if the accord was not signed. If the EU collects a carbon tax between 30-50 euros per ton from Turkey it would cost one or two million euros annually, Baban noted. Enditem\l"

""Across Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we are urging governments to step up and commit to clear and strong climate policies that will unlock the capital needed to transition to a net-zero economy.""G20 countries account for 80 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and over 80 per cent of global gross domestic product.With less than two weeks left until the United Nations climate change conference, known as COP26, opens in Glasgow, there is little time for countries to commit to more ambitious policies to \£daddress the climate crisis.AIGCC, Ceres and IGCC, \£dtogether with the Carbon Dis\£dclosure Project, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, the Principles for Responsible Investment and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, have founded The Investor Agenda - a common leadership agenda focused on accelerating investor action for a net-zero emissions economy.The report measured G20 countries' progress towards the five policy recommendations in The Investor Agenda's statement to governments on the climate crisis and collated analyses from independent sources to grade countries on their green investment environments.The statement, signed by 587 investors representing over US$46 trillion in assets, urged \£dgovernments to undertake five priority actions before COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5 \£ddegrees Celsius. This includes \£dincentivising private investments in zero-emissions solutions and committing to implementing mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \£drecommendations.Countries considered ""green"" have 2030 targets consistent with 1.5 degrees or less of warming. Britain is the only G20 country whose 2030 target is consistent with this aim. More than half of G20 members, including China, have targets consistent with more than two degrees of warming.On net-zero emissions, the report said seven G20 countries, including Indonesia and Australia, had not committed to net zero. And on the implementation and delivery of net-zero targets, apart from the EU, all the other G20 countries that had committed to a net-zero target were considered ""insufficient"".On mandatory climate risk disclosure to ensure climate risk is effectively managed, only Britain and the EU committed to man\£ddatory TCFD-aligned disclosure, the report said. Other countries, including China, had no policy encouraging or enforcing TCFD reporting and investors were not required to report climate risk.China pledged last September to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon \£dneutrality before 2060. However, the targets have not yet been \£dlegislated, and there is not enough information to assess whether the targets are sufficient, according to the investor groups.\l"

In recent years, this outlook has been fully vindicated: costs of renewables have consistently fallen faster than expected, while deployment has proceeded more rapidly than predicted, thereby reducing costs even further. Thanks to this virtuous cycle, renewables have broken through. And now, new analyses from two authoritative research institutions have added to the mountain of data showing that a rapid clean-energy transition is the least-expensive path forward.

One can only guess why forecasters have, for decades, underestimated the falling costs and accelerating pace of deployment for renewables. But the results are clear: bad predictions have underwritten trillions of dollars of investment in energy infrastructure that is not only more expensive but also more damaging to human society and all life on the planet. We now face what may be our last chance to correct for decades of missed opportunities. Either we will continue to waste trillions more on a system that is killing us, or we will move rapidly to the cheaper, cleaner, more advanced energy solutions of the future. New studies have shed light on how a rapid clean-energy transition would work.

But this process can and should be supported to ensure that it proceeds as quickly as possible. Policymakers who want to drive change must create an enabling environment for the optimal flow of capital. Bond clearly lays out the sequence of steps that this process entails. Examining past energy revolutions reveals several important insights. First, capital is attracted to technological disruptions, and tends to flow to the areas of growth and opportunity associated with the start of these revolutions. As a result, once a new set of technologies passes its gestation period, capital becomes widely available. Second, financial markets draw forward change. As capital moves, it speeds up the process of change by allocating new capital to growth industries, and by withdrawing it from those in decl"

The two have talked many times since, yet it is not clear they have achieved anything. It is becoming increasingly obvious there is little chance of one side coaxing the other to improve its performance through traditional diplomatic channels. The US strategy has three fundamental problems. For starters, the international community has factored into its own strategic calculus the possibility that Donald Trump - or at least Trumpism - will HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3146961/donald-trump-head-iowa-eye-2024return to power in the US.

But China insists that ""climate cooperation cannot be separated from the wider environment of China-US relations"". That leaves the two at loggerheads. The third problem is the most intractable.

ROME, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Luigi Mattiolo, a senior diplomatic advisor to Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, said on Tuesday that the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) Leaders' Summit will broadly focus on three main areas: climate change, health and the global economic recovery. Speaking to reporters via video conference, Mattiolo said that the discussions about climate change will assess progress made in the run-up to the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to be held in Scotland, while the health-related negotiations will focus on issues such as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ways to improve pandemic preparedness. The negotiators will also consider ways to strengthen the post-pandemic global economic recovery and to make economic growth more sustainable, according to Mattiolo. The G20 summit, slated for this weekend, will also aim to help confront global crises, including the coronavirus pandemic, and will assess the situation in Afghanistan following the collapse of the country's government. The long-standing ministerial-level talks on finance, labor, education, foreign affairs, development, environmental protection, energy, culture, trade and agriculture are also on the event's agenda. The highlights of the ministerial meetings this year include: the finance summit focused on the international tax reform; the labor talks focused in part on gender equality; the negotiations on education, including the impacts of the pandemic on the education systems; and the discussions on the environment and energy, in preparation for the upcoming COP26 climate summit. Each one of the series of talks held earlier in the year concluded with a final declaration that will be formally presented to the heads of state and government for its adoption. ""The big summit's main role will be to review and adopt the conclusions of the many working groups, task forces and ministerial meetings,"" Antonio Villafranca, research coordinator and head of the European Program at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a think tank, told Xinhua. ""In Rome, the leaders will assess what has been done and what can still be done."" One of the issues left to be decided, according to Villafranca, is whether the leaders would call for the curbing or elimination of the incentives that support the use of fossil fuels in the G20 countries. This decision will be significant since the G20 member states account for around 80 percent of the world's primary energy use, according to an ISPI report. If the leaders agree to reduce fossil fuel incentives it would also provide a boost to climate negotiations ahead of the COP26 climate negotiations, which get underway just as the G20 Leaders' Summit closes. But according to Raffaele Marchetti, an international relations professor at Rome's LUISS University, the effectiveness of the G20 should not be measured by its ability to make decisions. ""The correct way to look at the G20 is as a forum for conversations between global leaders on important topics,"" Marchetti told Xinhua. ""It's not necessarily a body for making major decisions. But those decisions can emerge from the discussions in the G20 context."" ""Other forums like the United Nations or the World Health Organization or the World Trade Organization are too large to be focused, and the G7 (Group of Seven) is too narrow and too dominated by western countries,"" Marchetti said. ""But the G20 includes eastern and western powers alike. In most areas, it's the best forum where the major powers -- the United States, China and the European Union -- are all involved.""

Do you have any comment on this?Wang Wenbin: Developed countries shoulder major responsibilities for climate change and historical emissions. It is not only their moral duty but also bound obligation under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement to provide funding and help developing countries to deal with climate change. The 16th G20 Leaders' Summit adopted the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration. It recalled and reaffirmed the commitment made by developed countries to the goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion per year by 2020 and annually through 2025 to address the needs of developing countries and stressed the importance of meeting that goal fully as soon as possible.Funding is key to addressing climate change. It is developing countries' major concern that developed countries honor their funding commitment. At the Copenhagen and Cancun conferences, developed countries pledged to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020. The Paris Agreement stipulated that developed countries should continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance for developing countries. However, for more than a decade, developed countries have never truly delivered on their commitment. According to a recent report released by a well-known international think tank, developed countries' annual funding fell short of the target. There are also problems like overreporting through inflated numbers or deliberate miscounting. Some countries even try to list green investment in the private sector and conventional infrastructure projects unrelated to climate change as official climate finance. The effective amount they actually provided is much lower than the official data. In particular, the US only paid less than 20 percent of its due share while Australia and Canada paid less than half.China sets great store by efforts to address climate change. As the largest developing country, China has overcome its own economic and social difficulties to resolutely follow a path of green and low-carbon development, implement the national strategy of actively addressing climate change, scale up its climate actions, and strengthen goals of Nationally Determined Contribution. We have been speeding up efforts to put in place a ""1+N"" policy framework for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, making coordinated efforts to reduce pollution and carbon emissions and exploring new models of low-carbon development. In this process, China has made tangible contributions to global climate governance and the fight against climate change. In the meantime, China has allocated about 1.1 billion yuan for South-South cooperation on climate change in recent years, donated energy conservation and new energy products and devices to almost 40 countries, helped relevant countries to launch meteorological satellites, and trained nearly 1,500 officials and technical personnel working in the climate response sector of 120 developing countries, and done our best to provide assistance and support to fellow developing countries under the framework of South-South cooperation on climate change.In the face of climate change, a common challenge for mankind and an unprecedented difficulty in global climate governance, the international community should take on its responsibility and make concerted efforts to seek harmonious coexistence of man and Nature. With COP26 underway, developed countries should demonstrate good faith in combating climate change, and take bolder actions to improve the quality of the $100 billion per year climate finance that they pledged to provide to developing countries, and contribute their fair share to the fight against climate change and global climate governance.MASTV: US President Biden apologized at COP26 for the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, saying it has put the country behind. Biden also called for strong actions to deal with climate change and urged major economies to honor their commitment. Does the Chinese side have any comment?Wang Wenbin: As the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in cumulative terms, the US should face up to its historical responsibilities, maintain policy consistency, show greater ambition and actions, take the lead in fulfilling obligations of substantial emissions reduction, and provide financial, technological and capacity building support to help developing countries enhance their capacity to respond to climate challenges. Rhetoric can not substitute for actions. We hope that the US can publish its action plan and roadmap for cutting carbon emissions by half before 2030 and ensure that there will be no reversal or retrogression of its climate policies in the future.AFP: US President Biden said at COP26 that it is ""a gigantic issue"" and China just ""walked away"", referring to addressing climate change. Does the foreign ministry have a response to this?Wang Wenbin: Tackling climate change requires concrete action, not empty words. China's actions on climate change are real. China adds about 12,000 hectares of forest area and 90,000 kW of installed photovoltaic capacity on average per day. We are building a batch of large-scale wind and PV projects with a total size of nearly 30 million kW.Successful governance relies on solid action and actions speak louder than words. China and the US made joint efforts to promote the conclusion of the Paris Agreement, but later the US withdrawal disrupted global climate governance and the full and effective implementation of the agreement. The Chinese side welcomed the return of the US with a constructive attitude together with the international community. We hope that the US side will earnestly shoulder its due responsibilities, come up with and implement specific policies and measures on emissions reduction as soon as possible, honor its funding commitments, and stop chopping and changing all the time.NHK: Australia and New Zealand have reportedly completed ratification procedures of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which has paved the way for RCEP to enter into force. It seems the pact is set to take effect on 1 January 2022. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant reports. At the recent leaders' meetings on East Asia cooperation, China joined relevant parties in calling for efforts to promote the early entry into force of the RCEP. Under the current circumstances, China is ready to work with all parties to push for the early entry into force and implementation of the RCEP to yield dividends as soon as possible, and promote regional economic integration and long-term prosperity and stability.China News Service: Joerg Wuttke, President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said the turnover and profits of member companies of the European Chamber hit new highs in 2020. EU companies are ready to make greater contributions to the high-quality development of the Chinese economy. Do you have any response?Wang Wenbin: I noted relevant reports. In the face of continuous spreading of COVID-19 and global economic recession, China has made coordinated efforts to promote economic and social development while putting in place epidemic control, and continued to establish a new system for higher-level open economy, and focused on building a market-oriented business environment based on rule of law and up to international standard to provide strong guarantee for companies operating in China. The record highs in the turnover and profits of member companies of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China are an epitome of the vitality of the Chinese economy and the positive effects of China's endeavor to deepen opening-up and optimizing business environment. The reports released by the chamber of commerce from the US, the EU and Japan indicate that nearly two thirds of American companies, 59 percent of EU companies and 36.6 percent of Japanese companies plan to expand their investment in China.I want to stress that China and the EU are two major independent forces in the world and each other's comprehensive strategic partner. China-EU cooperation, complementary, mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. Last year, China became the EU's largest trading partner. In the first three quarters of this year, two-way trade reached $599.3 billion, up 30.4 percent year on year. China attaches high importance to China-EU relations. We will continue to improve business environment for foreign companies, including those from the EU. We also stand ready to work with the EU side to advance connectivity, seek greater strategic synergy, boost global economic recovery and contribute to addressing global challenges.AFP: Could you tell us why China decided not to join the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions announced at yesterday?Wang Wenbin: China attaches high importance to the control of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases. The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development explicitly stated that we will increase efforts to control methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and other greenhouse gases. Relevant departments are formulating and implementing policies and measures in the fields of industry, agriculture and waste disposal. China is ready to work with other parties to advance global cooperation on reducing non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases.That being said, when setting ambitious targets, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that developing countries generally have weak basic data and lack monitoring technologies and effective measures to control non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases.Beijing Daily: We noticed that the website of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recently cited the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration in which leaders expressed their support for the upcoming Games in Beijing. IOC President Thomas Bach thanked the leaders for their support and said: ""The IOC warmly welcomes the recognition and support of the G20 Leaders' Summit for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022."" Do you have a comment on this?Wang Wenbin: The Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games is a grand gathering for athletes across the world and a symbol of solidarity and friendship. The event has recently received good wishes and support of the IOC and many countries.The IOC, International Sports Federations and athletes from many countries have all spoken highly of the organization of test matches and stadiums and venues. Dignitaries and Olympic committee officials from countries including Austria, France, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Swiss, Russia and Belarus said they support and will attend the Beijing Winter Olympics. The China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers' Meeting also expressed support for the Games in a joint statement.China will continue to follow a green, inclusive, open and clean approach to preparing and hosting the Games, demonstrate the Olympic spirit of ""together"" with the IOC and countries around the world, host an impressive and memorable Olympic gathering, and make new contributions to the promotion of winter sports and the international Olympic cause.Prasar Bharati: Chambers of commerce from America and Australia have reported that local government authorities in Beijing and a few other Chinese cities are now issuing PU letters for the dependent family members of qualified foreign workers so that employees can relocate to China together with their family members. Can you confirm this? And will this benefit India?Wang Wenbin: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has been providing visa facilitation to foreign nationals who are traveling to China for essential economic, trade, technological and emergency humanitarian purposes. Going forward, we will adjust relevant measures at appropriate points in light of the evolving COVID-19 situation on the basis of effective prevention of imported cases to actively foster a new arrangement for healthy, safe and orderly personnel exchange.China Review News: We've noticed several cases where students and visiting fellows to the US were repatriated. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: Recently we have seen frequent incidents of unwarranted harassment and suppression targeting Chinese students and visiting fellows to the US. Just the other day, a Chinese visiting scholar holding valid visa issued by the US government was repatriated after being interrogated without cause upon entry. According to incomplete statistics, in August 2021 alone, nearly 30 Chinese students and visiting fellows to the US suffered similar unjust treatment, with many more reporting rough handling during harassment, interrogation and search.Many of them were asked questions like if they or their parents are members of the Communist Party of China, and if they had been assigned any task by the Chinese government prior to their departure. Some of the reasons for repatriation are simply inconceivable. For example, photos of college military training in personal cellphones were enough to warrant suspicion of a military background. Such interrogation and search went far beyond the ""normal law enforcement"" scope the US side claims.While claiming to welcome Chinese students, the US side has inherited the poisonous legacy of the previous administration. Some law enforcement departments and agents continue to recklessly stretch the concept of ""national security"" to wantonly harass Chinese students and scholars in an attempt to produce a chilling effect among Chinese personnel pursuing studies in the US. Such practices deviate from the mutually beneficial and win-win nature of China-US people-to-people and cultural exchanges. They seriously hurt the amicable feelings between the two peoples, undermine mutual trust and cooperation, jeopardize the steady and healthy development of bilateral relations, and also run counter to the US leader's statement that the US has no intention of starting a ""new Cold War"" with China.We urge the US to stop such practices that harm others without benefiting itself and create enabling atmosphere and provide necessary conditions for China-US people-to-people and cultural exchange as well as education cooperation. China will resolutely safeguard the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese personnel pursuing studies in the US.\l"

""The floods in South Sudan are a timely reminder for urgent action on climate change, in view also of the COP26 conference: The effects of climate change are real, and they are here -- and vulnerable populations suffer the repercussions,"" EC commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic said in a statement. The EC said an estimated 40 people have died and over 750,000 people are affected by the flooding in South Sudan, adding that many people had to flee their homes due to the floods in 31 of the 78 counties of the country, including most famine-affected areas. Lenarcic said severe flooding in several areas of South Sudan has exacerbated an already fragile humanitarian situation. ""Prior to the flooding, around 70 percent of South Sudan's population was already in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Thousands of people live in famine-like conditions, and undernutrition is at critical levels. The emergency funding will be used to respond to the immediate needs of those affected,"" he added. The emergency humanitarian funding will be used to provide vulnerable populations with life-saving water and sanitation (WASH), shelter and other essential non-food items. The recent floods primarily affect four states in South Sudan while in some areas, communities have not seen flooding to this extent since 1962. Enditem\l"

With help from the Jiangmen municipal government, which provided them with housing support and a 200 square metre greenhouse free of charge to conduct their scientific research, they set up their base at the city's National Agricultural Science and Technology Park in 2016. They spent three years on research and development to combine fish and plant production, a circular approach to farming known as aquaponics, Lo said. They developed a circular system which allows organic matter in the water from fish farming, including manure, to be decomposed into nutrients that can be absorbed by vegetables. After the organic matter is absorbed from the water by the vegetables, the clean water goes back into the fish tank. The circular system does not generate any waste water and eliminates the need for chemical fertilisers. Fertiliser production is a carbon intensive process. The supply chain of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, commonly used in conventional agriculture to boost productivity, was responsible for estimated emissions of 1.25 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018, according to a report from US think tank the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Greenpeace International and non-profit international organisation Grain in November. Agriculture and food production accounted for about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, or 16.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, according to a report by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation released at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. ""In traditional ways of growing vegetables, it is a common practice to use chemical fertilisers. But we use water that is used to grow fish as the 'fertiliser' for our vegetables, which is completely organic,"" said Lo.

It generated the whole time, it was clean, the price didn\' t change. If the case for nuclear power wasn\' t already strong, it\' s a lot stronger now. The goal, as articulated by the chairman of the state-backed China General Nuclear Power Corp., is to generate 200 gigawatts by 2035, enough to power more than a dozen cities the size of Beijing. Furthermore, China says its plans\~could prevent about 1.5 billion tons of annual carbon emissions, more than what\' s generated by the UK, Spain, France and Germany combined.

Hinkley is expected to produce enough power to supply 6 million homes.The investment is intended to fund the project up to the stage where the reactor design receives approval. No decision has yet been made on how the construction cost will be financed.At an expected ultimate cost of around \£32bn each, they should cost less than a tenth of the \£320bn each of Hinkley and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Industry sources say they hope that these SMRs would be operational within a decade.The\~ HYPERLINK https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrsInternational Atomic Energy Authority\~says that  prefabricated units of SMRs can be manufactured and then shipped and installed on-site, making them more affordable to build than large power reactors, which are often custom designed for a particular location, sometimes leading to construction delays.  SMRs offer savings in cost and construction time, and they can be deployed incrementally to match increasing energy demand. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to  cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people\' s homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further.

The target, announced by China\' s economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), comes as the world\' s top climate negotiators have gathered in Scotland for the COP26 climate talks. Average coal use for electricity generation in China fell by about 17.4 percent in the 15 years till 2020. By 2025, coal-fired power plants in China must adjust their consumption rate to an average of 300 grams of standard coal per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the NDRC said Wednesday. That compares with 305.5 grams per kWh in 2020.  Further promoting the energy saving and consumption reduction at coal-fired power units is an effective means to improve energy efficiency and is of great significance for achieving carbon emission peak in the power industry, the NDRC said. China has vowed to bring its carbon emissions to a peak before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Last week, China published a roadmap on the peak carbon target, aiming to reduce waste, promote renewables and unconventional fuel as well as reform its electricity network. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the power generation and heating sectors account for more than 40 percent of total CO2 emissions in China. Average coal use for power generation in China is down now compared with 370 grams per kWh in 2005.  The reduction of coal use helped to cut 6.67 billion tons of CO2 emissions from the power sector in 2006-2020, or 36 percent of total emission reductions in the industry, the NDRC said. The NDRC is in charge of crafting policies on economic development for the country, with plans and orders issued by the agency expected to be carried out by local and regional authorities.

But they also warned that partisan politics and polarization in the US may affect the consistency of US pledges to cooperate, urging the US to be sincere, and keep its political tricks out of the constructive interactions of the two countries.\~But they also warned that partisan politics and polarization in the US may affect the consistency of US pledges to cooperate,Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the 28th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing by video link on Friday and deliver an important speech along with other world leaders, including US President Joe Biden. On Thursday, Xi attended the APEC CEO Summit through a prerecorded video and delivered a keynote speech, in which he stressed China's pledge to continue opening up and reach carbon neutrality.\~ Highlighting China's commitment to advance reform and opening-up to add impetus to economic development in the Asia-Pacific, Xi said the country will continue to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, promote all-round opening-up of its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, expand the opening of the service sector, and treat domestic and foreign businesses as equals in accordance with law.A day before Xi's speech at the APEC CEO Summit, China and the US on Wednesday released the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which included setting up a working group and reducing methane and CO2 emissions. The two sides said they appreciated the work done so far and pledged to continue working together and with all parties to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement. On the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as taking into account national conditions, enhanced climate action will be taken to effectively address the climate crisis.The declaration is the product of candid exchanges, mutual understanding and efforts to expand consensus, which once again showed China and the US can work together on major international issues and accomplish great things that benefit the people of both countries and the world, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at Thursday's media briefing.\~China is ready to work with the US to deepen dialogue and cooperation on climate change, inject positive energy to the multilateral process and promote a fair, win-win cooperation on the global climate system, Wang said.\~Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change, said on the release of the declaration that it once again shows that China-US cooperation is the only right choice, and that China and the US have more consensus than differences on climate change.Yang Fuqiang, a research fellow at Peking University's Research Institute for Energy, told the Global Times the declaration could play a positive role not only for developed countries but also developing countries, with more cooperation in technologies such as reducing emissions of methane to be expected.\~Compared to the serious commitment made by the Chinese government in achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement, there are many uncertainties in US politics, analysts said. For instance, if a Republican President is elected again, how can the US government guarantee they won't withdraw from the climate change commitment, given there has not been a strong public consensus in the US in support of climate actions compared to that of Europe?

China, the world's largest producer of hydrogen, has been stepping up efforts to transition to cleaner fuels under its net-zero emissions goal by 2060. It has prioritised hydrogen as an emerging industry under the 14th five-year plan. The output value for hydrogen in China could reach 1 trillion yuan (US$157 billion) by 2025, according to China Hydrogen Energy and Fuel Cell Industry Alliance. By 2030, demand for hydrogen will reach 35 million tonnes, and the fuel will make up at least 5 per cent of the energy-consumption mix by then, it added. Green hydrogen is produced using low or zero-carbon energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro or nuclear. Blue hydrogen indicates production using fossil fuels with carbon capture or storage, while grey hydrogen is based on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. The fuel was featured at the UN Climate Conference HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/cop26COP26 in Glasgow last quarter to raise awareness on decarbonisation in high-emission industries like power generation, mining and long-haul transport such as aviation. It remains too expensive currently to commercialise green hydrogen as cost, infrastructure and policy hurdles remain challenging, according to Winnie Fan, managing director of sustainable finance at Bank of China (Hong Kong). Bringing down the cost of green hydrogen depends on technological innovation, such as sufficient and cost-effective supply of renewable electricity, as well as storage and transportation technologies, Fan said at the virtual forum.

""The market is still in the early stage"" of progress, she added. Around two-thirds of China's supply of hydrogen comes from coal gasification, not green hydrogen. To scale up, the industry would require state support in the form of favourable policies and funding, according to Chen of Shell Hydrogen. ""Government subsidies and other forms of support over the whole supply chain will be a good incentive to saturate the pace of development of the hydrogen industry,"" he added. Although there has not been a nationwide regulation on hydrogen, some provincial governments have drafted their own blueprints to develop local industries, led by Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai.

Overseen by former Bank of England supremo Mark Carney, the banks and other financial institutions signing up to https://www.gfanzero.com/Gfanz (the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero) are pledging to report annually on the carbon emissions linked to the projects they lend to.They are also aiming to provide trillions of dollars in green finance, while committing to net zero emissions across the board by 2050. HYPERLINK Major signatories to the initiative, which was originally unveiled HYPERLINK https://racetozero.unfccc.int/net-zero-financial-alliance-launches/in April, include Citi, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America.While it\' s very encouraging to see many of the world\' s leading banks committing to sustainable lending, it\' s hard not to feel apprehensive. It certainly isn\' t the first opportunity that they have had to decarbonize their loan books, and so far the results have not been impressive.In 2019, the UN General Assembly exuberantly launched its HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/principles of responsible banking (PRBs) with similar goals in mind. The banks that signed up agreed, among other things, to  work with their clients to encourage sustainable practices and to  align their business strategy to the HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goalsUN sustainable development goals HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreementParis Climate Agreement HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5So far, many of the biggest banks in the world have not signed the PRBs, even though the principles have been the gold standard until now for committing to decarbonizing lending. Leading signatories are also a long way from satisfying their requirements \- not to mention those of Gfanz.Greening financeBanks can contribute to solving the climate crisis from two angles: their lending and their investments. On the investment side, we saw a tipping point in 2020 when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, HYPERLINK https://ukinvestormagazine.co.uk/blackrock-to-focus-on-esg-and-climate-change-in-2020/announced that it would concentrate its investments on securities that were focused on sustainability.Lending is still in the nascent stages of its green transition, however. And since it is well accepted that it makes up the majority of corporate finance, this area is make or break for decarbonizing the industry. HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/prbsignatories/Well over 200 international banks have signed the principles of responsible banking in the past two years, but, many of the biggest banks are not among them. Of the HYPERLINK https://www.advratings.com/banking/worlds-top-banks-by-market-captop ten banks (by market capitalization), only Citi, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China are signatories. A further six \- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, China Construction Bank, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and China Merchants Bank \- are not on the list.I should stress that being a signatory to the PRBs is a limited commitment. Signatories have four years to comply with the principles. Even then, everything is voluntary and non-binding, so signatories are not penalized or even named and shamed for failing to live up to the principles.To get a sense of the status quo, HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5I looked at the lending practices of three major signatory banks \- Citi, ICBC and Japan\' s MUFG \- for the years 2016-19. This covers the period directly after the Paris Agreement to the year the PRBs were signed. You might have expected banks that were serious about their commitments to have been cutting back on carbon-heavy lending in this period.I focused on banks\' lending to fossil fuels extraction, because data is readily available and because this is very much the top of the pyramid when it comes to carbon emissions. I also compared three other major banks that are not signatories to the PRBs: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC.I found that Wells Fargo and JP Morgan were the world\' s largest financiers of such companies during that period (though Wells Fargo dropped to third HYPERLINK in 2020). Neither signed the PRBs, though both are now members of Gfanz. Both state in their annual reports that they are committed to the Paris climate agreement. Both did reduce their total fossil fuels lending each year from 2018 to 2020, by 57% and 23% respectively. Citi, meanwhile, was the third-biggest fossil fuel lender in 2016-19 despite being a signatory to the PRBs (and Gfanz), and reached second place in 2020. And MUFG and ICBC, who are also signatories to the PRBs, both grew their fossil-fuel lending over the period. MUFG is also a Gfanz member, though neither ICBC nor any of the other Chinese banks are part of the new initiative. Also note that HSBC was not a major lender to fossil fuel projects despite not being a signatory to the PRBs (though it too has signed up to Gfanz).Six banks and fossil-fuel finance 2016-19From this, I see no discernible sign that the PRBs have so far made any difference to lending in this area. Despite the roar at the UN General Assembly, my worry is that this tiger is proving toothless \- and there is reason to fear that Gfanz will go the same way.The way forwardWhen signatories to the PRBs are lending money, they are supposed to carry out environmental impact assessments and to measure the greenhouse gas emissions of projects. This is not a minor issue considering that such work is beyond the traditional competencies of banks and will significantly affect their operational costs.Signatories are also supposed to ensure that loans go to projects that are carbon neutral. This means that borrowers have to commit to mitigation actions that last for the whole life-cycle of the project. It is part of each signatory\' s obligation to ensure that such mitigation actions are carried out, by monitoring the project throughout its duration.Yet the suspicion is that very little of this is happening on the ground at present. To change this, we would probably need to move to a scheme by which the PRBs are compulsory and binding.Unfortunately, Gfanz does not look like that scheme. Though the annual reporting requirements on carbon emissions are a step forward, nothing in the initiative is mandatory either. It was HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/9105cc47-58fb-47dc-8233-6b622fb56ae2also criticized in the weeks leading up to COP26 because the members refused to agree to end lending to fossil fuel projects this year. Instead, they aim to halve their carbon emissions in a decade.My own view is that it wouldn\' t make sense to abruptly forbid lending to non-green projects now since we need to avoid hitting hardest the banks that are traditionally most involved in carbon-heavy sectors. Instead, loan books need to be treated as a portfolio of projects in different tones of green, with a defined trajectory towards greener \- but it needs to be mandatory for signatories.It\' s a pity that Mark Carney and other banking leaders did not work towards strengthening the PRBs rather than come up with yet another initiative. I also worry that Gfanz muddies the waters by combining investing and lending rather than focusing purely on lending. We don\' t need more roaring; we need a tiger that actually has some teeth.We invited the banks referred to in the article to comment on their lending activities in this area. MUFG sent us links to its carbon neutrality declaration and environmental and social policy framework.

Temperatures in Moscow earlier hit a record high, after a winter that saw extreme lows hit North America and topple the power grid in Texas.The extreme weather provided the backdrop to the Aug 9 launch of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the most extensive so far from the United Nations agency.The report said humanity's damaging impact on the global climate was now an established fact, and warned that continuing emissions of greenhouse gases could force sea levels to rise by up to two meters by the end of the century.The authors said that global surface temperatures had risen faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years. They also concluded that some of the changes to planetary climate systems were already irreversible.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the findings as a code red for humanity and showed there was no time for delay to avert a climate catastrophe.The report will put further pressure on delegates to the international COP26 climate talks that the UK government will be hosting in Glasgow in November. Alok Sharma, the UK minister in charge of the event, has warned that the failure of the talks would be catastrophic.""You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world,"" Sharma said. ""Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.""Climate scientists are always cautious about linking any single extreme weather event to global warming and focus on tracking trends.However, this year's series of catastrophic events may reinforce the impact of the latest warnings on the public consciousness and could increase popular pressure on governments to boost active measures.The latest evidence of man-made climate change may also dent the influence of so-called climate skeptics, who continue to deny the link between greenhouse gases and extreme weather events.A recent study from the University of Oregon in the US found that committed climate change deniers were unlikely to change their minds on the basis of the latest evidence. However, moderate skeptics were highly likely to change their beliefs once given more evidence of recorded temperature change.The report's author, Grant McDermott, said one implication of the findings was that ""if you're trying to think about who to target with messaging to persuade people that climate change is a real and observable phenomenon, you should just accept that some people you're just not going to convince"".A 2019 poll showed that the US, a leading polluter, has by far the largest population of climate change skeptics, with 15 percent of people believing either that the climate is not changing at all, or that it is not changing due to human causes.It was a skepticism reflected by former US president Donald Trump, who abandoned US support for international efforts to fight climate change. Under his successor, Joe Biden, the US plans to take a more active role at COP26. US delegate John Kerry has urged all countries to step up and do their part.Despite outstanding diplomatic issues between the US and China, the world's top carbon emitters, the climate lobby is hoping to see progress between the two at the Glasgow talks.When President Xi Jinping announced at the UN last year that China planned to cap its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, the initiative was described as monumental.Beijing's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said this month that China would soon release updated plans to reduce carbon emissions ahead of the COP26.Climate negotiators from 196 countries, plus the European Union, will join business leaders, climate experts and world leaders at the Glasgow conference.Their task, after a year of climate extremes, will be to confront a challenge that COP26's UK host Sharma believes may be the last chance to save the planet.Harvey Morris is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK.

But that has not stopped criticism of the country's role in global deforestation. China's commercial supply chains lean heavily on so-called forest-risk commodities, or agribusiness materials such as palm oil, soy beans and beef cattle, which involve forest destruction, Rod Taylor, global director of the forests programme at the World Resources Institute, said in an interview on Monday. ""There is a good chance that you are causing problems unless you're doing the due diligence,"" said Taylor. ""It's both on the financing and the sourcing of commodities ... so you can say exactly where this is coming from and whether or not it is linked to deforestation.""

Taylor, however, said improvement in China's domestic environmental policies now needed to be extended across its own borders. ""We've seen some encouraging signals that they want to extend the concept of ecological civilisation ... there seems to be some kind of political will to extend that up internationally,"" he said. A report published in June by eco-watchdog Global Witness said China is the world's second-largest financier of deforestation after Japan, because it funds the production of forest-risk commodities. Citing data from the research and campaign group Forests and Finance, Global Witness said that between January 2013 to April 2020, Chinese banks and investors provided over US$22.5 billion to major businesses that produce ""some of the worst offenders"" in products driving deforestation in Brazil, Indonesia and elsewhere. According to the watchdog, Brazil, Malaysia, the United States, Indonesia and Japan are ranked above China in financing forest destruction. But because the top four countries produce these forest-risk commodities rather than simply import them, the study did not include them on the list. The report suggested that the lack of government oversight on investment clashes with China's aims to be a leader in sustainable finance, with President HYPERLINK Xi Jinping's ""bold commitment"" to become HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/chinas-carbon-neutral-goalcarbon neutral by 2060 HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3152542/cop15-biodiversity-summit-china-ends-un-hailing-renewed-optimismUnited Nations Summit on Biodiversity in October. ""China needs to put its money where its mouth is by ensuring that Chinese banks are not financing agribusiness that fuels deforestation, the climate crisis and biodiversity loss,"" said Beibei Yin, senior forests campaigner at Global Witness, while unveiling the report. China has had success in reducing deforestation within its borders. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation found in the latest Global Forest Resources Assessment that China ranks first among the top 10 countries that added forest cover in the last decade. A separate report by Boston University in February said China's forest cover had increased to 220 million hectares in 2020 from 157 million hectares in 1990. Similarly, figures from China's National Greening Commission in March indicate that over the past year alone, China planted 6.77 million hectares of forest as the forestry industry reached a total output value of 7.55 trillion yuan (US$1.18 trillion). However, China's increase in forest cover has coupled with its increasingly outsourced supply chain for agricultural products. The country's supply chain was the focus of this year's special policy study for the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. This study said China is the ""core of global value chains"" as the world's largest exporter and second largest importer. The research group said ""greening"" value chains, or making them more environmentally friendly, also aligns closely with China's ""six stabilities and six securities"" policy, which includes supply chain security. Zhang Daqian, the international head of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, said in an interview on Tuesday that one obstacle is a perception that action on overseas deforestation or HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change was cowing to Western interests. Some of the trending articles about COP26 on China's Weibo and WeChat social media platforms ridicule or attack US President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/people/joe-biden/newsJoe Biden, including for using a private jet or his ""sleepy"" disposition. ""They are not interested in forests or natural solutions, they are more interested in how to let the developed countries pay,"" Zhang said. ""We need to explain to them that we are not doing this because Western countries want to, but because as a part of humanity, we need to do so.

Date output 'as-is'. GMT","Xinhua General News Service","NAIROBI, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the European Commission on Sunday launched an observatory to reduce emission of methane gas into the atmosphere. UNEP said in a statement issued on the eve of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow that the launch of International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) marked a significant milestone in efforts to green the planet. Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, said that cutting down on methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry will help avert the worst impacts of climate change to livelihoods and vital ecosystems. ""Methane reductions must go hand in hand with actions to decarbonize the energy system to limit warming to 1.5 degree centigrade, as called for in the Paris Agreement,"" said Andersen. According to UNEP, methane emission is responsible for about one quarter of the current global warming and when the gas is directly released into the atmosphere, it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time horizon. Nevertheless, since methane's atmospheric lifespan is relatively short, robust measures to cut its emission would yield immediate results in terms of halting global warming and delivering air quality, says UNEP. The launch of the observatory will help improve accuracy and transparency in reporting the magnitude of its release into the atmosphere and the impact on global warming. At the initial stages, the observatory will focus on methane emissions from the fossil fuel sector and later expand to cover agriculture and waste sectors, according to UNEP. The observatory is expected to produce verified and accurate data on methane emissions in the fossil fuel sector to help inform mitigation efforts by governments and industry. Hosted by UNEP, the International Methane Emissions Observatory will operate on a 100 million euros (about 115.6 million U.S. dollars) budget over five years, but it will not receive industry funding in order to maintain its impartiality.

The ""Global Risks Report 2022"" warns that five of the top 10 global risks are environment-related, including climate action failure, extreme weather and biodiversity loss. Meanwhile, the main short-term global concerns include the erosion of social cohesion, livelihood crises and infectious diseases. ""We've seen what can happen when there is public-private collaboration, when we put our faith in science and technology, and when there is global coordination. The result of that was developing a vaccine for COVID-19,"" Saadia Zahidi, the WEF's managing director, told Xinhua in a virtual interview following the release. ""Now, if we can do that for one specific and very urgent area, we can do the same thing for other areas that require urgent attention, and that includes climate change. There are a number of technologies that are now available; it's really about making that green transition."" Now in its 17th edition, the latest annual report from the Geneva-based forum urges leaders to adopt a coordinated, multi-stakeholder response, and create policies that manage risks and resolve systemic issues. ""Half of the world is still not vaccinated, and half of the world still does not have access to the internet,"" Zahidi stressed. ""We're seeing a rising divergence between the developing world and the developed world. ""It's really about working out who has the best possible models that help governments move out of a constant focus on the emergency situation, towards building recovery and investing in resilience."" ""That is where I think the experiences of economies and pulling together the economic, social and green agendas closer together. That's where the proof point is going to lie. And those are the models that the rest of the world have to emulate,"" she added. UNEVEN RECOVERY The report, which has been developed with the WEF's strategic partners Marsh McLennan, SK Group and Zurich Insurance Group, also warns that global economic recovery from COVID-19 will be uneven and potentially volatile in the coming years. A global survey of experts found that only 1 in 6 is optimistic, and only 1 in 10 believes that global recovery will accelerate. The economic fallout of the pandemic and diverging levels of recovery also continue to threaten cooperation on other global challenges, at a time when climate and environmental risks loom large, the report emphasizes. Zahidi added: ""China is amongst the very positive growth stories that we've seen in the world in the last 30 years, with people coming out of poverty, having new economic opportunities, and now seeing how China manages this transition, this economic and green and technological transition that is underway. That's going to provide a role model to others."" Zurich Insurance Group's chief risk officer Peter Giger says in the report: ""The climate crisis remains the biggest long-term threat facing humanity. Failure to act on climate change could shrink global GDP by one-sixth, and the commitments taken at COP26 are still not enough to achieve the 1.5 C goal."" ""It is not too late for governments and businesses to act on the risks they face and to drive an innovative, determined and inclusive transition that protects economies and people."" BUILDING COALITIONS Last month, the WEF announced that due to continued concerns over Omicron it will defer its annual meeting, which is usually held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.

Topping made the remarks during an exclusive interview with Xinhua after attending the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). At the general debate of the UNGA, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. China's pledge regarding coal-fired power projects is indeed a big news item from the UN meeting, said Topping. ""One of the ideas which come from China, which is the most exciting, is this idea of ecological civilization which, for me in two words, sums up what we're trying to build together,"" Topping said. ""Ever since I heard the term 'ecological civilization', I was like 'yes', that's what we're all trying to build, that's what we have to build,"" he stressed. ""Because if we don't build an ecological civilization, actually we continue to undermine the ecological foundations of our civilization."" The British government appointed Topping in January 2020 as host of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. His tasks include driving actions from businesses, investors, organizations, cities, and regions on climate change and coordinating this work with governments and parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""I think we have a very strong sense of the need to recognize that the economy is embedded in the ecology. It's not the other way around,"" he said, noting that the economy must be in service of ecology and society, not vice versa, and that is the ""right relationship."" Topping, with nearly two decades of experience working in the private sector, said ""there's a lot of great work being done in greening the financial system in China."" ""The countries in the world which have the resources to invest overseas have a real responsibility to come together and make sure that that's really driving towards ecological civilization,"" he added. ""Building on that, no coal finance, how do we really accelerate green finance everywhere in the world. There are a few areas I think for really strong collaboration."" The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) will be convened in two parts this year and next year in Kunming, Yunnan Province, while the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) will take place in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year. The two important events were like ""brother and sister,"" Topping said. ""My expectation is that these two COPs prove to be a turning point towards a decade of action."" ""We don't need to debate the problem anymore. We actually don't need to debate the goal. The goal is an ecological civilization, a regenerative civilization. Heal ecosystems, restore our lakes and rivers, restore the climate,"" he said. Enditem\l"

However, when it comes to the use of fossil fuels - the lifeblood of the tourism industry for many Asian countries - Indonesians and Filipinos are much less keen to see them phased out than Spaniards and Britons. The findings come from a global survey of more than 76,000 active monthly Facebook users in 31 countries and territories, and could offer insights for the global delegates who are currently meeting at COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland, to discuss how they will cut greenhouse gas emissions and try to mitigate the climate emergency. The survey was conducted by the Yale Programme on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeClimate Change Communication in partnership with Facebook Data for Good - a team of ""humanitarian experts"", according to the social media giant - in February and March this year.

Survey respondents were aged 18 and older and included, in Asia, those from India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The survey found that although the overwhelming majority of people around the world believe that climate change is happening, fewer realise it is caused mostly by human activities. It also exposes geographical imbalances in knowledge - the majority of respondents in Australia (78 per cent) and Germany (77 per cent) claimed to know ""a lot"" or ""a moderate amount"" about climate change, but 28 per cent of those in Nigeria and 20 per cent in Malaysia said they had never even heard of climate change. Although 64 per cent of respondents in Spain and 60 per cent in Italy thought that climate change was mostly caused by human activities, only 16 per cent in Indonesia did so. Across Asia, at least 80 per cent of those surveyed in each country wanted more information about climate change. About 90 per cent support their country's participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, a legally binding treaty adopted in 2015 to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees, above pre-industrial levels. On Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived at COP26 and suggested that the climate summit is at serious risk of failure because countries are still not promising enough action to restrict global temperature rises to below 1.5 degrees. Delegates and world leaders would do well to note that more than half of people surveyed by Facebook expressed fears over climate change. In Asia, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/3153373/cop26-how-climate-crisis-could-affect-tourism-and-asianwhere the effects of severe weather events are often felt keenly, between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of respondents said they were ""somewhat worried"" or ""very worried"" about climate change. Ninety per cent of Japanese people expressed such concerns. At least 60 per cent of people in each surveyed country across the continent said the issue should be a top priority for their government and that their leaders should take action to address climate change. Vietnamese respondents (80 per cent) felt most strongly about this. However, when it comes to fossil fuels - the burning of which accounts for most of the world's carbon emissions - significant numbers of respondents in the Philippines (47 per cent), India (39 per cent) and Indonesia (37 per cent) said they believed their countries should actually be using ""somewhat more"" or ""much more"". Nevertheless, the vast majority of people support a shift to renewable energy in their country. Most respondents thought that action on climate change would have a positive impact on their country's economy, bringing growth and more employment opportunities. People in the Philippines are the most convinced, with 76 per cent - more than in any other surveyed country - believing that efforts to slow climate change would also bring economic benefits. To support the public in their search for more information on this issue, Facebook has launched the Climate Science Centre, a collection of factual resources from the world's leading climate organisations. From November 2, the centre has been expanded to cover more than 100 countries, including 39 in Asia, with a new section keeping track of national greenhouse gas emissions and comparing them with stated commitments and targets, so people can better understand how their country is performing and what more needs to be done.

The riot against an orderly transition of presidential power is seen as one of the most far-reaching domestic extreme events in U.S. history. Bloodshed and violence at the landmark of American politics stunned the world, exposing huge social disparities and breaking the fantasy of the ""American-style democracy,"" which has long been used as an instrument by U.S. politicians to manipulate public opinion and maximize their own interests. Suez Canal blockage exposes fragility of world economy On March 23, a large container ship ran aground at the Suez Canal and blocked the waterway. The flow of about 12 percent of world trade volume came to a halt. The fragility of the world economy was exposed this year. Bottlenecks on logistics and soaring freight rates disrupted global supply chains, and industrial chains were hit by chip shortages and rising commodity prices. Heavier debt, combined with an influx of liquidity, exacerbated the volatility of financial markets. The economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was unbalanced. The gap between the rich and the poor widened, and so did the huge development gap. In the face of the profound impacts of COVID-19 and headwinds in economic globalization, all countries should step up macro policy coordination with major economies shouldering greater responsibility for better global economic governance. World again keen on space exploration On May 15, China's probe Tianwen-1 touched down on Mars, marking a pivotal step in China's space exploration. Earlier in February, the Hope Probe of the United Arab Emirates and NASA's Perseverance rover entered the orbit of the red planet. The three visitors set off a new upsurge of Mars research. In April, China sent into space the core module Tianhe of its space station, kicking off a series of key launch missions to complete the station's construction. In June and October, two batches of Chinese taikonauts went onboard the space station. In December, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope lifted off into orbit. Commercial spaceflights have also taken a leap forward this year. In September, four tourists were launched into space for a journey. A Russian actor and a film director returned to Earth in October after filming a science fiction movie at the International Space Station. U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan a big fiasco, leaving disasters behind On Aug. 30, U.S. troops were completely pulled out of Afghanistan. The 20-year war Washington unilaterally launched ended in a big fiasco. The hasty withdrawal, regardless of U.S. allies, led to turmoil on Afghan soil. Meanwhile, brutal airstrikes brought many civilians, including children, to death. America once again demonstrated its selfish and high-handed nature. The longest war in U.S. history claimed more than 30,000 lives of Afghan civilians, and turned about 11 million people into refugees.

"COP26","China","COP26_China379","Biden's apology in Glasgow shows hypocrisy, powerlessness of US politicians","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","Global Times (China)","Trump and BidenUS President Joe Biden apologized at the start of the COP26 UN climate summit. On Monday, when Biden made the remarks during a meeting on ""action and solidarity"" in Glasgow, he said, ""I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact the US, under the last administration, pulled out of the Paris accord."" What a ""noble"" apology, which made Biden seem like he cares about climate change, but also how hypocritical and powerless he is.\~Unlike what Biden may have expected, the apology triggered ridicule. Quite a few netizens, including those from the US, claimed they cannot wait until 2024 when the Republican Party, or even Donald Trump himself, apologizes for Biden's apology. Most people believe this was hardly an apology, but a slap in the face of his predecessor, a move to pin all the blame on Trump. This is not about how sorry Biden is. He was making a show and bringing US political infighting to the global arena.\~Climate change is one of the most highly polarizing issues in the US. Leading Republicans, most notably Trump, have mocked the issue as a hoax and are reluctant to take it seriously. In March, 12 Republican-led states sued Biden for his executive orders on climate change.\~So if there is anything that Biden did bring to Europe, it must be a massive 85-car and gas-guzzling motorcade. Other than that, Biden can only make empty promises at COP26. His apology does not make any sense, as he has no plan to fulfill his promises and no guarantee to make sure that his commitment won't be toppled by the next administration. Worse, he cannot even win enough support from his own party to get a green light for his plan. Also on Monday, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said he would not endorse a $1.75 trillion framework on social spending and climate change unveiled by Biden last week. For Biden, who is in Europe and waiting for something to deliver to the world, this is heavy blow.\~""Biden's remarks remind me of the scene when Democratic lawmakers got down on their knees for George Floyd, whose death sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as Biden's face-to-face apology to France for the US' 'clumsy' Australian submarine deal,"" Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of the Beijing International Studies University, told Global Times. Those cases show that the declining US is trapped in a predicament where the best option is to apologize. If the US still has teeth, it will definitely not become that humble, Xu said.\~In an interview aired two days before Biden apologized for Trump, the ex-president described Biden as ""the worst presidency in history"" and gave Biden an ""F"" grade. Their ""interactions"" make people wonder whether the presidential campaign is over.\~Biden, who once shouldered high hopes of Americans, has been disappointing his people. If Trump's biggest failure was the disastrous handling of the novel coronavirus, Biden is not doing much better. US COVID-19 deaths topped 400,000 when Trump was in power. As of press time, the number of confirmed deaths from the virus in the country is over 745,800. It means the figure when Biden is in office is catching up with that of Trump. Not to mention the catastrophic US economy and chaotic supply chain in the country.\~Because of the US system, presidents often face restrictions and constraints on domestic issues, but they are supposed to be much more powerful on foreign policy, L\'fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told Global Times. If Biden could bring his diplomatic skills into full play and be more courageous, like lowering some tariffs imposed on China, he may confront huge pressure temporarily, but won't feel the so much pain today, until US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen noted that a reciprocal rollback of some tariffs could be a ""desirable outcome,"" L\'fc said. He added that if Biden did it earlier, the compromise could be seen as goodwill and courage. But if he ends up being forced to make the decision, he is going to be accused of being a loser by his political opponents. The case with China is only one of many examples that reflect the US' ""clumsy"" diplomatic strength.\~Is there a worst president of the US? Perhaps there is no ""worst"" but only ""worse."" American voters always have high expectations during elections but will soon become frustrated. Can a US president turn the tide? It is worrying. But one thing is certain - political infighting will continue, which is exhausting US strength in dealing with domestic and global issues.There will be more apologies from US politicians, and there will be more kneeling down, Xu said.\~\l"

Indonesia, which aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2060, has a turbulent history when it comes to protecting its forests, but recent comments from the environment and forestry minister, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, have still bewildered green activists. Last week, she said on Twitter that ""forcing Indonesia to [reach] zero deforestation in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair,"" adding that massive development under President HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/topics/joko-widodoJoko Widodo's 5.96 trillion rupiah (US$417 million) infrastructure programme ""must not stop in the name of carbon emissions or in the name of deforestation"".

Indonesia, with the third-largest area of tropical forest in the world, had just days before endorsed a legally non-binding pledge during the COP26 climate conference to halt and reverse forest loss and degradation by 2030, alongside 136 other nations. These signatories account for nearly 91 per cent of global tree cover and 85 per cent of the world's primary tropical forest. Vice Foreign Minister Mahendra Siregar later told Reuters that the pledge did not contain the phrase ""end deforestation"" by 2030 and Indonesia had interpreted it as a vow to carry out sustainable forest management. Nevertheless, the outrage to Siti's tweets came swiftly on social media, including from environmentalists and climate activists. ""We were stunned by her statements, which is quite funny since she is the minister of environment and forestry,"" said Nadia Hadad, director of Jakarta-based environmental NGO The Sustainable Madani Foundation. ""The development must go on but we can't allow deforestation as we have a target to become a net carbon sink by 2030."" According to Nadia, bureaucratic overlaps are one of the major impediments hampering efforts to save Indonesia's forests, as companies are sometimes able to get permits to clear protected woodland and conservation areas by applying to different government bodies that do not share up-to-date forestry data. Some 3.1 million hectares of oil palm plantations - or 19 per cent of Indonesia's total oil palm cover - were located inside in the country's forest estate as of the end of 2019, despite a law banning the practice, according to a recent report by environmental groups Greenpeace and TheTreeMap. The forest estate covers national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and Unesco sites across Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. According to the groups, which described oil palm plantations as ""the largest single cause of deforestation in Indonesia over the past two decades"", more than 332,000 hectares of land previously mapped as orangutan and Sumatran tiger habitats have been planted with oil palm. In the report, Greenpeace identified eight Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil member companies with more than 10,000 hectares of illegal plantations each, including one Singapore-based palm oil company and two Malaysia-based companies. According to a study launched in May by Forests and Finance, a coalition of research groups and civil organisations, Chinese financial institutions also provided around US$15 billion in loans and underwriting services between January 2016 and April 2020 for companies that are driving tropical rainforest deforestation by producing commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper, beef, soy, rubber, and timber in Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Central and West Africa. ""There are three sides that are responsible for this, the government, the companies, and the investors. Investors should be aware because they can assess the companies' environmental, social and governance indices. This could be damaging to their reputation,"" says Iqbal Damanik, forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. ""We are also calling for financial institutions such as banks to no longer fund companies that destroy the environment, including deforestation. They need to be more aware so that their sustainability claim is real."" ""Since it is Indonesia who cancelled the deal, we are questioning the government's commitment to stop deforestation. It provides a clue that Indonesia is not confident that it could curb its deforestation rate in the next few years,"" said Mufti Fathul Barri, director of Forest Watch Indonesia. Indonesia expects deforestation to claim up to 14.6 million hectares by 2050 or 6.8 million hectares with policy interventions, as laid out in the country's long-term strategy for low carbon and climate resilience. But many researchers say that so-called carbon offsetting does not actually reduce emissions in the long run. Deforestation and peatland degradation contributes about 60 per cent of Indonesia's total carbon emissions. ""The carbon [emissions] released from deforestation are bigger than the amount of carbon absorbed by forest rehabilitation. If we cut trees in a 100,000-hectare forest area, we should rehabilitate 200,000 hectares of forest."" Mufti also questioned Widodo's claim during his speech at COP26 that 3 million hectares of forest had been rehabilitated between 2010-2019, as data published by the environment and forestry ministry said only 1 million hectares had been rehabilitated from 2011-2020. At the conference, Widodo said that the annual deforestation rate in 2020 of 115,500 hectares was the lowest in 20 years, a statement repeated by Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi during a joint news conference with her UK counterpart Liz Truss on Thursday. However, Greenpeace Indonesia said 4.8 million hectares has been deforested from 2011-2019, compared to 2.45 million hectares from 2003-2011. The country's youth climate activists have also voiced their disappointment at Indonesia's apparent lack of action to tackle the climate crisis. ""We are seeing that the mitigation of climate disasters in marginalised regions in Indonesia is very minimal. Local governments are not very aware about the impacts of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change,"" said Devirisal Djabumir, founder of Aru Dream School and a climate activist in the Aru Islands, part of eastern Indonesia's Maluku province. Devirisal said that he started becoming environmentally aware in 2017, after learning about the climate crisis from his friends in environmental groups. That year, he set up an informal, self-funded, environment-focused school for the Aru Islands's children, who can ""pay"" for the education with plastic waste. Every month, Devirisal gives as much as 70 per cent of the money he earns - as a clean water and sanitation worker and consultant for the local disaster agency - to the school. He said the effects of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change were already being felt in Indonesia's low-lying outer islands, where fishermen have lost their livelihoods because of a scarcity of fish and villages lack clean drinking water due to rising sea levels. ""Here, clean water can trigger a social conflict. I am worried that in the future, the impacts of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change, from all kinds of aspects, will be worse. The government is yet to launch actions to improve the resilience in vulnerable places like this,"" the 29 year old said. Devirisal is calling for the government to stop deforestation and start the transition to renewable energy, ""if Indonesia is really committed to stopping the impacts of climate change"". If no concrete action is taken soon, Iqbal from Greenpeace Indonesia predicts that Jakarta's economic drives will clash with the demand of younger generations for a greener future. ""Young Indonesians are aware that their future will depend on the environment, if the environment collapses, there will be no economic growth,"" he said. ""So in the future, the demand from Indonesian youth will be very, very loud if the government hesitates to quit the dirty economy."" Copyright (c) 2021. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

""It's very important to strengthen the collaboration between the two sides,"" the mayor told Xinhua in a recent interview. ""One of the areas that we're very keen to strengthen is around green finance."" Russell, currently serving as the co-chair for the UK-China Green Finance Taskforce alongside Dr. Ma Jun, chairman of the China Green Finance Committee, told Xinhua that both sides have had lots of virtual meetings recently in the run-up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to be held in Glasgow, Britain in November. The COP26 is ""one of the biggest events for the UK and the world... I fear that climate change will be a lot worse unless we address it very quickly,"" he said. Talking about the collaboration with Chinese partners in green finance, Russell said: ""I think China has made great progress, and it's moving very fast, and we will continue to work with China to help with that progress."" ""We're learning from each other and working together with each other,"" he added. Impressed by Chinese firms' understanding on how critical the ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) is for the world, the mayor said: ""It was really refreshing to see how China is moving forward...China recognizes that has to come down not only for the world, but for the Chinese people."" Highlighting how finance is crucial to get the world to net zero emissions, Russell said: ""It's about greening finance and financing green. And eventually that word 'green' will not be in the word 'finance', because all finance has to be green and sustainable."" Hailing China's commitments to striving to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, Russell said: ""I think it's wonderful and brilliant that China has made those commitments and we respect that."" ""Knowing China as I do, it would not surprise me in any way if that came forward, because when China decides to deliver a commitment, normally not only delivers it, but normally delivers things ahead of time,"" he said. The mayor noted the rapid development of electric cars as well as solar panels in China. ""So I look on always with huge respect and admiration of what China's achieved,"" he said. Asked about the current headwinds facing the two countries, Russell said despite some differences that the two sides have on certain things, ""that doesn't mean we can't still be business to business."" ""Here in the City of London, we have a huge history about being a trading city. And that trade is what we will continue to do with China, whatever some of the geopolitics are,"" he said. Noting that China has opened the door wider and wider in the financial sector, the mayor said it is great news and ""we will hope to continue to work with China as the door opens wide, and it will be reciprocal."" The mayor also welcomed more Chinese financial firms to come to the City of London to set up their offices. ""We will welcome that,"" he said. Enditem\l"

That sounds like a non sequitur, but for the trillions of dollars promised at the COP26 UN climate summit to materialise, there needs to be a revolution in investor psychology of the kind that perhaps only a market shock can bring. Debate about who will pay to finance a climate rescue operation appeared finally to be getting real with the November 3 announcement by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) that HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3155160/cop26-talk-us130-trillion-cheap-when-global-carbon-fund-need-hourover US$130 trillion of private capital is ""committed"" to transforming the economy to net zero. That is a very large sum of money, equal to more than one year's global gross domestic product; but where is it supposed to come from?

Estimates of how much that transition will cost vary from US$2 trillion to US$4 trillion a year between now and 2050, so US$60 trillion could be a ballpark total for a start. That is largely for new investment in renewables and replacing fossil-fuel-burning plants ""stranded"" by tougher emission laws. Which brings us back to Wall Street and equity investors' love affair (or dance to the death) with tech stocks, which they believe (like HYPERLINK bitcoin) can only go onwards. Will they acquiesce in a shift from short-term speculation in glamour stocks to long-term investment in climate rescue? The problem with everything having to do with financing the battle against HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changeclimate change is that it is so ""fuzzy"", as one Wall Street specialist suggested to me. That seems to apply as much to the Gfanz initiative as it has done for a long time to ESG - environmental, social and corporate governance - and other forms of ""green"" investing. Gfanz says it is a ""global coalition of leading financial institutions in the UN's Race to Zero that is committed to accelerating and mainstreaming the decarbonisation of the world economy and reaching net zero emissions by 2050"". All well and good but the devil is in the lack of detail. According to the Glasgow announcement, ""over US$130 trillion of private capital is committed to transforming the economy for net zero. These commitments, from over 450 firms across 45 countries, can deliver the estimated US$100 trillion of finance needed for net zero over the next three decades."" These are very large sums. But money on the balance sheets of financial institutions and companies is not the same as investment dollars in the bank dedicated specifically to HYPERLINK climate change mitigation.

By 2030, it is estimated that up to 118 million extremely poor people will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa, if adequate response measures are not put in place, said Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko, commissioner for rural economy and agriculture at the African Union Commission.The extremely poor are those who live on less than US$1.90 per day, according to the report coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization. In sub-Saharan Africa, climate change could further lower gross domestic product by up to 3 percent by 2050, Sacko said in the foreword to the report. Not only are physical conditions getting worse, but also the number of people being affected is increasing. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said last year Africa saw temperatures continue to rise,  accelerating sea-level rise, as well as extreme weather events like floods, landslides and droughts, all indicators of climate change. The rapid shrinking of the last remaining glaciers in eastern Africa, which are expected to melt entirely in the near future, signals the threat of imminent and irreversible change to the Earth system, Taalas said.Last year, Africa\' s land mass and waters warmed more rapidly than the world average, the report said. The 30-year warming trend from 1991-2020 was above that of the 1961-1990 period in all of Africa\' s regions and  significantly higher than for the 1931-1960 trend.\l"

One important strategy for the global economy to transition to green energy is to increase the cost of capital for the coal and oil industries through fossil fuel divestment.Yet, major banks such as Standard Chartered and Bank of China are still providing enormous amounts of capital and loans to international coal and oil projects. To incentivise fossil fuel divestment, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong should revise its disclosure policies for all publicly listed banks and investment funds on the climate-related risks of their investees and loan recipients.Recently, the SFC announced that from November 2022, licensed asset managers with at least HK$8 billion of clients' assets in Hong Kong would be required to disclose greenhouse gas emissions data of their investees. While this can help investors manage climate-related risks, the requirement does not apply to banks.The commission should require all publicly listed banks in Hong Kong to assess and disclose the climate-related risks of projects receiving their investment and loans. Such a requirement would pressure the banks to make more environmentally responsible investment and loan decisions.The SFC also expects public companies in Hong Kong to follow the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions from their own activities as well as indirect emissions from their consumption of electricity, heat or steam by 2025.

""I don't think any series has looked at the plant world in the same level of detail that we have,"" says episode producer Paul Williams during a video call from London. ""We took a story approach, where we made individual plants into individual characters, as we do with animals.

""The realisation that there's an underground fungal network that connects all the trees and allows them to 'talk' to and help each other is a mind-blowing idea to me.

Executive producer Mike Gunton refers to that network as ""the wood-wide web"", an appropriate term catching on among scientists to describe ""this internet of the forest beneath our feet. There's this other world going on all around us that we just don't realise."" As we stumble from ""plant blindness to plant awareness"", Gunton sees clearly the path to survival humans must choose.

As for a mission statement for The Green Planet: ""Make the world green again - that's our plan,"" he adds. Promisingly, the reaction to the Glasgow premiere was ""very good"", says Gunton. ""We wanted to show another viewpoint. The series is not just about a warming planet, it's also about a complex ecology. There was positivity because there are some solutions; people need some positive beacons to follow. And there are. ""But time is running out,"" he warns.

Is that the political equivalent of a sucker punch?After playing down for months the significance of rising inflation as ""transitory"", his administration is paying a heavy political price as the United States faces the strongest inflationary surge in decades, as do other major economies.His approval rating is at a new low, at 36 per cent, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll.After his virtual summit with President Xi Jinping, Beijing has reportedly agreed to a coordinated release of strategic petroleum reserves. Oil prices, an inflationary factor, retreated from above US$80 a barrel this week. Opec+ has resisted calls from Biden to ramp up production.A close coordination between the world's two biggest oil consumers would not be welcome news to the oil cartel.The White House said Biden and Xi discussed ""taking measures to address global energy supplies"" during the summit.Biden has made similar requests to other top oil-consuming countries. China's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration is reportedly working on a release of crude oil, the second time this year, but did not provide details.Last week, Biden also managed to secure a surprise bilateral pact with China at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.

The HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/8f7323c8-3197-4a69-9fcd-1965f3df40a7Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero says it is made up of more than 450 different banks, asset managers and insurers and represents up to US$150 trillion in assets.It is notable that this coalition of private sector firms is headed by Carney, a former senior central banker, as in recent years researchers, activists and others have HYPERLINK https://odi.org/en/publications/the-role-of-central-banks-in-tackling-climate-change/called for central banks to do moreAnd though central bankers have discussed the issue widely, they have generally focused on its implications for financial stability. Carney has previously warned that HYPERLINK climate change could damage the financial system, as assets are damaged by extreme weather or become unviable (and thus uninsurable) as temperatures rise and climate action is normalized.While the stability of the financial system is important, it remains a secondary objective for most central banks. Indeed, their primary goal is to maintain stable prices and HYPERLINK https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/aboutachieve low inflationHow climate change affects monetary policyCentral banks have generally remained shy on this issue, as if they assume that they are immune from the effects of climate change. But my co-author Koyesha Mukherjee and I recently published HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03149-2research in which we showed that climate change does pose a threat not just to financial stability, but also to prices and inflation.We highlighted various channels through which climate change affects price stability. For example, hotter temperatures and more frequent droughts could lead to a fall in agricultural output, resulting in food shortages. This in turn would drive prices up as the demand for food would be higher than supply. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drought-Water-Faucet-Fields-iStock-e1552471550432.jpg?resize=780%2C491&ssl=1Link to ImageClimate-related extreme weather also means more demand for energy (for cooling or heating) but also a fall in supply \- thereby driving prices up. Extreme weather also affects countries\' ability to produce exported goods. For example, when people are exposed to extreme heat they are HYPERLINK https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---gjp/documents/publication/wcms_476194.pdfless effective at producing goodsWe found evidence of this when we analyzed the effects of temperature changes on inflation for a group of 107 countries (including 80 developing and 27 developed countries). We first gathered daily mean temperatures for each country which we then converted into an annual figure. The change in this annual figure gave us a simplified measure of temperature change, which we compared to inflation in that country in that year.After excluding some countries that had experienced hyperinflation and two periods of global inflationary shocks, we found that rising temperatures were overwhelmingly linked to an increase in inflation.Our finding was also confirmed when we undertook separate investigations for developed and developing countries. In developed countries, temperature increases lead to an increase in inflation in the short run (about a year). In developing countries, the findings were more worrying, however, as this effect persisted for at least six years after the start of the process.What do the results mean for central banks?This could have severe implications for the wider economy, making recessions and financial crises more likely. Finally, central banks face the challenge of implementing the best policy response to climate-driven changes in inflation and output.It is extremely important for central banks to understand that the impact of climate change goes beyond financial stability, and actually poses a threat to their first primary objective of keeping prices stable and inflation low. As such, they should take climate change into account in their decision-making process.It is important for central banks to understand the source of inflation in order to adopt the right response.

A lot of the tropical episode is about how plants fight one another for survival-in the desert, it's about cooperation.""The series was shot over four years in 27 countries, with many local crews already being used before the pandemic intervened, restricting international travel.Rosie Thomas, producer of the episode about the changing seasons, said it is rare for plants to receive the treatment filmmakers usually give to wildlife.""Often, animals do take center stage, and the beauty of this series is that we were able to treat plants as star characters,"" she said. ""Pretty much everything here is something people haven't seen before, or filmed in a new way, using new technology to show the plant characteristics.""Because of how plants change over the passage of time, each episode required about 50 separate shoots, which Williams said highlighted the difference between filming plants and animals.""When you film a wildlife sequence, a lot of effort goes into finding the animal and waiting, but with plants it's different,"" he said. ""Plant behavior doesn't happen in a moment, it can take years. In the desert episode, we set up a timelapse camera on an Arizona desert cactus and took tens of thousands of images over three years, which had to be edited.""All kinds of plants from all over the world are featured in the study of plant behavior. Photo provided to China DailySeries executive producer Mike Gunton said telling such a commonly-overlooked story was one of the most exciting challenges he had faced in 35 years working in the sector.""I thought 'we're missing a whole fundamental part of the natural world here',"" he said.""We're all a bit plant-blind, so could we use the approach of immersing into their lives, could we translate (from filmmaking about animals) into the plant world, to tell a story about such an under-explored part of nature,"" he said.""Scientists are now beginning to talk about plants in the same way they talk about animals. The challenge was how do you show that to people if you can't see it with the naked eye, so you have to use the camera to take you through the secret portal into their world.""At November's COP26 climate summit, delegates were shown the tropical episode, and Williams said their response made all the production teams' efforts worthwhile.""It was really wonderful to sit in the audience and hear audible appreciation for plants,"" he said.""We show how diverse and beautiful plants are, and also show the connection between animals and plants, and between plants and plants.""At the end, we revealed how when you dissect a rainforest into fragments, which is how half the existing rainforest is, those connections break down. It makes the point of how plants are pivotal to all life on earth, and speaking to people afterwards, it gave them a new insight into how plants are central to the fight against the problems we face.""\l"

How the building functions will be monitored by researchers, with data used to inform future tenement upgrades.River power\~As Glasgow looks for new green energy sources, it is turning in part to the wide Clyde River that winds through its city center.In much the same way as air-source heat devices work, large water-source heat pumps could draw residual heat from the Clyde, which is then piped to homes and businesses, providing a lower-carbon alternative to traditional heating systems.The river is already fueling one district heat network serving homes and businesses just outside Glasgow, and another planned system will power a high-tech ""innovation district"" in the center.One catch is that although renewable systems can compete on price with heat produced from fossil-fuel electricity, the gas boilers that still warm most homes remain even cheaper.Who pays?As leaders prepare to gather at the COP26 talks in Glasgow to hammer out rules designed to ramp up emissions cuts, one crucial question will be how to finance it all.Glasgow City Council leader Aitken said reaching the city's aim of net-zero emissions by 2030 is likely to require about 30 billion pounds ($41 billion) of investment, including 5 billion pounds just to retrofit homes to higher efficiency standards.""Governments alone can't deliver this.

The building is designed to consume 7 kilowatt-hours per square meter each year  nearly 10 times less energy than the average European building consumes. Rooftop solar panels, two onsite wind turbines, the use of groundwater, and smart technology solutions enable the complex to consume and produce equal amounts of electricity over one year. A unique microgrid partnership facilitates energy sharing and coordination with the surrounding community.Another contribution is Schneider's recent agreement with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, the country's national utility provider. It will be the Middle East's first ever country-wide smart grid and help Egypt meet future energy demands while advancing its sustainability strategy.All three solutions will be highlighted during the launch of the ""100 days"" initiative and Schneider's remaining three contributions will be featured throughout the project.About Schneider Electric Our mission is to be your digital partner for Sustainability and Efficiency.We drive digital transformation by integrating world-leading process and energy technologies, end-point to cloud connecting products, controls, software and services, across the entire lifecycle, enabling integrated company management, for homes, buildings, data centers, infrastructure and industries.We are the most local of global companies.

"COP26","China","COP26_China406","Ukraine: A conflict soaked in contradictions","March 3, 2022 Thursday 3:56 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","Surprise and horror have defined the reaction to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. That\' s likely because although the intervention has followed the contours of a modern land war, it has also marked a break with the past in a number of ways. The world has become used to military interventions by the United States. This is, however, not a US intervention. That in itself is a surprise \- one that has befuddled reporters and pundits alike.Even as we deplore the violence and the loss of life in Ukraine resulting from the Russian intervention \- and the neofascist violence in the Donbas \- it is valuable to step back and look at how the rest of the world may perceive this conflict, starting with the West\' s ethnocentric interest in an attack whose participants and victims they believe they share aspects of identity with \- whether related to culture, religion or skin color.White warsWar in Ukraine joins a sequence of wars that have opened sores on a very fragile planet. Wars in Africa and Asia seem endless, and some of them are rarely commented upon with any feeling in media outlets across the world or in the cascade of posts found on social media platforms. For example, the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which\~ HYPERLINK https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/monuc/background.shtmlstarted\~in 1996 and which has resulted in millions of casualties, has not elicited the kind of sympathy from the world now seen during the reporting on Ukraine. In contrast, the startlingly frank comments from political leaders and journalists during the conflict in Ukraine have revealed the grip of racism on the imaginations of these shapers of public opinion.It was impossible recently to get major global media outlets interested in\~ HYPERLINK https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/09/rwandas-military-is-the-french-proxy-on-african-soil/the conflict in Cabo DelgadoAt COP26, I told a group of oil-company executives about this intervention, which I had covered for\~ HYPERLINK https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/09/rwandas-military-is-the-french-proxy-on-african-soil/Globetrotter, and one of them responded with precise accuracy:  You\' re right about what you say, but no one cares. No one, which is to say the political forces in the North Atlantic states, cares about the suffering of children in Africa and Asia. They are, however, gripped by the war in Ukraine, which should grip them, which distresses all of us, but which should not be allowed to be seen as worse than other conflicts taking place across the globe that are much more brutal and are likely to slip out of everyone\' s memory because of the lack of interest and attention given by world leaders and media outlets to them.Charlie D\' Agata of CBS News\~ HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3eDZean39ssaid\~Kiev  isn\' t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European \- I have to choose those words carefully, too \- city, where you wouldn\' t expect that, or hope that  [a conflict] is going to happen. Clearly, these are the things one expects to see in Kabul (Afghanistan) or Baghdad (Iraq) or Goma (the Democratic Republic of Congo), but not in a  relatively civilized, relatively European city in Ukraine. If these are things that one expects in the former cities respectively, then there is very little need to be particularly outraged by the violence that is witnessed in these cities.You would not expect such violence in Ukraine,\~ HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQ392yepF0said\~the country\' s deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, to the British Broadcasting Corporation, because of the kind of people who were caught in the crossfire:  European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed every day. Sakvarelidze considers the Ukrainians to be Europeans, although D\' Agata calls them  relatively European. But they are certainly not African or Asian, people whom \- if you think carefully about what is being said here \- certain world leaders and international media outlets expect to be killed by the violence unleashed against them by the global great powers and by the weapons sold to the local thugs in these regions by these great powers.Worst war?On February 23, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, in a heartfelt statement about the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, HYPERLINK said:  In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century. The next day, on February 24, with Russia\~ HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-orders-military-operations-ukraine-demands-kyiv-forces-surrender-2022-02-24/launching\~ the biggest attack on a European state since World War II, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\~ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1496810890250928132condemned\~this  barbaric attack and said  it is President Putin who is bringing war back to Europe.  Bringing war back to Europe : this is instructive language from Von der Leyen. It reminded me of Aim\'e9 C\'e9saire\' s\~Discourse on Colonialism (1950), where the great poet and communist bemoaned Europe\' s ability to forget the terrible fascistic treatment of the peoples of Africa and Asia by the colonial powers when they spoke of fascism. Fascism, C\'e9saire wrote, is the colonial experiment brought back to Europe.When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, neither the United Nations secretary-general nor the president of the European Commission came forward to make any immediate condemnation of that war. Both international institutions went along with the war, allowing the destruction of Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of\~ HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-deaths-survey/iraq-conflict-has-killed-a-million-iraqis-survey-idUSL3048857920080130more than\~one million people. In 2004, a year into the US war on Iraq, after reports of grave violations of human rights (including by Amnesty International on\~torture\~in the prison of Abu Ghraib) came to light, the UN secretary-general, at the time, Kofi Annan,\~ HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2004/09/115352-lessons-iraq-war-underscore-importance-un-charter-annancalled\~the war  illegal.

In the case of the Russian intervention, these institutions rushed to condemn the war, which is all very well; but does this mean they will be just as quick to condemn the United States when it starts its next bombing campaign?War stenographyPeople often ask me what is the most reliable news outlet. This is a hard question to answer these days, as Western news outlets are increasingly becoming stenographers of their governments \- with the racist attitudes of the reporters on full display more and more often, making the apologies that come later hardly comforting. State-sponsored outlets in Russia and China now increasingly find themselves banned on social media sites. Anyone who counters Washington\' s narrative is dismissed as irrelevant, and these fringe voices find it hard to develop an audience.So-called cancel culture demonstrates its limits. D\' Agata has\~ HYPERLINK https://news.yahoo.com/cbs-journalist-apologizes-saying-ukraine-024714455.htmlapologized\~for his comment about Ukraine being  relatively civilized, relatively European compared with Iraq and Afghanistan and has already been rehabilitated because he is on the  right side of the conflict in Ukraine.

He  misspoke, they might say, but this is a Freudian slip.Calculations of warWars are ugly, especially wars of aggression. The role of the reporter is to explain why a country goes to war, particularly an unprovoked war. If this were 1941, I might try to explain the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II or the Japanese assumption that the Nazis would soon defeat the Soviets and then take the war across the Atlantic Ocean. But the Soviets held out, saving the world from fascism. In the same way, the Russian attack on Ukraine requires explanation: The roots of it go deep to various political and foreign policy developments, such as the post-Soviet emergence of ethnic nationalism along the spine of Eastern Europe, the eastward advance of US power \- through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \- toward the Russian border, and the turbulent relationship between the major European states and their eastern neighbors, including Russia. To explain this conflict is not to justify it, for there is little to justify in the bombing of a sovereign people.Sane voices exist on all sides of ugly conflicts. In Russia, State Duma Deputy Mikhail Matveev of the Communist Party\~ HYPERLINK https://holod.media/2022/02/27/matveev/said soon after the Russian entry into Ukraine that he voted for the recognition of the breakaway provinces of Ukraine, he  voted for peace, not for war, and he voted  for Russia to become a shield, so that Donbas is not bombed, and not for Kiev being bombed.

Two decades on, we are still not making full use of our options.Like many in the green finance space, I welcomed the announcement by COP26 that the Paris Agreement ""rulebook"" on carbon markets had been approved. The lack of consensus had been holding back vital funding to carbon projects, and delaying the urgent mission of keeping global warming below 1.5 .One key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is that developing countries are now also committed to their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The newly passed Article 6 of the Paris Agreement established a cross-border system similar to the CDM but with a greater burden placed on developing nations to achieve their own NDCs by selling carbon credits to developed countries.It would be beneficial to have an additional mechanism to help multinational corporations (MNC) purchase carbon credits from developing countries, allowing those nations to achieve their own NDCs instead of helping the country where the MNC is based to meet its NDCs without reducing emissions. Utilizing the voluntary markets in this way would drive much-needed capital from large MNCs to finance green mitigation projects in vulnerable communities and speed up the world's decarbonization effort. Mobilizing green finance Unfortunately, countries chose to exclude a mandatory share of proceeds to be allocated to the UN's Adaptation Fund, set up expressly to help the developing nations most at risk from climate change to adapt. Despite being set at a minimum annual fund size of US$100bn by 2020, it never reached that number. ""We are not there yet,"" conceded U.N. secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres, although the final figure is unknown.Experts had called for a 50:50 split of fund allocation to mitigation projects and adaptation. Sadly, most funds were allocated as loans to reduce carbon emissions in middle-income countries. These are profit-making ventures that could likely have found private funding without such financing.

While the cost to big polluters remains around US$25 per tonne of emissions and emissions ceilings remain generously high, carbon trading will continue to be ineffectual. There is widespread agreement that pollution rights need to be set at US$100 to US$135 a tonne to change the behaviour of big industrial polluters. Momentum towards another stick - HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3039549/eus-carbon-border-tax-will-damage-global-climate-changecarbon border taxesLess attention has been paid to carrots, but proposals from HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/1881249/chinas-pain-indias-pain-too-says-indian-central-bank-bossRaghuram Rajan, at the University of Chicago, for ""global carbon reduction incentives"" have aroused my interest. His proposals are elegant and, by international trade policy standards, quite simple. Worldwide CO2 emissions in 2019 were 36.4 billion tonnes. With a world population of 7.7 billion people that year, that means average per capita CO2 emissions worldwide of about 4.7 tonnes. Rajan calls for all countries with per capita emissions of more than 5 tonnes to contribute to a climate pool, calculating the contribution by multiplying their population by their per capita emissions above 5 tonnes. For example, China had 10.2 billion tonnes of HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3131294/china-will-phase-out-coal-now-its-essential-energy-mix-seniortotal emissions in 2019. With a population of 1.4 billion people, that means per capita emissions were 7.3 tonnes. If countries were asked to pay US$1 per tonne over 5 tonnes, China's contribution would be its population multiplied by 2.3 - about US$3.2 billion. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3130698/global-climate-summit-xi-jinping-and-joe-biden-united-driveThe US emitted 5.28 billion tonnes in 2019, which on a per capita basis was 16.1 tonnes. Using the same calculation, its contribution would be its population of about 330 million multiplied by its 11.1 excess over the 5 tonne allowance, amounting to US$3.7 billion. Using the Our World in Data emissions database built in collaboration with the UN's Global Carbon Project, Rajan's carbon reduction incentive pool for 2019 would raise about US$13 billion, with eight economies - China, the US, the EU, Japan, Russia, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3127296/saudi-arabia-unveils-campaign-tackle-climate-change-andSaudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada - contributing 87 per cent of the climate pool. China, the US and the EU alone would contribute 66 per cent. It is possible China would complain that rich economies get off lightly under this basic scheme. In response, my thought is that a US$100 billion ""starter pool"" could be created, based on every country's cumulative contribution to the more than 1.5 trillion tonnes of emissions generated since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The US, whose cumulative contribution was 399 billion tonnes as of 2017 or 25 per cent of the total, would pay US$25 billion into the starter fund. The EU contribution, based on cumulative emissions of 353 billion tonnes, would contribute 22 per cent or US$22 billion. China, with cumulative emissions of 200 billion tonnes or 12.7 per cent, would contribute US$12.7 billion. Between them, the US, China and the EU would account for 60 per cent of contributions to the starter fund. However, all economies would contribute a little. For example, based on HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3111355/hong-kong-will-be-carbon-neutral-2050-carrie-lamour cumulative emissionsThe carbon reduction incentive pool could then be launched with a starter pool of US$100 billion to aid adjustment among https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3091133/new-climate-fund-southeast-asia-targets-25-billion-cleandeveloping economiesCountries that succeed in cutting their emissions to or below 5 tonnes per capita would contribute less, year by year. Those that increase them would have to contribute more. To ensure a progressive squeeze towards "" HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3048308/if-china-fails-follow-germanys-net-zero-carbon-example-fightnet zero"", the 5-tonne per capita allowance could, for example, be cut to 4 tonnes in 2030, 3 tonnes in 2040 and 2 tonnes in 2050.

[Photo/Xinhua]The conference is titled ""Deepen China-Africa Partnership and Promote Sustainable Development to Build a China-Africa Community with a Shared Future in the New Era"", and follows the last summit held in 2018.Happening soon after the conclusion of COP26 in Scotland earlier this month, and President Xi Jinping's announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September that China will no longer fund new coal-fired power plants overseas, Africa's expectations on climate and energy issues from the conference are high.China-Africa watchers predict the forum may close with a climate declaration, which will likely be a first for the FOCAC.According to the International Energy Agency, Chinese companies that operated as the main contractors on energy projects were responsible for 30 percent of new capacity additions in sub-Saharan Africa between 2010 and 2015.African governments are increasingly looking toward renewables as a source for the expansion of energy generation, and African leaders are therefore anticipated to sign renewable energy deals.Despite its rich endowment in renewable resources, including the world's most abundant solar resources, the continent's non-hydro renewable sector has so far been growing slowly. Only five countries on the continent have installed wind power capacity in excess of 300MW, and only four countries have over 300MW of installed solar power capacity.As the world's largest producer of solar photovoltaic and wind power equipment, and with a domestic track record of rapid capacity expansion and utilization, experts said China is well-placed to take advantage of the emerging renewable energy market on the African continent. China's announcement at the UNGA to stop funding coal projects overseas is seen as giving political impetus to Chinese investments in the renewable energy sector in Africa.Wei Shen, research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies in the United Kingdom, said China is a leader in the global renewable industry, particularly in the solar photovoltaic sector.""It has unparalleled manufacturing capacity for solar panels \- eight of the top 10 world suppliers are Chinese,"" he wrote. ""Across sub-Saharan Africa, China's renewable energy involvement has been growing. For example, the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the China\- Africa Renewable Energy Cooperation and Innovation Alliance have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate in renewable energy generation in Africa to combat climate change and promote sustainable development.

While delivering their ""State of the World"" addresses, the main focus of these leaders was on the COVID-19 challenge, climate change, the deepening financial crisis and post-pandemic recovery.The three leaders shared a similar vision for 2022 and beyond. They emphasized further opening up of the world economy and greater cooperation and solidarity in tackling common global challenges. ""We should remove barriers and not erect walls,"" said President Xi.Xi explained that humanity will certainly move on but the world needs to jointly defeat the pandemic. ""A giant ship is strong enough to brave the storm"". The pandemic impacts health and the economy and thus he cautioned that ""holding each other back and shifting blame, will only shift our objectives"". He further advised: ""The world needs to discard the Cold War mentality and confrontation will lead to disastrous consequences. We need to explore new drivers of economic growth to promote steady and robust global economic recovery.""President Xi was more categorical when explaining the present global scenario: ""Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one; they ultimately hurt the interest of others as well as one's own. Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history"". He thus suggested that ""developed nations need responsible economic policies, should control spill-over effects of policies to avoid impacting developing countries"".The speeches by President Xi and Prime Minister Modi underscored the potential of their respective nations and people for contributing towards meeting challenges and building a better world based on equity, justice and fairness. Xi advocated for a ""global community of health for all"", while Modi talked of ""one earth, one health"". Both leaders highlighted their own efforts in overcoming the pandemic crisis and in accelerating the pace of economic recovery and social resilience.The world has seen millions of COVID-19 cases and subsequent deaths so far. In explaining the gravity of the pandemic, President Xi also noted that the economic impact has led to an increase in poverty, and that the Human Development Index has decl"

[Photo/Xinhua]The eighth ministerial conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation will take place from Nov 29 to 30 in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, with 55 members expected to attend.The conference is titled ""Deepen China-Africa Partnership and Promote Sustainable Development to Build a China-Africa Community with a Shared Future in the New Era"", and follows the last summit held in 2018.Happening soon after the conclusion of COP26 in Scotland earlier this month, and President Xi Jinping's announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September that China will no longer fund new coal-fired power plants overseas, Africa's expectations on climate and energy issues from the conference are high.China-Africa watchers predict the forum may close with a climate declaration, which will likely be a first for the FOCAC.According to the International Energy Agency, Chinese companies that operated as the main contractors on energy projects were responsible for 30 percent of new capacity additions in sub-Saharan Africa between 2010 and 2015.African governments are increasingly looking toward renewables as a source for the expansion of energy generation, and African leaders are therefore anticipated to sign renewable energy deals.Despite its rich endowment in renewable resources, including the world's most abundant solar resources, the continent's non-hydro renewable sector has so far been growing slowly. Only five countries on the continent have installed wind power capacity in excess of 300MW, and only four countries have over 300MW of installed solar power capacity.As the world's largest producer of solar photovoltaic and wind power equipment, and with a domestic track record of rapid capacity expansion and utilization, experts said China is well-placed to take advantage of the emerging renewable energy market on the African continent. China's announcement at the UNGA to stop funding coal projects overseas is seen as giving political impetus to Chinese investments in the renewable energy sector in Africa.Wei Shen, research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies in the United Kingdom, said China is a leader in the global renewable industry, particularly in the solar photovoltaic sector.""It has unparalleled manufacturing capacity for solar panels \- eight of the top 10 world suppliers are Chinese,"" he wrote. ""Across sub-Saharan Africa, China's renewable energy involvement has been growing. For example, the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the China\- Africa Renewable Energy Cooperation and Innovation Alliance have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate in renewable energy generation in Africa to combat climate change and promote sustainable development.

But there are more important issues to attend to if we really want to improve education in Hong Kong. Further promotion of STEM in primary and secondary schools is unnecessary as three of the four subjects (science, technology and mathematics) are already incorporated into the curriculum of most schools. Maths and science are exam subjects for the Diploma of Secondary Education. Maths is a core subject and the three branches of science, namely physics, chemistry and biology, occupy three of the four most chosen elective subjects in Hong Kong.

Get the answers with HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledgeSCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Moreover, computer literacy lessons are offered in primary and secondary schools. Some schools already teach programming languages such as Python and Arduino. The knowledge taught in school is more than enough to give students the computer knowledge they need in the future. After all, not everyone will become a scientist or engineer. If the purpose is to learn logic and critical thinking, children can do that by playing chess and through other activities. What young people need is all-round development, and they should work on other areas like music and sports to find their interests when they are young, and specialise later. If Hong Kong really wants to become more competitive in research and development, the government should prioritise investments in universities to encourage more research and attract more people to forge careers in technology. The further promotion of STEM education would not really help children, and would not help the government achieve its aims in tech development. Instead of promoting STEM courses for young students, resources should be directed towards helping more university students get an internship in tech companies or funding innovation competitions to boost Hong Kong's technological sector.

"COP26","China","COP26_China415","Volvo reveals vehicle made of fossil-free steel","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","Shenzhen Daily","A FEW months ago, Volvo teamed up with Swedish steel producer SSAB to develop a type of steel it can use for its vehicles that doesn\' t use fossil fuels. Now, the automaker has revealed what it says is the world\' s first vehicle made of fossil-free steel: a four-wheeled fully electric load carrier made for quarrying and mining. In addition to having no greenhouse gas emission, it\' s also autonomous and can follow a pre-programmed route to transport materials at a job site. SSAB produces fossil-free steel by replacing the coal used during the manufacturing process with hydrogen from electrolysis. As Forbes notes, though, the whole vehicle isn\' t exactly fossil-free, since the steel used for its components provided by third-party suppliers, such as its electric motor, was made using traditional means. Still, Volvo Group CTO Lars Stenqvist said  the majority of the steel in the vehicle is fossil-free. He said three tons of the carrier\' s 8.2-ton weight is made of green steel from SSAB, and those eight tons include other heavy components like the vehicle\' s tires. Volvo plans to start a small-scale production for the vehicle next year and to scale up production, depending on the availability of steel from SSAB. The Swedish manufacturer is hoping to start mass-producing its fossil-free steel in 2026, so we may see more Volvo vehicles made using the material by that time. Martin Lundstedt, president and CEO of Volvo Group, said:  This initiative with SSAB sets the benchmark for a fossil-free future. Just as the nations of the world come together at COP26 to address climate change, so too must organizations and industries work in collaboration to develop innovative new solutions for a greenhouse gas emission-free future. Volvo is committed to pioneering partnerships such as this with SSAB to develop attractive, safe and efficient new vehicles and machines that pave the way for a more sustainable transport and infrastructure system adopted for the future.

"COP26","China","COP26_China416","China means what it says in reducing carbon emissions: ambassador","October 27, 2021 Wednesday 11:50 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","LONDON, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China will honor its pledges to reduce carbon emissions and any worries about it failing to do so is unnecessary, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Zheng Zeguang said in an article published on The Guardian on Wednesday. ""Anyone who knows China well is sure that my country is serious about reducing carbon emissions and pursuing green development, and that we mean what we say,"" Zheng said in the article published days ahead of the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland Last year, China announced that it will strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, he said. These commitments were reiterated last month at the UN general assembly, with the further announcement that China will not build any more coal-fired power stations overseas. Earlier this month, at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, known as COP15, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for joint efforts in building a community of all life on Earth, and proposed major policies for the preservation of biological diversity, he added. As a result of China's leadership, the Kunming declaration has been adopted and the Kunming biodiversity fund set up, with China committing an initial capital contribution of 1.5 billion yuan (about 235 million U.S. dollars), he said. ""This is a testimony to the resolve and determination of China's top leader to protect the ecosystem and tackle climate change,"" he said. Zheng noted that in China, it is already a national consensus that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are mountains of gold and silver"" -- an idea proposed by Xi. Ecological conservation has been one of the ""five prongs"" of the overall plan for the country's development since the 18th congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012. Anyone familiar with China's political system knows that once decisions and goals are set by the CPC central committee and the top leader, they are incorporated into the overall national development program, turned into feasible action plans and delivered faithfully by local governments and competent departments, the ambassador said, noting that is how the country has achieved its development miracle over the 72 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In terms of climate action, China met its target for 2020 ahead of schedule, he said. By the end of last year, carbon emissions intensity had come down by 48 percent compared with 2005, and non-fossil fuels accounted for 16 percent of primary energy consumption. China is also doing what it can to help build up climate response capabilities in developing countries, he said. From supporting Africa in monitoring the climate system with satellite technology and building low-carbon pilot zones in southeast Asia, to introducing energy-saving bulbs to small island countries, China's cooperation with less developed regions of the world has produced tangible results. China has also launched green action initiatives that encourage green infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework, he said. In 2020, 57 percent of China's energy investment in BRI partner countries went to renewable energy projects, up from 38 percent in 2019, he said, adding that such efforts will continue. Meanwhile, the ambassador said the international community should recognize that, for a developing country with a population of over 1.4 billion that has not completed industrialization or urbanization, the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the supporting policy measures that China has adopted voluntarily have not been easy. He expressed hope that the international community should aim to complete the negotiations of the Paris rulebook (market mechanisms in article six in particular) and push for progress on issues of concern to developing countries, namely adaptation and financing. The principles of equity -- common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities -- should be upheld. Developed countries with a couple of hundred years of industrialization behind them and historical environmental debts should make bigger contributions to tackling pollution and protecting the environment, instead of pinning the responsibility on China and other developing countries, he said. Developed countries must shoulder their obligations and take the lead in drastically cutting emissions -- a key to achieving global net-zero emissions, he said. They also need to help developing countries speed up the green and low-carbon transition by significantly increasing support to them through financing, technology and capacity building, and avoid putting up green trade barriers. ""All countries must keep their word rather than just pay lip service"" in order to strengthen international mutual trust, he said, noting that the longstanding pledge by developed countries to provide 100 billion dollars a year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020 has yet to be fulfilled. China and Britain, as countries of global influence, should work together to implement the important understanding between the leaders of the two countries, so as to strengthen the synergy between COP15 and COP26, contribute to a successful conference in Glasgow, and promote full and effective implementation of the Paris agreement, the ambassador said.

"COP26","China","COP26_China417","HK contributes to global green efforts","December 9, 2021 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Dec. 9 --Hong Kong SAR Government issued the following news release:Chief Executive Carrie LamClimate change is an imminent issue for all of us. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) held last month has drawn the world's attention to the pressing need for immediate actions. Among others, a number of advancements related to green and sustainable finance were made in COP26, including the publication of the Common Ground Taxonomy report by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance, and the publication of the prototype for the climate disclosure standard. This summit is most timely to focus our attention on this important topic as Hong Kong continues to map the way forward towards a low-carbon and sustainable economy.In my Policy Address delivered on October 6 this year, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment that Hong Kong would strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. The Hong Kong Climate Action Plan 2050 announced shortly thereafter sets out a series of proactive strategies and measures, and pursues more vigorous interim decarbonisation targets to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by 50% before 2035 as compared to the 2005 level. The Steering Committee on Climate Change & Carbon Neutrality personally chaired by me since January this year will oversee the various actions, and we expect some HK$240 billion public sector investments in the next 15 to 20 years to support their implementation, which will create many opportunities in the green economy.As an international financial centre with a large financial market and world-class regulatory framework, Hong Kong is well positioned to provide the necessary infrastructure and connect the flow of green and sustainable funds to promote a green economy. Over the years, the Government, together with the financial regulators, has continued to develop green and sustainable finance to boost investments conducive to reducing carbon emissions. With a view to contributing to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 in the Mainland and before 2050 in Hong Kong, and elevating Hong Kong's position as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, we are doubling our efforts to promote market development, align Hong Kong's regulatory standards with international best practice, encourage more entities to make use of Hong Kong's capital markets as well as financial and professional services for green and sustainable investment, and capitalise on the enormous green finance opportunities presented by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt & Road Initiative.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Limited (HKEX) has long been our close partner and I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to HKEX for their work in fostering green and sustainable finance development in Hong Kong. As one of the six members of the Green & Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, HKEX has spared no effort in promoting the enhancement of ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) and climate change disclosures among listed companies. Just last week, HKEX announced two new initiatives to facilitate the industry's transition to net-zero, namely the release of the Practical Net-Zero Guide for Business and the partnership with leading ESG data providers to display listed companies' ESG metrics.HKEX also co-chairs with the Securities & Futures Commission the Carbon Market Work Stream under the aforementioned steering group, which will soon complete an assessment report on the feasibility of developing Hong Kong into a regional carbon trading centre and exploring opportunities presented by the carbon emission markets in the Mainland and overseas. With the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between HKEX and Guangzhou Futures Exchange in August, HKEX will further strategic collaboration with its counterpart in promoting sustainability, particularly in areas such as clearing, technology, product development and marketing to drive the development of a green and low-carbon market in the region. Last week, I visited the carbon emissions exchange in Wuhan, Hubei, and saw their sterling efforts in promoting innovation to combat climate change. I trust that the Government, together with HKEX, can work with Hubei and other places in the Mainland as well to promote the development of a carbon emission market system to support the country's target of achieving carbon neutrality.I recall that some of you joined me two months ago in the HKEX Connect Hall to celebrate the issuance and listing of offshore RMB bonds by the Shenzhen Municipal Government in Hong Kong. The issuance was remarkable, not only because it was the first time for Mainland municipal government bonds to be issued offshore, but also because some of them were green bonds. These RMB3.9 billion-worth green bonds signify the joint efforts of Shenzhen and Hong Kong to support the country's targets for carbon emission reduction as well as our unique position as an offshore RMB hub and green finance centre. We welcome and would encourage more Mainland issuers to do the same.Green bond initiativesThe Government has in fact set the example and established the Government Green Bond Programme in 2018 with a view to raising Hong Kong's profile, establishing a market benchmark, and showcasing to potential green bond issuers that Hong Kong is a premier platform offering a one-stop solution for issuing green products. We have recently doubled the borrowing ceiling of the programme to HK$200 billion, and successfully issued renminbi, euro and USD-denominated green bonds. The inaugural offering of euro-denominated and RMB-denominated bonds by the Government has helped set an important new benchmark for potential issuers in Hong Kong and the region. The US$3.25 billion issuances attracted strong interest from a diverse group of conventional and green global investors despite market volatility at the time of offering. We will continue to issue green bonds regularly, and explore ways to involve more types of currencies, project types, issuance format and channels. We are also planning to issue retail bonds for the participation of the general public in driving together a low-carbon economy in Hong Kong.Green bonds by private issuers also constitute a large part of the green and sustainable finance ecosystem. We launched the Green & Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May this year to encourage issuance of more green and sustainable bonds and loans in Hong Kong and attract more financial and professional services providers and external reviewers to expand their presence in Hong Kong. So far, around 30 applications have been approved under the scheme covering various kinds of green and sustainable debt instruments.Talent and professionals in ESG are key to the success of building a green and more sustainable future. I announced in my Policy Address recently to add ""professionals in ESG"" to the Talent List to attract more talent in this respect outside Hong Kong. In addition, we will endeavour to include more courses related to ESG in the list of reimbursable courses under the Continuing Education Fund and incorporate more ESG-related topics in the business and finance programmes. Meanwhile, the Centre for Green & Sustainable Finance established by the Cross-Agency Steering Group is also co-ordinating efforts of financial regulators, government agencies, industry stakeholders and academia in promoting capacity building and talent development.In short, ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is determined to collaborate with our financial regulators and the industry participants to promote Hong Kong into a green and sustainable finance hub in the region. That is not only for driving financial and economic development in Hong Kong, but also for contributing to the global efforts in tackling climate change, which is vital for our planet and our future generations. I am sure I can count on your support in this regard.Chief Executive Carrie Lam gave these remarks at the HKEX Green Asia Summit 2021 - Path to Net Zero on December 9.Source: Hong Kong SAR Government\l"

The two talked via video last Wednesday, and Xi said he was ""looking forward"" to meeting Putin at the Games. Afterwards, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng confirmed it would be a face-to-face meeting. Since that time, Xi has not set foot outside the country or received any visiting foreigner in person. Xi and Putin were the only two government leaders not to attend the Group of 20 summit in Rome in October. COP26Observers said the meeting with Putin might offer a chance for Xi to gradually ease back into in-person diplomacy. ""It is the Winter Olympics and Xi is bound to attend, and when he does, meetings with foreign leaders appear inevitable,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington. ""I think this could signal the beginning of China's reopening after two years of restriction. ""Putin is special in the sense that China and Russia need to align with each other and provide support at a time that is difficult for both."" The pair's meeting will happen at a time of growing pressure from the West on both countries.

"COP26","China","COP26_China421","China means what it says in reducing carbon emissions: ambassador","October 28, 2021 Thursday","People's Daily Online - English","China is serious about reducing carbon emissions and pursuing green development, according to Chinese Ambassador to Britain. The country met its target for 2020 ahead of schedule as the carbon emissions intensity had come down by 48 percent by the end of last year compared with 2005. LONDON, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China will honor its pledges to reduce carbon emissions and any worries about it failing to do so is unnecessary, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Zheng Zeguang said in an article published on The Guardian on Wednesday. ""Anyone who knows China well is sure that my country is serious about reducing carbon emissions and pursuing green development, and that we mean what we say,"" Zheng said in the article published days ahead of the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland Last year, China announced that it will strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, he said. These commitments were reiterated last month at the UN general assembly, with the further announcement that China will not build any more coal-fired power stations overseas. Earlier this month, at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, known as COP15, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for joint efforts in building a community of all life on Earth, and proposed major policies for the preservation of biological diversity, he added. As a result of China's leadership, the Kunming declaration has been adopted and the Kunming biodiversity fund set up, with China committing an initial capital contribution of 1.5 billion yuan (about 235 million U.S. dollars), he said. ""This is a testimony to the resolve and determination of China's top leader to protect the ecosystem and tackle climate change,"" he said. Zheng noted that in China, it is already a national consensus that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are mountains of gold and silver"" -- an idea proposed by Xi. Ecological conservation has been one of the ""five prongs"" of the overall plan for the country's development since the 18th congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012. Anyone familiar with China's political system knows that once decisions and goals are set by the CPC central committee and the top leader, they are incorporated into the overall national development program, turned into feasible action plans and delivered faithfully by local governments and competent departments, the ambassador said, noting that is how the country has achieved its development miracle over the 72 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In terms of climate action, China met its target for 2020 ahead of schedule, he said. By the end of last year, carbon emissions intensity had come down by 48 percent compared with 2005, and non-fossil fuels accounted for 16 percent of primary energy consumption. China is also doing what it can to help build up climate response capabilities in developing countries, he said. From supporting Africa in monitoring the climate system with satellite technology and building low-carbon pilot zones in southeast Asia, to introducing energy-saving bulbs to small island countries, China's cooperation with less developed regions of the world has produced tangible results. China has also launched green action initiatives that encourage green infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework, he said. In 2020, 57 percent of China's energy investment in BRI partner countries went to renewable energy projects, up from 38 percent in 2019, he said, adding that such efforts will continue. Meanwhile, the ambassador said the international community should recognize that, for a developing country with a population of over 1.4 billion that has not completed industrialization or urbanization, the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the supporting policy measures that China has adopted voluntarily have not been easy. He expressed hope that the international community should aim to complete the negotiations of the Paris rulebook (market mechanisms in article six in particular) and push for progress on issues of concern to developing countries, namely adaptation and financing. The principles of equity -- common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities -- should be upheld. Developed countries with a couple of hundred years of industrialization behind them and historical environmental debts should make bigger contributions to tackling pollution and protecting the environment, instead of pinning the responsibility on China and other developing countries, he said. Developed countries must shoulder their obligations and take the lead in drastically cutting emissions -- a key to achieving global net-zero emissions, he said. They also need to help developing countries speed up the green and low-carbon transition by significantly increasing support to them through financing, technology and capacity building, and avoid putting up green trade barriers. ""All countries must keep their word rather than just pay lip service"" in order to strengthen international mutual trust, he said, noting that the longstanding pledge by developed countries to provide 100 billion dollars a year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020 has yet to be fulfilled. China and Britain, as countries of global influence, should work together to implement the important understanding between the leaders of the two countries, so as to strengthen the synergy between COP15 and COP26, contribute to a successful conference in Glasgow, and promote full and effective implementation of the Paris agreement, the ambassador said.\l"

This includes incentivising private investments in zero-emission solutions and committing to implementing mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Countries considered ""green"" have 2030 targets and policies consistent with 1.5 degrees or less of warming. The UK is the only G20 country whose 2030 target is consistent with 1.5 degrees of warming. More than half of G20 countries, including China, have targets and policies consistent with more than two degrees of warming. On net-zero emissions, the report said that seven G20 countries, including Indonesia and Australia, have not committed to net zero. And on the implementation and delivery of net-zero targets, apart from the EU, all of the other G20 countries that have committed to a net-zero target are considered ""insufficient"". On mandatory climate risk disclosure to ensure climate risk is effectively managed, only the UK and EU have committed to mandatory TCFD-aligned disclosure, the report shows. Other countries including China have no policy encouraging or enforcing TCFD reporting and investors are not required to report climate risk. China pledged last September to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-changecarbon neutrality before 2060.

Photo: XinhuaThe goal of reaching carbon neutrality before 2060 can help China avoid $134 trillion in climate change losses by 2100, said a study from Tsinghua University, which estimates that the country suffers from $50 billion financial losses annually caused by climate disasters, accounting for 0.4 percent of its GDP.\~Under existing commitments, the global temperature is estimated to rise three degrees by 2100, and climate losses will account for 5 percent of China's GDP and cumulative climate-related losses will reach $189 trillion, said a report by the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy at Tsinghua University, which was sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.Climate change is estimated to cause China $290 trillion of economic losses, and the country's goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 can avoid 80 percent of the losses, it said.\~China needs to make a huge effort to achieve carbon neutrality. Carbon neutrality targets can also avoid economic losses from climate change. Estimating climate-related losses would help China better achieve its carbon neutrality goal, said Teng Fei, a professor at the institute.\~In September, China set a goal of striving to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.The country issued a white paper in late October, which says that China's above-mentioned target marks the world's highest reduction in carbon emissions intensity and the shortest time in achieving the goal of going from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in global history.China submitted two documents on its nationally determined contributions and long-term emission control strategies to the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change before COP26 convened in Glasgow, Scotland earlier November.\~Climate scientists said that China is one of the countries bearing the largest burden of climate change disasters.\~Globally, about 70 percent of deaths caused by heat waves are among the elderly, and the percentage is even higher in China, with 77 percent of all 14,000 deaths resulting from heat waves in 2020 among people aged 65 and over, Cai Wenjia, director of the Lancet Countdown Regional Center for Asia and one of the lead authors of the 2021 China report, told the Global Times previously.From January to October, floods affected 58.9 million people nationwide, according to data released by the Ministry of Emergency Management on Monday, with 590 people dead and missing, 3.5 million people relocated, and 203,000 houses destroyed, resulting in 240 billion yuan ($37.5 billion) in losses.\~Yet China has become the target of criticism by many Western countries for not doing enough to tackle climate change. They always chide China for its carbon emissions, consumption of fossil fuels and so forth.Developing countries should have the opportunity to improve the lives of their people. This is where the 'stock' of greenhouse gas emissions matters. Developed countries have played the biggest role in causing climate change, and to let the rest of the world develop they have to acknowledge this, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times.\~""It is simply unfair for developed countries, which have relied on coal to fuel economic development that was unrestrained for centuries, to ask developing countries, which just started an economic takeoff, to abandon coal completely,"" said Lin.\l"
"COP26","China","COP26_China424","China and US can lead in climate talks","October 30, 2021 Saturday","South China Morning Post","There are daunting expectations of the global climate change summit beginning this weekend in Glasgow, partly because its predecessors have fallen short of coming to grips with the social, economic and humanitarian threats posed by global warming. The goal of the 13-day United Nations event, also known as COP26, is to ""bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement [of 2015]"". That is an admission the world is falling behind in the race to prevent a catastrophe.Even if all countries meet their targets to reduce emissions by 2030, the planet will still warm by at least 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century, according to a UN Environment Programme report. This is almost twice the internationally agreed target of 1.5 degrees to avert catastrophe, or at least well under 2 degrees. While global targets for net-zero emissions by mid-century could cut another 0.5 degree off global warming - a big improvement - temperatures would still rise 2.2 degrees this century.As a result there is pressure on big polluters such as China, the United States and India to set tougher targets, and on the rich world to do more to help poor countries. One measure of how the world is responding to the challenge is the performance of rich countries in meeting their commitments to compensate poor nations for the development costs of forsaking cheaper but emissions-heavy fossil fuels. They promised in 2009 to channel US$100 billion a year to less wealthy countries by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and reduce emissions. After still falling short by US$20 billion in 2019, they will not reach the target until 2023, according to the Climate Finance Delivery Plan to be submitted to the summit.Climate finance will be central to the success or failure of the summit, with China's environment vice-minister Ye Min saying the biggest obstacle to negotiations had been the disappointment of developing nations with progress on finance and climate change adaptation. Hopefully, developed nations will reach a deal to offer more help. There is a need for global leadership. One positive sign is that climate change is seen as one important area in which China and the US can improve tense relations.\l"

"COP26","China","COP26_China426","Halt to overseas coal projects an option for Beijing amid climate pressure","September 5, 2021 Sunday","South China Morning Post","China is under pressure to set more ambitious climate targets ahead of November's United Nations COP26 summit in Glasgow, with diplomats and negotiators calling on the country to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 - a decade earlier than pledged by President Xi Jinping last September.But climate experts said economic pressures made it unlikely Beijing would bring forward its carbon neutrality goal, suggesting an end to support for overseas coal power as a possible option for any new commitment before .Countries are being asked to bring ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets to the summit, to align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.The IPCC warned in 2018 that carbon emissions would need to fall by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 to reach net zero around 2050. Last month, a new IPCC report said it was still possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees with an immediate, rapid and large-scale reduction of all greenhouse gases, triggering the latest push for action this decade to avoid devastating climate disasters.The Glasgow summit is also aiming to mobilise finance and finalise the rules needed to implement the Paris Agreement, which requires signatories to update their emissions reduction targets every five years to reflect the highest possible ambition.China, along with other parties to the agreement, will update its 2030 targets before the summit and has also promised to submit revised short-term and long-term targets.US climate envoy John Kerry encouraged Beijing to do more to reduce emissions during a virtual meeting on Wednesday with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Kerry was on his second visit to China in five months, as part of US efforts to convince Beijing to speed up its curb on carbon emissions.There was similar urging at an webinar on climate change last month, when Lord Adair Turner, chairman of Britain's Energy Transitions Commission, called on China to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050.In response, Beijing's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said it was more important for countries to implement their commitments than to argue whether it should be 1.5 or 2 degrees. ""We already have a consensus, which is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, preferably to 1.5 degrees. There is no need for us to raise more controversy over this goal,"" he said.It is a view shared by Wang Wen, a professor at Nanjing's Hohai University and one of the lead authors of the IPCC report. ""We have the responsibility to reduce emissions, but China's rapid economic growth was reliant on high-emissions industries,"" he said. ""It is very tough to achieve carbon neutrality in three decades with rapid economic growth.""Byford Tsang, a climate diplomacy expert at London-based think tank E3G, said the challenge for China's decarbonisation was a reliance on coal power and polluting industries to drive growth. ""There is no need to rewrite the aspirations set out in the Paris Agreement. But we need to keep the 1.5 degrees target within reach to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.""According to Tsang, a formal announcement that it was ending support for coal power internationally would be a logical next step for China's overseas investment policies. ""China is the last remaining major financier of coal power internationally, after South Korea and Japan formally pledged to end their support. But demand for Chinese finance is shrinking,"" he said.""The pledge would also lend credibility to China's domestic climate targets and the country's status as an emerging global climate leader. It also offers an easier first step for Beijing to signal goodwill before it is ready to make similar pledges on domestic coal.""Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, also said a ban on the funding of overseas coal-fired power projects could be an option for any new commitment ahead of COP26.Xie sparked further discussion - and confusion - over China's carbon target when he told a Beijing financial forum in July the 2060 goal included all greenhouse gases. It is unclear what that means for China's carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets, and the ecology and environment ministry did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.According to the IPCC's 2018 report, if warming is to be limited to 1.5 degrees carbon dioxide emissions will need to reach net zero between 2044 and 2052, with total greenhouse gas emissions reaching net zero between 2063 and 2068 - in other words, carbon levels must hit the target 10 years ahead of greenhouse gases.China has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, which means it would need to reach net zero CO2 emissions around the middle of the century, according to another Chinese lead author for the IPCC report, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.In Tsang's view, Xie's remarks were meant ""as a clarification, not a new commitment"", while former US climate change envoy Todd Stern said he doubted Xie had intended to suggest China would reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\l"

It is more about whether the world\' s dominant powers can establish a relationship that enables reasonable dialogue and even cooperation.In the Xi-Biden phone call on September 9, the two agreed there was too little communication between Beijing and Washington.

""We were all a bit nervous trying to work out what we should say, but in the end, it was all very easy. He put us all at ease immediately.""

But there is a small problem. The narrative is false - even as the Financial Times' Gideon Rachman gave it a robust airing recently after China's President Xi Jinping opted not to fly to the HYPERLINK G20 and HYPERLINK COP26 summits. ""Xi's dismissive attitude to the climate talks was not so much Middle Kingdom as middle finger,"" said Rachman. ""The Chinese leader's refusal to travel to Glasgow for COP26 ... is part of a broader pattern of national self-isolation. ""The effects on international business [of China's self-isolation] are already apparent. China continues to trade and invest with the outside world. But business ties are fraying."" Setting aside Rachman's contestable claims that international executives are HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3154903/chinas-covid-19-isolation-takes-toll-foreign-bodies-risks-itsleaving China and that Hong Kong's role as a global business centre has taken a battering, his claims of China's self-isolation are emphatically misplaced. In the first nine months of this year, HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3152141/china-trade-export-growth-stronger-expected-septemberChina's exports grew by nearly 24 per cent, with imports up by 26 per cent. Utilised foreign direct investment (FDI), at US$113 billion to the end of August, was up by nearly 28 per cent. China remains among the top FDI destinations worldwide. These are not the sort of trade and investment numbers that suggest disengagement. Ironically, Rachman's article coincided with the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3155627/chinas-top-import-fair-reports-first-contraction-debut-2018China International Import ExpoIronic, too, that the article coincided with Alibaba's HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3155403/alibabas-singles-day-shopping-bonanza-loses-lustre-amid-chinas-bigSingles' Day shopping extravaganzaThe facts Rachman used to suggest China's growing isolationism can be perfectly explained without resorting to any world-stability-threatening narrative. Xi did not fly to Rome or Glasgow. But neither he nor any of the other six members of the Politburo Standing Committee have left China since the pandemic. One can complain about the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3154464/chinas-zero-covid-19-policy-becoming-heavy-burden-some-localseverity of China's Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions, and the dislocation for Chinese and foreign businesses alike, but it is crass to suggest this is part of a devious plan to purge China of foreigners and foreign businesses - still less to snub the climate summit or dismiss the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions. The more serious claims of China turning inward focus on the Made in China agenda and dual circulation policy. But you don't need a xenophobic mindset to justify them. China's policymakers have long recognised that the low-value-adding assembly role they captured in global manufacturing supply chains was a mug's game. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3134270/us-china-tech-war-rages-washington-debates-steps-beyond-just-blockingDenied access to the innovation- and technology-intensive high-value-adding roles reserved for Western workforces, China means to capture higher value-adding roles in the supply chain, lifting its technology input and generating higher workforce incomes. These higher incomes aim to reduce poverty and build a strong domestic consumer economy. The US trade war against China reinforced Chinese paranoia over its manufacturing sector's vulnerabilities. When the US government is blocking access to HYPERLINK semiconductors and your hi-tech enterprises rely on foreign suppliers for 85 per cent of their needs, the logical response is to reduce that vulnerability - an astute response to a clearly defined commercial threat. Dual circulation is also nothing to do with xenophobia or splendid isolation but a recognition that China's consumer market is globally significant and potentially a strong economic driver. That domestic consumption accounted for just 39 per cent of China's economy last year, compared with about 50 per cent in the European Union and 67 per cent in the United States, screams the reality that China's consumer economy has a long way to grow. A policy focused on strengthening domestic consumption makes good sense. Meanwhile, China's commitment to engagement with the global economy has been glaringly consistent for the past 30 years. Deep engagement in the World Trade Organization, World Health Organization and across UN bodies - including sending over 50,000 troops to nearly 30 UN peacekeeping missions since 1990, more than any other permanent Security Council member - proves China's multilateral commitment, not to mention intensive engagement in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3154659/rcep-trade-deal-reaches-milestone-after-ratificationRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and efforts to build the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3139659/how-west-can-learn-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-and-vice-versaBelt and Road InitiativeOver the past month, Xi has had calls with Japan's HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3151687/china-and-japan-should-properly-handle-sensitive-issues-xiFumio Kishida, Germany's HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3152497/chinese-leader-xi-jinping-continues-eu-engagement-drive-talksAngela Merkel, Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong, the EU's Charles Michel, France's HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3153796/xi-jinping-and-emmanuel-macron-speak-first-time-aukus-allianceEmmanuel Macron and Britain's Boris Johnson.

"COP26","China","COP26_China438","Deal on climate and leaders' summit bode well for China-US ties","November 15, 2021 Monday","South China Morning Post","It is too soon to say whether the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, will be remembered more for its achievements or its disappointments. That may become clearer next year with governments' responses to a call at the summit agreement for parties to return with stronger plans to curb carbon emissions and much more financing to help poor nations cope with the costs of damage due to climate change.One thing certain to be remembered is the defusing of a threat of decoupling on climate between the world's two biggest polluters, China and the United States. Their joint declaration to cooperate on climate change - between a developing nation and a developed rival - not only removed a potentially impassable roadblock to an effective global response but boosted momentum towards greater consensus between rich and poor, the powerful and the weak.In reality, the ambitious goals in early drafts of the summit declaration were never achievable in less than two weeks in Glasgow. The new deal therefore will not, on its own, meet the threat of global warming. It aims to sustain hopes of achieving the goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate, to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It was forged by compromise reflected in the choice of language to water down commitments, such as ""phasing down"" instead of ""phasing out"" the use of coal, and the phasing out of ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies. The insertion of ""inefficient"" leaves the door open for self-serving interpretation.China and the US have promised to cooperate on forming regulatory frameworks to reduce emissions, cut methane emissions, protect forests and improve technology and information exchange. This means addressing details such as the sharing of responsibility between rich and poor, strong and weak. The more the two can work together, on this issue at least, the sooner the world can expect to have global standards and rules - on green finance for example. This has long been the subject of debate on what kind of business qualifies as green, so the green capital market can respond, to the benefit of smaller economies. Currently China, the US and the European Union have their own standards.Given there is little immediate prospect of progress between Beijing and Washington on intractable issues such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea, the two powers need to focus on areas where they can make progress in bilateral relations. Climate change is low-hanging fruit, along with economic and financial cooperation. Their agreement on climate is a positive sign ahead of the virtual leaders' summit scheduled for tomorrow (Hong Kong time). Hopefully, it signals a building of momentum towards stabilising the world's most important bilateral relationship.\l"

Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday revealed the government's ""uniquely Australian"" plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Under the plan, which will not be legislated, about 20 billion Australian dollars (15 billion U.S. dollars) will be invested in low-emissions technologies by 2030. It was revealed after the National Party, the junior partner in the governing Coalition with Morrison's Liberals, on Sunday confirmed ""in principle"" support for a net zero target in the lead-up to the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, in Glasgow.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the price of the technology would reduce in time and offered no subsidies to buyers of electric cars. ""The costs of technology are coming down, and that means the choices available to Australians and right around the world are becoming more accessible, so our plans are all about supporting those choices,"" Morrison said. ""Our plans aren't about sending a lot of taxpayers' money off to big multinationals to get costs down. They'll do that themselves. They've a keen interest in doing that,"" he added. The 250 million Australian dollar ($185 million) plan would partner with private enterprise to accelerate the rollout of 50,000 charging and hydrogen refueling stations. The conservative government expects that would result in 30% of new passenger and light commercial truck sales in Australia being battery electric or plug-in hybrid electric by 2030. Less than 2% of new vehicles sold in Australia are electric, and the transport sector is a major reason why Australia, on a per capita basis, is one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters. Electric vehicle groups expressed disappointment at the policy. Electric Vehicles Council chief executive Behyad Jafari, an advocate for the electric vehicle industry in Australia, described the policy as a ""fizzer"" that lacked initiatives to boost uptake. The opposition center-left Labor Party went to the last election in 2019 with a target of 50% of new cars being electric by 2030. Morrison argued at the time that Labor's policy would ""end the weekend"" because electric vehicles could not tow boats and caravans or replace SUVs. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said if Labor wins elections due by May, his government would make electric vehicles cheaper by reducing taxes on them. ""The government ..., during the last campaign, said that electric vehicles would 'end the weekend,' and now ... in the lead-up to an election campaign, they want you to believe that now electric vehicles are all okay and they want to encourage uptake,"" Albanese said. ""Well, they can't have it both ways. This is a government that is scared of change,"" he added. At the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, known as COP26, Morrison committed Australia to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. But he was widely criticized for leaving Australia's 2030 target unchanged at the relatively modest aim of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels.

"COP26","China","COP26_China444","More method than madness in China's tech sector crackdown","December 13, 2021 Monday","South China Morning Post","The Chinese used to be described by Westerners as ""inscrutable"" and it is certainly not easy to discern Beijing's real motives in cracking down on the activities of high-flying tech entrepreneurs at home and overseas. But it is possible to detect pragmatism rather than ideology behind its recent actions. Consider the impact that the apotheosis of tech entrepreneurs has had on Western financial markets and economies where capital tends to flow very largely into areas dictated by fashion and which can create dangerous vulnerabilities instead of supporting ""real economy"" needs. This is illustrated clearly by the example that just five tech stocks account for no less than 20 per cent of the entire capitalisation of the benchmark S&P 500 stock index on Wall Street where they are worth more than a combined US$7 trillion. These are the famous five, also known as FAANG - an acronym that refers to the stocks of Meta (FB) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG) (formerly known as Google). The heads of some of these and other shooting-star companies are feted and worshipped while Chinese counterparts like Jack Ma (retired founder of Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the Post) or Cheng Wei (Didi Chuxing) are being cut down to size. Stargazing in Western markets creates vulnerabilities, as is obvious from the fickleness of investor appetites for tech stocks. This first manifested during the dotcom bubble, which burst some 20 years ago, from which markets were rescued only by monetary intervention. But what of the argument that the boom also serves to divert investment from critical areas of market economies, such as infrastructure building and grappling with climate change? Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempt to launch a US$1 trillion infrastructure rescue plan and his successor Joe Biden's need to ask taxpayers rather than financial markets to foot the bill are clear evidence of market failure. The situation with regards to financing the mega battle against climate change is even more egregious. Calls for a proportionately huge diversion of private capital into this critical area reached a crescendo at the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow. That money belongs not to the alliance as such but to millions of people who own shares via mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies etc. It will not be available for purposes such as climate change mitigation while it is being lured into tech stock bubbles, however flashy their attractions may appear. There is another important dimension to the debate over the degree of influence that freewheeling entrepreneurs should be able to exert over capital allocation in an economy. The ""cult of the equity"" in Western stock markets has arguably been allowed to go too far, to the point where trillions of portfolio-investor dollars rush into grossly overvalued shares because everyone is piling in and others cannot afford to be left out. This is partly due to the failure of the financial industry and its generally overpaid executives to come up with a more imaginative and responsible array of financial instruments designed to channel savings into long-term investment projects rather than into short-term speculative investment. Those who believe that China's crackdown on such speculative areas of tech are motivated by envy among the political classes of business entrepreneurs, or by a new kind of Cultural Revolution, will probably not be swayed, but there is clearly method in China's ""madness"" towards its markets. Western financial markets need to take note. Anthony Rowley is a veteran journalist specialising in Asian economic and financial affairs\l"

"COP26","China","COP26_China447","Thinking that forests worth more dead than alive must end","November 5, 2021 Friday","South China Morning Post","A political pledge from more than 100 world leaders to end deforestation and land degradation by 2030 is the first major outcome of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow. Trees help to mitigate warming temperatures by absorbing carbon emissions. The farming and mining that takes place when they are removed leads to increases in greenhouse gases. But promises are empty without action and success of initiatives can only be gauged through delivery and monitoring.The countries that have signed the declaration account for more than 85 per cent of the world's forests and include the biggest polluters, China and the United States, and nations with significant endangered tree cover, among them Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. They have committed to ""working collectively to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation"". The pledge includes almost US$19 billion in public and private funds to protect and restore forests. CEOs from more than 30 financial institutions have committed to eliminating investment in activities linked to deforestation.This is the cooperation President Xi Jinping was referring to in his written address on Monday to the 26th UN climate conference, known as COP26, which is widely perceived as a final chance to ensure temperatures are capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as agreed in the 2015 Paris accord. He called on developed countries to ""help developing countries do better"" and urged governments to take stronger action to ""jointly tackle the climate challenge"". That desire was on show in the pledge by leaders, but climate experts worry that the necessary will could be lacking. A similar promise made in New York in 2014 failed to slow the removal of forests, which some estimate are now disappearing at the rate of the size of a football pitch every two seconds.Forests form a huge carbon store and help regulate weather and climate. More than half the world's species live in them and billions of people need them for food, livelihoods and shelter. But they are being cleared at a relentless pace to grow crops such as palm oil, soya and cocoa, create pastures for cattle and other livestock, and mining. Many scientists believe halting deforestation is crucial to keeping temperatures in check. Signing an agreement is only the start; there has to be commitment, resolve and for those involved in deforestation, disclosure of activities and reporting on progress. Policymakers and regulators have an important role. Until the thinking that forests are financially worth more dead than alive is reversed, global warming will worsen and all suffer.\l"

(PHOTO / XINHUA)China-United States interaction these days has not been as constructive as it needs to be for any productive engagement. And the economic woes universally felt amid the pandemic have not been conducive to any new, significant commitments at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, generating a generally gloomy mood.So the unveiling of a joint agreement on cooperation to accelerate climate actions and tackle global warming by the climate envoys of China and the US on Wednesday has come as a pleasant and welcome surprise to many.These are precisely what Beijing has insisted are part of the obligations China and the US must shoulder as ""major countries"".It is a growing consensus that the window of opportunity is rapidly closing for meaningful actions to mitigate global warming before it is too late. Any further feet-dragging will be devastating to the future of all life on Earth. It is reassuring to hear from the two key emitters that they ""recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"", especially during the ""critical decade of the 2020s"", and will work together.The newly reached agreement on climate cooperation will certainly inspire constructive interactions between the two sides, and facilitate more sensible, responsible actions, which in itself will be a boost to the global climate response. More important, they may provide fine leadership that has exemplary impacts worldwide.It is no secret that there has been a protracted, though fruitless, blame game going on between Beijing and Washington, over but not limited to who should have done what. That they seem to have more or less returned to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as well as taking into account national conditions represents a significant step forward.A gap exists not only between the current efforts and the Paris Agreement's requirements, but also between countries' rhetoric and actions. Hopefully, the joint will being demonstrated by China and the US can be translated into practical actions that will start to remedy this.\l"

I was having to bring my boy in bed beside me, just because I couldn\' t afford to put the heating on, Osborne said.  It\' s meant to be my forever home with my child, and I can\' t afford to live here now. A spokesperson for the Home Group Scotland housing association that owns and manages the property said it was working to resolve issues with heating in some flats, and offering support to tenants who had received high bills.Several miles up the road, Tizo Seleman, 40, and his partner Saada Mwalimu, both care workers who live with their baby daughter in a high-rise block in Glasgow\' s northern Springburn district, expect their once-onerous heating bills to shrink.In July, their inefficient old heaters were replaced with a low-carbon air-source heat pump system  part of a bid by their social housing landlord to make heat cheaper for tenants and slash climate-changing emissions.  I think it will make a real difference, and I will get some savings, predicted Seleman.In cities around the world, making existing homes more energy efficient and switching them to run on green power is a big challenge, as the world tries to slash carbon emissions.Glasgow, a former industrial hub that will host the key COP26 UN climate negotiations this November, is one of those trying to drive the shift as part of the C40 Cities network, a group of nearly 100 major cities worldwide working for faster action on climate change.The cities have each committed to delivering climate action plans designed to spur uptake of clean energy, boost adaptation to climate threats and turn the Paris Agreement into a reality.In Glasgow, which has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, that includes pulling water-source heat from the city\' s river, improving public transport and planting more trees.It also is working to find ways to make homes climate-smart, comfortable and cheaper to heat, while ensuring those least able to afford the green shift are not left out.That is not an easy job in a port city noted for its cold winters, where around a quarter of residents pay more than 10 percent of their income for heat, and restrictions on how historic homes can be modified make retrofits challenging. If people are left behind, then it\' s not going to tackle emissions, said James Roberts of Living Rent, a renters\' union that works with low and middle-income people.About 15 percent of Scotland\' s emissions come from heating homes, which makes finding low-carbon ways to keep families warm a priority, as Britain aims to slash its emissions by 78 percent by 2035.  It is one of our biggest climate justice issues, said Susan Aitken, leader of the Glasgow City Council.The council wants to ensure efforts to decarbonize also speed up  the way in which we are addressing some of these long-standing social and economic inequalities , she added.While Glasgow looks to the future, its streets are largely shaped by its past.The city is known for its sweeping terraces of red and blonde sandstone tenements  properties built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that contain multiple flats and make up about a fifth of Glasgow\' s homes, according to the council.The tenements  beloved for their high ceilings, original fireplaces and other features  are also considered chilly and sometimes damp, while their stonework and historical features make efficiency upgrades more challenging.But one inner-city project aims to produce a blueprint for revamping them to modern energy-efficiency standards without losing their character.An eight-flat tenement in Glasgow\' s southern Govanhill District has been stripped back to its bare bones for a deep retrofit. The work includes new insulation for walls, floors and the roof, plus triple-glazed windows and air-source heat pumps.The retrofit aims to reduce energy bills for homeowners by up to 90 percent. How the building functions will be monitored by researchers, with data used to inform future tenement upgrades. This is the first of its kind. That\' s why it\' s exciting  but it\' s also challenging, said Drew Carr from John Gilbert Architects, which is leading work for the Southside Housing Association.As Glasgow looks for new green energy sources, it is turning in part to the wide Clyde River that winds through its centre.In much the same way as air-source heat devices work, large water-source heat pumps could draw residual heat from the Clyde, which would then be piped to homes and businesses, providing a lower-carbon alternative to traditional heating systems.This method could meet half the city\' s total heating demand, estimates social enterprise Greenspace Scotland, which is running a project to explore how urban green spaces and water can provide low-carbon energy. The river is already fueling one district heat network serving homes and businesses just outside Glasgow, and another planned system will power a high-tech  innovation district in the center.One catch is that although renewable systems can compete on price with heat produced from fossil-fuel electricity, the gas boilers that still warm most homes remain even cheaper.Largely thanks to plentiful fracking supplies, fossil-fuel gas costs about 3 pence per kilowatt-hour compared to an average of about 17 pence for electricity, said John Maslen of Greenspace Scotland.Ensuring a switch away from gas to meet climate change goals does not increase fuel poverty might require a major subsidy scheme for poorer households, he added.As leaders prepare to gather at the COP26 talks in Glasgow to hammer out rules designed to ramp up emissions cuts, one crucial question will be how to finance it all. The huge issue with a \' just transition\' and retrofitting is who\' s going to pay? said Michael Mikulewicz, a researcher at the Centre for Climate Justice at Glasgow Caledonian University.Glasgow City Council leader Aitken said reaching the city\' s aim of net-zero emissions by 2030 is likely to require about 30 billion pounds of investment, including 5 billion pounds just to retrofit homes to higher efficiency standards. Governments alone can\' t deliver this. We need to have private investment come in, she said.The city will launch an investment prospectus around the time of the conference, laying out 10 major projects. Glasgow will work to make the voices of city leaders heard at the summit, Aitken said, calling cities crucial players in the race to reach net-zero goals. Cities are where most of the emissions are generated, because it\' s where most of the people are  but it\' s also where you get the biggest gains in decarbonization the fastest, she said.\l"

[Photo/Agencies]The key to carbon pricing is sending a clear signal to market players, while market players need to play a key role in the actual formulation of carbon prices, experts said.While speaking on Monday via video at a subsession during the ongoing COP 26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, the United Kingdom, Zhu Xian, vice-president and general secretary of the International Finance Forum (IFF), noted that while governments of all countries have been putting great efforts into carbon pricing, actions should also be taken by market players, particularly from the private sector.""Their role in the formulation of carbon pricing is equally important. And this is particularly the case for developing countries, like China,"" he said.Zhu urged that a proper benchmark for carbon pricing is particularly important, because ""without a benchmark, the market cannot really get a signal to do the right things.""In developing countries, since the scope of the market is relatively small, he believes it is more important for them to get prepared in infrastructure building, such as information disclosure. He believes developed economies like the European Union have gained rich experience in this respect and can share this with countries like China.""This will save time for China and other emerging market countries to do the right things, and then eventually make the process much smoother,"" he said.He also believes that as China's current carbon market is still relatively small and still restricted to energy companies, it can be expanded to other sectors -- including important ones such as steel, cement and the shipping industry -- so that the role of carbon pricing can be more widely leveraged.Tom Howes, head of the Energy and Environment Division at the International Energy Agency (IEA), also believes that carbon pricing will be a flexible tool to help deliver a signal for change.""It will be an effective tool for getting markets to change their behavior. And as it is flexible, the market will be able to plan investment horizons well in advance,"" he said.He urged governments of all countries to take swift action so that market players will get clearer signals.""Governments need to move from the pledges to the road maps, strategies and policies they're going to use. Carbon pricing can easily be a part of their own domestic measures,"" he said. ""All countries will need to introduce measures. All countries can benefit from the introduction of carbon pricing. We need to start taking action in the short term to make sure we do start to implement it and see changes in a very short period of time.""\l"

Mori made the remarks in Glasgow, Scotland, as negotiators met for the second week at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ""We are a victim as a consequence of their activities,"" Mori said. ""It is totally unfair that while we are bracing ourselves as to how we could be able to mitigate, the developed world are continuously emitting greenhouse gases in the quest basically to advance the livelihood, while we are suffering the consequences."" The Pacific island country is a direct victim of climate change. According to the minister, the oceans have become ""highly acidic"" due to the intemperatures. ""We have lost our marine stock in terms of tuna. Furthermore, we have seen, given the rise in the temperatures, buildup of wind that leads to storm, tornadoes and cyclones."" Meanwhile, the country's infrastructure is also being damaged by global warming, with a loss of ""a lot of the segments of our road transport infrastructure"", which requires about 100 to 200 million U.S. dollars a year just to maintain, said the minister. However, the developed countries -- which built their wealth by burning fossil fuels and accounted most for the climate crisis -- have failed to deliver their promise of 100 billion dollars a year to help lower-income nations to tackle climate change by 2020, among other pledges. ""They have got to also be part of the mitigation processes and adaptations. They have got to compensate those countries that have been impacted by climate change in the area of mitigation and adaptation,"" he sid. ""We want them to play a more significant role so that they can help those countries that are impacted by climate change to add up to a new normal. Otherwise, it's totally unfair.""

These variables keep on changing,"" Li said.""I feel lucky in the sense that I sort of see a complete cycle - the different political dynamics; the positive and negative aspects; the progress and the challenges.""The world is now at a \£dcrossroads at the 26th United \£dNations Climate Change \£dConference (COP26A UN report this year warned that there was a 50-50 chance \£dglobal temperatures would rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next two decades.It warned that without rapid efforts to cut emissions, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees Celsius above \£dpre-industrial levels by the end of this century would be beyond reach, and said countries needed to take aggressive action to curb carbon emissions beyond 2030.Meanwhile, countries have to submit new or updated emissions reduction commitments, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions, before COP26.""Globally there is no question that 1.5 degrees Celsius is what we need to be seeking,"" said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute (WRI).Under the Paris agreement, countries agreed to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, and limit warming to 1.5 \£ddegrees. But some developed and vulnerable countries have urged the international community to go further, by limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century and reaching net-zero emissions by around 2050.An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2019 showed a number of \£dclimate change effects could be avoided by limiting global \£dwarming to 1.5 degrees. Between 10 and 30 per cent of coral reefs would survive, for example, while virtually all would be lost with a two-degree rise.Another report by the IPCC in August warned that global \£dwarming was already causing record numbers of droughts and floods around the world and that the situation would only get worse without action.Despite the urgency of these warnings, international tensions and domestic political concerns are still a complicating factor in the climate negotiations.China submitted its emissions reduction commitments to the United Nations on Thursday, in which it reiterated President Xi Jinping's pledges at a UN \£dconference last year to reach peak emissions by 2030 and make China carbon neutral by 2060, \£ddisappointing many observers.""Six years after the Paris Agreement, China's choice epitomises the lack of determination to step up climate action among some of the major economies,"" Greenpeace's Li said.""It also reflects Beijing's doubts about the US ability to \£dfulfil its carbon reduction and \£dclimate finance targets. There's real fear that Washington's empty words will intensify an already \£dunfair global climate order.""Domestic concerns may also have been a factor following the recent power crunch that affected more than half of China's \£dprovinces and highlighted the \£ddifficulties of moving away from fuels such as coal.In mid-October, the National Development and Reform \£dCommission, the country's top economic planning agency, said the country's coal output had hit its highest levels this year - at 11.6 million tonnes a day. Reuters \£dcalculated that the total coal \£doutput could reach an all-time high this month if the existing pace of production continued.Li also warned that the US might only be able to offer \£d""rhetorical leadership"" if \£dPresident Joe Biden could not get the country's two main pledges - to halve emissions by 2030 and to double climate finance to \£ddeveloping countries by 2024 - through Congress.""The US' biggest problem is rhetorical leadership, and \£dwhether it can turn this rhetorical leadership into leadership in \£daction depends on the Congress,"" he added.The increased rivalry between China and the US has also made climate engagement harder, \£daccording to observers.""Back in 2015 when the Paris Agreement was adopted, the US and China were in a honeymoon period and the two countries were willing to reach a consensus and make breakthroughs on climate issues,"" Li said. ""Now these political conditions no longer exist.""The underlying question is how to make progress. Unlike some developed countries, China has not offered clear support for the 1.5-degree target - a stance that may be down to its own levels of economic and industrial \£ddevelopment.""We do not actively promote the revision of this target, nor do we oppose it,"" said Wang Mou, a \£dresearcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.""From China's stage of \£ddevelopment as well as its future development demands, I think it is unnecessary for us to actively promote the 1.5 degree process.""Wang also said that China's target of achieving carbon \£dneutrality by 2060 was more \£dambitious than the two-degree target.Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China, said his \£dinstitute had concluded there was a high chance that China would reach peak emissions by 2025 after analysing provincial data from 2010 to 2018.Research carried out by the WRI last year reached a similar conclusion - that China could reach peak emissions by 2026 - and could benefit economically over the long term by \£dstrengthening its climate and \£denergy policies now.""China is correct that nations must focus on implementation.

They get to talk up their commitments to a green and clean future without being held to account for their disproportionate role in fueling the problem. It\' s hard for experts, let alone the average citizen, to tell fact from fiction.Because it\' s only domestic greenhouse-gas emissions that are counted for the purpose of the UN climate negotiations, burning exported fossil fuels counts toward the emissions of the importing country. Accordingly, the role that major fossil-fuel exporters like Saudi Arabia (oil and natural gas) and Australia (coal and natural gas) play in stoking global heating is not accurately reflected in the talks.Unlike some areas of international cooperation, such as limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, climate-change summits aim to control something that evades easy calculation.

The analysis was undertaken by the HYPERLINK Global Carbon ProjectThe fast recovery in CO emissions, following last year\' s HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/global-emissions-are-down-by-an-unprecedented-7-but-dont-start-celebrating-just-yet-151757sharp drop, should come as no surprise. The world\' s strong economic rebound has created a surge in demand for energy, and the global energy system is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels.Most concerning is the long-term upward trends of CO emissions from oil and gas, and this year\' s growth in coal emissions, which together are far from trending towards net-zero by 2050. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SE-Asia-Climate-Change-Vulnerability-Map-ResearchGate-e1578478592838.png?resize=780%2C523&ssl=1Link to ImageThe global emissions pictureGlobal CO emissions from fossil fuels dropped by 5.4% in 2020, compared with the previous year. But they are set to increase by about 4.9% above 2020 levels this year, reaching 36.4 billion tonnes. This brings them almost back to 2019 levels.We can expect another 2.9 billion tonnes of CO emissions this year from the net effect of everything we do to the land, including deforestation, degradation and re-vegetation.This brings us to a total of 39.4 billion tonnes of CO to be emitted by the end of this year.The fast growth in emissions matches the corresponding large increase in energy demand as the global economy opens up, with the help of HYPERLINK US$17.2 trillion in economic stimulus packages around the world.CO emissions from all fossil fuel types (coal, oil and natural gas) grew this year, with emissions from coal and natural gas set to grow more in 2021 than they fell in 2020.Emissions from global coal use were declining before the pandemic hit in early 2020 but they surged back this year. Emissions from global gas use have returned to the rising trend seen before the pandemic.CO emissions from global oil use remain well below pre-pandemic levels but are expected to increase in coming years as road transport and aviation recover from Covid-related restrictions. Nations leading the emissions chargeEmissions from China have recovered faster than other countries. It\' s among the few countries where emissions grew in 2020 (by 1.4%) followed by a projected growth of 4% this year.Taking these two years together, CO emissions from China in 2021 are projected to be 5.5% above 2019 levels, reaching 11.1 billion tonnes. China accounted for 31% of global emissions in 2020.Coal emissions in China are estimated to grow by 2.4% this year. If realized, it would match what was thought to be China\' s peak coal emissions in 2013.India\' s CO emissions are projected to grow even faster than China\' s this year at 12.6%, after a 7.3% fall last year. Emissions this year are set to be 4.4% above 2019 levels \- reaching 2.7 billion tonnes. India accounted for 7% of global emissions in 2020.Emissions from both the US and European Union are projected to rise 7.6% this year. It would lead to emissions that are, respectively, 3.7% and 4.2% below 2019 levels.US and EU, respectively, accounted for 14% and 7% of global emissions in 2020.Emissions in the rest of the world (including all international transport, particularly aviation) are projected to rise 2.9% this year, but remain 4.2% below 2019 levels. Together, these countries represent 59% of global emissions.The remaining carbon budgetThe relatively large changes in annual emissions over the past two years have had no discernible effect in the speed at which CO accumulates in the atmosphere.CO concentrations, and associated global warming, are driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases \- particularly CO \- since the beginning of the industrial era. This accumulation has accelerated in recent decades.To stop further global warming, global CO emissions must stop or reach net-zero \- the latter meaning that any remaining CO emissions would have to be compensated for by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Carbon budgets are a useful way of measuring how much CO can be emitted for a given level of global warming. In our latest analysis, we updated the carbon budget outl"

Weber | China Daily | Updated: 2022-01-10 09:36A view of the wind turbines installed on Nanpeng Island, Guangdong province, in August. [Photo/China Daily]Long before COVID-19 took a grip on our society, the risks presented by a possible pandemic were well known. And yet the world as a whole proved unprepared to deal with the situation. We can learn from this by taking better precautions against other potentially catastrophic risks we already know we face. I'm thinking in particular of climate change.The Paris Agreement seeks to avert potentially catastrophic and irreversible damage to our ecosystem by limiting the global rise in temperatures to well below 2 C above preindustrial levels. But achieving its objectives won't be easy. In fact, it will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy.China is making an essential contribution to these efforts with its dual carbon goals. This commitment sees China's carbon emissions peaking by 2030 and the country achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. And this kind of energy transition, both in China and around the world, will require massive amounts of capital.The scale, pace and geographic range of growth needed in green capital markets to provide the necessary capital are unprecedented. UBS estimates that converting the global energy system alone will require cumulative investment of between $120 trillion and $160 trillion by 2050. This is equivalent in size to the current capitalization of the global stock market.Sustainable finance is gaining momentum everywhere. Last year, for example, global green and sustainable development-related bond market issuances were up 112 percent year-on-year. And China's green bond issuance is already the second-largest in the world after the US, even though the official statistics only account for half of the total green bonds issued in China. It's clear that significant progress has been made. But I see three prerequisites for sustainable finance to continue growing in the long term.First of all, financial markets must be further opened to foreign investors and foreign financial institutions, as available capital does not match the investment needs of all countries. For example, around half of the total investment needed to meet the Paris Agreement's climate targets is in Asia. That's more than the combined investment needs of Europe and the US.China's plans for further financial market opening-up will help pave the way for global banks to make a greater contribution to the country in meeting its investment needs by bringing in both their expertise and international investors. Professional knowledge and global rating systems can, for example, help Chinese firms to improve their ESG ratings and catch up with global peers. At the same time, global banks can give responsible Chinese investors access to sustainable investment opportunities outside of China that are still, to a large degree, out of reach due to current regulatory restrictions.Second, there's an urgent need for international coordination and the alignment of standards for climate risk-related regulation\u-243 in particular climate risk disclosure standards for corporate issuers, financial institutions and financial products. Regulatory fragmentation causes high implementation costs. And we must be vigilant against the risk of turning sustainable finance into a compliance exercise or a significant obstacle to cross-border capital flows, precisely at a time when such flows are so critical.China is playing an important role in initiatives that improve international coordination and facilitate crucial international capital flows. The IFRS International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) announced at COP26 it may set up an office in Beijing. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, is a founding member of the Network for Greening the Financial System. And the G20 Working Group on Sustainable Finance was launched during China's G20 presidency in 2016 and is now co-chaired by the PBOC and the US Treasury.The third prerequisite is that while financial markets and financial institutions play an important role in the transition as an intermediary between the supply and demand of capital, the main impetus for the real economy to embark on the necessary transition must come from government policies and incentive structures\u-243 above all a single and comprehensive price for carbon. In fact, a carbon price is the only way to reach our ambitious climate goals, as a pricing mechanism works far more efficiently than directives, restrictions and subsidies.Nevertheless, policies and regulations have a role to play in encouraging innovation, as new technologies\u-243 some of which are yet to exist\u-243 will be crucial in reducing carbon emissions. UBS sees China particularly well-positioned in fields such as renewables equipment makers and operators, energy storage operators, electric vehicle makers, battery makers, grid equipment makers and hydrogen gas providers. And increasing domestic and global investment demand for these technologies represents a significant growth opportunity for China.The national emissions trading system launched in 2021 is already the largest in the world and covers approximately 40 percent of China's total emissions. China is also a major voluntary carbon project developer. International demand will shift focus increasingly toward nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage capacity. This creates a significant opportunity for China to develop additional carbon offset projects. The recently introduced carbon emissions reduction facility of the PBOC will further help to fund efforts in achieving stated dual carbon goals.The road to net zero is long and challenging. And the reduction of carbon emissions is one of the defining challenges of our time. UBS has long been at the forefront of sustainable finance. As the world's largest manager of private wealth, we're ready to enable and facilitate the transformation toward a more sustainable future. So are our clients, as evidenced by the large growth of our ESG investor base and of our range of investment products.

"COP26","China","COP26_China463","Developed countries must honor their promise: China Daily editorial","November 14, 2021 Sunday","China Daily","chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-11-14 20:00A person walks past a projection during the UN Climate Change Conference () in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 1, 2021. [Photo/Agencies]The Glasgow Climate Pact that was adopted at COP 26 on Saturday will hopefully prove to be a milestone for the global response to climate change, as it acknowledges that the emissions commitments made by countries so far are nowhere near what are needed to avert this existential threat to humans and other life on Earth.In reaching a consensus on the need to come up with increased targets and actions to prevent planetary warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, although it has not yet averted the impending climate cataclysm, has hopefully set us on the path to doing so.Especially as the pact for the first time calls on countries to reduce their reliance on coal and stop subsidizing fossil fuels. And a promise has been made to end deforestation by 2030.What has added to this encouraging news is the joint declaration in the final days of COP 26 by China and the United States on enhancing responses to climate change in the 2020s.With a ray of hope in sight that the temperature rise can be kept to the 1.5 C target, it is important for all countries to take real actions. China has already made specific plans to ensure that its CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and it achieves carbon neutrality before 2060.However, whether developed countries will deliver on their commitment to supporting developing countries in their adaptation to and responding to climate change is the key to averting catastrophe. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion a year to help lower-income nations by 2020. However, they still have not made good on this pledge and recent reports indicate that this goal could slip to 2023.It is essential for developed countries to realize that the financial and technological support they give to their developing counterparts is not charity.The emissions they discharged during their industrial development were much more than what the developing countries do today and they should be held responsible for most of the impacts from climate change.To a certain extent, this financial and technological support is the cost developed countries have to pay for the accumulated emissions they discharged in the course of their development.That explains why the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be maintained when dealing with climate change.Developed countries need to realize that their support in terms of both funds and technologies will make it possible for developing countries to do a better job in reducing their emissions and do their bit in the global fight against climate change.From this perspective, their support is crucial for more effective global climate change action.\l"

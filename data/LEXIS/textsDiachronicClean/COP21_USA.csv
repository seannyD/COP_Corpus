The conference objective is to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change., as the conference is frequently referred to, stands for the 21st Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The international political response to climate change began at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where the 'Rio Convention' included the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This convention sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.""The UNFCCC, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has a near-universal membership of 195 parties. Parties are the member states that ratified the convention, making it the leading international negotiation mechanism on climate change.The main objective of the annual Conference of Parties (COP) is to review the Convention's implementation. The first COP took place in Berlin in 1995 and significant meetings since then have included COP3 (in Kyoto, Japan) where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, or COP17 in Durban where the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was created.UN-Habitat is an observer organization to the UNFCCC, and member states, the UNFCCC secretariat and other observers have frequently asked UN-Habitat to provide inputs and recommendations on urban climate change issues.\l"

Udall, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee, will meet with U.S. and international negotiators and others gathered for the 21st annual Conference of the Parties (COP21) on the U.N. Convention on Climate Change. Delegates from more than 190 countries are seeking an international agreement to reduce global carbon emissions.A longtime advocate for action to prevent global warming and its serious consequences for national security and the economy, Udall will discuss his work on the Appropriations and Foreign Relations committees to prevent efforts in Congress to roll back U.S. commitments to reduce the carbon pollution that contributes to global warming. Udall will discuss the global warming impacts the United States is already experiencing -- particularly in New Mexico -- including rising temperatures and increasingly severe drought and wildfires, as well as positive steps the states and the administration are taking to drive the global effort to fight climate change.""Americans want action to prevent climate change, and New Mexico is a great example of how we're taking that action. New Mexico has every kind of energy resource, and we've embraced efforts to diversify and reduce carbon emissions. We're hitting our renewable energy goals and our efforts are boosting the economy, building new opportunities and creating well-paying clean energy jobs,"" Udall said. ""But we have to keep it up. America's leadership in reducing carbon pollution is crucial - the United States must drive progress across the world. As a member of key Foreign Relations and Appropriations subcommittees, I will be helping lead the charge in Congress to keep the U.S. climate goals on track. We will stop efforts that would turn back progress on global warming.""\l"

""I don't think it was in any sense cynical, though there were certainly forces at work trying to undermine and neutralize the treaty at every turn.""Steingraber said her opinion of the treaty was generally favorable, expressing her confidence in the agreement's structure.""There are good bones, the science is sound,""?Steingraber said. ""There are pledges in place for almost every nation and there is a ratchet mechanism in place to make the pledges more significant over time.""Prof. Johannes Lehmann, soil science, agreed, expressing his belief that the treaty was a step in the right direction.""There was a lot of trepidation ... that we would end up with no hope,""?Lehmann said. ""It turned out to be very different this time, and you could feel it.""Lehmann also called the attending the summit a ""really a huge opportunity.""""From my perspective as a scientist ... this is as close to political decision-making as you can get,"" said Lehmann.Prof. Karen Pinkus, romance studies added that the conference was interesting from a language perspective.""It was fascinating to sit in on the negotiations where it would be a discussion ... talking about syllables, comma placement, very precise terminology,"" Pinkus said. ""There is an incredible amount at stake in this.""Other panelists attended COP21 as members of activist groups, according to Colleen Boland, a conference attendee and a founding member of We are Seneca Lake - a group campaigning to stop a company from fracking near Seneca Lake. ""Advocacy groups of all kinds ... had gathered outside the official summit, to bear witness, exert pressure, change the media narrative and otherwise appeal to the better angels of those who were inside negotiating on behalf of the citizenry of the entire planet,"" Boland said.Pinkus, however, said she did not feel as hopeful as Lehmann did about the agreement's prospects.""We forget that we are a very small segment of the population in a very small part of the world, and we matter very little when we think about the enormous capital and investments and infrastructure of the big carbon monoxide institutions that we're up against,"" Pinkus said.\l"

Please attribute the statement to AIA President Elizabeth Chu Richter, FAIA:""When our board adopted our position statement on resilience in 2014, we saw this as a call to action for architects to address issues of climate adaptation in their practice. Architects welcome the COP21 talks as a way to make sure that the role buildings play in sustainability is forefront in the delegations' minds.""Residential and commercial buildings account for almost 40 percent of both total U.S. energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Meanwhile more and more architects globally are making the commitment to design sustainable buildings, according to the AIA 2030 Commitment report, a voluntary initiative by architect firms to commit their practice to advancing the AIA's goal of carbon-neutral buildings by the year 2030.""""Unfortunately, just as COP21 commences, the U.S. House of Representatives may vote as early as this week to abolish energy conservation requirements for new and existing federal buildings. These requirements have kept the United States in a leadership position when it comes to achieving carbon neutrality goals in buildings by 2030.""As we have said before - and will say again - the AIA stands ready to support legislation that keeps energy conservation goals for the federal government and positions the United States as a leader globally in conserving resources. But we will continue to oppose legislation that only encourages use of fossil fuels at great cost to the environment.""[Category: Architecture]Contact: John Schneidawind, 202/626-7457, HYPERLINK mailto:johnschneidawind@aia.orgjohnschneidawind@aia.orgCopyright Targeted News Services24HariRad 151202 30FurigayJane-5371054 30FurigayJane\l"

UN-Habitat took part in the summit.Beyond advocating immediate action and the empowerment of non-state actors, the summit paved the way for the adoption, during in Paris, of an ambitious and exhaustive global agreement on climate change. The focus was placed on the development of a new global climate agenda that also includes the participation of citizens, civil society groups, the private sector and local governments.It also pressed for pro-climate commitments at national and international levels, as well as the presentation of a strong and concerted message at the COP21. ""Most of the vital economic and social infrastructure, government facilities and assets are located in cities. When disaster strikes, these are at risk of collapse.Cities need to fully accept the inevitable effects of climate change and adapt, while, at the same time, curb and mitigate the causes of climate change,"" said Elkin Velasquez, UN-Habitat's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. The summit also addressed the articulation of climate change, resilience, risk reduction and water in regards to sustainable urban development.These considerations were organized in four themes: Cities and the new global climate agreement; Inclusive cities, resilient cities; Climate change and cultural change; and Climate Finance. UN-Habitat is currently active in 20 countries implementing climate change related programmes. Projects range from assistance to local authorities to improve systems aimed at climate proofing urban infrastructure to ensuring that climate change adaptation becomes a key component of infrastructure design and urban planning.More about the event: HYPERLINK http://www.bogotaclimatesummit2015.comwww.bogotaclimatesummit2015.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesAutoTriage6yd 150923 30VitinMar-5287500 30VitinMar\l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA15","Climate negotiators say global deal is close in Paris","December 12, 2015 Saturday","St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)","LE BOURGET, France  Talks on a global pact to fight global warming appeared to make progress late Friday, with some negotiators telling The Associated Press a deal was close.Negotiators emerged from meetings with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, the host of the talks, amid an air of optimism that had been lacking just hours earlier. Fabius was expected to present a new, potentially final draft of the elusive accord Saturday morning.""We are pretty much there,"" Egyptian Environment Minister Khaled Fahmy, the chairman of a bloc of African countries, told the AP late Friday. ""There have been tremendous developments in the last hours. We are very close.""A negotiator from a developed country was equally positive. ""I think we got it,"" said the negotiator, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Negotiators from more than 190 countries in Paris are aiming to create something that's never been done before: an agreement for all countries to reduce man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and help the poorest adapt to rising seas, fiercer weather and other impacts of global warming.This accord is the first time all countries are expected to pitch in - the previous emissions treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, only included rich countries.The talks, originally scheduled to end Friday, dragged into an extra day as the French hosts said they needed more time to overcome disputes.A French official expressed confidence that the draft to be presented Saturday would be the final one. The official was not authorized to speak publicly because the negotiations were ongoing.Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu was also upbeat.""The signals that have come to me give me encouragement that we are going to have a very ... comprehensive and strong agreement in Paris,"" Sopoaga told the AP.Liu Zhenmin, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, was more cautious. Asked by the AP whether the draft would be the final one, he said only if ""it's more or less acceptable.""Earlier Friday, Liu stood firm on his nation's demand that rich countries should assume most responsibility for the costs and argued against an agreement that sets too-tough goals for weaning the world off using oil, gas and coal - the biggest source of carbon emissions.The U.S. and European countries want to move away from so-called ""differentiation"" among economies and want big emerging countries such as China and India to pitch in more in a final climate deal. Liu told reporters that that issue is ""at the core of our concern for the Paris agreement."" He said he wants different rules for different countries ""clearly stipulated"" in the global warming pact.China is among the more than 180 countries that have submitted emissions targets for the new pact but is resisting Western proposals for robust transparency rules that would require each country to show whether it's on track to meet its target.Liu also argued against sharply limiting the number of degrees the planet warms this century because that would involve huge lifestyle and economic changes.""We need heating. We need air conditioning.

Conference leaders will try to reach a global agreement to reduce carbon emissions and keep global warming below 2C. Two American University professors are attending the conference, which runs through Dec. 11. School of International Service professor Paul Wapner is attending COP21 to conduct research on the negotiations. He will be tracking negotiations about ""loss and damage"" how developed countries will respond to the climate change hardships experienced by developing countries. School of Public Affairs professor Todd Eisenstadt, who has a National Science Foundation grant regarding climate change in Latin America, is also attending and blogging from COP21.COP21. The group is primarily attending adjacent events in the Climate Generations area of Le Bourget conference complex and writing posts for AU WCL's Sustainable Development Law andPolicy blog: HYPERLINK https://wclsdlp.wordpress.com/https://wclsdlp.wordpress.com/COP21COP21 is focusing on.Climate Justice, Policy, Hardships and Adaptation Experts:Paul Wapner is an expert on global environmental politics, environmental thought, transnational environmental activism, and environmental ethics. He is currently editing a book, ""Reimagining Climate Change,"" and continues to lead workshops for professors that explore contemplative practices and environmental engagement. Wapner is also the author of ""Living through the End of Nature: The Future of American Environmentalism,"" (MIT Press) and co-editor (with Simon Nicholson) of ""Global Environmental Politics: From Person to Planet"" (Paradigm Press). He can discuss climate suffering, adaptation, and climate justice.Wapner says: ""Paris will not be an answer to climate change but a crucial pivot for turning toward a post carbon world. Paris needs to build global solidarity for climate protection and then direct such concern into meaningful policies. Final agreements will be simply a down payment on the hard work ahead. But, make no mistake, that work can only be done if state officials, corporate actors, and civil society groups demonstrate genuine leadership in Paris. They must unite behind an uncompromising vision to reduce and then stop the use of fossil fuels and build a more just global society. The city of light offers a chance to light up the world with clean energy and social compassion.""Todd Eisenstadt's research focuses on the intersection of formal institutions and laws with informal institutions and practices, mostly in democratizing countries in Latin America. While in Paris at COP21, Eisenstadt will produce a daily blog about this international climate change discussion that can be viewed here. He teaches in the government department and is presently a Principal Investigator of the National Science Foundation (NSF) project, ""Lawsuits for the Pacha Mama [Mother Earth] in Ecuador: Explaining the Determinants of New Indigenous Movements to Mitigate Environmental Impacts."" He can discuss the relationship between constitution-making processes and democratization across scores of nations.Eisenstadt says, ""The optimism of people going in to the Paris meeting has been of hope, but also wishful thinking. A better chance for an agreement would be between the world's top six emitters. If they are able to come to an agreement, that would cover about 60 percent of the world's emissions. The top two, the U.S. and China, started this process via a voluntary, unilateral agreement they signed last year. They will reach an agreement, but it will, as they have every year over two decades, fall woefully short of what is needed and what the top six emitters can do, or even the top three emitters. There is also a vital role for the private sector and for technological innovation.""Dan Fiorino is the director of the Center for Environmental Policy and executive-in-residence in the School of Public Affairs. He teaches courses on environmental policy, energy and climate change, environmental sustainability, and public management in the public administration and policy department. Fiorino had a career at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before joining AU. He can discuss environmental policy.Fiorino says: ""With our work at American University, we're trying to identify the sweet spots, the potential for positive outcomes and how you design energy, environmental and economic policy. It's not necessarily a tradeoff, despite what the critics say that you can really get some economic health and other kinds of benefits from clean energy.""Kenneth Conca, professor in the School of International Service, is also a member of the United Nations Environment Programme's Expert Advisory Group on Conflict and Peacebuilding. His research and teaching focus on global environmental governance, environmental peacebuilding in war-torn societies, environmental politics and policy in the United Nations system, water governance, and environmental policy analysis. His latest book is ""An Unfinished Foundation: The United Nations and Global Environmental Governance"" (Oxford University Press, 2015).Conca says: ""The UN must make full use of all of its powers under the UN Charter. When the right to clean water and air become a human rights issue, the UN can deploy its most powerful tools for accountability.""Golub says: ""Uncertainty over the future of climate policy may cost billions dollars in forgone revenues and stranded assets. Policy uncertainty increases cost of capital and discourages investments. Inability of politicians to agree on climate change sends misleading signals to business and delays an inevitable decarbonization of the U.S. and global economy.""Malini Ranganathan, assistant professor in the School of International Service, is a critical geographer with a special interest in postcolonial cities. Ranganathan is concerned broadly with the political economy of the urban environment and sits at the intersection of urban geography, urban studies, and development studies. Most of her research to date has focused on water and land governance in Bangalore/Bengaluru in India. Her historic and ethnographic research here argues that new water pricing policy is central to struggles over the right to tenure security and urban belonging given widespread urban informality. She can discuss the political economy of the urban environment and the critical need for climate justice between cities and countries.Ranganathan says: ""We need climate justice not just between countries but also within our cities. While the responsibility for the climate crisis sits overwhelmingly on developed countries, developing countries like India cannot afford to divorce development from sustainability.""Global Environmental Governance/Climate Engineering Expert:Simon Nicholson, assistant professor of International Relations, is the director of the Global Environmental Politics program in the School of International Service and. His work focuses on global environmental governance, global food politics, and the politics of emerging technologies, including climate engineering (or ""geoengineering"") technologies. He also co-director of the Forum for Climate Engineering Assessment initiative at AU. He can discuss global environment governance and geoengineering.Nicholson says: ""One thing that won't be talked about much in Paris is climate engineering or ""geoengineering"" -- basically, large-scale technological responses to climate change. Yet the bulk of the computer models negotiators are relying on as they search for pathways to limit global warming already have climate engineering built into them. An unspoken assumption is that technologies will be invented that will draw large amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere. We need a more open and honest conversation about the options for tackling climate change, including a conversation about currently unpalatable technological schemes.""Climate Change Conference Coverage Risk Factors Expert:Scott Talan, professor of public andstrategic communication, is an expert in social media, digital media, new media, personal branding and multimedia. He has been a writer, producer, and reporter for numerous media organizations, including ABC News/Good Morning America. Talan can discuss the risks associated with the large amount of media coverage COP21 has produced that covers the talks and promises made between leaders without including concrete plans for action. Talan believes the public can become skeptical and further disenchanted with the lack of progress as a result of the summit. However, he is also able to talk about the progress made by non-state actors such as NGO's and WWF companies like Coca-Cola.Talan says: ""Looking back these type of global climate summits such as the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro gathering in the early 1990s, then the Kyoto Protocol five years later, and more recently the Copenhagen Summit in 2009, leads some to conclude 'it's all hot air' and no concrete steps are being taken. If there were accomplishments why is there another global gathering? It is a tough challenge for leaders to finesse in terms of meeting and talking, but also taking action as well.""Sustainability Experts:Megan Litke, is Director of Sustainability Programs and oversees all sustainability related initiatives, including efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2020 and sustainability outreach and education efforts. Litke can discuss higher education sustainability trends and priorities.Litke says: ""Seeing the international community come together to reach an agreement at the global level is inspiring and exciting, and could eliminate some of the barriers we face at individual institutions in creating change.""Richard Linowes, Director of Sustainability Management Program and Assistant Professor of Management, teaches strategy, global leadership, entrepreneurship, cross-cultural management and sustainability. Linowes studies how companies adjust themselves to operate internationally. He examines the strategic vigilance required for international business and focuses on how multinational companies adjust to cultures around the world.Linowes says, ""The gathering of nations in Paris has two vital aspects that build confidence that humanity may face the crisis brought on by climate change: nations are pledging goals for reducing greenhouse gases, and countries and cities are sharing their innovations and achievements in dealing with the world's changing conditions and resource limits. Whether it is the Dutch teaching others about holding back rising sea levels, or Japanese discussing how Tokyo accepted 82-degree office buildings to cut electricity use, or Perth Australia explaining how they became drought-proof by storing underground water produced by water desalination plants, or Washington, D.C. obtaining electric power via wind farms, countries are learning from each other about how to adjust to our changing planet.""American University is a leader in global education, enrolling a diverse student body from throughout the United States and nearly 140 countries.

I was proud to be at COP-21 helping communicate EPA and U.S. efforts on climate action at the U.S. Center, the State Department's public diplomacy space at the COP. I had the opportunity to meet attendees from around the world and to hear about global efforts to combat climate change so I wanted to share a few thoughts from the conference. The most striking thing about the COP was its size. Forty thousand attendees came from around the world educators, students, government officials, and non-profit and private sector leaders so it was held at Le Bourget, best known as the airplane hangar for the Paris air show. The U.S. Center was one of the many pavilions where visitors could learn more during COP21. Play Video[1]This short video gives a sense of the scale of the COP21 venue at Le Bourget, outside Paris, France. \~ HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-US-Center.gifhttp://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-US-Center.gif The U.S. Center COP21 during an event at Le Bourget, outside Paris, France. In the spirit of the event, conference organizers went all-in on sustainability with an extensive biodegradables and recycling program. Participants could return reusable plastic coffee cups for a 1 Euro deposit, and the cups quickly became as good as currency. Participants were spotted scooping up coffee cups from empty tables and desks, returning several at a time. HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Coffee1.gifhttp://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Coffee1.gif Reusable coffee cup with the COP21 logo from United Nations Climate Change Conference in Le Bourget, outside Paris, France. Something I didn't fully appreciate before arriving in Paris was that the COP is a consensus process so for the negotiations to succeed, all 195 countries had to be in favor of a deal. So the Paris Agreement reflects the threat climate change poses to every nation on Earth, as well as the global community's determination to do something about it. The Paris Agreement is ambitious, universal, and durable. Before the negotiations even began, 180 countries, representing more than 95 percent of the climate pollution on Earth, put forward individual pledges to cut carbon pollution. The Paris Agreement was built from country-level plans, and it states that countries will limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius on average and make efforts to keep it under 1.5 degrees Celsius levels science tells us will help avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. The agreement calls for transparent reporting and accountability about how nations keep track of carbon emissions. It creates a mechanism for countries to come back to the table every 5 years with increasingly ambitious national carbon pollution reduction pledges, and it includes provisions for financing to developing countries to help them grow their economies with clean energy. American leadership paved the way for global action. Secretary Kerry spoke in the second week about the need to seize the moment for an ambitious, universal climate agreement, and how U.S. efforts have led the way. EPA's Clean Power Plan is a centerpiece of U.S. climate efforts, and Administrator McCarthy spoke at the U.S. Center about why she's confident the rule is built to last. \~ HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kerry1.gifhttp://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kerry1.gif Secretary of State John Kerry speaks at COP21 about the need for countries to seize the opportunity for an ambitious, lasting climate agreement. \~ http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-Admin.-McCarthy1.gifhttp://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-Admin.-McCarthy1.gif EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy speaks at the U.S. Center about why the Clean Power Plan will stand the test of time. American businesses are also leading the way. On the first day of the COP after President Obama and other world leaders spoke, Bill Gates and other business leaders launched 'Mission Innovation' to develop the next generation of clean technologies. Meanwhile, 154 of the largest U.S. companies including WalMart, AT...Coca-Cola, and Facebook, representing 11 million jobs and more than 7 trillion dollars in market capitalization, signed the White House American Business Act on Climate Pledge. Major companies know that climate impacts increase their financial risk, while climate action represents an unprecedented economic opportunity. That is the real triumph of the Paris Agreement: it sends a global market signal that a low-carbon future is inevitable, and climate-smart investments are not only the right thing to do, but the profitable thing to do. Despite the size of the COP, climate change is personal. So it was powerful to hear from the following two local leaders at a U.S. Center side event hosted by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. Councilwoman Maija Lukin of Kotzebue, Alaska, and Alson Kelen of the Marshall Islands each explained that climate change threatens their communities' existence today. Homes in Kotzebue are slowly sinking into the sea as the permafrost underneath thaws and the sea level rises. Traditional food sources caribou, seals, berries are disappearing. And thinning ice has made travel dangerous Councilwoman Lukin lost 2 uncles when they fell through thin ice while traveling to the next town, which doesn't have a road. In the Marshall Islands, rising sea levels mean just about every time it rains, garbage and sewage wash through communities, making people sick. Warming waters mean fish are disappearing. \~ HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-Councilwoman-Lukin.gifhttp://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-Councilwoman-Lukin.gif Councilwoman Maija Lukin of Kotzebue, Alaska speaks about dwindling sea ice in her region due to climate change. Climate change is threatening our health, our economy, and our national security today. But I am convinced we will meet this challenge, in part because of the incredible will it took from countries around the world to reach the Paris Agreement. Attending the COP was a tremendous opportunity and an experience I'll never forget it'll be a story for the grandkids.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA21","Nearly 200 nations pledge to slow global warming","December 13, 2015 Sunday","St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)","Long-term goal  Keep global warming ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) Still to be ratified  At least 55 countries linked to at least 55 pct. of global emissions must sign off Critics remain  Nicaragua balks, and thousands demonstrate, calling accord too weak to save planetLE BOURGET, France  About 200 nations adopted the first global pact to fight climate change on Saturday, calling on the world to collectively cut and then eliminate greenhouse gas pollution but imposing no sanctions on countries that don't.The ""Paris agreement"" aims to keep global temperatures from rising another degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) between now and 2100, a key demand of poor countries ravaged by rising sea levels and other effects of climate change.Loud applause erupted in the conference hall after French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gaveled the agreement. Some delegates wept, others embraced.""It's a victory for all of the planet and for future generations,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, adding that the pact will ""prevent the worst most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening.""Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira added: ""Today, we've proven that it's possible for every country to come together, hand in hand, to do its part to fight climate change.""In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.In practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would have to stop emitting greenhouse gases - most of which come from the burning of oil, coal and gas for energy - altogether in the next half-century, scientists said. That's because the less we pollute, the less pollution nature absorbs.Achieving such a reduction in emissions would involve a complete transformation of how people get energy, and many activists worry that despite the pledges, countries are not ready to make such profound, costly changes.The deal now needs to be ratified by individual governments - at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions - before taking effect. It is the first pact to ask all countries to join the fight against global warming, representing a sea change in U.N. talks that previously required only wealthy nations to reduce their emissions.""History will remember this day,"" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. ""The Paris agreement on climate change is a monumental success for the planet and its people.""Speaking from Washington, President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers ""the best chance to save the one planet we have.""The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 compared with pre-industrial times ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and says they will ""endeavor to limit"" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times.Ben Strauss, a sea level researcher at Climate Central, said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees could potentially cut in half the projected 280 million people whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas.More than 180 countries have ready presented plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions - a breakthrough in itself after years of stalemate. But those pledges are not enough to achieve the goals in the accord, meaning countries will need to cut much more to meet the goal.""We've agreed to what we ought to be doing, but no one yet has agreed to go do it,"" said Dennis Clare, a negotiator for the Federated States of Micronesia. ""It's a whole lot of pomp, given the circumstances.""It says wealthy nations should continue to provide financial support for poor nations to cope with climate change and encourages other countries to pitch in on a voluntary basis. That reflects Western attempts to expand the donor base to include advanced developing countries such as China.In a victory for small island nations, the agreement includes a section highlighting the losses they expect to incur from climate-related disasters that it's too late to adapt to. However, a footnote specifies that it ""does not involve or provide any basis for any liability or compensation"" - a key U.S. demand because it would let the Obama administration sign on to the deal without going through the Republican-led Senate.The adoption of the agreement was held up for nearly two hours as the United States pressed successfully to change the wording on emissions targets from saying developed countries ""shall"" commit to reducing emissions to they ""should."" Experts said that means the deal probably won't need U.S. congressional approval.OPPOSITION REMAINSNicaragua said it would not support the pact. Its envoy, Paul Oquist, said the agreement does not go far enough to cut global warming and help the poor countries affected by it.Nicaragua is one of eight participating countries that haven't submitted emissions targets, after Venezuelan envoy Claudia Salerno said her country - which had been holding out - liked the agreement and had submitted its pledge.Thousands of protesters demonstrated across Paris, saying the accord is too weak to save the planet.Kumi Naidoo of Greenpeace said the accord is a good start but isn't enough. ""Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it's what happens after this conference that really matters,"" he said. ""This deal alone won't dig us out the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep.""---KEY POINTS OF CLIMATE DEALLONG-TERM GOALThe long-term objective of the agreement is to make sure global warming stays ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and to ""pursue efforts"" to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). To achieve that goal, governments pledged to stop the rise in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions ""as soon as possible."" By some point after 2050, the agreement says, man-made emissions should be reduced to a level that forests and oceans can absorb.EMISSIONS TARGETSTo reach the long-term goal, countries agreed to set national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions every five years. More than 180 countries have already submitted targets for the first cycle beginning in 2020. Only developed countries are expected to slash their emissions in absolute terms; developing nations are ""encouraged"" to do so as their capabilities evolve over time. Until then, they are expected only to rein in the growth of emissions as their economies develop.REVIEWING TARGETSThe initial targets won't be enough to put the world on a path to meet the long-term temperature goal. So the agreement asks governments to review their targets in the next four years and see if they can ""update"" them. That doesn't require governments to deepen their cuts. But the hope is that it will be possible for them to do so if renewable energy sources become more affordable and effective.TRANSPARENCYThere is no penalty for countries that miss their emissions targets. But the agreement has transparency rules to encourage countries to do what they say they will do. That was one of the most difficult pieces to agree on, with China asking for softer requirements. The agreement says all countries must report on their emissions and efforts to reduce them. But it allows for some ""flexibility"" for developing countries that ""need it.""MONEYThe agreement says wealthy countries should continue to offer financial support to help poor countries reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. It also encourages other countries to pitch in on a voluntary basis. That paves the way for emerging economies such as China to contribute, even though it doesn't require them to do so. Actual dollar amounts were kept out of the agreement itself, but wealthy nations had previously pledged to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020.LOSS AND DAMAGEIn a victory for small island nations threatened by rising seas, the agreement includes a section recognizing ""loss and damage"" associated with climate-related disasters. The U.S. long objected to addressing the issue in the agreement, worried that it would lead to claims of compensation for damage caused by extreme weather events. In the end, the issue was included, but a footnote specifically stated that loss and damage does not involve liability or compensation.\l"

It energises us.We do not doubt the implications of the science, or the scale of the challenge.But above all we do not doubt the capacity of humanity to meet it - with imagination, innovation and the prudence that befits those, like us, who make decisions that will affect not just our own children and grandchildren but generations yet unborn.And Mr President while we come to you in Paris with our deepest condolences, we bring you the most resolute solidarity in our common cause for freedom in the face of terrorism.Here in Paris Australia supports a new and truly global climate agreement.It is an agreement that must drive humanity's capacity for inventiveness and a new wave of technological advances.Good for our environment, good for our economies.I join over 150 leaders in calling for a strong and effective agreement.And over 180 countries have now announced post-2020 targets.This is an extraordinary effort.For Australia's part, our 2030 target represents real economic effort, and will halve our per capita emissions one of the biggest reductions of any G20 country.We will meet and beat our 2020 emissions reduction target.Today I announce that Australia will ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.We firmly believe that it is innovation and technology which will enable us both to drive stronger economic growth and a cleaner environment.We are a highly social and innovative species and so the more we share innovative technologies, the better they will become.Today Australia joins with many other countries in supporting Mission Innovation which aims to double investment in clean energy innovation over the next five years.Australian universities are at the forefront of energy and climate science innovation.To give one example, the University of New South Wales has held the world record for solar cell efficiency for 30 of the last 32 years.And by 2018 over 60 per cent of the world's solar cells are to use technology developed by Australian researchers.But our task, and that of the technologies we deploy, is not just to reduce emissions.Adaption to the impacts of climate change is equally important and there too innovation is a key.Some of the most vulnerable nations are our Pacific neighbours and we are helping them to build resilience through practical action and assistance.To this end, Australia will contribute at least $1 billion over the next five years from our existing aid budget both to build climate resilience and reduce emissions.Our agreement here in Paris must provide a common platform for action, the dynamism to build ambition and a robust and transparent reporting system.Australia is not daunted by the challenge. With great optimism and faith in humanity's genius for invention, we are confident that with your leadership, Mr President, we will, in common cause, secure our future.\l"

How can national parliaments push for a strong global deal on climate?Parliaments should focus on what they do best: promote national climate laws and get them recognised in the global agreement; they must hold governments to account on national commitments to combat global warming and press negotiators in a bottom-up manner, said Lord Prescott, former Chairperson of the PACEs Sub-Committee on Environment and Energy, when addressing a major parliamentary gathering organised by the IPU and the French Parliament.More than ever before, legislators are taking centre stage in steering efforts against global warming. They can act forcefully in proposing climate-friendly law packages, validating national budgets with ample provisions for climate action and ratifying the international agreement, hopefully to be agreed by the end of this week,- continued Lord Prescott.Both the public and private sectors should seize the low-hanging fruit via sustainable climate action, because what is good for the planet is good for its people and businesses.

Previous drafts had included more specific timeframes.Diplomats from 196 governments are trying to forge a global pact in Paris to slow global warming by collectively slashing emissions, mostly from the burning oil, coal and gas for energy.

But the text still contained competing options on the key issue of making sure countries follow through on their emissions targets. Several options remained on the contentious issue of financing to help poor and vulnerable countries such as small island nations cope with climate change.The draft didn't resolve how to deal with demands from vulnerable countries to cope with unavoidable damage from rising seas and other climate impacts.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA38","Matter of degree: Temperature goal an issue in climate talks","December 5, 2015 Saturday","St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)","PARIS  In climate math, the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is much greater than 0.5.Small nations say that for them, that half-degree could mean the difference between life and death. For larger nations, the question is what's realistic and what's not when it comes to limiting global warming.The warming goal is what experts call a guardrail, and it has the potential to derail the climate talks going on in Paris if negotiators can't agree on a number.Small island nations - such as the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and St. Lucia - and some other countries are pushing 1.5 because they see it as an issue of survival. They talk about sea level rise inundating cities, salt water killing off crops and more dangerous storms wiping out cities.""It's a fight that really should not be focused on numbers, 1.5, 2, 2.5,"" said James Fletcher, St. Lucia's minister for sustainable development, energy, science and technology. ""It should be focused on lives. We're not fighting for numbers, we're fighting for lives.""Climate scientists say both numbers are a bit arbitrary, but keeping warming to 1.5 degrees could increase the chance of survival for coral reefs, slow the rise in the number of ever-increasing severe weather disasters and help keep the planet from hitting dreaded but so far unseen tipping points of irreversible environmental damage.""There is no such thing as a guardrail where we are free from all the impacts of climate change; we've already seen climate change and it's widespread,"" said Chris Field, a Carnegie Institution scientist who headed an international scientific assessment of climate impacts two years ago.For some countries, keeping warming to 1.5 degrees may require steep and painful cuts in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas. But United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres and climate talks president Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, were optimistic about compromise. So far, international negotiators trying to broker a deal say it's a challenge they think they can handle.There are many issues in the talks, which continue through mid-December. Climate negotiators are trying to figure out how much countries must reduce carbon dioxide emissions to keep the planet from heating up to dangerous levels; how to make sure countries do what they promise; and who pays for it all. But how much countries cut and pay could depend in part on the planetary goal.""Whether the text will also take into account a very justifiable request from the most vulnerable countries to improve on those efforts, it remains to be seen how that is going to be handled,"" Figueres said in an interview. ""It wouldn't surprise me if there is a recognition of the intense vulnerability of some nations.""Fletcher said that based on reports from his negotiators, there would be pushback from some countries on the 1.5 goal.U.S. chief climate negotiator Todd Stern said his delegation had talked with the small islands about their position.""We haven't landed anywhere yet, but we hear the concerns of those countries and we think those concerns are legitimate,"" he said.India's chief climate negotiator, Ashok Lavssa, said India believed that the number should be below 2 degrees, but whether it goes all the way to 1.5 is difficult to say.Fletcher said he could see a compromise by which both goals - 2 and 1.5 - would be listed in whatever pact comes out of the conference and countries would agree to try to hit 1.5 but commit to 2 if they can't.He calls achieving a 2-degree goal difficult and a 1.5-degree goal ""very difficult."" His numbers show that current pledges by nations would only limit warming to 3.5 degrees, down from the current trajectory of 4.5 degrees if nations continue producing emissions as they have been.For example, to do its part in keeping warming to 2 degrees, the U.S. must cut emissions by 4.1 percent a year by 2030, but to get to 1.5, it must cut emissions by 6.2 percent a year. Those cuts would need to increase even more between 2030 and 2050. The fastest a country has ever cut carbon emissions was about 4 percent a year during the 1970s oil crisis, when France switched heavily to nuclear power.But Jones and MIT professor John Sterman said people shouldn't get bogged down in the numbers right now. They said it's like driving from New York City to San Francisco, arguing about where you are going to park when you get there when you are still only on the East Coast.Field said it wa's a bit of an academic question, especially because the emissions already spewed stay around for so long the world is nearly already committed to 1.5 degrees of warming.Others, such as James Hansen, a former NASA climate chief turned activist, said 2 degrees was too much warming, calling it ""a crazy target to have; you cannot say that's a safe guardrail."" Hansen, often considered the godfather of global warming science said that ""1.5 is certainly less dangerous than 2 degrees; I wouldn't even want to characterize that as a guardrail.""\l"

Endorsed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Energy Agency, as well as Tesla Motors and Michelin Nissan-Renault, it reportedly builds on commitments from companies, cities, States and associations that have undertaken decisive efforts towards sustainable transport electrification.""Of course I think the sector of transport is one of the most important to succeed in fighting climate,"" Segol ne Royal, the French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy told the UN News Service.With energy-related CO2 emissions expected to jump from one quarter of total energy-related emissions today to one-third by 2050, the actors that are part of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) are underlining that significant changes can be made in transport to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius.The LPAA was launched one year ago at the the previous UN climate change conference in Peru, and aims to strength climate action beyond COP21.The effort comes as demand for public and freight transport is projected to grow rapidly, especially in emerging and developing countries. Yet, projections reveal a 50 per cent reduction of transport CO2 emissions compared to a ""transport-as-usual"" scenario can be achieved by 2050, without hampering sustainable economic growth.Moreover, according to the International Energy Agency, if global warming is to be limited to 2 degrees or less, at least 20 per cent of all road vehicles (cars, two and three-wheelers, trucks, buses and others) must be electric-powered by 2030, in conjunction with the low-carbon production of electricity and hydrogen.Other announcements today at COP21, which centered around the themes of 'Transport' and 'Building,' included new efforts to stabilize emissions from the aviation industry by 2020. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said it has received 74 action plans to advance the implementation of mitigation measures by States, which accounts for 80.6 per cent of global CO2 emissions from international flight.\l"

""Instead of making excuses tomorrow, let's take action today.""Even before the gathering, more than 180 countries pledged to cut or curb their emissions, but scientific analyses show that much bigger reductions would be needed to limit man-made warming of the Earth to 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-industrial times, the internationally agreed-upon goal.The biggest issue facing the 151 heads of state and government at the summit is who should bear most of the burden of closing that gap: wealthy Western nations that have polluted the most historically, or developing countries like China and India that are now the biggest and third-biggest emitters of greenhouse gases?""Addressing climate change should not deny the legitimate needs of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve living standards,"" Chinese leader Xi Jinping told the conference.The last major climate agreement, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, required only rich countries to cut emissions, and the U.S. never signed on.Since then, global temperatures and sea levels have continued to rise, and the Earth has seen an extraordinary run of extreme weather, including severe droughts and storms.This new round of talks seeks to produce an agreement that would require all countries, rich and poor, to take action.While the specifics have yet to be worked out, the pact is meant to chart a path toward reduced reliance on coal, oil and gas and expanded use of renewable energy such as wind and solar power.The negotiations will focus on whether emissions targets should be binding or voluntary and how to verify that countries are hitting their targets.Another big issue will be how to provide the finance and technology that developing countries will need to reduce their emissions and cope with the effects of rising seas, intensifying heat waves and floods.""The future of the people of the world, the future of our planet, is in your hands,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told negotiators in his opening remarks. ""We cannot afford indecision, half measures or merely gradual approaches. Our goal must be a transformation.""China and India say they want the agreement to clearly reflect that industrialized nations bear the biggest responsibility for the problem.President Barack Obama offered assurances that the U.S. isn't trying to shirk its duty.""I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it,"" Obama told the conference.Statistics since 1959 from the U.S. Department of Energy show the United States has been by far the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, the top man-made greenhouse gas. It has released about 258 trillion tons of carbon dioxide over the past half-century, compared with China's 158 trillion tons, the figures show.China is catching up, though, and is now the world's biggest greenhouse gas polluter, accounting for 28 percent of the world's current emissions - twice as much as the United States. Beijing has pledged to put a ceiling on its emissions around 2030 as part of the latest negotiations.Developing countries say they need financial support and technology to make the transition to cleaner energy. On the bustling first day of the conference, a number of such initiatives were announced, including one backed by 19 governments and 28 leading global investors, including Bill Gates and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.Their initiative would provide billions of dollars in investments to research and develop clean energy technology, with the ultimate goal of making it cheaper and more reliable.Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande unveiled an initiative to get rich and poor countries to cooperate on expanding solar power.""It's making the dream of universal access to clean energy become more real,"" Modi said.Many of the leaders said the world must keep the average temperature within 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of current levels - and, if possible, to half that, to spare island nations threatened by rising seas. The world has already warmed nearly that much since the beginning of the industrial age.Beijing on Monday reported one of the worst spells of air pollution in years, saying levels of soot were 25 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. That's a different pollution from carbon dioxide, but both come from burning fossil fuel, especially coal.Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which had binding emissions targets for wealthy nations, the new deal will be based on a bottom-up approach where countries set their own targets. One of the things being negotiated is a ratchet-up mechanism that would encourage countries to review and improve their targets every five years.---'What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save it?'

Last summer, President Obama launched EPA\' s Clean Power Plan  the biggest single step America has ever taken to address climate change. Because of this plan, the U.S. is now on track to slash carbon pollution from the power sector 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cuts to smog and soot that come along with these reductions will bring economic opportunities for clean energy innovation and major health benefits for American families. EPA\' s plan  building on six years of concerted effort by the Obama Administration  means that in the year 2030, the U.S. will avoid thousands of premature deaths and trips to the hospital, tens of thousands of asthma attacks, and hundreds of thousands of missed school days and missed work days. Details for the Administrator\' s trip, press events and stakeholder meetings will be shared as more information becomes available. NEW Video: Administrator Gina McCarthy reflects on the United States\' progress on climate, as well as how far the U.S. has come on environmental protection since the EPA was established.

It stated that these millions of individuals are demanding a strong agreement that will shift the world away from carbon pollution and rapidly towards climate solutions.Noting his appreciation for the signatures, the UN chief highlighted that he thinks the world is standing at a very critical moment: I'm hopeful and I'm reasonably optimistic that we'll be able to have for the first time in the history of the United Nations a universal and very ambitious climate change agreement which will make our lives healthier and more prosperous.Since the beginning of last week, government representative have been negotiating a new agreement with the goal of limiting global temperature rise to less than two degrees Celsius. Yesterday, Laurent Fabius, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of COP21, said the intention is to have an adopted agreement by Friday.We would not be where we are today here in Paris, with 196 Parties poised to adopt a global climate change agreement, without the leadership and vision of civil society, Mr. Ban insisted, adding that after Paris is over, their voices will be needed more than ever.He also underl"

Major pronouncements have been made before, but nothing has come to fruition yet. So, we are eager for further steps than what has been the case in the past,"" he said. In its COP21 position paper, the AfDB warns that Africa's hard-earned development progress could go into reverse if the new climate deal does not limit warming to 1.5\'cbC and provides more help for Africa to adapt to climate change.The AfDB, Africa's premier financial institution on climate change initiatives, particularly highlights Africa's vulnerability to climate change, a continent that is already suffering from its worst effects. The Bank emphasizes that a strong deal at the 2015 United Nations (COP21) is particularly vital for Africa because the continent faces acute climate risks.""Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time in development. COP21 presents a unique opportunity to meet that challenge. The voice of Africa is crucial to ensure the success of COP21. And the voice of Africa will be heard, said Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group.According to the Bank, seven Africans in 10 depend for their livelihoods on agriculture, which is the economic sector most vulnerable and exposed to climate impacts as over 90% of African agriculture relies on rainfall.Climate extremes such as drought, flooding, heat stress and tropical cyclones are set to become more intense and more frequent.In fact, experts warn that in some cases, today's climate extremes may become tomorrow's ""normal"" weather.Rising sea levels will threaten Africa' large coastal population, while agriculture, tourism, cities, water levels, health, energy and fisheries are already negatively affected, and the problems are set to intensify.And these issues were also highlighted by the COP21 President and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who identified terrorism and climate change as this century's greatest enemies and called on governments to step up their efforts:""The stakes are too high, and the menace of climate change is too great for us to be content with a minimalistic agreement. The Heads of State and Government who have come to Paris have come to express the voice of ambition,"" he said.Speaking at the opening ceremony, which was webcast live around the world, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said that the eyes of millions of people around the world were on the governments meeting in Paris, not just figuratively but literally.""You have the opportunity, in fact the responsibility, to finalize an agreement that enables the achievement of national climate change goals, that delivers the necessary support for the developing world and that catalyses continuously increasing ambition and action by all,"" she told delegates.Figueres said that the past year had been a turning point and that after many years of hard work, the world was finally seeing that the direction towards a low-carbon, resilient future was irreversible.""This turning point is truly remarkable, but the task is not done. It is up to you to both capture this progress and chart an unequivocal path forward, with a clear destination, agreed milestones and a predictable timel"

It will take place from Nov 30 to Dec 11 at Le Bourget - a suburban commune in Paris, France. Here are five things about the 2015 Climate Conference everyone needs\~to know and might be embarrassed to ask:<nl/> 1. The Paris Climate Conference of 2015 is the 21st annual session of the Conference of Parties to the 1992 UNFCCC[1] - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is also the 11th Meeting of the Parties to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol[2].<nl/> The 2015 Climate Conference aims to achieve a universal and legally binding agreement on climate change from all the countries on the globe. According to the organisers[3], the COP 21, 'for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aims to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C.'<nl/> 2. Governments at the 2015 Climate Conference are expected to produce a continued agreement to tackle climate change.<nl/> The current greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol ran out in 2020. The countries will be expected to enter into agreement for the decade after 2020 and potentially beyond.<nl/> 3. The COP21 is the largest conference the French government has ever organised, according to CNN[4].<nl/> The UNFCCC has 196[5] member parties - a near universal number, while 192 parties of the UNFCCC have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. French Prime Minister Francois Hollande will welcome major world leaders such as US President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<nl/> 4. The crucial objective behind setting targets beyond 2020 is keeping global average temperature rise under 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.<nl/> Scientists have warned that a continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions will breach this safety threshold and lead to catastrophic changes[6] in the global environment.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA57","What to expect from the COP21 conference?","December 2, 2015 Wednesday","Massachusetts Daily Collegian: University of Massachusetts - Amherst","Posted by Noosha Uddin on December 2, 2015 \'b7 Leave a Comment(Rob/Flickr)This Monday marked the beginning of the 21st annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP21The objective is to reach a unanimous decision on keeping the rise in global temperature capped at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2020 - a means of regulating how much greenhouse gas emissions each nation produces now in comparison to the pre\£dindustrial era and how much each needs to cut down.In short, it's meant to create a game plan in dealing with the current global climate crisis once and for all. But how can we be sure this conference isn't just another high profile meeting that leads to nothing but more debates on whether or not climate change is real? It's the one topic that U.S. politicians have been alone in arguing, while the rest of the world has moved on in at least recognizing it's an actual problem.Nevertheless, world leaders are hopeful, discussing what could be monumental for the next generation in a city recently struck with tragedy. The State of Emergency that French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande declared immediately following the Islamic State attacks calls for a ban on protests and demonstrations, a directive that's sparking unrest between policemen and climate activists. And so, outside the gates of what could be the most important conference of the time a too familiar dispute between the police and citizens of the state ensues once more.Notable speakers include U.S. president Barack Obama, who called upon other leaders to set an example for the next generation, since we're all waiting and watching to see what kind of mess us Millennials will have to clean up. Russia's president Vladimir Putin reiterated the point that the growth of the global economy is independent from gas emissions and stated that the participating nations ""can ensure economic development and take care of our environment at the same time."" Even president Xi Jinping, leader of the nation responsible for 28 percent of global CO2 emissions as of 2011 in China, is pledging to cut emissions by 2030.Why two degrees? The number was proposed by Yale economist William Nordhaus back in 1977, where he argues anything more than a two degree rise in temperature ""would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years."" But even that may be too high of a threshold; nations among the equatorial regions are already experiencing intense hurricanes, crop shortages, decl"

After approximately two weeks of negotiations and meetings, the conference culminated in 195 countries adopting the first legally binding and universal agreement on slowing global warming.The agreement, which comes into force in 2020, establishes an international action plan for avoiding dire climate change by limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, according to the European Commission.Prominent among the Dartmouth participants in the conference, also known as COP21, was U.S. State Department's special envoy for climate change Todd Stern '73, the lead negotiator for the U.S. delegation.Morgan Curtis '14 and Leehi Yona '16 both attended COP21 representing SustainUS, a youth-led delegation advocating for justice and sustainability in United Nations meetings on sustainable development, climate change, eradicating poverty, biodiversity loss and women's rights.As a youth delegate and a Dartmouth senior fellow, Yona followed the negotiations at the conference, conducted interviews of delegates and academics attending the conference, participated in symbolic protests and wrote opinion pieces, she said.Before arriving in Paris, Curtis spent the five months before the conference cycling and gathering stories in eleven countries on a Climate Journey project. She focused on grassroots mobilization in climate action and gathering the stories of people who have made the transition from individual to collective action for the climate.Curtis recalled her two weeks at the conference as the ""most stimulating, difficult and transformative"" of her life.A group of students from the Tuck School of Business also attended COP21 as observers. ""It is important for my students who will be entering the work force soon to attend because we want them to be global leaders and think about their role as the cause and solutions to these climate change problems,"" Tuck School of Business professor and pioneer of the course ""Business and Climate Change"" Anant Sundaram said.Corporations are both the problem and solution to climate change as they are the biggest contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases, Sundaram said. He added that the industry will have to do a lot of the research and development that goes into developing these clean energy technologies to solve the climate change problem.Patrick Turevon Tu'16, observed many of the ""behind the scenes negotiations"" and attended the various panels and lectures held throughout the second week of the conference.""I tried to attend a lot of the business lectures on building a clean energy market and investing in clean energy,"" Turevon said.Sundaram said he finds it important for his business students to see how global negotiations and consensus building processes work or do not work.The main objective of this annual conference is to review and revise the implementation of the Rio Convention, which in 1992, established a framework for action aimed at stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.Although delegates and leaders from countries meet annually, an agreement is not reached every year, environmental studies professor and Union of Concerned Scientists delegate at COP21 Anne Kapuscinski said.\~ ""This [conference] was really important because the international agreement that these nations are currently operating from was the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020,"" Kapuscinski said. ""Countries have been hard at work for the past 20 years to negotiate a new agreement and it was understood and agreed upon that at this meeting, they were going to try to reach a new agreement for the global community.""The countries at this conference took a more cooperative approach in Paris. States agreed to individually reduce their carbon emissions to a specific target rate and mutually enforce and coerce each other into continuing to lower their emission numbers in the future, Kapuscinski said.\~ Before and during COP21, countries submitted individual comprehensive national climate action plans to reduce carbon emissions. The long-term goal of the plans was to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. The governments also agreed to track each country's commitment through an extensive transparency and accountability system.\~ The COP21\~ Although the agreement is a step forward, Sundaram said he is less optimistic about its timel"

While many continued to hail the outcome document as the walls of COP21 were torn down on Sunday, the UN News Centre looked back on other aspects that contributed positive energy to the two-week event.Highlighting what made COP21 green was Fanina Kodre-Alexander from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), who manages communications on climate change, disasters and conflicts. She said UNEP worked with the organizers the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Government of France to ensure sustainability throughout the Paris-Le Bourget site located north-east of the capital.We work under our Eat, Think, Save campaign in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and we believe that food waste is the third largest emitter after a couple of countries, Ms. Koder-Alexander noted.To reduce waste, all the food provided at UNEP events, including those during COP21, is sourced from rescued food, resources that would otherwise have been destroyed. Ms. Kodre-Alexander highlighted that its always provided in a very appetizing and lovely way.Another exciting feature at COP21 related to food, which attracted a lot of attention, was the boulangers brought on premise to avoid trucking kilos of fresh baguettes ever day.They welcomed the UN News Centre into their lab, which is visible to all conference-goers through a thin see-through plastic tarp.Every day, COP21To go with the bread, of course theres cafe.Were very happy to see theyre using recyclable cups, said Ms. Kodre-Alexander. The method which theyve employed is that people are returning them to get a credit. Its quite successful and you dont see them left around and dropped in the garbage.Scenes from COP21In addition, welcome packs handed out to all participants included water bottles to limit the number of plastic ones purchased. Water stations to fill these were abundantly found around every corner, similarly to the many recycling bins, clearly labeled to support the separation of paper, plastics and compostable organic waste.UNEP has also tried to be as paperless as possible, added Ms. Kodre-Alexander. There are certain documents that need to be printed and distributed but we believe in either providing links to our website or USB keys when available.On Saturday, the printed final draft of the agreement was handed out to delegates to review before they reconvened hours later for its adoption. This was a rare time paper was seen throughout the venue, as negotiators met in all free spaces including the cafeteria.Scenes from COP21Meanwhile, several eco-friendly options were available to get to and from the site. In addition to free public buses, 300 electric cars were provided by Renault-Nissan to anyone seeking a ride. Reservations could be made onl"

But many countries are calling for the Paris deal to include a road map on how to achieve it, such as a target for phasing out the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.Various options have been proposed. The United States and members of the Group of Seven wealthy countries endorsed earlier this year a ""decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century.""""Decarbonization is something that has appeared recently. We don't even know what that means,"" Indian delegate Ajay Mathur said. ""Does it mean zero carbon? Does it mean net zero carbon?""The term is generally understood to mean sharp reductions of carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, but it hasn't been defined precisely.Brazil's lead negotiator Antonio Marcondes said there was no need to come up with a new joint climate goal.Marcondes added that Brazil would consider options that emphasize that phasing out fossil fuels will be easier for some countries. He referred to a Brazilian-German declaration in August that backed a ""decarbonization of the global economy"" while noting that some countries will need help to transition to cleaner energy.The long-term goal is one of the issues that split the larger group of developing countries in the climate talks.

(AP Photo / Jacky Naegelen)<nl/> Paris, France It's the first night of COP21. Free food and action planning are the irresistible combination that draw dozens of youth to an art space in late-night Paris. The passion in the room is real. So is the fear as our generation bears the burden of unprecedented global upheaval. Ad Policy[1] <nl/>I ask myself: Why is it that we feel this issue so deeply, but global leaders do not? For us, the climate crisis is a matter of identity. It's personal, profound, existential. But for the heads of state who speak at COP21, climate change is politics and policies. <nl/>    <nl/> My family watches the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy each holiday season. I look forward to the Ents' uprising, no matter how many times I've seen it. The Ents, for those unfamiliar with Tolkein's world, are the ancient tree-beings of Fangorn Forest in Middle Earth. They learn that the evil warlord Saruman is building power at the edge of the forest to wage a massive war. The Ents call a meeting to discuss how to address the threat. Their language (Ent-ish) is slow and tedious it takes them nearly all day simply to say 'hello.' <nl/> Merry and Pippin two Hobbits traveling with the Ents are outraged by the slow pace of conversation. If Saruman's forces win, their home the Shire and all of Middle Earth will be submerged in darkness and evil. Merry and Pippin frantically interrupt the Ents' discussion, pleading for a sense of urgency and rapid action. 'Our world teeters on the edge of doom!' they cry. 'Do something!' they scream. The Ents begrudgingly make their way to the edge of the forest to better understand Saruman's plans. <nl/> The Ents emerge from the deep woods to discover that Saruman has obliterated a massive tract of Fangorn Forest. They stand stunned, staring in disbelief at a hideous graveyard. Their mothers, fathers, cousins, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, friends had once stood proud on that land, but they were slaughtered as fuel for Saruman's takeover. Something shifts in the Ents' collective soul. Reeling in pain and shock, they let out mighty bellows to summon the entire forest. The Ents storm Saruman's castle and demolish his operations. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING<nl/> <nl/>What shifted for the Ents? At first, Sarumon was a far-off political abstraction that didn't affect their sense of self and shared fate. But the assault on family and home turned a distant threat into an immediate challenge to their identity. In an instant of illumination and revulsion, the fight became personal. As suddenly as 'the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike,' it had finally become clear that 'our trees and our lives are in great danger,' Tolkien wrote. <nl/> Climate change, for most, is a far-off political issue. It doesn't define who we are. This is because the climate movement is one of very few social movements that are not defined by identity. My wise friend Kirin Gupta rightly observed that the civil-rights, LGBTQ, women's-rights, and Black Lives Matter movements are each centered on a central aspect of our beings: gender, sexual orientation, race, religion. Whereas\~climate change is a scientific phenomenon. <nl/> How do we create common identity around climate change? How does everyone from youth activists to world leaders feel the crisis in their souls? We do it through love. Climate change becomes a personal issue of identity for all when we understand how it affects what we cherish. The sad reality is that the climate crisis has and will affect all of our lives. We will each experience an urgent connection with this emergency. Once something threatens who you are and what you love, you have no choice but to take action. <nl/> To each politician, global leader, and decision-maker at COP21 and beyond, I ask: What do you love? What are you willing to do for all that you hold dear? Can you feel the pain, the possibility, of losing your home, your family, your community? Hold on to that feeling. Bind it to your heart. That is what I feel. That is what my generation feels. <nl/> My greatest hope for COP21 is that global leaders can secretly become Ents. I hope that the endless effort of youth to convey the dire urgency of this crisis works its way into their hearts. I hope that they find a way to grasp what we feel and make it their own. If they do, it will become impossible to delay meaningful\~action any longer. I hope that they realize that they have the power and the ability to move beyond the slow ambiguous conversations of the status quo and lead the world out of crisis. Just like the Ents. <nl/> As they marched to challenge Saruman, the Ents' leader, Treebeard, declares: 'if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now . we may help the other peoples before we pass away.'<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policyhttp://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy \l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA68","COP21: Is India Stuck On The Wrong Approach? - Analysis","November 27, 2015 Friday","Eurasia Review","By Nilanjan GhoshFrom this month end (November 30 to December 11), the United Nations , COP21 is beginning in Paris. This will be the 21st annual session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 11) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The objective of the 2015 conference is to achieve, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world with an overarching goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase to 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. I have my clear doubts on whether a binding and universal agreement can emerge.The reasons for my cynicism are not one. The first point of contention arises from the differential impacts of climate change on the developing and the developed nations. Recently, a number of authors have opened up a whole new area of research by using the natural variations in temperature among different years caused by the El Ni\'f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which produces extreme weather conditions in different parts of the world. For instance, research by Solomon Hsiang and colleagues shows that for rich countries, an additional degree of warming has a nominal effect, but for poor countries, the same change leads to very significant costs in the form of reduced economic growth and increased costs of military and other conflicts.This is akin to what Thomas Homer-Dixon, cherished political scientist, talked of in the 1990s, when he hypothesized about the environmental scarcities leading to the violent conflicts, and the limited capacity of the poor nations to cope up with the problems, due to the ""ingenuity gap"", the critical gap between our need for ideas to solve complex problems and our actual supply of those ideas.The second point of contention is the concern of distributive justice. The concern begins with: who pays for damages? Most developing countries firmly believe that mitigation should start in the rich countries that bear the largest part of the responsibility for historical emissions. How can one deny the position that the developed world has grown by emitting, whereas the developing and poor world are still on the learning curve? Can one deny the position that only after historically emitting CO2 extensively they have started talking of the perils of the planet, and want the developing world to share parts of the responsibility for the follies committed by them? The very suggestion that all countries should reduce their emissions by similar percentages clearly favors the countries that have large emissions today. Therefore, the calls that the developed nations should compensate the developing nations for the losses caused by the former to the latter through pollution damages also impinging on the ecosystem services is proper, just, and equitable.The third point of contention arises with the capacity of the scientific knowledge and skilled manpower of developing and poor nations to defend their interests in the international climate negotiations. The risks are different across the globe some developing countries have much to lose from climate change, while others are more concerned over the costs of global agreements that will limit their markets for fossil fuel or hamper their perceived chances of development. As a result, building coalitions, even among the low-income countries, will be very difficult.The fourth point of contention arises from the divergence in priorities. Interestingly, the divergence in goals between developed and developing nations can be witnessed in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by developed and developing nations. Whereas the INDCs of the developed world like US, EU, and Japan do not consist of the term ""adaptation"" but only consist of the ""mitigation"" commitments, the developing and emerging nations have a significant portion of INDC's dedicated to ""adaptation"". The need to adapt arises for the poor of the developing world because of livelihoods losses due to ecosystem service losses.The bigger concern of climate change and global warming for the poorer nations is the changes in the land use patterns and forest cover, resulting in changes in ecosystem structures and functions, thereby impeding on the various ecosystem services. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) of 2005 enhanced human understanding of nature's capacity to provide ecosystem services (benefits) to the human society in the form of provisioning services (e.g., food, raw materials, genetic resources, water, minerals, medicinal resources, energy, etc), regulating services (e.g., carbon sequestration, climate regulation, pest and disease control, etc), cultural services (tourism, religion, etc), and above all, supporting services that are necessary for production of all other ecosystem services (e.g. nutrient recycling, gene-pool protection, primary production, soil formation, etc).For the poor people in the developing world, the ecosystem services adds up or complements their low incomes, and is often referred to as ""GDP of the poor"". So, the concern of the poor nations is with the impacts of global warming and climate change on ecosystems-livelihoods linkages, and not really carbon-dioxide emission! How can the poor adapt to such vulnerabilities? Who will pay for this adaptation?The fifth issue of contention arises again from the perspective of understanding the local priorities and bringing them in global platforms like COP 21. Developing nations including India has failed to do that so far! India will again fail to bring that, as I see it, simply because of complying with the carbon-centric approach of global negotiations, as decided by the prime movers of this negotiating process, which are primarily the developed nations. With India being one of the lowest per capita emitter of CO2, its bigger concern is the concern of the poor who are getting poorer because of the losses in the ecosystem services due to global warming and climate change.Unfortunately, the Indian dialogue initiators in the global platform, most of whom will be retired bureaucrats, are likely to adopt the same techno-centric and carbon-centric approach, and argue on l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA76","COP21: A DEFINING MOMENT FOR HUMAN HEALTH - DR MARGARET CHAN, DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF WHO","December 4, 2015 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the World Health Organization:This week's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris offers a chance to save the planet from severe, pervasive and irreversible damage. Though often lost in the debate, saving the planet also means saving the conditions that sustain human life in good health. If sufficiently ambitious and effective, the climate agreement will be a major turning point in environmental policy, but also a far-reaching treaty for protecting public health.The stakes are high. Unless a deal is clinched to keep the temperature rise within two degrees Celsius, the consequences will be catastrophic. Many of the same inefficient and polluting energy choices that are driving climate change are also devastating human health. Climate change degrades air quality, reduces food security and compromises water supplies and sanitation.Climate change and heatlhWHO estimates that, each year, more than 7 million deaths worldwide can be attributed to air pollution. Climate change is also causing tens of thousands of yearly deaths from other causes. Records for extreme weather events -- like droughts and floods, storm surges, heatwaves and wildfires -- are being broken a record number of times, claiming human lives and livelihoods. The World Meteorological Organization says 2015 is already the hottest year since records began in 1880. Next year is predicted to be even hotter.Droughts, especially in poor countries where subsistence farming is rain-fed, threaten already perilous food supplies. Outbreaks of cholera thrive under conditions of too much or too little water. Insects and other carriers of disease are exquisitely sensitive to variations in heat, humidity and rainfall. Climate change has already given dengue a vastly expanded geographical range and may do the same for malaria.Experts predict that, by 2030, climate change will be causing an additional 250,000 deaths each year just from malaria, diarrhoeal disease, heat stress and undernutrition.Investing in better healthImplementing and enforcing higher standards for vehicle emissions and engine efficiency can reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane. Doing so could save at least 2.4 million lives a year by 2030 and reduce global warming by about 0.5o C by 2050. New estimates could raise that to 3.5 million lives saved annually by 2030, and between 3 to 5 million lives per year by 2050. Policies that promote walking and cycling bring added dividends for health.In preparation for COP21, countries have made important commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions and scale up adaptation to climate change, but more needs to be done. If the right commitments are made, efforts to combat climate change will produce an environment with cleaner air, more abundant and safer freshwater and food, and more effective and fair systems for social protection. Healthier people -- arguably the world's most important resource -- will be the bonus.Earlier this year, member states of the United Nations agreed on a set of supremely ambitious goals and targets for sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Without a strong climate deal, most of the 17 goals will be utopian. The tremendous progress made since the start of this century in reducing deaths among children and during childbirth, and turning the epidemics of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis around is likewise at stake. All these hard-won gains can easily be swept away by the tidal wave of health threats unleashed by climate change. We are recklessly late in taking action and must not fail. A ruined planet cannot sustain human lives in good health.\l"

The Action Agenda was launched in December 2014 by the previous meeting of the UNFCCC parties in Lima, Peru.As highlighted in a press release issued by UNFCCC, the LPAA aims to strengthen climate action beyond COP21, by ""mobilizing robust global action towards low carbon and resilient societies and providing enhanced support to existing initiatives.""During the two-week conference, 12 thematic focus events are being organized to expose how climate issues affect various sectors and to suggest relevant solutions to tackle them. On Tuesday, with forests and agriculture taking center stage, leaders from governments, the private and public sectors, civil society and indigenous peoples voiced their environmental concerns.This included how agriculture, forestry and other land uses are responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions about half of that from deforestation and forest degradation, mostly driven by demand for food and wood products and inequities and inefficiencies in the use of land for their production.""Forest countries in partnership with other governments, the private sector and civil society are set for an increased international effort to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation in a few decades,"" said Peru's Minister of the Environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal speaking at a press conference.""The success of the LPAA and its action area on Forests relies on effective synergies between state and non-state actors, between investment and forest management all together rallied behind sustainably managed forests as a common goal,"" he added.According to UN estimates, approximately one billion people depend directly on forests for their livelihoods and each year, approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. This loss of forest cover is said to be responsible for roughly 11 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.Meanwhile, governments and organizations, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), announced six new cooperative initiatives that aim to protect the long-term livelihoods of millions of farmer and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The entities highlighted how agriculture is one of the sectors most seriously affected by extreme climate but it also accounts for 24 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change. The initiatives focus on four key areas: soils in agriculture, the livestock sector, food losses and waste, and sustainable production methods and resilience of farmers. The new partnerships are expected to deploy money and know-how across both developed and developing nations to help hard-pressed farmers become key actors in the global drive to achieve a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.UNFCCC said today's events reveal the ""effective and concrete progress"" that can be made when a wide, international set of stakeholders work together to build resilience and low-carbon systems of production in agricultural and food systems.\l"

Although it can be seen that there is a shared intent on the part of the two regions for COP21 to be a success, differences remain in terms of the ambition of its results, the distribution of the burden between countries according to their level of development and on the physical and legal effects of forest fires.The situation in the South China Sea was another of the issues tackled at the ASEM meeting, without an agreement being reached. The Spanish delegation highlighted its confidence in dialogue and respect for international law as a means to resolve differences. The situation in the Korean Peninsula was also discussed.In his speech, State Secretary Ybaez highlighted the importance placed by Spain on initiatives that will configure the world and globalisation in the coming decades, such as the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), the One Belt One Road initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, of which Spain is a founding member.

CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE MAY BE LAST CHANCE TO NEGOTIATE GLOBAL AGREEMENT ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION","December 7, 2015 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Rutgers University:The 2015 United Nations has gathered 150 heads of state with a single, but lofty objective: negotiate the world's first universal and binding agreement to quell global warming in 20 years.The conference also called the 21th annual Conference of Parties, or COP 21 began in Paris on Nov. 30, and runs through Dec. 11. After speeches and statements from many world leaders most of whom say that action is needed to slow or stop climate change diplomats and technical experts have gotten down to negotiating the details of that action.Benjamin Horton, professor of marine and coastal sciences in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences and a member of the Institute of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, studies changes in sea level over the ages. His research was cited in President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address.Rutgers Today asked Horton to explain the importance of the talks.What makes this U.N. gathering of world powers on climate talks so pivotal?Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. The COP21 in Paris aims to conduct negotiations among countries to contain and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. COP21 is pivotal because it is the last chance for this process. Negotiators agreed in 2011 that a deal had to be done by the end of 2015. Scientists agree that we must cut emissions now or risk catastrophic changes such as losing most of the Antarctic ice sheet.What can we expect to result from this conference? What is your great hope for it?The purpose of is to reach a new global agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. To be successful there must be an agreement from both developed nations, such as the United States, that are more responsible for much of the 20th century greenhouse gas concentrations, and emerging and developing countries, (including China and India, that significantly increased their emissions in the 21th century.I am hoping COP21COP21 by forecasting how severe climate change will be. However, when confronting climate change challenges, considerations of fairness, equity and justice must also inform international agreement to combat climate change.What do you think is the most important thing President Obama said in his opening remarks? Do you agree with the requirements that he said must be in any climate agreement, including an ambitious target that calls for a low-carbon global economy; transparency, and periodic reviews of whether emissions targets need to be adjusted?President Obama stressed the urgency of action on climate change. He was also fully aware of the difficulties of an agreement on greenhouse gas emissions both in the United States and internationally. COP21 must find an agreement that not only curbs emissions, but also allows countries to continue to grow their economies, and provides assistance to the least developed and those most affected by changing climates. Periodic reviews of emissions targets is warranted, because we are responding to climate-related risks in a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate-change impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation.Are you concerned the French government's decision to ban protests and the arrest of protesters at the conference will overshadow the news taking place inside?As nearly 150 global leaders are gathering in Paris, there must be tight security for this critical UN climate meeting. Indeed, an agreement from COP21 that ignores the realities of the world is doomed to fail. This is true for just about all the biggest issues that we confront, from terrorism to energy and climate, criminal justice, health and immigration.\l"

They promised to continue working for climate justice, including divestment from fossil energy.The statement was developed by the World Council of Churches (WCC), ACT Alliance, CIDSE - an international alliance of Catholic development agencies and Religions for Peace with regard to the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris.The statement was handed to the secretary general of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Christiana Figueres, on 19 October in Bonn, Germany. This was on the occasion of the last round of climate negotiations before COP21 and the inter-sessional meeting of faith leaders from various traditions.""As representatives of the majority of the global population who live with religious affiliations and values, we will not only hold leaders to account, but will also support politicians working towards an ambitious global climate agreement in Paris and beyond"", reads the statement.The statement is a follow-up to the Interfaith Summit on Climate Change organized by Religions for Peace and the WCC in September 2014 in New York, as well as Pope Francis' Encyclical on ""care for our common home"". The document also refers to international faith initiatives such as pilgrimages for climate justice and fasting for the climate.Dr Guillermo Kerber, WCC programme executive for Care for Creation and Climate Justice, said, ""Once again faith leaders have expressed an urgent need for a fair, ambitious and binding treaty as an outcome from Paris. Time is running out, and present commitments by states, although relevant, do not match with the needs of people in the most vulnerable communities in various places who are already suffering the impacts of climate change.""Religious leaders have argued in the statement that an ambitious Paris agreement is not only a scientific, political and economic necessity but also a fundamental ethical and moral challenge, and the religious communities immensely care about it.In the statement they also referred to five key religious convictions regarding climate justice that they share across different faith contexts. They stressed that COP 21 offers the right momentum to translate fundamental values and beliefs into concrete climate action, leading to transformation towards a zero carbon, climate resilient, more equitable and just future.Apart from addressing governments, the statement calls on all other stakeholders in climate negotiations to act responsibly and strengthen their efforts. A firm commitment by the signatories of the statement was made to focus on their own emission reduction targets, to continue addressing climate risks, raise climate consciousness and divest from fossil fuels.Copyright Targeted News ServicesAutoTriage6yd 151021 30VitinMar-5323395 30VitinMar\l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA90","PARADOXES OF PARIS: REFLECTIONS FROM COP21","December 7, 2015 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of Vermont:Jennie Stephens, Blittersdorf Professor of Science and Policy, is one of four UVM people three faculty members and one student to make the trip to Paris for the United Nations , COP21. One week in, Stephens shares her perspective on the events surrounding the negotiations, how this year's COP differs from those of the past, and the feelings of both hope and futility in the air as world leaders attempt to create a plan to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius.Read her thoughts:Reflecting on my experiences in Paris during the first week of the international climate negotiations, I am struck by the paradoxes the tangible tensions between hope and frustration, between optimism and futility. Among the thousands of international visitors in Paris for the climate conference including the official national delegations of negotiators as well as the many more representing NGOs, private sector organizations, environmental activists, the energy industry (both fossil fuel and renewables), universities, youth, parents, and other parts of civil society there is a diversity in perspectives and priorities that includes both a simultaneous sense of unprecedented positive collective action as well as assumed inadequacy in the highly anticipated agreement scheduled to be finalized by the end of the week.Last week began with motivating speeches by prominent world leaders, including the president of France, the prince of Wales, and President Obama highlighting the urgency and significance of the Paris negotiations. Unlike the disappointing 2009 Copenhagen Accord which was pieced together at the eleventh hour by a few prominent leaders on the last night of COP15, the organizers this time strategically coordinated the heads-of-state to show up at the beginning (rather than the end) of the two-week negotiations to offer support and encouragement for the process ahead. These speeches also acknowledged links between climate disruption and security, offering condolences and solidarity to the people of Paris as they recover from the tragic terrorist attacks of Nov. 13.Chilling effect of the attacksBefore the attacks, an unprecedented level of civic engagement, mass mobilization, protests, demonstrations and marches on the streets of Paris was anticipated. But in response to the attacks, the French government declared a state of emergency prohibiting for three months any gatherings of people for political purposes. While sports and music events are allowed, events that bring people together in public places with political messages are illegal. So instead of the large climate march on the Sunday before the meetings started, activists organized a distributed human chain with people holding hands along the march route. The plan for how activists will conclude the two weeks, how to replace the huge march that was originally planned for Saturday Dec. 12, is still emerging with tentative plans for a single police-authorized event in a stadium in the southern part of the city (far from the official conference site). Despite scaling back of the demonstrations on the streets of Paris, many other publicly accessible events of all kinds have proceeded within the official conference center and in multiple other venues throughout the city. With the People's Climate Summit organized for this weekend, a concentration of public events are happening now.Among the highlights of the events I attended, a panel on fossil fuel divestment was inspirational as international leaders of the divest-invest movement described the growing impact of this rapidly expanding social movement. At this event I connected with Bill McKibben, Vermont resident and founder of 350.org and heard from Stephen Heintz, of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, who talked about how the divestment-investment movement is changing the world of philanthropy, and Jess Worth of ""BP or not BP?"" who described efforts to reduce corporate fossil fuel donations to museums and cultural events.Ice inspiresAnother highlight included a stunning art exhibit in front of the historic Pantheon in the Paris city center where twelve huge blocks of ice broken off from the Greenland ice sheet are arranged in a circle to represent a clock. Throughout the two weeks of the climate negotiations these pieces of ice are gradually melting, representing the limited time left to take effective action. This artistic expression of urgency, demonstrates in a very simple and tangible way the precarious global situation. This powerful exhibit, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, was coordinated by two Danish artists (Olafur Eliassson and Minik Rosing).The ice melting in Paris represents for me the paradoxes of climate change and the Paris negotiations. We simultaneously understand on one level that these efforts are in some ways futile (we are already locked in to a severe degree of climate disruption even if/when we can achieve drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions) while on another level these unprecedented efforts of collective action represent extreme optimism and hope. At a personal level, the growing level of commitment and passion to address climate change, demonstrated by individuals and organizations in Paris and around the world, offers great inspiration.\l"

Only a few days ago, not far from this venue, terrorists launched an attack on the people of Paris, and by extension on us all. We condemn terrorism wherever it strikes. By coming here today we are demonstrating that we are stronger than any terrorists.Today, heads of government from some 150 countries have the chance to look beyond all the controversies and differing interests, and to send a very clear joint message a message that will determine the future of our planet. At stake are the foundations on which the life of future generations will depend. We are well aware of the need to act today. That is what this Conference is all about. That is the defining feature of the outcome we will have to agree on in the next few days.I would like to start off by thanking everyone involved in preparing this meeting, in particular the French Government and the United Nations. After a long hiatus, we now have the chance to reach our goal an international agreement. Put simply, this means no more and no less than ensuring that the rise in global temperatures remains under 2C in comparison with pre""industrial levels. This goal is necessary. But, as the small island states show, it is not sufficient. We therefore need a UN agreement which is ambitious, which is comprehensive, which is fair and which is binding.What does that mean? Let's look at these four elements individually. First comes ambitious:For the very first time, more than 170 countries industrialised nations, emerging economies and developing countries have submitted information on their intended national contributions towards reaching the 2C target. The good news is that these relate to 95% of CO2 emissions worldwide. The bad news is that the submitted INDCs won't be enough to reach the 2C target. At this Summit we must therefore state credibly what we can do in the coming years in order to meet the target. We will be required, no more and no less, to undertake a far""reaching decarbonisation of our economies in the course of the 21st century.Secondly, comprehensive:Comprehensive means that we need a fundamental transformation of our societies embracing all sectors, including industrial production, mobility, energy generation, thermal insulation and energy efficiency. Germany has set itself clear targets. We are going to reduce our CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020. And by the year 2050, we want to have reduced emissions by 80 to 95% from a 1990 basel"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA97","New Mexico: Ecoppia Agreement to Deploy Its Robotic Technology to 40 MW PV Site for EDF RE and Arava Ahead of COP21","December 4, 2015 Friday","US Official News","Santa Fe: NM Solar Energy Association has issued the following news release: In time for the kick-off of the UN conference on climate change, Ecoppia has inked a deal to retrofit a 40 MW PV solar site jointly owned by EDF RE and Arava Power with its autonomous and waterless robotic cleaning solution. Ecoppia\' s automated and waterless technology is increasingly in demand as the solar industry matures. The agreement is significant because it lends increasing commercial clout to a technology that is disrupting the solar energy business. Dirt and dust cover (soiling, in industry speak) on solar panels are a significant challenge and can decrease energy output by up to 40%. Existing solutions - oftentimes labourers with water and brushes - can damage panels, use huge amounts of water and be cost-inefficient. Ecoppia provides a solution in the form of autonomous, waterless robots that are managed through the cloud and clean panels every night after production stops. ""It's the next step for the solar industry,"" says Eran Meller, CEO of Ecoppia. ""We're seeing significant value creation in all the projects we're currently involved in, both here in the Middle East and in India. For many of the big industry players, a solution that can clean panels nightly, can respond instantly to weather and is waterless - we feel solutions like ours have the potential to become the industry standard."" The site is among the largest solar parks in the Middle East and is located in Southern Israel's Arava Valley - next to the Jordanian border and 20 and 60 miles from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The cleaning technology is so promising that Meller has been asked by Israel to attend COP21 as part of a special delegation of green technology companies from Israel. ""It's very exciting to see the progress Ecoppia is making in terms of winning large clients - it's because of promising technology like theirs that we believe Israel has a bright future in the International Solar Industry and why Ecoppia was chosen to take part in a side event on ""Israeli Innovation in response to climate change"". This special event which the Government of Israel has organized together with Israel Green Energy Association, is part of the COP21,"" said Ron Adam, the permanent representative of Israel to IRENA (The International Renewable Energy Agency).

Climate Change Summit in Paris Falls Short","December 16, 2015 Wednesday 12:38 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Green Party issued the following news release:U.S. Green Party leaders said that the nonbinding deal reached in Paris at the 2015 United Nations (COP 21) showed progress but ultimately failed to address the crisis as a global emergency.Greens from the U.S. and around the world attended the summit, with many taking part in public demonstrations outside of the summit and demanding that participating nations ""Keep Coal, Oil and Gas in the Ground"" and commit to 100% clean renewable energy.Statements by Greens:Dr. Margaret Flowers, Green candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maryland ( HYPERLINK http://www.flowersforsenate.org""While it is remarkable that an agreement was reached by all 195 nations, the agreement is not a solution. The severity of the climate crisis and the pressure of the global climate justice movement forced the nations to reach consensus, but the final language is completely inadequate to address the crisis and provide financial support to those who need it.The final treaty, which will replace the Kyoto Treaty when it expires in 2020, is non-binding; and thus the inadequate commitments made by each nation are not mandatory. Current commitments to reduce greenhouse gases are too little, too late.Though the stated goal of the Paris Treaty is to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the stated commitments won't achieve that. And although previous drafts of the treaty called for phasing out fossil fuels in the second half of the century, the final draft excludes that language. Countries are also not required to cut emissions before the new treaty commences in 2020.""Andrea Merida, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States:""The decision to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was a positive step. But the deal combines this with only voluntary pledges from nations for the actions necessary to prevent average global temperatures from rising further.Scientists and environmental groups have warned that the pledges, especially those from wealthy developed countries, to curb greenhouse gas emissions are more likely to result in a dangerous rise of 2.7C or more. Furthermore, the pledges are not legally binding. The deal tells us that it's unlikely that the global community will reach the 'net zero emissions' goal by 2070, based on imperatives established by U.N. scientists.""Audrey Clement, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States:""Republicans continue to deny anthropogenic climate change, while Democrats like President Obama acknowledge the crisis but are reluctant to seek deep cuts in domestic fossil-fuel consumption and emissions. The positions of both parties show the pervasive influence of Big Oil and we can be certain that Republicans in Congress will block ratification by the U.S. of any climate-change agreement.The Green Party calls for a complete reorientation of our national energy priorities, beginning with the elimination of subsidies for petroleum and coal energy, divestment from fossil-fuel companies, enactment of carbon fees and dividends to reflect the true cost of fossil fuel extraction, and phasing out of off-shore drilling, mountaintop removal mining, hydrofracking, and new pipel"
"COP21","USA","COP21_USA99","CITIES EMERGE AS URGENT CLIMATE SOLUTION AT COP21","December 10, 2015 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","As the climate conference advances into its final stages amid the colossal challenge of having 195 countries agree on a single and unified global policy on climate change, urban areas appear a a different issue but complementary solution for all. Cities are undeniably one of the key players in the global warming arena, being the leading source of greenhouse gases, of population settlements and of energy consumption, grouping three highly interconnected driving factors of global warming. As humanity walks deeper into the 21st century their relevance will only grow.Cities and municipal level government offices have proven to move faster than the international country-driven negotiations in addressing climate change, as international alliances both inside and outside the UN umbrella show.However, they don\'e2??t live in another world and their solution portfolio is intertwined with the fate of the 2015 UN Climate Conference (COP21).\'e2??The way decisions will be made as part of the agreement, including the funding and the agenda of solutions, all these decisions will be implemented at that sub national level so they are key to success,\'e2? said French French Minister of Ecology, Energy and Sustainable Development S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne Royal.The minister spoke during the presentation at COP21 of a five-year plan to raise action from cities and regions spanning across five continents representing almost one-fifth of the world\'e2??s population.The plan was launched under the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) platform, a mechanism created during last year\'e2??s climate conference as a way to include so-called non state actors into the search for the climate solution.Its urban workstream currently includes over 2200 settlements around the world, from Mongolia\'e2??s capital Ulan Bator to globalization strongholds like New York and London and adds to previous efforts like C40.Tokyo, for instance, emits as much as 62 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per year, which accounts to the equivalent of the 37 countries least polluting countries in Africa.Their transition to a greener economy is also an economic necessity. If the world keeps a business-as-usual high-carbon economy, about 90 trillion dollars, or an average of six trillion a year, will be invested in infrastructure in the world\'e2??s cities, agriculture and energy systems over the next 15 years, according to the New Climate Economy report \'e2??Better Growth, Better Climate\'e2?.But the report adds that only around 270 billion dollars a year would be needed to accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon economy, through clean energy, more compact cities, better public transport systems and smarter land use.These and other low-carbon local decisions are going to be taken by country delegates at the climate conference, but the actual heavy lifting will come from sub national efforts.\'e2??COP21 is the first time that cities will have their voices fully recognized at a global UN conference on climate change and the first time mayors are gathering in great numbers to demand bold action,\'e2? said UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Michael Bloomberg during the Cities for Change, a parallel event in Paris.The conference comes at a crucial moment. Earlier this year, Paris suffered from haze masking city\'e2??s landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and this week Beijing raised a \'e2??red alert\'e2? warning over smog and the city has gone on a shutdown to protect its people, so mayors and city planners are moving fast.The city of Ghent in Belgium has implemented projects that address climate change. Speaking at a side event in COP21 called \'e2??Global Covenant of Mayors: Towards Carbon Neutral and Inclusive Cities,\'e2? the city\'e2??s mayor Tine Heyset emphasized climate policies at the local level. \'e2??Climate policy should contribute to reduce emissions. It can contribute to a livable city, reduction of poverty, and better housing. Local authorities can demonstrate that local climate policy is not only good for climate but also good for citizens,\'e2? she said. And it\'e2??s not just developed cities that are making bold steps of climate action. Mayor Josefa Errazuris of Chile\'e2??s Providencia also shared about their city-wide projects such as changing street lights to LED and having a target of 50 per cent carbon reduction of GHG based on 2014 levels. \'e2??In order to protect our commune and the sustainability of our territory, we have efforts to include climate change as part of policies,\'e2? she said.But urban areas also have to carry a heavy burden. During her intervention, minister Royal highlighted the double nature of the cities as \'e2??both places with highest greenhouse gases but also where you need concrete and urgent action\'e2? to address the negative impacts of climate change.A 2013 paper published in Nature showed that without major new defences or emissions cuts, the global costs of flooding in cities could rise to one trillion dollars a year in 2050 and the negative effects span to all corners of the world.As poverty hotspots around the world, cities lack the necessary resilience to withstand climate change and its impacts, which usually harder on the most vulnerable among communities and settlements. The 2014 World Urbanization Prospects revealed that 828 million people are currently living in slums, as satellites or metropolis in all continents, a number enlarged by 6 million on a yearly basis.But it\'e2??s not only the world\'e2??s most vulnerable. A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that if global warming continues as it is now, half the homes in 21 cities in the United States will be underwater by 2100.COP21 is scheduled to deliver a final text by Thursday noon, Paris time, in which all 195 countries that signed to the UN Climate Convention agree on a global plan to combat climate change.(End)\l"

They are:<nl/>Peak in emissions - set the conditions to achieve an early peak in global energy-related emissions. Five-year revision - review national climate targets regularly, to test the scope, to raise ambition. Lock in the vision - translate the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal. Track the transition - establish a process for tracking achievements in the energy sector.<nl/>'As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence,' van der Hoeven said in the IEA's press release[3] accompanying the release of the report. 'It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept.'<nl/> The first of four 'key pillars' the IEA believes is essential is an earlier 'peak in emissions,' which the IEA believes 'can be achieved relying solely on proven technologies and policies, without changing the economic and development prospects of any region.' The authors of the report detail this idea in the 'Bridge Scenario' which depends upon five separate measures:<nl/>Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors Reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction Increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from $270 billion in 2014 to $400 billion in 2030 Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030 Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production<nl/>The Bridging Scenario would see coal use peak before 2020 and then decl"

It will change the world's approach to fossil fuels, and it establishes an achievable path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to respond to the potentially devastating changes caused by climate change. That almost 200 countries from around the globe signed on to the agreement is a breathtaking sign of unity and commitment. I am proud to have been part of California's delegation to COP 21, and I am proud of our state's leadership and vision on climate change. By showing what is possible, California helped open the door to this historic agreement. The Paris Agreement is by no means the end, however.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA107","Reflecting On Georgetown At COP21","January 5, 2016 Tuesday","The Hoya: Georgetown University","PARIS - Le Bourget, the location of the 2015 United Nations , was surprisingly far from the center of Paris. Conference-goers got off in the periphery of the metro at Fort d'Aubervilliers before taking a shuttle ride that offered views of the fairly drab suburb of Le Bourget, filled with plain storefronts and often-dilapidated apartment buildings. It did not seem like the kind of place the entire world would be watching.I chose the second week of negotiations to visit the conference to attend an event hosted by Georgetown, a panel discussion titled ""The Subnational (State and Provincial) Foundation for Action."" The other three events hosted by Georgetown officials were titled ""Challenges and Opportunities in China-U.S. Cooperation on Energy and Climate Change,"" ""Subnational Cooperation on Clean, Resilient Transportation"" and ""U.S. State Actions to Achieve Significant GHG Reduction.""By the time I attended the conference, the overwhelming security-presence brouhaha that surrounded the arrival of 150 heads of state in France had subsided, and entering the Climate Generations space, located behind the main negotiations area, involved nothing more than a straightforward security check. The space, intended for civil society and open to the public, aimed to drive dialogue about climate change between ordinary citizens, nongovernmental organizations and policymakers.Three sections of the giant tent were designated for stalls operated by NGOs and cities to inform the public on particular initiatives, including everything from the basics of recycling to the intersection of poverty and the environment. Ten conference rooms in another section hosted panel discussions throughout the day, while a projection room screened environmental documentaries.The panel I attended was a dialogue on subnational efforts by American states and Canadian provinces to combat climate change. It featured Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, Manitoba Premier Gregory Selinger and senior officials from Quebec, California and Washington state.Georgetown Climate Center Executive Director Vicki Arroyo moderated the event. The Climate Center is an affiliate of the Georgetown Law Center that collaborates with the federal government to coordinate state policies around the country.As the Climate Center works closely with state and provincial governments, Arroyo highlighted the outsized impact of subnational actors on the fight against climate change.""They're not subnational, they're super-national,"" Arroyo said at the panel.Shumlin credited the Climate Center with bringing these various actors together.""We were all working too hard to think about working together,"" Shumlin said. ""We would not be working together without Vicki and her team at Georgetown.""Establishing a theme that other panelists would also emphasize, Shumlin pointed to transportation as a primary area of action, noting the importance of the Climate Center's Transportation and Climate Initiative in designing improvements to electric vehicle infrastructure.Selinger expanded on Shumlin's remarks, explaining the importance of state-level focus.""Every jurisdiction has its own challenges,"" Selinger said.Yet the panelists also acknowledged the interconnectedness of issues across borders. Quebec Environmental Minister David Heurtel said that his province had just established a sub-national $25.5 million Solidarity Fund to invest in developing countries, the first of its kind.""We have a responsibility worldwide as well,"" Heurtel said.Quebec and California have also teamed up to implement a cooperative cap-and-trade system, a partnership which California Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Matt Rodriquez said developed naturally.""I thought I'd just be focused on California throughout my time as secretary, but a number of other governments around the world were interested in what we were doing,"" Rodriquez said.Sarah Rees, special assistant to the director for climate policy at the Washington State Department of Ecology, underl"

Anne Smith, the senior vice president and environmental practice co-chair at NERA Economic Consulting, cautioned that on the CPP, the 'EPA's cost estimate is an underestimate.' Smith said the CPP's 'net costs to the economy are substantial,' with higher electricity costs and reduced consumer spending. President Barack Obama holds a press conference at the White House to announce the new Clean Power Plan on Aug. 3. World leaders will meet at the United Nations in Paris Nov. 30-Dec. 11 to negotiate a global climate change agreement. (Photo: Patsy Lynch/Polaris/Newscom) Paul Knappenberger, the assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, said 'climate change is real' and that it is due to 'human and natural factors.' What is disputed is 'the degree to which we can separate those factors.' Knappenberger added that the Clean Power Plan would result in a 'global temperature savings by the end of the century of about two one-hundredths of a degree.' 'This is neither meaningful nor scientifically detectable.' Other witnesses were supportive of an international agreement. Katie Dykes, the deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the chair of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, Inc., defended the president's initiative, comparing it to a climate agreement among\\xA6states[2] that she argued has created jobs and reduced carbon emissions.

The conference will cover the latest developments in market-based mechanisms to address climate change, carbon trading, climate finance, and low-emission development. Coming just months before the United NationsClimate Change Conference in Paris, where countries are to adopt a new, universal climate agreement, the LACCF 2015 is an important opportunity for private and public-sector representatives to leverage market and finance opportunities for ambitious and effective climate action in the region.  As countries are busy preparing and making public their intended contributions to a new universal climate change agreement to be adopted in Paris in December, the Forum offers a golden opportunity to explore the use of market-based mechanisms and approaches to increase emission reduction ambition and stimulate sustainable development now and over the years and decades to come, said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a co-organizer of LACCF 2015. Aneffective response to climate change requires strong interlinkages between politics, finance, technology and execution strategies. Thus, the three-day event will cover the latest in climate policy, low carbon technology solutions, carbon pricing and climate finance options throughout 8 plenaries,12 thematic workshopsand 4 side events. Different mechanisms and sources that help to support low carbon development goals, provide access to climate finance, and to promote innovation and policies addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation will be discussed. Participants will also explore ways to leverage and scale up private investment in the region and business leaders will learn how to incorporate environmental considerations into their business planning while preparing for future ""clean"" opportunities. Furthermore, since achieving clean development requires building the capacity in the public and private sectors to identify, adapt and deploy the most appropriate low carbon technologies, renowned climate change experts from both sectors will highlight the importance of innovation in the energy sector, Climate Smart Agriculture & land use, and transport, among others. As momentum grows for transition to carbon neutral economies, this year\' s regional carbon forum will also show how individuals, governments and the private sector can spur action through offsetting, featuring achievements of Latin American carbon offset projects, and showcase the experience of those who are already helping to create a climate resilient future. This conference is jointly organized by the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World Bank Group, the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the UNEP DTU Partnership, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and CAF -Development Bank of Latin America (CAF).

We need 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2050 to combat climate change. This will require effective regulation and markets that value low carbon emissions and reliable supplies,"" said WNA Director General Agneta Rising. ""France has shown that with nuclear energy an affordable low carbon generation mix is achievable. COP 21 must deliver an agreement that helps us achieve a low carbon emissions world.""<nl/> The Paris talks represent a rare opportunity for world leaders to lay the framework for an ambitious and meaningful plan that transforms the global energy economy for the better, according to Nuclear Matters.<nl/> ""As President Obama and other world leaders convene in Paris for the United Nations Summit on Climate Change to discuss groundbreaking measures that aim to combat the effects of global warming, carbon-free nuclear energy must be recognized for its role in helping us transition to a cleaner energy future,"" said Nuclear Matters co-chair and former Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN).<nl/> In the United States, existing nuclear power provides 20 percent of electricity and more than 60 percent of carbon-free energy.\~<nl/> ""Unfortunately, a number of our existing nuclear power plants are at risk of premature shutdown or have already announced their retirement, which will lead to an increase in carbon emissions. Further premature closures must be prevented to ensure that the progress we've made in reducing carbon emissions is not compromised, and to help the United States retain its position as a leader on climate change,"" Bayh said. ""As a recent White House Summit underscored, the administration supports nuclear for its role in addressing climate change, but more must be done, including implementing public policies that properly value nuclear for its carbon-free benefits. This would help us retain the existing nuclear fleet and ensure nuclear is a part of our carbon reduction plan, as any credible attempt at this must include nuclear.""<nl/> Nuclear for Climate said in a new position paper that a significant expansion of nuclear energy is necessary for the world to achieve an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to prevent a greater than two degrees Celsius rise in average global temperatures.<nl/> ""We strongly believe the world must use all available low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear energy, if it is to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting development goals and not impeding on economic growth,"" said Val\'e9rie Faudon, director-general at the French Nuclear Energy Society (SFEN).<nl/> While meeting this goal appears challenging, electricity generation is one sector where a low carbon path has been proven with technology available today, WNA contends. Countries such as Switzerland, Brazil, Sweden and France have achieved low carbon electricity supplies through combinations of generation from nuclear energy and renewables.<nl/> Globally, 438 reactors generate around 11 percent of the world's electricity, with almost no greenhouse gas emissions. In the European Union, nuclear energy accounts for more than half of all low-carbon electricity. In the United States, it accounts for 63 percent of all low-carbon electricity.<nl/> Going forward, developed and developing countries alike will expand nuclear energy as part of their transition to a lower carbon electrical grid. For example, China is expected to account for one-third of the world's installed nuclear energy capacity by 2050 to meet its energy and climate change goals.<nl/> Over the last 50 years nuclear generation has been estimated to have avoided the emission of more than 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to ""Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power"" -- more than ten times the annual carbon dioxide emissions from the world's road transport.<nl/> For more: - see this report[1]<nl/> Related articles: Shifting focus: Owner of world's largest nuclear fleet looks to renewable energy[2] Warm and fuzzy?

It is right that we all reflect on the ""historic"" outcomes of the COP21, but most importantly, focus on how we intend to implement the measures we have agreed upon.The British Embassy is supporting the Chilean Chapter of the Corporate Leaders Group on climate Change (CLG) since its creation after the visit to Chile of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in 2009.The Chilean chapter is modelled after the UK Chapter, the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group (CLG).Prior to the COP21The agreement reached in Paris marks a clear turning point towards a sustainable and low carbon future. As Prime Minister David Cameron said ""this global deal now means that the whole world has signed to play its part in halting climate change. It's a moment to remember and a huge step forward in helping to secure the future of our planet.""In particular, the Paris deal clears the way for the private sector to drive a long-term solution by investing in low carbon transition. In the UK, we already have a clear long-term approach. We have a legally-binding 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 and legislation -the Climate Change Act which introduces 5-year carbon budgets, set 12 years in advance. This system allows us the flexibility to keep costs low while giving long term certainty to business.The UK is already benefitting from the transition to a low carbon economy. In 2013 the UK's annual turnover in this sector was 122 billion the equivalent to twice that of our car manufacturing and food and drink industriesUK businesses have also welcomed the deal. We saw many examples in Paris where businesses and investors made billions of pounds worth of commitments to a low carbon economy, including the insurance sector collectively investing over $100 billion in smarter risk and resilience projects.Additionally, one of the main announcements of the COP 21 events included the launch of the Mission Innovation initiative by President Obama, President Bachelet and Prime Minister Cameron, together with heads of state from 17 other countries in collaboration with 27 private sector investors. Through Mission Innovation, these actors pledged a doubling in low carbon innovation a great example of the public and private sector coming together.We have long said that Paris is not a one-stop, top-down treaty where Governments 'solve' the problem of climate change.Through the collective participation of its members, initiatives like the CLG should and can have a key role towards driving long term solutions and accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy in Chile. Tonight's event is a great example of how we can encourage more members of the private sector to participate in dialogues, collective actions and networks that will support a more sustainable and low carbon future for Chile and the world.Thank you.\l"

COP 21 was the first United Nations climate conference to gather experts from both the private and public sectors to address global climate change. Sarah shared her impressions on the landmark conference and what it means to JLL in reducing greenhouse gases across its global footprint and helping clients do the same.<nl/> Q: COP21 was the first global climate change conference to include both the private and public sectors to tackle global warming. What were your overall impressions of the conference proceedings?\~<nl/> A: What resonated with me was the presence of big, multinational company CEOs - several of whom are JLL's clients - who spoke with unwavering conviction about the economic drivers of climate change. This was echoed, too, by politicians such as US Secretary of State John Kerry who remarked that climate change was the biggest market opportunity in the history of humankind. <nl/> I viewed the critical discussions and negotiations as a means to obtain a clearer understanding of the countries' respective positions and how this would provide certainty and a unified signal for business action.<nl/> Q: One conference session particularly relevant to JLL's global business concerned the Buildings Efficiency Accelerator (BEA) initiative. What are the links to JLL's ongoing efforts to educate and guide its clients in energy reduction?<nl/> A: The Sustainable Energy for All's Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform aims to double the rate of energy efficiency by 2030. Buildings is one of several accelerators such as Industry, District Energy Systems and Lighting that will help drive forward this energy efficiency goal.<nl/> Our industry leadership in property and corporate facility management services spans a portfolio of 3.4 billion square feet worldwide, so we have a vested interest in the building sector that accounts for about 40% of global energy consumption. The Buildings Efficiency Accelerator session at COP 21 was, not surprisingly, the one most relevant to JLL.<nl/> The BEA encourages widespread implementation of progressive policies that boost the use of best available technologies, low-energy building design and energy efficient renovation that can deliver 25-50% reductions in energy demand from new and existing buildings.\~<nl/> Q: Were there any examples of what U.S. companies were doing proactively to reduce their CO2 emissions that you found particularly progressive?<nl/> A: As you might imagine, technology companies like Google and Microsoft are leading the way in reducing their carbon footprints. Google, for example, has been carbon neutral since 2007. Google described how long-term (10-20 years) renewable energy contracts (committed to using renewable energy) help create financial certainty, but may not be something that a building landlord wants to sign given the duration. So they, as well as others in the industry, are still trying to figure out which constructs make the most sense to achieve the scale that is crucial to drive down costs for renewable energy.<nl/> Regarding Microsoft, I learned more about their internal carbon fee in Paris. Microsoft spoke to the power of putting carbon on a company's profit and loss statement. And in Microsoft's experience, the carbon fee also helps to provide an accountability mechanism. So even for a company like JLL that has a total carbon footprint of around 52,000 metric tons of CO2e (compared to 30,000+ metric tons of CO2e for Microsoft), a carbon fee may help speak in terms of money i.e. a tax instead of carbon. This could be the key to engaging a company's business leaders such as the Chief Financial Officer.\~<nl/> Q: Given JLL's long-term involvement with the UN Global Compact and other global organizations dealing with climate change, do you foresee additional engagement with other organizations moving forward?<nl/> A: We're committed to: continued involvement with the UN Global Compact; active participation in green building councils around the world; a longer-term collaboration with the World Economic Forum where our CEO has been actively engaged; and steady interest as a Business Network member in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which seeks to align capital allocation and corporate behavior to wider goals of financial stability and sustainable development.\~<nl/> To show our support for a positive COP21 outcome, we joined the UN Caring for Climate[3] initiative and the Non-state Actor Zone for Climate Action[4] (NAZCA). We also used our time in Paris to better understand the vast array of external organizations that are driving forward climate changes actions both within our industry and more broadly. As encouraged by our CEO, this will help JLL carefully review our climate change partnerships so that we are involved in the most focused and relevant way possible. This is especially important considering how the conversation on climate change has significantly advanced in the last few years.<nl/> Q: How does the outcome of the Climate Change agreement align with JLL's commitment to GHG emissions reduction and global sustainability?<nl/> A: Since 2008 JLL has recognized the impact of GHG emissions and committed to helping our clients address energy and sustainability in their real estate. Over time, we have also recognized that we cannot credibly offer these services without doing the same in our own operations.<nl/> As a result, we set 3 targets in 2013 for JLL offices to reduce our own environmental footprint. Our latest Global Sustainability Report[5] has details on these targets and our progress. COP 21 has spurred JLL to consider how we can reset our targets according to a longer timeframe and based on climate change science. We had considered this approach in 2013 and the Climate Change agreement provides extra impetus to raise our ambitious.\~<nl/> This reminds me of a powerful theme from COP 21: the thresholds are continually getting higher and higher. Let's take a simple example based on company scores in initiatives such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index or CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). Companies may score X in year 1, then X+1 in year 2. Even though improvement has been shown in year 2, the market is actually starting to require X+3.<nl/> This means expectations are higher over a shorter duration. Companies that do not innovate and that cannot change will lose the race. It's great to see that the Climate Change agreement - and general tone of the conference - was that we're all expecting more from one another. And that climate change is here to stay.\~<nl/> Q: How do you see the COP21 conference outcomes and the Climate Change agreement being received by your company's leadership and sustainability teams?\~<nl/> A: Ahead of the conference, JLL's CEO sent a note to all staff worldwide, which was then followed shortly by a note from me and Dan to JLL's internal sustainability stakeholders. The main aim of these notes was to make the firm's presence at COP 21 known, and it has started a great dialogue in many different directions about JLL's role in advancing climate change. It's terrific to see that the momentum and positivity from Paris carry over into conversations within JLL as well. <nl/> We certainly believe the conference outcomes are consistent with our long-term sustainability strategy, and our immediate plans include several briefings with JLL leadership to provide our COP 21 observations. We will also issue internal guidance that ensures our client account managers understand what COP 21 means for their clients across all sectors.<nl/> We see these developments as the perfect springboard to engage our clients and supply chain partners, further extending our influence beyond our business to create permanent, sustainable behavioral change.<nl/> Ultimately, our involvement in COP 21 - and even more so, the actions that we take following the Climate Change agreement - will help ensure we have a sustainable enterprise that clients, investors and employees can rely on for the long term.\~<nl/> About JLL's Sarah Nicholls\~<nl/> Sarah Nicholls is JLL's Global Corporate Sustainability (GCS) team leader. The GCS team focuses primarily on the sustainability strategy and reporting for JLL's own operations across the 80 countries where JLL serves its clients.

As a result of climate change crop yields are generally projected to decrease across Africa, putting security at risk.""""Therefore, the COP21 must deliver a fair climate deal for Africa"", he argued.He called on African negotiators to speak with one voice and work tirelessly to ensure that the new climate agreement is a fair deal for Africa. ""It is in this spirit that the Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union Commission, the African Development Bank and the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency have come together to provide the Africa Pavilion at this a COP.The Pavilion is a platform for coordination of events, interests and stakeholders as well as an intellectual hub for exchange and fusion of ideas on climate change and its implications for the continent.

But it could rile conservatives in Washington, especially if he tries to put the deal into effect without seeking congressional approval.Obama's administration has pledged during the international talks to reduce U.S. emissions by up to 28 percent by 2025. But inscribing the emissions target in the Paris deal would probably require the president to submit the pact to the GOP-controlled Congress, where it would be unlikely to win ratification. Many Republicans doubt global warming is real or fear that stringent pollution controls could kill jobs.So the administration is looking to keep the targets out while including binding procedures on when and how countries should periodically review and raise their targets.""Although the targets themselves may not have the force of treaties, the process, the procedures that ensure transparency and periodic reviews, that needs to be legally binding,"" Obama said in Paris, ""and that's going to be critical.""Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a fierce critic of Obama's policies, fired back immediately.""The U.S. Senate will not be ignored. If the president wishes to sign the American people up to a legally binding agreement, the deal must go through the Senate,"" he said in a statement. ""There is no way around it.""The White House previously said parts of the deal should be legally binding, but this is the first time Obama has said it himself and spelled out which ones.Obama's comments brought relief to the French hosts of the conference, who were worried about whether the U.S. wanted a binding deal at all after Secretary of State John Kerry told The Financial Times that the agreement was ""definitely not going to be a treaty"" and that there was ""not going to be legally binding reduction targets.""""The fact that the United States of America could commit to a binding agreement, whilst before there was a doubt because of Congress, is really extraordinary news that comes at a good time,"" French Environment Minister Segolene Royal said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans have warned other countries not to trust any deal Obama may strike. Other GOP politicians moved to block Obama's plan to force steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.On Tuesday, the House passed two resolutions disapproving Obama's rules to reduce carbon emissions from power plants despite a promised presidential veto.At a news conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked whether Congress was out of step with public opinion on climate change.""I don't think we're out of step with public opinion wanting jobs, wanting economic growth, weighing the costs and the benefits,"" Ryan said. ""I think when you weigh the costs and the benefits against these so-called legally binding obligations, they don't add up. I think it's very clear people want jobs.""At the Paris talks, the European Union has called for a legally binding agreement with emissions targets, but observers said it is likely to drop that demand over the next two weeks of negotiations to make sure the U.S. can join the deal.""I think at end of the day everyone knows that for the U.S. to be part of this, it can't have the emissions target itself legally embedded in the treaty,"" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Earlier in the day, the president met with leaders of small island nations who fear their countries will be swallowed up by rising seas. Obama, who was born in Hawaii, said he understood the beauty and fragility of island life and called their populations ""among the most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change.""African leaders also stressed the need to do something about the Lake Chad region, where the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has been carrying out bloody attacks. The lake, surrounded by Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, has shrunk as much as 90 percent since 1960, changing the lives of farmers, fishermen and herders. Some say the increasing desperation is driving people into the extremists' ranks.The talks, which run through Dec. 11, are aimed at a broader, tougher replacement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. That treaty required only rich countries to cut their emissions, while this time the goal is for everyone to pitch in.After protesters clashed with police earlier this week, Paris police on Tuesday extended a ban on public demonstrations around the climate conference until it is over.One of the smartest ways to fight global warming is putting a price on carbon dioxide pollution, such as a tax on carbon dioxide emissions or putting a price on carbon and trading carbon pollution according to leaders at the climate summit.\l"

The NY Times posited that it will save the world. Is this true? How would researchers test for its causal effects? In this blog post, I will sketch some performance metrics.<nl/>In previous posts, I have pessimistically argued that the free riding problem[1] is here to stay and that this treaty will not achieve its lofty goals. I would like to be wrong about this but I believe that global greenhouse gas emissions will just keep rising and may even accelerate as India and Africa grow. A young political scientists should conduct the following research project; for each nation what promises did it make at the conference and now does it quickly implement its promises? If ""no"", why is the clock ticking? Which domestic interest groups are blocking the righteous new regulations? Or have other priorities emerged? If the government does enact the regulation, would the government have enacted this same regulation in the absence of the COP 21? Did the spur any new carbon abatement activity? If the government enacts the regulation, what benchmarks will be used to judge whether it is effective? A before/after comparison in the nation's per-capita carbon emissions isn't sufficient because this doesn't allow one to infer the counter-factual. Since we don't have twins for nations, how do observe what the nation's carbon performance would have been in the absence of the COP 21 induced new regulatory rules? An optimist might counter; ""Matt, you are not looking in the right places for progress here. The right metric is to examine the acceleration of the pace and diffusion of green technology."" Okay, so in this case; researchers who study patent data can look at patenting in green tech and R...nvestments by country by year. Will they accelerate because of the COP21? In this age of Big Data, what are the right metrics for judging whether this conference was a ""game changer""? At the end of the day, will the COP 21 achieve a game change by shifting expectations and signalling to the world that the ""green economy"" is coming and this field of dreams creates a self fulfilling prophesy? Or, did progressives need a week of feeling strong and hopeful before returning to the real world challenge of a world in which billions of people need energy services to live their version of the American Dream and the suburbanized United States is unwilling to vote for pricing carbon because our lifestyle would become more costly to continue?<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2015/12/no-more-free-riders-lessons-from-paris.htmlhttp://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2015/12/no-more-free-riders-lessons-from-paris.html \l"

Special recognition from Bill Clinton and the Turner family on how IDEAS is equipped to lead the charge.<nl/>Orlando, FL -- (ReleaseWire[1]) -- 12/16/2015 -- After one of the most difficult deliberations and agreements in United Nations history, the twenty one year saga of debates on climate change have finally come to a close in Paris, France with the establishment of a universal document outlining a goal to hold the World to - stop global climate change by keeping temperatures below 2C and strive to reach 1.5C. <nl/><nl/>Some have called the historic COP21 Agreement, and its goal of curtailing emissions ""an achievement bigger than the industrial revolution"" or ""the final nail in the coffin of the Fossil Fuel Era"", while others have called it ""empty promises with no plan of action"".<nl/><nl/>Mixed reactions are to be expected considering the document was a true process of compromise, that on paper at least, culminated with an unprecedented consensus of over 195 nations that climate change is happening and that it is human caused. Previous sessions over the last twenty one years since the Rio Convention created the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), have had little success grappling with such issues of how the developed World would be able to help the developing World fight and pay for climate change resilience and mitigation. Yet, with the strike of a gavel on December 12th, 2015, the Paris Climate Agreements became history. <nl/><nl/>The COP21 Agreement is a giant step in the right direction on a long road to solving climate change. Environmental, social and economic development will fail if citizens, businesses, and particularly NGOs do not play a significant role in driving human ingenuity, developing action, and holding their leaders responsible with measurable results. <nl/><nl/>This need for action harks back to Former President Bill Clinton's 2013 Commencement Speech at the University of Central Florida where he said ""No matter how smart we are, how righteous we are, how close to the truth we are, we all do better when we work together, when we share prosperity, when we share responsibilities, when we share membership in the community... Look at IDEAS -- they had no money, they didn't know what was going to happen  now The White House recognizes them as change agents and today that group is called IDEAS For Us."" <nl/><nl/>The former 42nd President of the United States inadvertently spoke to the role of youth have to play in this process by referring to the successes of the UN Accredited NGO, IDEAS For Us. This global organization with a presence in over 20 countries seeks to develop, fund, and measure solutions to the World's most pressing environmental and social problems. IDEAS For Us has a long history of working hand in hand with the United Nations, White House, U.S. State Department, and various other institutions to advance sustainability goals worldwide. They've also joined the Sustainable Energy For All practitioners network and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) to share cross-cutting sustainable solutions that can replicate to communities around the World.<nl/><nl/>Millennials have a considerable role to play in this sustainable transition, particularly because they represent the largest generation in human history. <nl/><nl/>John Rutherford Seydel, the grandson of Ted Turner and youth environmental advocate says ""The COP21 agreements creates the mechanism, the architecture, and the responsibility for developed and developing countries alike to continually tackle this problem in an effective way. But let us not forget that the problem is not solved because of this agreement, better yet the solution has just begun. With the help of organizations like IDEAS For Us, we will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change by mobilizing our youth, and communities to pave the way for even more progress, in successive stages, over the coming years."" <nl/><nl/>Earlier in 2015, IDEAS For Us was invited by the United Nations to work hand in hand to aid in developing the sustainable development goals being reviewed at COP 21. Recently, in August 2015, Chris Castro, President of IDEAS For Us, presented at the United Nations for over 2 hours on the importance of NGO lead action. He stated, ""These agreements will hold no weight without local action and accountability. The Paris Climate Agreement marks the beginning of a long journey ahead to improve the lives and wellbeing of everyone, end the fossil fuel era, and empower local governments, academia, civil society, NGO's, community groups, and the private sector to accelerate local solutions to these challenges.""<nl/><nl/>Despite the need for action, making lasting change at the community level - let alone the global level - is difficult. Funding stands at the largest barrier for projects, considering it is always in short supply and usually lacks the oversight to ensure a project's development, measurement, and success. As a result, IDEAS For Us is in the midst of a capital campaign, raising funding to develop more ideas into solutions, measure the results, and then scale those solutions across their Network. IDEAS For Us recently funded five international projects in the 4th quarter of 2015 as cool as Ugandan aquaculture in Lake Victoria, reforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and sustainability education in Liberia. <nl/><nl/>About IDEAS For Us<nl/>IDEAS For Us aims to ride the momentum COP21 has created, the right timing for large scale action on climate change is now. The hope is that with community, business, and governmental support, IDEAS For Us will be able to develop more ideas into solutions, measure the results, and then scale for capacity and impact across their grassroots, youthful network.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA132","RESILIENCE IN FOCUS AT COP21","December 3, 2015 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by International Strategy for Disaster Reduction:Delegates at the COP21 global climate summit have thrown the spotlight on resilience, a central issue in international efforts to reduce the risk of disasters and face up to growing environmental challenges.Resilience is a key word in this COP 21, Ms. Sgolne Royal, Frances Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy told a special conference session.Resilience was invented by psychologists and was defined as an individual's ability to properly adapt to stress and adversity. Stress and adversity can come from family or relationship problems, health problems, or workplace and financial worries, among others and it is no wonder why we use it now for climate change, as millions of people suffer every year from the negative impacts of floods, storms and cyclones, she said.This is the first time that such human dimension is integrated in an international climate conference and it is our moral responsibility to find the solutions to stop the suffering of millions of people who are affected by climate change, she added.The theme of resilience is at the core of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), launched in 2014 the previous climate change conference in Peru with the aim of strengthening climate action beyond COP21.A daylong resilience event on Wednesday brought together a host of high-level participants from a range of fields, including governments, the UN, researchers, the private sector and civil society to present solutions and announce individual and cooperative commitments to tackle climate change impacts.A report issued last week by UNISDR and the Belgian-based Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), The Human Cost of Weather Related Disasters, shows that over the last twenty years, 90% of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 recorded floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other weather-related events.The report also demonstrated that since the COP1 climate summit in 1995, 606,000 lives have been lost and 4.1 billion people have been injured, left homeless or in need of emergency assistance as a result of weather-related disasters.Current trends indicate that extreme weather is increasing in frequency and intensity as the climate changes, increasing the pressure on people around the world.COP21 caps a year of international meetings with an interlocking sustainability agenda.The first was in March, yielding the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, a 15-year agreement that seeks to curb the impact of natural and man-made hazards and thereby reduce disaster-related deaths, the number of people affected, and economic damage. After an international agreement on development financing in July, governments in September adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, which have the same timel"

Sciences Po is the world-famous political science university based in the heart of Paris.The event will bring together inspiring Millennials with a robust roster of top corporate leaders and sustainability experts like the Danone Ecosystem/Social Innovation Fund and B-Lab. Together, they will explore how the Millennial generation can lead the response to climate change. MSLGROUP units Salterbaxter MSLGROUP and Publicis Consultants MSLGROUP have been part of a global collaboration for the event.As Millennials face this climate crisis, according to MSLGROUP's recent reportA Chance for Change: The Tipping Point for Sustainable Business,\~their reactions range from fear, frustration and a sense of powerlessness to one of personal responsibility and hope. In response, Millennials want to see more collaboration between business and government to address climate change.#MakeItWorkA unique film has been made about the negotiations and will be screened at the Chance for Change event. Sponsored by MSLGROUP, this film is the culmination of the Make it Work worldwide initiative. The COP21: Make it Work project, led by Sciences Po, brought together 200 students from around the world in May to take part in a public simulation of the COP process. The simulation led to five key recommendations on the negotiation which have been presented to the COP21 officials in order that the process might have a better chance of success.The project was inspired by the fact that for 20 years, international climate negotiations have stalled on action to address the urgency of climate change stemming from a complexity of intersecting issues and the institutionalization of a certain format of the negotiations over the years.The film is directed by David Bornstein and produced by Les Films de l'Air.Event InformationOrganizations interested in sending Millennial or other delegates to the event can reach out HYPERLINK mailto:tojbayly@salterbaxter.comtotojbayly@salterbaxter.comtoTo view the event live on December\~5\~or on replay on the Internet, click HYPERLINK http://blog.mslgroup.com/chance-for-change/http://blog.mslgroup.com/chance-for-change/.To be kept abreast of event details, follow@msl_groupon Twitter.For information about MSLGROUP's approach around global Millennials, business citizenship, the agency partnership with Sciences Po and the support of theCOP21\~: Make It Work!film, please HYPERLINK mailto:contactpascal.beucler@mslgroup.comcontactpascal.beucler@mslgroup.comAbout MSLGROUPMSLGROUP is Publicis Groupe's strategic communications and engagement group, advisors in all aspects of communication strategy: from consumer PR to financial communications, from public affairs to reputation management and from crisis communications to experiential marketing and events.

Developed by Air Liquide R&D teams, this breakthrough innovation enables to reduce the environmental impact of the glass melting process.Energy efficiency and emission reduction are critical for the glass industry which needs a significant amount of energy to achieve the extremely high temperatures necessary for glass melting. Oxy-combustion is based on the enrichment of air with pure oxygen. It is widely used for the glass and metal industries to improve the combustion process, reduce air pollutant emissions and save fuel.The Heat Oxy-Combustion technology is an innovative technology that makes oxy-combustion even more efficient. It is based on the following principle: extract heat from the combustion fumes and use it to heat oxygen and fuel hence maximizing the oxy-combustion performance by 10%. Compared to air combustion, this technology provides up to 50% energy savings and up to 50% CO2 emission reduction.So far, this technology has been implemented in several glass factories in Europe, owned by major glass players. It is of particular interest to the Chinese market which represents about 50% of the worldwide glass production.To develop this unique patented technology, Air Liquide's R&D teams have designed safe and reliable equipment, fully integrated with glass melting furnaces. The Group has substantial R&D resources and strong experience in glass making thanks to its extensive network of field experts and dedicated testing platforms in France, the United States and China. For more than 20 years, they have been mastering oxy-combustion technologies including patented burners and furnace heat modeling.Fran\'e7ois Darchis, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee supervising Innovation and the Industrial Merchant Business Line, commented:""We are honored to receive this prize which demonstrates the unique expertise of Air Liquide in the field of oxy-combustion and its capacity to provide innovative technologies to address the industry's environmental challenges.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA143","United Nations Draft Climate Agreement Illustrates Futility of COP21 Conference","Somewhat Reasonable","Newstex Blogs","Dec 07, 2015( Somewhat Reasonable: HYPERLINK / Delivered by Newstex) The main boulevard between buildings at COP-21 in Paris.[This is the third in a series of reports from the United Nations COP21 climate conference filed in Paris by Heartland Institute senior fellow for environment policy James Taylor.] PARIS - Halfway through the United Nations COP21 climate conference in Paris, the UN on Friday released a 'draft agreement' that illustrates the futility and irrelevance of the UN conference. The draft agreement is merely confirmation that the developing nations which emit the majority of global carbon dioxide emissions refuse to cut emissions and want massive wealth transfers from developed nations, while leaders of developed nations realize they are powerless to meet the extortionist demands of developing nations. The reason the UN released merely a draft agreement rather than a final agreement is because there has been no agreement on any of the most important issues under discussion. Developing nations insist on (1) ever-increasing amounts of monetary payments from developed nations, (2) steep reductions in emissions from developed nations, (3) international authority to enforce the developed nations' monetary payments and steep emissions cuts, and (4) no requirement for developing nations to reduce their own emissions. Even climate activist politicians such as U.S. President Barack Obama realize their citizens will never tolerate or approve such one-sided restrictions and obligations. With such a wide gulf between the demands of developing nations and the capacity of developed nations policymakers to cave in to such demands, the just-released draft agreement is merely political window dressing for leaders of all nations - developing and developed alike - to save face and tell the citizens of their nations they have struck an agreement. Canadian Green Party leader Elizabeth May explained the divide in a Friday Associated Press story[1], observing the draft agreement is 'just a package of things on which people don't yet agree.' Wealthy developing nation China emits more carbon dioxide than any other nation in the world[2], and twice as many emissions as the nation with the second-most emissions, the United States. Wealthy developing nation India ranks third in carbon dioxide emissions. Cumulatively, the Western-style democracies targeted by the developing nations - the United States, the European Union, Canada, and Japan - emit less than one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. Developing nations have made it clear they will not soften any of their demands. Accordingly, any meaningful final deal requires the United States and other Western democracies to burden their citizens with monumental wealth transfers, severe energy restrictions, and the surrender of national sovereignty to international enforcement bodies. Even climate alarmists like U.S. president Barack Obama realize they cannot obtain domestic authority to commit their nations to such demands. As a result, the chances of a meaningful climate agreement emerging from Paris are dim. What is dim news for UN climate conference participants is bright news for billions of people around the world. The best and latest scientific evidence[3] indicates humans are not creating a climate crisis. The lack of substantial new restrictions on affordable energy will allow economies to prosper and people to keep more of their earnings to spend on better nutrition, housing, education, health care, and consumer goods that allow people to live longer, more productive, and more enjoyable lives. The United Nations COP21 climate conference may be doomed to failure, but that failure is a victory for the people of the world.

According to 350, there were 175 countries in participation and 2,300 marches taking place to influence leaders at COP21.While 350 is a global movement, Angelenos had their own demands for the Eric Garcetti and Jerry Brown administrations, including a decreased dependency on natural gas, and an increase in renewable energy alternatives and water conservation in the midst of California's drought.Gov. Jerry Brown is currently in Paris at COP21 alongside 190 world leaders advocating for climate change action and presenting California as a prime example of gas emission reduction. According to the California Environmental Protection Agency, emissions have dropped 7 percent since 2004.""As far as policy is concerned, I'm not very happy about what they have been doing,"" said Iris Lovelace, environmental activist and Signal Hill resident. ""They say they're doing one thing but then you see someone like Garcetti who went from 20 percent to 40 percent natural gas demand. Instead of decreasing, he wants to increase it and that's his version of changing to clean energy.""Locally, Lovelace is also part of various organizations such as Stop Fracking Long Beach to raise awareness about the environmental impacts of fracking on their communities and push for legislation. ""If you know Signal Hill, you know there are oil wells all over the place,"" Lovelace said. ""Stop Fracking Long Beach is doing a good job trying to bring it to the attention of the community and we're having lobby meetings with city council members to educate them because its like they've never heard of fracking until we walk in the door.""Before the march, leaders from organizations such as California Against Fracking and SoCal 350 coalition took the stage to rally Angelinos to join the cause against fossil fuels and advocate for renewable energy.COP21 conference will continue until Dec. 11 as leaders attempt to reach an agreement to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius.\l"

What are the actions and goals?The COP 21 is the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" on climate change. Organised by the UN. This year, the event is bringing together 196 signatories in Paris, from 195 countries and the European Union. The ultimate aim is to limit global temperature increase by 2100 to 2\'b0C compared to 1900. This objective can only be achieved by establishing common rules to all countries \- quantified greenhouse gas reduction commitments with funding mechanisms to help developing countries to enter the energy transition.For SUEZ, the fight against climate disruption is a top priority. It is the very essence of our work. In 2008, the Group had already set itself targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and to preserve water resources. Today, SUEZ continues to develop initiatives as a non-State actor. For instance the group set up the Business Alliance For Water, which brings together 25 companies to discuss the water issue, a topic judged to be as important as carbon. Today, SUEZ is making 12 new commitments for climate. These commitments aim to: \~\~\~ continue the efforts to reduce the Group\' s carbon footprint; \~\~\~ promote the circular economy model that structurally reduces greenhouse gas emissions and protects natural resources; \~\~\~ adapt to the consequences of global warming on water.SUEZ has chosen to be present at a partnership-based stand \- the Vivapolis stand, which unites 11 exhibitors involved in sustainable cities development. Bringing together companies such as Dassault Systems, Vinci and HSBC, as well as young innovative companies, the space is built around a shared vision: everyone must act for the climate. Through interactive workshops, SUEZ will introduce you to its solutions to promote a more circular economy and a sustainable resource management.

The question of financing the fight against the consequences of climate change, is also crucial. Mr. Pasztor, who recently participated in meetings on this issue, on the margins of the World Bank/IMF annual meeting in Lima, says there have been ""interesting developments"" in this field.Last year, $62 billion of the $100 billion committed to yearly in financing to adapt to climate change was secured. ""These are not only promises, but the concrete mobilization of finance"", he said. Multinational development banks have announced that they will double or even triple their contributions. ""I am confident that at the end of the year we will have more than $ 62 billion. This is a strong signal for developing countries, and not least, small-island developing states and makes a big difference,"" he noted.The private sector is also engaged and has contributed one third of the financing. Since the Summit on Business and Climate in Paris last spring, ""there has been a real change towards a low carbon economy. Not only have companies that were present at the Summit committed themselves concretely, but since then others are on board, as well.""Mr. Pasztor welcomed the success of green bonds, which are a new financing instrument.

What an Advent Season it has been!On Monday, November 30, the day after the first Sunday in Advent, 150 presidents and prime ministers assembled in Paris to launch the Conference of the Parties, 21st Session (COP21). By December 6, the second Sunday of Advent, negotiators from 190 countries had narrowed the language for a climate change agreement. Then, on the night of December 12, hours before the third Sunday of Advent, the Paris Agreement was gaveled into approval by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. Around the world, people of faith knew that we humans had taken a major step in caring for Gods creation. People from disparate nations, with different languages and cultures, shaped an historic agreement intended to slow the onrush of human-caused climate change, assist developing nations in adapting to impacts, and accelerate the transition to low carbon economies.Now, in the final days of Advent, in a time of expectation, it is appropriate to ask what next? How will the spirit of the Paris Agreement find ways of being lived out in the life of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)?Might we as individuals and children of God find new ways to live more lightly on the Earth? Will we examine our patterns of consumption, our frequency and manner of transportation particularly transportation requiring the burning of fossil fuels?-Might the content and the publicity around COP21 create new energy within our Earth Care Congregations? Might the aspirations of the agreement inspire members elsewhere for their own congregation to become an Earth Care congregation?-Will the agreement make us more sensitive to the issues of eco-justice, particularly climate justice of the poor, for women, for indigenous peoples?-Will the powerful presence of youth and young adults in Paris serve as an inspiration for more engagement by Presbyterian youth and young adults in creation care?-As individuals or congregations or the denomination, will we be more bold in engaging elected officials on issues of the environment? Will we tell our members of Congress to support the Green Climate Fund, the mechanism in the Paris Agreement to assist developing countries to adapt to climate change impacts.-Will we find new ways to join hands with other people of faith in protecting Creation?-And, how will the spirit of the Paris Agreement guide the discernment and actions on the environment at the 222nd General Assembly in Portland, Oregon (June 18-25)?The Paris Agreement represents a milestone in decades of work by government officials, scientists, people of faith, and environmental activists.

Rather, it is a question of how.<nl/> 'Never before have we seen this level of engagement from business and it is clear that the momentum is unstoppable. The private sector should also be applauded for inserting good business practices into the COP21 process and by sending the message that a solid climate agreement was indeed needed and wanted.<nl/> 'As referenced in the Paris Agreement, the private sector has an important role to play and we believe that responsible business can help to fill the gap between what has been committed by Governments though the INDCs and what is needed to reach a carbon neutral economy by mid-century.<nl/> 'At the UN Global Compact, we have built the largest coalition of businesses that are taking action on climate. Since 2007, our Caring for Climate initiative with UNEP and UNFCCC has brought more than 450 companies together to advance the power of sustainable business.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA156","Global Climate Action at COP-21","EPA Connect","Newstex Blogs","Dec 08, 2015( EPA Connect: HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/epaconnecthttp://blog.epa.gov/epaconnectCOP-21.COP-21, I spoke about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) role in this international effort, and how EPA is delivering on President Obama's climate agenda. Over the past 7 years, The U.S. has taken a series of ambitious actions to cut the carbon pollution driving climate change, and demonstrate that the U.S. is fulfilling our responsibility to act. All told, the steps we've taken under President Obama's leadership will help the United States reach our national goal of cutting carbon pollution 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Whether it's the Department of Agriculture's 'Climate Smart Agriculture' initiative to cut carbon pollution by over 120 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2025, or the several dozen utility-scale renewable energy projects that the Department of Interior has permitted on public lands, or NASA's cutting-edge scientific efforts to monitor Earth-system changes. The list goes on and on. A centerpiece of U.S. efforts is EPA's Clean Power Plan, our historic rule to cut carbon pollution from the power sector, the largest source in the U.S. economy. Our plan puts the United States on track to slash carbon pollution 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. And the cuts to smog and soot that come along with these reductions will lead to major health benefits for kids and families. And EPA is taking a host of additional steps to push our progress even further. We're doubling the distance our nation's cars go on a gallon of gas by 2025. We've taken four separate actions to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. We're acting on climate-damaging Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), domestically, internationally, and through voluntary programs with industry. We set standards for medium-and heavy-duty vehicles and are now going even further with a proposal that will reduce 1 billion tons of emissions. I'm confident these actions will stand the test of time. Why? Because EPA has a 45-year legacy of finding lasting solutions to difficult environmental problems. In that time, we've cut air pollution by 70 percent while our nation's economy has tripled.In the U.S., we're already seeing clean-energy innovations being rewarded. Today, the U.S. uses 3 times more wind power, and 20 times more solar than when President Obama first took office. Jobs in the solar industry are growing faster than in any other sector of our economy good-paying jobs that grow opportunity in the communities that need it most. Our actions under President Obama's leadership build on that trajectory. And we've seen time and again the American people are ready to act on climate now. We heard from millions of people on our initial proposal for the Clean Power Plan. We heard from states, utility companies, environmental organizations, and communities across our country. What we heard is that people want to stop talking and start doing. In poll after poll, a majority of Americans say they want climate action. That's how we know our actions will endure. But we also know that no country can solve this challenge alone. That's why I'm so encouraged by the ambitious commitments we're seeing from nations around the world. Heading into the COP-21, 180 countries, representing more than 90 percent of greenhouse gas emissions already submitted national plans to reduce their emissions. That's big. Here in Paris, our collective efforts are finally aligning. Now is our time. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, it's time to come together and do what's necessary to protect our common home.

Brown Jr. will welcome the United Nations top climate change official, Christiana Figueres, to Los Angeles tomorrow. They will join leading climate scientists to discuss the impacts of a changing climate and the need for swift, decisive action at every level.When: Tomorrow, Monday, June 15, 2015. At the conclusion of the meeting, a news conference will be held at approximately 10:30 a.m. Reporters who have RSVP'd must check in at 10:00 a.m. at the North entrance.NOTE: This event is open to credentialed media only. Reporters interested in attending must RSVP to Andrew Santana at HYPERLINK mailto:andrew.santana@gov.ca.govandrew.santana@gov.ca.govChristiana Figueres has been involved in climate change negotiations for two decades and was appointed Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2010 and reappointed for a second three-year term in July 2013.The United NationsClimate Change ConferenceCOP21, will be held from November 30 to December 11, 2015 in Paris, France and is one of the largest climate conferences ever organized. The aim of the conference is to reach, for the first time, a universal, legally binding agreement that will enable the world to combat climate change effectively and boost the transition towards resilient, low-carbon societies and economies.While many national governments have failed to act on climate change, Governor Brown is seeking to further collaboration amongst states and provinces at the subnational level ahead of the conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Last month the Governor convened international leaders from 11 other states and provinces, collectively representing more than $4.5 trillion in GDP and 100 million people, to sign a first-of-its-kind agreement to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius the warming threshold at which scientists say there will likely be catastrophic climate disruptions.This builds on other international climate change pacts between California and leaders from Mexico,China, North America, Japan, Israel and Peru and the Governors efforts to help forge and highlight scientific consensus around climate change.Earlier this year, Governor Brown issued an executive order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 the most ambitious target in North America and announced in his inaugural address new 15 year targets to: increase from one-third to 50 percent our electricity derived from renewable sources; reduce petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent; and double the efficiency savings from existing buildings.Next month, Governor Brown will join other international leaders, including former U.S. Vice President and Nobel laureate Al Gore and former president of Mexico Felipe Caldern, to deliver keynote remarks at the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada.###\l"
"COP21","USA","COP21_USA160","COP21 -- A health, technology, energy, transportation agreement","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the following news release: Conference of Parties (COP) 21COP21 will be held at Le Bourget from 30th November to 11th December 2015. At the time of the conference, Le Bourget shall be known as the blue-zone area in Paris for UN delegates and public bodies' attendees. The Sustainable Innovation Forum 2015 in partnership with UNEP, will convene more than 500 attendees at an expanded two day session (7th to 8th of December), to further increase the facilitation of partnerships and to bring greater scale to business innovation on climate change. Pre-Paris meet During the Responsible Business Forum in Singapore (RBF Singapore; Marina Bay Sands & Gardens by the Bay) earlier this month from the 3rd to 4th Nov. 2015, international delegates of which 80% of the companies were global corporations attended the event. Mr Tony Boatman, Director of Innovation at Global Initiatives, mentioned a few take home-messages at RBF Singapore, 'The biggest emitters have signed up to cut down their emissions by 2030. We recognize the complexity, and we are not comparing apples to apples. Countries that are responsible for two-thirds of carbon emission have signed up for COP21, with the aim of 40-percent reduction to 1999 emissions-level.' 'What we do know that the commitments will be made in Paris will not be enough, it will not be enough to cap the emissions at 2 degrees,' said Boatman. COP21 will not be enough and there are a lot more to be done. Outside governmental corporations should be taken into consideration in the protocol for the reduction in emissions. To save Planet Earth before it is too late The COP21 universal agreement will include actions for sustainability in businesses, supply chains, logistics, agricultures and global consumer networks. The opportunities for sustainable and responsible finance to be shared for business behaviors to go beyond short-term financial gain in ventures and investments framework. Most importantly, for public and private companies to recognize business opportunities to go green and sustainable. There shall be an increase use of biofuels in commercial and private transports, e.g. aircrafts, road vehicles, etc. This further illustrates the need for further advancement in biofuels research development. At RBF Singapore opening plenary address, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's Ministry for Foreign Affairs said, 'This is not a natural disaster it is a deliberate man-made disaster, it is vandalism on nature.' And an encouraging news at RBF Singapore is that the blueprint for Singapore to be sustainable is already available. 'If you truly believe in democracy that we breathe the same air, drink the same water, eat the same food, then you need to believe in sustainability in the long-term.' Dr. Balakrishnan will be attending COP21 in December 2015. Products have to be made from sustainable materials in order to be placed on the shelves for purchase, and transparency must be valid in the supply chain and product distributions. These are some of the practical considerations for long-term survival. Dr. Balakrishnan emphasized that one of the duties for Singaporeans is to prepare and build up resilience against the deleterious consequences of climate change. Public awareness on climate change and sustainability can be raised by giving incentives to individuals who makes an effort to transform the country to a better place and a green-er nation. 'Sustainability efforts cannot be unilateral,' as mentioned by Dr. Balakrishnan at RBF Singapore 2015. Who should cut the 'Cake'? Brought forward by industrial revolution, developed nations enjoy access to advanced technology, better accessibilities to remote regions in their respective cities and towns, better food packages that are bound to the regulations of Good Manufacturing Practices, etc. However, it is not practical and maybe ridiculous, to ask big emitters to slash carbon emissions and greenhouse gases to absolute zero while developing countries are still removing trees in the forest. In June 2015 at The Hertie School of Governance in Berlin Germany, Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC secretariat shared her perspectives on the upcoming COP21 and the World's response to climate change. 'Developing countries that were left behind during the industrial revolution, and now to be left behind the energy revolution? That would be unfair.' Figueres recognizes the challenges in developing countries, and it is a huge challenge for developing countries to continue their economic growth without greenhouse emissions. 'No country has done it before, and we are asking developing countries to do the same when they have other development urgencies on their agenda.' Rather than to place an expectation on the pace for developing countries to lower carbon emissions and greenhouse gases, and to balance the ecosystem, countries can choose which pace may suit them better in conjunction to their economic growth; GDP. 'Every country is going to contribute, different ways and paces but every country has to contribute.' Figueres placed a metaphoric illustration on climate change and sustainability policies; countries are as of similar to cars driving along the motorway and in accordance to their preferred paces they shall take the respective lanes. The pace may differ, but ultimately they are heading towards the same direction and to the same destination; to make the world a better place to live in where clean drinking water is available and the ecosystem is balanced. What's the difference between COP21 and other COPs or other Climate Change protocols; e.g. Kyoto protocol? COP21 is a legally binding agreement for all countries. 'It is not for self-interest, rather it is for climate change, for a positive agenda,' said Figueres. And it is time for policy to be guided by science. 'At COP21, there will be a gap between what we are doing and what we should be doing.' Figueres then further emphasized that the gap between doing and should be doing will be drawn closer in progression of time. COP21 is a facilitated system and, to encourage countries and people to do more to save the environment before it is way too late. The agreement will include the evaluation of the engagement on climate change and sustainability issues for each country. There shall be no backsliding with each step has to be more ambitious, and ultimately to reach the common goal; to lower carbon emissions and to reduce global warming. It is to prevent the repeat of history, e.g. COP15 and Kyoto Protocol. But not all provisions are equally binding in the same ways. Some provisions are international, for instance, obligations for carbon planning. Carbon managements shall be under domestic legislations because trajectories of carbon are likely to differ from country to country, and may be estimated using different methodology and recorded using different documentations. 'We are able to do more together than by an individual alone,' said Figueres. Moving towards zero emissions in transport and logistics There were mixed reviews on the possibilities to achieve zero emissions in transport and logistics. At the panel session RBF Singapore 2015, most delegates agreed there is a possibility to achieve zero emissions. Delegates include: Stephan Schablinski (Director for Sustainable Supply Chain Solutions, DHL); moderator of the panel session, Sophie Punte (Executive Director, Smart Freight Centre), Rachid Yazami (Professor for School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technology University), Justin Gadbois (Head of Sustainability, Maersk), Mark Cameron (Regional Director, South Malaysia & Singapore, Scania), and Oliver Risse (Managing Partner, OneNorth Ventures, Floatility) Most of the panelists agreed it is possible to reduce emissions to zero, and if not, perhaps 90% reduction in emissions. Sophie Punte thinks that though there may be many good inventions such as 3-D printing to solve some existing problems, there is still a lack of efficiency to transport one product from a place of origin to another. For instance, the transport of freshly pressed orange juice from Florida to the Philippines. 'We need to take steps to move towards zero emissions,' said Mark Cameron. 'What we are seeing today is the exciting steps being taken, continued in the field of biofuels, battery technology, the heart of organization of vehicles, and all of these are taking one step towards zero emissions in Europe.' 'It is possible to achieve zero emissions because we have no choice,' said Prof. Rachid Yazami the inventor of lithium battery and who is currently a professor at NTU in Singapore. However, Yazami highlighted that there are some hurdles to achieve the goal, and he gave the use of electric cars in mega cities as an example. The challenges according to Prof. Yazami: the costings of electric cars in comparison to regular-diesel or petrol cars; on whether it is convenient and practical to drive an electric car in mega cities; the mileage that an electric car can cover with the batteries installed; fire hazard safety; materials have to be recycled and environmental friendly; Oliver Risse is totally convinced that zero emission is possible, 'It is just the matter of time.' Risse also suggests that solutions are all in the mind, and it is not just about having new devices or technology. The solutions are within or should start from consumers' purchasing behaviours, e.g. in Europe, there are strong connections from the residents to buy daily products from their local or regional markets. When there is no plan B Is going to stunt developing countries' growth? Who is going to have the hardest time? 'It will be the developing countries that will have the hardest time. We are asking developing countries to continue their growth without greenhouse emissions. A huge challenge for developing countries, as no country has set an example before.' A quote by Figueres which is stated in the earlier text of this article. Developed countries will have to provide the necessary aids to developing countries to prevent further disruptions on biodiversity, ecosystem and on climate. COP21 universal agreement may be a demanding request on developing countries. However, Figueres addressed the concern that the purpose of the agreement for developing countries is to protect the growth that the countries have had, and to spur further growth.

'There's no plan B, because we have no plan B. It is difficult, but there's no other option,' said Figueres. 'Devil is in the detail, but there's a lot work to be done.

The first COP took place in Berlin in 1995 and significant meetings since then have included COP3 where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, COP11 where the Montreal Action Plan was produced, COP15 in Copenhagen where an agreement to success Kyoto Protocol was unfortunately not realised and COP17 in Durban where the Green Climate Fund was created. Immediate action, and already taking place, for an agreement to lower CO2 emissions, better carbon management plans and coalition China's air pollution costs around 5 to 10% of their GDP. According to some estimates, the removal of air pollution in China adds on 5% GDP COP21 agreement has to look into long-term plans: GDP and CO2 emissions CO2 emission has increased and ecology balance was lost during the industrial revolution, and it has to be restored, COP21 meet will not be enough for the reduction in global warming by 2&deg;C and 5% reduction in greenhouse gases In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\l"

Foreign Affairs[1] Gun Violence[2] Climate Change[3]Foreign AffairsThis week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee began its work for the second session of the 114th Congress. I attended a markup of three bills and look forward to working with my colleagues to craft meaningful legislation.Costa Rican Ambassador, Roman Macaya, visited my office to continue discussing relationships in the Western Hemisphere. He provided me with information on recent developments in the ongoing efforts to help Cuban migrants stranded in Central America.I joined with various colleagues and sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to sanction Iran for recent violations of international law. In October and November 2015, Iran test fired medium-range ballistic missiles, destabilizing the already delicate relationships in the region. Furthermore, during military exercises, a rocket fired by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of Iran's Armed Forces, came within 1,500 feet of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman. These actions, preceding the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), pose a threat to our national security and demand a U.S. response.Gun ViolenceIn the last decade, over 100,000 people have been killed in the United States as a result of gun violence. This week, President Obama introduced executive actions to combat this continued gun violence in our nation. These actions will facilitate the reporting of mental illnesses into the background check system and expand the use of background checks by those who sell guns in stores, on the Internet, or at gun shows. They will also make the background check system more effective, increase mental health treatment across the nation, and will support new research into gun safety measures. While I support the Second Amendment, I am frustrated that both the House and the Senate failed to consider gun safety measures thus far this Congress. It is our responsibility to pass long-term reforms that are aimed at reducing gun violence, which is why I have cosponsored key measures that will help to accomplish this goal and keep Americans safe. To read more about my stance on gun violence, visit my Gun Violence Prevention Page[4].Climate ChangeOn December 12th, the 2015 Climate Change Conference (COP21) came to a close in Paris, France with an agreement among the 195 nations that participated. The Paris Agreement is a pact to reduce global carbon emissions, with a goal of zero net emissions, by the second half of the century. Participants also agreed to work to keep global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius. The COP21 also resulted in the private sector joining with the public sector to capitalize on newly funded research into clean energy and improve reliable, affordable, non-carbon producing energy through technological innovations. This marks a global readiness to invest in climate change research and the development of alternative energy sources that will help combat climate change. I am encouraged by the results of COP21 and look forward to working with my colleagues to facilitate the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

These pledges cover 86% of global emissions. We have seen major commitments from the U.S., the E.U., China, and other major developing nations. We have also seen incredible support from the private sector. Many companies, including dozens of Fortune 500 companies, have made commitments through the American Business Act on Climate Pledge. Many businesses recognize that acting on climate change is not only the morally right thing to do, but the economically right thing, too. An agreement in Paris would be an incredible first step that could be built upon with even more ambitious goals in the coming years. Because the bottom l"

COP21, with its profuse sweat under bright lights and sleepless nights, resulted in an agreement praised by mainstream media all across the world but universally panned by climate change advocacy groups. Still, at the end of the day COP21 may not make much difference. After all, renewable energy is not waiting for COP21 to nudge people to go green. Renewables have already, for some time now, been on a tear, bustling ahead as if COP21 never counts. Some of the world's foremost climate scientists and climate change experts such as Dr. James Hansen labeled COP21 £ fraud' with 'no action, just promises.' Others with similar credentials claim 'the deal is certain to result in 3\\x8CC by 2050, or sooner.' Thereby, missing, by a wide margin, the COP21 goal of keeping temperatures under 2\\x8CC. Meanwhile, silently but assuredly, renewable energy is literally on fire all across the planet, sans COP21. The year 2013 is more likely the 'watershed year for tackling climate change' because of renewables rather than because of COP21 in 2015. Renewable installations crossed over those of fossil fuels for the first time ever in 2013, as the world added 143 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity versus 141 gigawatts of fossil fuel electricity generation. Renewables have never looked back. In the United States, for example, approximately 22,700 megawatts of solar powers 4.6 million homes and 66,000 megawatts of wind energy 18 million homes. When blended, U.S. renewables provide 90,000 megawatts for nearly 23 million households. Therefore, if solar and wind renewables continue to grow at the 2013 rate, renewables alone will cover the planet's roughly 1.5 billion households within roughly 40 years, meeting the criteria set at COP21 of greenhouse emissions neutrality in the second half of the century with or without COP21. But, with psychologically pushing ahead renewable growth, accelerating the build-out, it is probable that renewables will vastly exceed any goals of COP21 well before 2050. Thus, in the real world, renewables offset COP21's toothless agreement. As, for example, language dealing with mitigation or cutting greenhouse gases is extremely vague in the agreement with phrases like 'efforts to be made to hold temperatures to 1.5 C.' What does that mean in the real world? And, what efforts? Or, as for another example, Article 4 of the COP21 agreement addresses timel"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA179","Expert available to discuss Paris climate talks with reporters","December 5, 2015 Saturday","US Official News","Lawrence: The University of Kansas has issued the following news release: The 2015 United Nations , known as COP21, currently is meeting in Paris until Dec. 11. According to Shannon O\' Lear, professor of geography, atmospheric science & environmental studies, and Ryan Chilcoat, student with the KU Environmental Studies Program, the goal is to produce a legally binding agreement among more than 190 countries to keep global temperatures from exceeding 2 Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.  COP21 is distinguished from previous conferences by taking a bottom-up approach, allowing countries to submit individual pledges, said Chilcoat.  Before the Paris climate talks began, more than 150 countries offered national plans towards reducing greenhouse emissions or ramping up renewable energy use. O\' Lear, who researches environmental geopolitics, critical geopolitics, linkages between climate science and  slow violence, and academic and military perspectives on environmental security, said the talks suggest a strong degree of political will to address the increasingly dire situation of a changing climate.  Topics of concern at the Paris climate talks will include threats to coastal areas  with a significant portion of major urban centers around the world in close proximity to an ocean  flows of people leaving their homes and home states when they become uninhabitable due to flooding, drought or degraded capacity to support human well-being, options for shifting away from fossil-fuel based energy and consumption patterns, possible security connotations of hydrometeorological disasters and threats to military, urban, energy, and food infrastructures and systems, and justice issues pertaining to the uneven distribution of risk caused by the degradation of our life support system, she said. According to the KU researcher, the Paris talks\' success can be measured by how effectively it addresses key issues.  To what extent are new investments being promoted as opposed to established government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry? O\' Lear asked.  If nuclear energy is going to be promoted, how much support might be garnered for liquid fluoride thorium reactors, which are far less hazardous than uranium technology? To what degree are scientific solutions such as geoengineering  which is mostly understood through computer simulations  promoted as being more \' certain\' than motivating necessary political and social changes? To what degree are methane emissions, which are 80 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, included in national plans and calculations for reducing the warming capacity of the atmosphere? O\' Lear said COP21 provides some reasons for optimism  there is now a greater moral imperative, more public outcry, and more political will than ever before.  However, the conference is not a solution, she said.  With such a large and diverse group of interests and concerns, the Paris climate talks cannot realistically resolve the issue of climate change, but with attention and financial backing focused less on business-as-usual and more on innovative approaches to these challenges, it may yet be a sign of progress.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA180","Ocean Conservancy Statement: COP21 an Opportunity to Turn the Tide on Ocean Acidification","November 30, 2015 Monday 2:46 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Ocean Conservancy issued the following statement:To ensure world leaders have access to the best available information at this year's Conference of Parties in Paris, more than 20 international marine scientists worked together to synthesize the best available research on our changing ocean.Their paper, published in July in Science magazine, considers two potential scenarios: serious emissions cuts, and business as usual. They concluded that we need to immediately reduce CO2 emissions in order to prevent massive changes to the ocean. The longer we wait to act, the more difficult and costly it will be manage ocean acidification.Following is a quote from Sarah Cooley, PhD, Ocean Conservancy's Science Outreach Manager, and co-author of the Science paper.""The ocean provides food, oxygen, and jobs for people around the world. It also helps to regulate our climate. Studies show that the ocean has absorbed half of all the carbon emitted since the Industrial Revolution. But it is reaching a saturation point. Seawater along our shores is becoming increasingly acidic, making it hard for some marine animals to build their shells. That impacts everything from whales to seabirds to shellfish farmers.Here in the United States, we are seeing leaders from states on both coasts and the federal government stepping up to meet this challenge. New monitoring programs and efforts to cut emissions will slow the progress of ocean acidification and help the most vulnerable communities prepare. But local action is not enough - to truly address acidification, we need global action. We are pleased to see so many nations committing to emissions reductions ahead of COP21, and hope to see the momentum continue as world leaders gather in Paris.""Background:Monitoring and managing ocean acidification is an area that has bridged partisan divides. From the Pacific Northwest to Florida, Maine to Maryland, states on both U.S. coasts are working to tackle ocean acidification, and help impacted rural, coastal businesses and communities adapt in the face of a changing ocean. The U.S. is not alone in working to address the problem. Over one hundred nations have submitted plans to reduce carbon emissions ahead of the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP 21) meeting.Ocean acidification occurs when carbon absorbed from the atmosphere changes ocean chemistry, creating more corrosive waters that make it difficult for corals, plankton and shellfish to build their shells. Scientists warn that the ocean is at a tipping point--immediate action is needed to prevent massive and mostly irreversible changes to the food web that will ripple all the way up to coastal communities and businesses. That is why the eyes of the world will be on COP21.Our vision is a healthy ocean that sustains life on our planet. We envision a world where we all work together to keep the ocean and our coastal communities healthy and prosperous.Contact: Julia Roberson, 202/351-0476, HYPERLINK mailto:jroberson@oceanconservancy.orgjroberson@oceanconservancy.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesAutoTriage10PkS 151201 30FurigayJane-5369522 30FurigayJane\l"

SPECIAL SERIES Paris Climate Talks provides in-depth coverage of the 21st U.N. summit to forge a new global agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Visit the special report. The social media website yesterday afternoon unveiled the new icons, which are activated by hashtags, to mark the beginning of the two-week-long Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 21, in the French capital. The summit aims to hash out a global deal to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels. The emojis -- which feature an Eiffel Tower overlaid on a green leaf, a green Eiffel Tower and a heart-shaped Earth icon -- will appear when users tweet using the hashtags #COP21, #GoCOP21, #ActionDay and #ClimateChange. The #COP21 hashtag has nearly 380,000 tweets. According to the United Nations, 192,000 of those tweets occurred today, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the ""most influential participant."" Calif. Gov. Brown, Tom Steyer lead business delegation to Paris California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and billionaire Tom Steyer will head to Paris next week and will take a massive business delegation along with them. The group includes Calpine CEO Thad Hill, Kaiser Permanente Chairman Bernard Tyson, NRG Energy CEO David Crane, PG&E Corp. Chairman Anthony Earley and other health care, energy and financial services industry officials. ""We welcome California businesses as key allies in our efforts to halt dangerous climate change,"" Brown said in a statement. Some nations defy U.N., won't submit targets While 183 nations have now submitted climate targets to the United Nations, a handful are still lagging behind -- and some remain defiantly opposed to doing so. In an interview yesterday with Climate Home, Nicaraguan lead envoy Paul Oquist said his country has no intention of offering an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) for slashing emissions. Venezuela, which like Nicaragua is a member of the Bolivarian Alliance, or ALBA, also has not submitted an INDC. Asked earlier this year by ClimateWire when Venezuela would put forward its targets, Venezuelan envoy Claudia Salerno said, ""In our own nationally determined time."" The move is a dig at the United States, in particular, which has championed the burgeoning system. Speaking today to reporters, Liz Gallagher, a climate analyst with London-based think tank E3G, said she expects to see some drama this week from ALBA countries. ""The ALBA countries have always played a slightly disruptive game at the negotiations,"" she said. ""I suspect we'll see a few surprises. We know that some of them haven't or won't put down an INDC, which is obviously a great shame."" Coal plans could stymie warming target If all the planned coal-fired power plants around the world are built, attempts to limit warming to 2 C will fail, according to a new analysis presented today during the climate talks in Paris. Construction of the 2,440 planned coal plants by 2030 would boost greenhouse gas emissions four times above the 2-degree target, researchers from Climate Action Tracker said, according to a report from BBC News. The research looks at planned and existing coal-fired power plants in eight countries, including India, China and Indonesia, as well as the European Union. U.S. will struggle to hit renewable targets -- analysis Coal plants aren't the only things that could hinder efforts to halt climate change. According to a new analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, some nations or blocs face an uphill battle in their efforts to achieve renewable energy growth targets that they submitted ahead of the summit. The analysis found Australia, Brazil, Japan and the European Union are well-positioned to reach their targets. Others, like the United States and India, will struggle to meet their targets, according to the analysis reported by Bloomberg. France drops billions on renewable projects in Africa France will spend billions of euros on environmental and renewable energy projects in its former African colonies over the next five years, President Fran\'e7ois Hollande said today. Hollande said the French government would double current investments in renewable energy generation -- wind farms, solar power and hydroelectric dams -- across Africa to \€ 2 billion ($2.12 billion) by 2020, according to Reuters. One project will plant pockets of trees to revive soil in West Africa. Another will aim to protect Lake Chad from pollution.\l"

According to the Fossil Free Stanford press release, if Stanford's Board of Trustees does not divest from fossil fuels before COP-21 in December, the signatories of the pledge ""will take nonviolent direct action in order to demonstrate the urgency with which Stanford must divest if it is to make a maximal impact.""Fossil Free Stanford, which began working on the University's divestment from coal three years ago, presented their case to ""divest the rest"" in front of the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford Board of Trustees on Monday, Oct. 5. \~In the written text of the letter read aloud to the SCIR, Fossil Free Stanford recognizes the contributions that the University has made overall to fighting climate change - including faculty research and investment into a new energy generation strategy - but argues that more must be done.""[Stanford's] actions regularly do change the world,"" the letter reads. ""Following Stanford's coal divestment announcement, a wave of divestments cited Stanford's logic and action...

""We unequivocally support an agreement coming out of Paris that takes a strong step toward a low-carbon future. We are cutting our own carbon emissions and taking additional measures to tackle climate change.""The full text of Avery Dennison's pledge reads as follows:We applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for climate action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters and the health of the global environment. We put forth our pledges as follows:Building on a 2009 pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, indexed to net sales, by 15% from 2005 to 2015, Avery Dennison pledges to:  Reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by at least 3% annually, and by at least 26% overall, between 2015 and 2025.Eliminate deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities by 2020, in alignment with the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests.  Purchase 100% of our paper from certified sources by 2025.Purchase at least 70% of our paper from FSC-certified sources by 2025.Develop long-term business plans that align with the deep decarbonization necessary to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2\'b0C.Scarborough will speak in Paris next week as part of the Sustainable Innovation Forum, which will run concurrently with the COP21 climate talks. Avery Dennison supports an agreement that will cut emissions enough to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change.Scarborough said his company supports strong and immediate efforts to curb emissions for reasons both ethical and commercial.""Climate change is an imminent global threat that demands urgent action from all segments of society-including business- while we still have time to act,"" he said. ""It poses risks to people, communities, ecosystems and, obviously, our business. Responding to climate change by reducing emissions is, above all, a moral imperative. It's consistent with our company's ethics and guiding principles.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA190","New York: Panelists review Paris climate summit at Ithaca event","February 8, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Albany: Cornell University, The State of New York has issued the following news release: Six panelists, including Cornell faculty members, who attended the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris last fall recalled the historic proceedings for a spirited audience that spilled into the hallway of the Tompkins County Public Library\' s BorgWarner Room Feb. 3. The panel,  COP21: Reflections on the Historic Climate Agreement, was co-sponsored by Cornell\' s Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, local government agencies and community groups. Todd Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering, moderated the discussion. Topics discussed ranged from methane emissions to agriculture to civil disobedience, but panelists agreed that the COP21 made history by producing a 195-nation commitment to combat climate change that, while not nearly strong enough, they said, was a remarkable achievement nonetheless. \' It cannot be a bridge fuel\' Panelist Robert Howarth, Cornell\' s David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology, attended methane, anti-fracking and ocean meetings at COP21. He said 195 nations agreed to keep Earth\' s temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius but noted that the Earth is on target to warm 1.5 degrees Celsius in about 12 years. Howarth said the United States and other nations need to focus more on methane, a shorter-lived, more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  No matter what we do for carbon dioxide over the coming years and decades, the planet will continue to warm by 1.5 degrees [Celsius] in 12 years and by 2 degrees [Celsius] in 35 years, unless we cut methane emission, said Howarth, who said we need to reduce methane within the next three years. The natural gas industry is the largest source of methane emissions in the U.S. by far, and shale-gas development (fracking) has at least doubled these gas-industry methane emissions.  This completely undercuts the idea that natural gas is a bridge fuel, Howarth said.  It cannot be a bridge fuel if we\' re to meet the COP21 targets. &hellip; We\' ve got to get rid of natural gas. Parsing the language Picking up on the talks, Karen Pinkus, professor of Italian and comparative literature, observed how language was used in Paris. Pinkus observed meetings where negotiators parsed syllables, comma placements and precise terminology. As an example, she said an African coalition argued for the treaty to mention electricity rights. Negotiators had excised the term -  electricity rights - from the final COP21 document, which made no mention of agriculture or food security, critical issues for developing nations. Pinkus also observed that climate change discussions have all but disappeared from U.S. media since the December convention.  This is something to be very cautious about, because if there is any momentum to come out of Paris &hellip; we can\' t really afford to brush it aside, she said. \' This time it was different\' Johannes Lehmann, professor of soil and crop sciences, said COP21  was an awesome assembly of people, and a quite frustrating beast as well. Lehmann had attended previous climate meetings but said,  This time it was different. The meeting\' s youth movement encouraged Lehmann.  It was teeming with young people, and they were excited about it, he said.  To nurture this new generation of climate scientists, activists and concerned citizens is really important. Laying the foundation Allison Chatrchyan, director of the Cornell Institute for Climate Change and Agriculture, set up an exhibit in Paris to showcase the university\' s research and work on climate change, and she organized a panel on climate change and global food security and nutrition issues. While some people believe the COP21 treaty did not go far enough, she said she agrees with climate scientist Christopher Field, of the Carnegie Institution\' s Department of Global Ecology, who said the Paris agreement is going to save the world.  We didn\' t solve the problem, but we laid the foundation, Chatrchyan said, noting the conference provided a more flexible approach to get agreement among all countries of the world:  But it is up to us - in our own countries and communities - to make sure that we\' re living up to our commitments. \' We\' re out of time\' Sandra Steingraber, distinguished scholar in residence in environmental studies and science at Ithaca College, spoke about business looking for strong signals from political leaders to signal that investment dollars will flow into a new green economy.  So for the treaty itself, I think it\' s a pretty sound document, it has good bones, the science is sound and there are pledges in place from almost every nation, Steingraber said.  I see this as a great race. I agree with [climate author] Bill McKibben, who said, \' It\' s a great treaty - for 1995.\' But the problem is what\' s missing is what we can\' t add anymore, which is time. We\' re out of time. So all of this remarkable transformation has to happen rapidly. \' Appeal to the better angels\' Colleen Boland \' 01, founding member of advocacy group We Are Seneca Lake, said she and others gathered outside the official summit to  appeal to the better angels of those who are inside negotiating on behalf of the citizenry of the entire planet.

This year, business leaders from every industry are here advocating for an ambitious Paris Agreement. Even as COP21 has gathered an unprecedented number of heads of state, it's fair to say it has also gathered an unprecedented number of heads of business. These leaders are already experiencing the effects of climate change on their companies, and they are here to share their commitments and let governments know that they plan to partner with policymakers in implementing the final Paris Agreement.<nl/> 'At Kellogg, we have seen firsthand how extreme weather can impact the people who grow and supply our ingredients,' Kellogg Company Chairman and CEO John Bryant wrote in a guest editorial[2] for the We Mean Business Bottom Line. At a New York Times dinner Tuesday night, Bryant announced[3] that, by 2050, Kellogg would cut its emissions by 65 percent and help reduce those of its suppliers by 50 percent.<nl/> At the same event, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry who announced yesterday that the United States will provide US$800 million in climate aid to the world's poorest countries (subscription required)[4] noted the importance of the business community. 'We are not going to solve this at government level,' Kerry said to an audience of largely businesspeople. 'You are going to make the difference.'<nl/> One of the reasons we are so optimistic about an ambitious climate agreement this year[5] is because of the strong role of business, which has come to Paris with a set of clear, concrete policy asks designed to maximize ambition, secure a diplomatic agreement, and send the signal that will catalyze private-sector investments in a thriving, clean economy.<nl/> As we enter the last few days of negotiations, the BSR climate delegation at COP21 is working hard on three main priorities of business for the final agreement: a long-term goal that sends the policy certainty that business needs, a review mechanism starting in 2020 to ensure that goals are increased every five years to give business the confidence to invest, and a strong financial element that leverages the trillions needed.<nl/> We urge business leaders to send this message to their government officials in their national capitals. Together, we can support a successful Paris Agreement.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/> Business is asking the French Presidency for its continued leadership of COP21. In particular, business would like the French officials to\~stay strong in seeking an ambitious climate agreement,\~which will send a catalytic signal to the real economy. Business also urges the French COP21 leadership to fulfill its promise to\~'leave nothing behind' including the\~long-term goal\~and the\~five-year ambition mechanism, starting from 2020 onward.<nl/> As the French COP21 Presidency pushes for ambition, business urges all to be 'willing to do so.' For business, this means offering ambition through climate commitments, innovation, and the mobilization of private-sector finance. And for other governments this means being willing to find common ground on the remaining crux issues the long-term goal, the five-year review mechanism starting from 2020 onward, and climate finance.<nl/> To ensure an effective outcome in Paris, we all need to do three things. We must\~secure\~ambition that is consistent with the scale of the climate challenge.\~We must\~secure consensus\~among the 196 governments negotiating an agreement. And we must secure an agreement that sends\~a catalytic signal to accelerate the creation of a thriving, clean economy.\~We cannot sacrifice the integrity of one of these in pursuit of the others.<nl/> BSR's Climate Insights<nl/>Why Paris Is Not Another Copenhagen: Read more[6] Let's Support the COP21 French Presidency and a Strong Paris Agreement: Read more[7] Midsession COP21 Report: What Happened in Week 1, Expectations for Week 2, and How Business Can Act: Read more[8] Business Asks Climate Negotiators for Specific Text in Paris Agreement to Ensure Ambition: Read more[9] For Ambitious Climate Action Before 2020, Business Should Focus on 'Workstream 2': Read more[10]<nl/>What We're Reading<nl/> Read the latest from We Mean Business:<nl/>Accelerating Transition to Clean Power: Read more[11] Business Leaders Ask for Clear, Long-Term Emissions Goal to be Included in Paris Climate Deal: Read more[12] Chennai Refocuses Paris; Businesses Ready to Invest in Low-Carbon Economy: Read more[13]<nl/>And highlights from the latest COP21 media coverage:<nl/>A New Draft of the Paris Climate Agreement, and What Remains |\~The New York Times | December 9, 2015:\~Read more[14] Kerry Promises $800M in Climate Aid for World's Poorest | Greenwire | December 9, 2015: Read more[15] (subscription required) Business Leaders Commit to Energy Goals at Climate Conference | The New York Times | December 8, 2015: Read more[16] U.S. Republicans Pushed by CEOs in Paris to Shift Climate Stance | Bloomberg | December 8, 2015: Read more[17] COP21 Spotlights Climate Change and Agriculture | General Mills | December 9, 2015: Read more[18]<nl/>Events<nl/>December 16, 8-9 a.m. PST: 'Road Through Paris Briefing: First Results from COP' webinar Join this webinar to hear from BSR's COP21 delegation on initial takeaways from Paris, including insights on the diplomatic agreement, what the agreement means for business, what kind of commitments business and investor commitments were announced at COP21, and the media coverage and narrative during the climate talks.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA196","Delta21@COP21; Delta Promotes Cross-Strait Cooperation on Sustainable Cities and Green Buildings to Reduce Carbon Emissions","December 10, 2015 Thursday 9:05 AM EST","PR Newswire","As the end of the UN Conference on Climate Change (COP21) nears, experts and scholars in the energy, architecture and meteorology fields from both sides of the Taiwan Strait attend the Delta21 Forum organized by Delta Electronics on December 10 at the Grand Palais. They discussed the enormous potential of green buildings in regards to energy conservation and lower carbon emissions from the policy support, energy-efficient technology and architectural design perspective. Over the past 10 years, Delta has worked with partners to construct 21 green buildings, accumulating valuable experience and defining the philosophy of ""Building Harmony with Nature"". The concrete achievements during the COP21 conference period included proposing solutions that will help traditional high energy consumption cities transform into sustainable cities. Delta also hopes to utilize COP21's international influence to remind organizations around the world to focus upon the potential value of conserving energy via green buildings as we all work together to create a smart green life.During the forum, Mr. Bruce Cheng, Delta's founder and honorary chairman, shared his experience on cost-effective designs for natural ventilation and lighting that can effectively conserve energy, optimize comfort and realize the concept of ""Building Harmony with Nature"". He pointed out that a UN report indicates the potential to reduce the carbon emissions of buildings reaches up to 90%. Since 2005, Delta's factories, offices and donated buildings around the world adopt green building practices, with a current total of 21 green buildings. Delta has also sponsored the ""Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition"" for ten consecutive years and has promoted the implementation of winning designs from this initiative. Delta hopes that these international contestants will accumulate knowledge and skills related to green buildings and become future urban planners and architects capable of ultimately benefiting a growing number of people with higher energy conservation and healthier living and working conditions.Mr. Ding-huan Shi, president of the China Renewable Energy Society (CRES), the organizing entity of the ""Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition"", and the director of the China National Engineering Research Center for Human Settlements, Mr. Ji-shou Zhong, also participated at the forum. Ding-huan Shi emphasized that in the past ten years, the Delta Cup competition has gradually become a multifaceted platform to lead the development of China's green building and energy industries, implement winning designs, nurture innovative talent and spread the low-carbon concept. Delta utilized a first-prize winning proposal to construct the ""Delta Sunshine Elementary School at Yangjia Town"" and the ""Delta Sunshine Junior High School in Longmen Township"" in disaster areas affected by the earthquakes in Sichuan. ""The 24 Corridors Under the Riyue Mountain"", a project recognized and supported by the Qinghai Government, also combines multiple award-winning proposals into a showcase construction project to house farmers. Mr. Zhong highlighted that industries, governments and academia across the Taiwan Strait must work closely in order to facilitate more progressive ideas that enhance innovation in green building technologies.The architect who designed the first net-zero energy campus in Taiwan, the Namasia Ming Chuan Elementary School, Mr. Ying Chao Guo, and the architect who designed the world's largest festive lantern, Delta's Ring of Celestial Bliss, Mr. Jih Pan, also shared their design expertise. Ying Chao Guo stated that, ""We are rebuilding not just the past, but the future."" In addition to serving an educational function, the reconstructed school also follows the ""Building Harmony with Nature"" philosophy while respecting the indigenous culture. The structure serves multiple complementary functions. According to Jih Pan, architecture is an external factor at any time and place, which is why architects must take special care to maintain a harmonious relationship ""between nature and humans"". He hopes that, ""Architects will remain committed to the respect for nature and humanity so that buildings can contribute towards turning the dream of sustainability into a reality.""The goal of COP21While introducing Delta's experience in lowering the electricity intensity of its worldwide factories by 50% from 2010-2014, the chairman of Delta Electronics, Mr. Yancey Hai, provided the example of the renovation of its 16-year-old Taipei headquarters with smart green building solutions. The building received a diamond-level EEWH certification (existing buildings) from Taiwan. This building achieved energy savings of up to 58% through the use of Delta's HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) automation, power regeneration units for elevators, LED lighting, renewable energy solutions and energy management software. Not only has this green building set the record for the most significant carbon emissions reduction among Taiwanese office buildings, it has also brought significant reductions in electricity costs. Mr. Hai stressed the business potential of smart green buildings. As a global leading provider of power and thermal management solutions, Delta is dedicated to facilitating the creation of sustainable cities to counter the impact of buildings on the environment.As the week-long ""Solutions COP21"" exhibition ends today, this forum is the conclusion of the company's Delta 21 Green Buildings Exhibition, that proposes the concept of ""Building Harmony with Nature"". Delta's exhibition utilized immersive projections and interactive designs to showcase the 21 green structures Delta has constructed over the past 10 years, including Delta's own operation facilities in Taiwan, mainland China, India, and the US, as well as the 12 green buildings donated in Taiwan and mainland China. The exhibition organizer stated that Delta has actively exercised its responsibility as a global corporate citizen, working with all organizations to promote energy conservation and lower carbon emissions. Delta has committed to contribute in the global effort to slow down global warming within 2 degree celcius\~through solutions that are also economically valid.For updated event information, please visit the website of Delta21: HYPERLINK http://www.deltaww.com/cop21http://www.deltaww.com/ HYPERLINK cop21About DeltaDelta, founded in 1971, is a global leader in power and thermal management solutions and is a world-class provider in several product segments.

The Green Infrastructure Investment Coalition aims to address the investment challenge of building green infrastructure as it cannot be met with public sector funds and bank finance alone. A key task for the Coalition will be to look for ways to bridge risk gaps to ensure investment profiles can meet the needs of institutional investors.Apart from FICCI, around 11 other organisations from across the world have confirmed their participation in the Green Infrastructure Investment Coalition, including: the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), Legal & General Investment Management, AB (global investment-manager with USD464 billion under management); Pax World Management; The Regions20 Coalition; The European Investment Bank; IDBI; India's Export Import Bank; the National Institute of Public Finance & Policy; Deutsche Bank; and Investor Group on Climate Change.

Dirt and dust cover (soiling, in industry speak) on solar panels are a significant challenge and can decrease energy output by up to 40%. Existing solutions - oftentimes labourers with water and brushes - can damage panels, use huge amounts of water and be cost-inefficient. Ecoppia provides a solution in the form of autonomous, waterless robots that are managed through the cloud and clean panels every night after production stops.""It's the next step for the solar industry,"" says Eran Meller, CEO of Ecoppia. ""We're seeing significant value creation in all the projects we're currently involved in, both here in the Middle East and in India. For many of the big industry players, a solution that can clean panels nightly, can respond instantly to weather and is waterless - we feel solutions like ours have the potential to become the industry standard.""The site is among the largest solar parks in the Middle East and is located in Southern Israel's Arava Valley - next to the Jordanian border and 20 and 60 miles from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The cleaning technology is so promising that Meller has been asked by Israel to attend COP21 as part of a special delegation of green technology companies from Israel.""It's very exciting to see the progress Ecoppia is making in terms of winning large clients - it's because of promising technology like theirs that we believe Israel has a bright future in the International Solar Industry and why Ecoppia was chosen to take part in a side event on ""Israeli Innovation in response to climate change"". This special event which the Government of Israel has organized together with Israel Green Energy Association, is part of the COP21,""\~said Ron Adam, the permanent representative of Israel to IRENA (The International Renewable Energy Agency).About EcoppiaEcoppia is dedicated to maximizing solar park value creation by increasing output and lowering production overhead.

CLIMATE CONFERENCE AS ""COURT CASE"" FOR THE CONTINENT","September 10, 2015 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","As the clock ticks towards the United Nations () in Paris in December, African experts, policy-makers and civil society groups plan to come to the negotiation table prepared for a legal approach to avoid mistakes made during formulation of the Kyoto Protocol.The Kyoto Protocol\~is an international\~treaty which extends the 1992\~U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change\~(UNFCCC) that commits countries to reduce\~greenhouse gas\~emissions, based on the premise that global warming\~exists and that man-made\~CO2 emissions\~have caused it.""The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a legal instrument, and therefore we need legal experts to argue the case for Africa, using available evidence instead of having only scientists and politicians at the negotiation table,"" according to Dr Oliver C. Ruppel, a professor of law at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa.""It is a court case for Africa, and Africa must argue it out, and not keep looking for scientific evidence,"" Ruppel told an Africa Climate Talks (ACT!) forum on 'Democratising Global Climate Change Governance and Building an African Consensus toward COP 21 and Beyond' last week in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.The forum, which was organised by the Climate for Development in Africa (ClimDev-Africa) Programme, was part of the preparatory process for Africa's contribution to COP 21 in Paris.Africa has always based its climate argument on geopolitics and science. However, in Paris, experts say that Africa will have to include a good number of lawyers who will table existing evidence of what climate change has caused, what Africans have done about it, and what they can do given appropriate financial and technological support.""We must stop complaining and look at how much we have done ourselves with and without support, look at our success stories and build a case of what Africa can do instead of shouting for resources,"" said John Salehe of the Africa Wildlife Foundation. ""We need to show evidence of what we can do, then approach the negotiations positively,"" added Ruppel.Dr Mohammed Gharib Bilal, Vice-President of Tanzania, observed that Africa has suffered under the Kyoto Protocol because there were unforeseen gaps. ""Since we are negotiating a new agreement, nobody in Africa will benefit if we make the same mistakes that were made in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations,"" he told the forum.According to experts, the Kyoto Protocol was formulated in a way that was designed to address mitigation of climate change, rather than adaptation to its impacts.""The agreement also failed to recognise some countries which have since emerged as major greenhouse gas emitters, a fact that has complicated implementation of the agreement's mechanisms,"" observed Mithika Mwenda, executive secretary of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA).He also noted that the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the protocol was based on markets, and therefore failed completely to address climate change in countries with negligible emissions. Such gaps must be sealed in Paris and a new agreement reached or else the world's sustainable development path will be jeopardised, warned Bilal.Nevertheless, the Tanzanian Vice-President recognised that sometimes Africa expects too much from the developed countries. ""We need to change and change has to start from within,"" he said."" The vision has to be crafted from within and we have to go to Paris to champion a narrative and cause that is consistent with our own development aspirations.""So far, in response to changing climatic conditions, African countries have proactively put in place climate change policies with tools geared towards mitigating and adapting to their impacts. Some have invested heavily in clean energy, some have adopted climate-smart farming techniques, and others have invested in tree growing.""Africa has lots of capacities but they differ,"" said John Kioli, chairman of the Kenya Climate Change Working Group. ""We need to take stock of what we have, and negotiate for enhancement of what we do not have.""ACT! seeks to crystallise a conceptual framework umbrella for Africa's role in the global governance of climate change, and to position climate change as both a constraint on Africa's development potential as well as an opportunity for structural transformation of African economies.The objective is to mobilise the engagement of Africans from all spheres of life in the run-up to the Paris negotiations, increase public awareness of climate change and the roles people can play in the global governance of climate change, and elicit critical reflection on the UNFCCC process among Africans.Edited by Phil Harris\~\~\~\l"

A recent study published by Lanzhou University in China[1] indicates that climate change will lead to ever-expanding drylands area. If global emissions continue to rise, the study estimated that dryland areas will cover 56% of the world's land surface by 2100.<nl/> A key challenge in this scenario will be adaptation, and therefore the success stories coming out of the deserts of the Indian state of Rajasthan are that much more important. The Thar desert[2] cover 60% of the area of the state (it spills over also into the Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan) and the state faces water scarcity for 9 to 11 months in a year and frequent droughts (1 in 2.5 years). It is in this bleak landscape that women farmers are adopting new farming methods that have helped them deal with the impacts of climate change in the drylands and move out of poverty.<nl/><nl/>Play Video[3]<nl/> These efforts are part of the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems, where work is underway in three states of India (Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) to empower farmers and local institutions to build resilient and sustainable farming systems that cope with the vagaries of current and future climate. Women leaders like Mani Devi and Rameshwari [4]from the Derasar village in Rajasthan have pioneered the use of innovations such as the use of improved crop varieties - including pearl millet and other crops suited to the region, the planting of fruit trees to provide nutrition and income, constructing embankments to capture rainfall and prevent runoff and soil erosion, and the planting of grasses and fodder trees to provide fodder for cattle.<nl/><nl/>Play Video[5]<nl/> The planting of new crops is not enough though. The success of the programme hinges on the new institutional arrangements that have been implemented to enable communities to better manage common property resources such as common grazing lands. They have also formed women's self-help groups to weigh and market livestock for higher income. To make this happen, these women farmers worked with a local community organisation, the Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti[6] (the village development knowledge committee) and received scientific expertise from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics[7] (ICRISAT). Funding was provided by the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems[8].<nl/> 'The strategy takes women's needs into account by working directly with them. Women are empowered to take charge of their lives and reduce the vulnerability of the communities living in these harsh environments.' says Dr Shalander Kumar, Scientist, ICRISAT.<nl/> The programme shows that while success is possible, it requires a great deal of coordination and numerous organisations working at all levels. As the talks commence at Paris for COP21, the world will be watching whether global leaders are able to put together a framework that makes such cooperation easier as the climate change increasingly impacts the world.<nl/> The author is a media officer with global organization - ICRISAT.

Since January, Mr. Pasztor's work has focused on supporting efforts towards a new climate agreement and mobilizing global climate action on the ground.Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change.UN News Centre: What is the importance of the upcoming 21st United Nations ?Janos Pazstor: There are at least two major points. First of all, if we have a good agreement it will allow us to move towards a low-carbon, low-emission future, where there are lots of opportunities for new technology developments and new ways of organizing ourselves. That is an opportunity we must take. Secondly, climate change is already happening. The impacts are already visible. If we take action now, we can address climate change as we move toward a low-emission economy and build a sustainable future. The more we delay, the more we will pay.UN News Centre: Why do we need to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius?Janos Pazstor: If we allow warming to go beyond that, scientists tell us there are likely to be potential irreversible impacts on people, on natural ecosystems, and therefore, on the economies of the world. Now the 2 degrees is not a very hard level. Many are saying that it actually has to be much less than 2 degrees for the small island developing countries whose land might become completely inundating with a sea level rise. Already 2 degrees is way too much. So, it must be remembered that when we talk of 2 degrees, it is the maximum. It must be kept as much as possible below that.10 Things You Need to Know About COP21. Credit: United NationsUN News Centre: What is the best outcome possible from COP21?Janos Pazstor: We are expecting a package of outcomes and it will have four elements they're interrelated but they're different.The first one will be the national plans for climate change of each country, for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Those are plans that are developed ""bottom up"" by the countries this is what they can do.The third part is climate finance. All of this will require financing, public and private finance, and there will be some parts of this package of finance that will go into the agreement.And the fourth is the action agenda a collection of actions on the ground to do either mitigation or adaption, and it's to demonstrate that it's already possible, it's already happening and to showcase what are the good partnerships between private sector, public sector and civil society to actually do the work on the ground.UN News Centre: What are the main challenges ahead?Janos Pazstor: The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement.

Marwah's work focuses on engaging younger generations in issues such as agriculture and food safety, indigenous people, climate change and intergenerational equity.For Marwah, climate change is more than a changing scientific environment - it's a far-reaching issue that will permeate all aspects of life.""The impact of climate change will extend into issues of political stability, growing poverty, access to clean water, food safety and more,"" she said.From Marwah's perspective, any significant change must come from a local effort. Due to a lack of physical boundaries when it comes to climate change, she believes that any resolution must be dynamic and accessible across cultures and communities.Marwah's journey at COP began when she was still an undergraduate student working toward attaining both a bachelor of science in health promotion and disease prevention and master of science in global medicine.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA221","COP21: Did we forget something?","January 20, 2016 Wednesday","The Breeze: James Madison University","subscriber-premium"">In late 2015, a number of the United Nations' most prominent environmental and government leaders came together for the 21st United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (otherwise known as COP21). This event focused on addressing the problems surrounding climate change through research, studies and discussions.Theprimary goal of COP21 was to keep global warming under an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit).When it comes to talking about global warming and how to best address it, it makes sense to look at the prime offenders. From there, progress can be made to alter negative outcomes. While COP21 put plans in place to tackle some of the major threats to our environment, it failed on at least one important front.On the positive side, the conference addressed the problem of carbon dioxide as well as five other greenhouse gasses. This chief greenhouse gas is produced by human activities. Carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuelscause destruction to the ozone layer and play a major role in trapping heat in our atmosphere. Although it's been the subject of much criticism, we can take encouragement from the fact that the196 participating countries made promises to limit future greenhouse gas emissions. Logical steps for this include curbing reliance on fossil fuels by tightening regulations and investing in research on renewable energy sources.However, with regard to addressing the next most prominent greenhouse gas, COP21 fell very short. Methane is also a major perpetrator of environmental damage. Next to fossil fuel production, animal agriculture is thesecond largest emitter of methane gas. Livestock animals such as cows, sheep and goats have digestive systems that undergo enteric fermentation -the result of this process is the release of copious amounts of methane gas and a significant contribution to climate change.As in the case of carbon dioxide, one would expect to see COP21 address the sources of the problem. Disappointingly, the connection among animal agribusiness, methane and climate change wasmentioned only once at the conference. The lack of discussion about the effects of animal agriculture on our environment is worrisome. If the world's leaders and climate experts won't speak to this problem, who will?In the European Union, approximately 8.3 billion animals are consumed each year for food, while in the U.S.,that number rises to 10 billion animals. This is a startling comparison to the approximate 320 million people in our country. Greenhouse gases aside, producing meat requires massive amounts of our other valuable resources.To generate about two pounds of beef,free-range cattle individually consume at least 265 pounds of forage and 31,700 gallons of water are required. This doesn't even take into account the fossil fuels to maintain the factory farms and machinery to process the animals, excessive amounts of land and forests cleared for growing feed or the vehicle emissions from the transport of these billions of animals to the millions of people all across the U.S.Thankfully, steps can be taken to help improve this. With additional education on both the environmental impact of our consumption and thehealth benefits of a more vegetarian or a reduced-meat diet, we have the ability to contribute to less suffering for so many animals. Last year, as a result of increased education,400 million fewer animals were killed for food. Although the topic of animal agriculture might not have come up enough in Paris, we can make the choice to raise awareness and bring positive environmental change with how we pick our plate every day.Amanda Trenchard is a junior interdisciplinary liberal studies major.

Security concerns following the terrorist attacks in the French capital earlier this month have meant that a planned march through the city by up to 200,000 people has been cancelled. But a number of events will still take place, including the handing over of a one-million-strong petition and an ecumenical service at Notre Dame Cathedral. The Anglican presence will be headed by two primates: Archbishop Thabo Makgoba from the Anglican Church of Southern Africa; and Archbishop Fred Hiltz, Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Canada. Two of the  resident Anglican bishops in Europe - the Church of England\' s David Hamid and the Episcopal Church\' s Pierre Whalon will also be there; as well as the C of E\' s lead bishop for the environment, Bishop of Salisbury Nicholas Holtam; and the Bishop of Dudley, Graham Usher; as well as the Episcopal Church\' s Bishop of California, Marc Andrus.

Speaking at the high level opening, President Yayi Boni of Benin, was resolute that the Africa is not at the negotiating table with a begging bowl.<nl/><nl/>He told the audience at the Africa high level event marking the launch of the Africa Pavilion that 'Africa did not come here () to beg for money or assistance but to bring about commitment of all concerned to Africa's adaptation needs'<nl/><nl/>'The adaptation and mitigation needs of the continent are not aid' President Boni said, but an equity issue because climate change is a global phenomenon not caused by Africa. 'The time to act is now' he said 'the house is burning.'<nl/><nl/>In Africa, climate change constitutes a major threat to the continent's development, and has major implications and impacts on African economies. Climate extremes such as drought, flooding, heat waves and tropical cyclones are intensifying in frequency and intensity. Rising sea levels will threaten Africa's large coastal population with agriculture, tourism, cities, water levels, health, energy and fisheries all likely to be impacted by the adverse impacts of climate change. COP 21 marks a decisive stage in negotiations of the future international agreement on climate change.<nl/><nl/>The high level panel at the official opening constituted the African Heads of State and Government, African Parliamentarians and the principals of the four pan-African institutions namely: the African Union Commission, (AUC); the African Development Bank, (AfDB); the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA); and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).<nl/><nl/>'Africa's message for this Summit is clear: we need a legally binding agreement with a global governance framework, applicable to all parties that balances the issues of adaptation, mitigation, provide adequate finance as well as technology development and transfer. The new Agreement must commit to reduction of greenhouse emissions to achieve well below 2 degree Celsius, ensure the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, social justice, equity and African must speak with one unified voice', African Union Commission Chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urged the high level dignitaries.<nl/><nl/>The Chairperson also noted the fact that Africa's commitment to define African development path for the next 50 years in Agenda 2063: The Africa we Want as a sustainable and low carbon path. 'Through Agenda 2063 we want to ensure not only that we mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also do so in a manner that build African capacities, researches, institutions and most importantly - whether it is in agriculture and agro-processing or in renewable energy - to ensure that these initiatives contribute towards development on the continent, creating the much needed livelihoods and jobs for our young people and women', she emphasized. (The complete speech of the Chairperson is available on HYPERLINK http://www.au.intwww.au.int.<nl/><nl/>Mr. Adesina Akinwumi, President of the African Development Bankstressed that 'COP21 can only be considered successful if it meets the needs of our continent. Africa is the continent suffering the most from the scotching heat from rising temperatures and droughts have become more frequent and with greater intensity than ever before. Africa needs more money for adaptation. The continent has been short changed by climate change. But we must ensure that it is not short changed by climate finance. AfDB will triple its climate finance to $5 billion a year by 2020.'<nl/><nl/>While the CEO of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA), Dr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, commended the collaborative approach of the four institutions for providing leadership in setting up the Africa Pavilion. The institutions should continue to work together in promoting Africa's socio-economic development.<nl/><nl/>He emphasized that 'Africa must continue to advocate for an agreement that reaffirms the obligations of developed country Parties for the provision of climate finance which is additional, predictable and sustainable, with the agreement providing for a continuous assessment of scale of funding needed compared to climate finance available, particularly from public sources, and include a clear burden-sharing process for calculating the contributions to be made by developed country parties'.<nl/><nl/>In Africa, renewable energy systems offer an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate the transition to modern energy services and to increase energy access. This has a ripple effect on job creation, women empowerment and economic development.<nl/><nl/>This was reinforced by Mr. Carlos Lopes, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) who said Africa is well endowed with all forms of renewable energy resources  hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and even marine energy. 'Yet, today we are in a situation where the total installed electricity capacity in Africa is only about 160 gigawatts. By comparison, this is just over half of Japan's installed capacity. If we take out North Africa and South Africa, the installed capacity in the rest of Africa is less than that of South Africa. Given the abundant renewable energy resources of Africa, the energy mix of the continent is still dominated by fossil fuels (gas, coal and oil), with renewables making only 22% of the installed capacity, dominated by hydropower.'<nl/><nl/>During the event, the African Renewable Energy Initiative, a transformative, Africa-owned and Africa-led inclusive effort to accelerate and scale up the harnessing of the continent's huge renewable energy potential was presented by Dr. Khaled Al Fahmy, Minister of Environment of Egypt and President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).<nl/><nl/>Under the mandate of the African Union, and endorsed by the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC), the Initiative is set to achieve at least10 GWof new and additional renewable energy generation capacity by 2020, and mobilize the African potential to generate at least300 GWby 2030.<nl/> \l"

The Breakthrough Energy Coalition[2], announced on the eve of COP21, will funnel investment into the cleantech economy and shares the Element 8 dual mission of accelerating the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable world, while seeking a profit on those investments. The coalition is a $1 billion fund backed by leading philanthropists, entrepreneurs and CEOs of top US and global companies, with the goal of expanding clean energy investment and deployment. It was joined by the announcement of the Mission Innovation initiative[3], in which the U.S. was joined by 17 other countries-including China with a commitment to double government spending on clean energy research in the next five years. Also announced in concert with the event was the partnership between the Compact of Mayors[4], a global coalition of nearly 400 mayors committed to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, and the Covenant of Mayors[5], an initiative of several thousand local governments in the European Union committed to addressing climate change in their territories. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition and increased support from federal and local governments are key steps in addressing climate change and reflect what we've seen in nearly a decade of angel investing in cleantech companies. Perhaps most encouraging in the U.S. was a series of environment and climate-related bills that passed in a bitterly divided Congress in the wake of COP21: the extension of tax credits for the wind and solar industry; the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund supporting conservation efforts; and even a reform of the Toxic Substance Control Act (albeit still in bicameral negotiations to iron out the differences in legislation passed by the two chambers). The tax credit extensions, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance[6], will support the addition of 20 gigawatts of solar power (which is more than every panel ever installed in the U.S.), while the wind credit will help contribute another 19 gigawatts of new generating capacity over five years. 'Combined, the extensions will spur more than $73 billion of investment and supply enough electricity to power 8 million U.S. homes,' wrote Tom Randall of Bloomberg BusinessWeek. The deal reached in Paris, and last Friday's signing, represent major strides in pledged emissions reductions globally. But the responsibility now lies with each and every country, state, and city, along with every company, university, research lab, and individual to act in order to make good on those pledges. Even if all of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (climate reduction targets set by individual nations) were enforced and commitment levels reached, it wouldn't be enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

In his opening speech, EESC President Georges Dassis reminded national leaders who will attend the COP21 conference that Europeans and citizens around the world expect ""a binding, ambitious and universal agreement and also a structured way of involving civil society, which is indispensable for its success."" He called on the negotiators not to lose the contact with ordinary people: ""State leaders must not forget that it is the citizens who will drive the change"".Karl-Heinz Lambertz, Vice-President of the CoR, said: ""We, regions and cities, are often more ambitious than states on climate policy. We know the development opportunities and the weaknesses in our cities and regions. We are now ready to go further on climate action. But we need adequate support. We need a climate governance system that works and that brings into accord all levels of government and an agreement that explicitly refers to local governments.""The two EU bodies have closely aligned their positions on many of the major issues that will be decided by national leaders at the summit, which should culminate in a long-term global agreement on how to prevent runaway climate change.Transition towards a low-carbon economy and society is already happening at grassroots' level with many communities leading the way, in particular thanks to partnerships between sub-national governments and civil society organisations. National governments sometimes fail to recognise and empower bottom-up initiatives, but the success of international climate action will depend on harnessing the ideas, knowledge and energy of businesspeople, consumers, trade unions, NGOs, communities and local and regional authorities.Both the CoR and the EESC are intensifying their efforts to ensure that an agreement in Paris explicitly recognises the role of citizens and of local and regional authorities in tackling climate change, empowering them and giving them more possibilities to translate global climate policy-making into further concrete, meaningful, transformative actions.EESC Press Unit:Silvia AumairE-mail: HYPERLINK mailto:press@eesc.europa.eupress@eesc.europa.euTel: + 32 2 546 8141CoR Press Unit:Andrew GardnerE-mail: HYPERLINK mailto:andrew.gardner@cor.europa.euandrew.gardner@cor.europa.euTel: +32 (0)473 84 39 814Copyright Targeted News Services18EstebanLiz 151121 30FurigayJane-5363694 30FurigayJane\l"

As the government ministers hammer out the final text, business has an important role to play in ensuring the climate talks end with an ambitious Paris Agreement that guarantees a transition to a thriving, clean economy.<nl/> For those in the business community, there are three things you can do right now to influence the negotiations:<nl/>Make it clear to the government officials in your nation's capital that business wants an ambitious Paris Agreement. As a business leader, the most powerful thing you can do is speak to your own government not just at COP, but at your national capital. Sending this message to your own domestic government will contradict the notion that a Paris Agreement will undermine competitiveness. If their own companies are saying a Paris Agreement would boost competitiveness, that provides governments with confidence to make the deal. Let government know that your company plans to implement the Paris Agreement. Governments are more likely to reach an agreement in Paris if they know business will help drive emissions reductions, enhance adaptive capacity, and facilitate equitable access to sustainable development. Make clear how your business plans to mobilize finance through corporate procurement and investments and direct research and development, and by providing access to goods and services consistent with a low-carbon economy. Continue to act on climate. We Mean Business[2] provides a forum for action on issues ranging from deforestation to renewable energy to carbon pricing to short-lived climate pollutants. By taking ambitious actions to address global warming, your company will not only be more competitive and climate-friendly, it will increase your credibility in advocating for an enabling policy framework.<nl/>Read our analysis of week one and priorities for week two in our latest blog[3].<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/>We need developed countries to honor their promises, particularly on climate finance. Words matter, but numbers matter more. In the absence of agreed-upon language on the long-term goal, it's important to pay attention to numbers and dates, like zero emissions well before the end of the century. In order to\~cut greenhouse gas emissions and make the transition to a thriving, clean global economy,\~business needs the clarity of a long-term goal to know where we are going and by when. Business needs governments to\~strengthen\~their\~commitments every five years, starting in 2020.\~This will ensure that governments keep\~pace with private-sector innovation, stimulate increased private-sector ambition, and\~progressively realize the transformation of the global economy.

For business, these impacts include disrupted supply chains, reduced availability of natural resources, damaged infrastructure and utilities, and increased market volatility. Some\~estimate[2]\~that if we continue on our current path of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change will cost as much as US$4 trillion by 2030.<nl/> To survive and grow, business must invest in climate resilience, which was the theme of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda on Wednesday.<nl/> But what does resilience mean to the private sector? For business, the path to climate resilience consists of two important steps:<nl/>Deepen understanding of climate vulnerability: While business leaders traditionally consider climate vulnerability through the lens of risk to operations, facilities, raw materials, or financial loss genuine resilience requires an understanding of how climate vulnerability is connected to the financial, political, legal, cultural, and social landscapes that the business operates within. Enhance adaptive capacity: BSR has identified seven assets physical, natural, governance, technological, knowledge, social, and financial that business leaders can use to strengthen their companies' resilience in the face of climate change, and to enhance the ability of communities to rebound and prosper in a climate-constrained world.<nl/>The innovative power of the private sector is critical for building a resilient business and a resilient world. And now that resilience has entered the conversation at COP21,\~let's use this as our moment to ensure that climate resilience receives the same political parity as mitigation[3]. The Paris Agreement can treat both with the same urgency, for example, by establishing collective mitigation and adaptation goals.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/> While the business and investor community is hopeful that COP21 will deliver a transformative agreement, many are growing anxious over the slow pace of the negotiations and governments' ability to deliver the ambitious agreement the private sector needs to shift to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.<nl/> Only faster progress at COP21 will produce the ambitious, catalytic agreement business needs.

Moreover, Congress must appropriate any funds that the Obama administration has pledged.  The White House\' s overall domestic strategy of making energy more expensive and less abundant to satisfy international constituencies, many of whom compete against the United States, should worry the business community, American workers, and consumers. We will continue our efforts to understand how this deal affects the U.S. jobs and growth.

Plenty of important activity is already happening outside COP. In the private sector, 67 companies are aligning with the UN Global Compact's business leadership criteria on carbon pricing, meaning they are setting an internal carbon price and publicly advocating for carbon pricing. Additionally, almost\~40 countries and more than 20 cities, states, and provinces use carbon-pricing mechanisms or are planning to implement them[4].<nl/> Indeed, Paris is already likely to achieve a great deal.

As the regulator of the sixth largest insurance market in the world and largest in the United States, Jones has been a national and international leader with regard to how insurers address climate risk in their business operations, reserving and underwriting. Jones strongly supports reducing carbon emissions and reliance on carbon based fuels and increasing investment, including insurers' investment, in alternative green energy sources.""I am pleased to join Governor Jerry Brown and other California leaders in the public and private sector at the UN Climate Summit in Paris,"" said Commissioner Jones. ""Governor Brown's leadership on climate change is making a tremendous difference in California and across the world.""Commissioner Jones will participate in a number of prominent meetings in the COP 21 ""Blue Zone,"" where official negotiations among national leaders are being held. Commissioner Jones has been selected as one of 24 world leaders to participate in a private roundtable with high-level participants including asset owners, asset managers and policymakers to discuss carbon related risks, financial regulation and climate safe energy alternatives.The Commissioner will participate in Climate Action Day, an event aimed at showcasing the most emblematic commitments and initiatives of state and non-state actors in the Lima-Paris Action agenda and shedding light on those engaged in climate action. Jones will also join decision-makers from across the globe at the Sustainable Innovation Forum, the largest business-focused climate event held during the annual conference.Commissioner Jones will also have bilateral meetings with insurance regulators from other nations regarding the establishment of an international consortium of insurance regulators sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that will further collaboration between insurance regulators from around the world in addressing climate risk and the insurance sector.The Commissioner's itinerary for COP21:Saturday, December 5, 2015United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Climate Action DayCommissioner Jones will attend this event showcasing the most emblematic commitments and initiatives of state and non-state actors in the Lima-Paris Action agenda and shedding light on those engaged in climate action.At the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP20) to the UNFCCC in December 2014 in Lima, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC and the Presidency of the COP21 were encouraged to convene a high-level event to enhance implementation of climate action.Monday, December 7, 2015The Role of the Financial System in the Transition to a Low-carbon EconomyJones will attend the session focused on decarbonizing financial markets and portfolios. Investors and financial regulators have started to acknowledge their role in this arena. 2 Investing Initiative, Carbon Tracker Initiative and the UNEP Inquiry are three organizations working with investors and policymakers on the integration of climate considerations in investment decisions to ensure the reallocation of capital to a low carbon economy. Discussions will focus on theories and actions, offer insight on the European and global context and analyze the current policy momentum.6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum 2015The Commissioner will join global stakeholders and decision-makers with delegates from 43 countries at the 6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum. Building on year-round work from Climate Action and UNEP, the two-day forum will convene cross-sector participants from business, government, finance, the UN, NGOs and civil society to create an unparalleled opportunity to bolster business innovation and bring scale to the emerging green economy.Tuesday, December 8, 2015Carbon Tracker Roundtable Discussion on Strategic Risk Disclosures for Fossil Fuel CompaniesCommissioner Jones has been selected as one of 24 world leaders to participate in a private roundtable with high-level participants including asset owners, asset managers and policy-makers to discuss the extent to which company business plans diverge from climate safe energy pathways and to agree on future actions.Organized in partnership with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the discussion will focus on the disclosure of fossil fuel companies' long-term exposure to energy transition risk and how investors can best engage on this topic.On December 7, Carbon Tracker will launch a set of recommended strategic risk engagement principles for fossil fuel companies at the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Leaders Luncheon on Climate. This document is designed to complement the work of organizations including PRI and SSE and will allow investors in fossil fuel companies to gain insight into business risks in the context of the transition to a low carbon economy.Shifting Billions Toward Green InvestmentsThe Commissioner will attend this meeting of investors and policymakers, which will include a discussion of investment solutions to a greener economy, carbon impacts in investment decisions and asset management, and emerging new solutions.# # #Media Notes:Commissioner Jones believes that climate change poses an existential threat. Since the start of his first term in 2011, Jones has required insurance companies to report on how they are addressing climate risk in their business operations, reserving and underwriting. Commissioner Jones leads a multi-state group of insurance regulators in requiring insurers to answer the Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, surveying more than 1,000 insurance companies annually and capturing approximately 77 percent of the entire U.S insurance market, enabling regulators, insurance companies and interested members of the public the ability to identify climate risk trends, vulnerabilities and best practices by the insurance industry. Survey results can be found on the California Department of Insurance's website.###The California Department of Insurance, established in 1868, is the largest consumer protection agency in California. Insurers collect $259 billion in premiums annually in California.

""At the same time, it is obvious that a more 'comprehensive' approach is necessary to address all the aspects that affect emissions during the use phase of a vehicle,"" Erik Jonnaert, ACEA Secretary General explained. Such an approach seeks to reduce CO2 emissions more effectively by drawing on a full spectrum of solutions, whether this relates to the vehicle itself, alternative powertrains, faster fleet renewal, intelligent transport systems (ITS), improving infrastructure, decarbonising fuels, or altering driver behaviour. The need for a comprehensive approach to further reduce CO2 emissions from road transport should be reflected in the EU's implementation of the COP21 agreement.ACEA expresses the hope that the outcome of the climate negotiations forms the basis of a new long-term and predictable policy framework. Policy makers should also ensure that the COP21 talks result in equivalent conditions for all major emitting economies and industrial sectors around the world, recommends ACEA.Jonnaert: ""Only a level playing field between countries, as well as industrial sectors, will allow the EU automotive industry to make the long-term investments that are necessary to tackle the climate change challenge.""AutoTriage14sp 151127 30FurigayJane-5368858 30FurigayJane\l"

For the past two weeks at the U.S. Center, the U.S. public outreach space at COP21, we've been proud to host several LES who helped fulfill the U.S. Center's mission of bringing COP21 to the world.

I didn't expect the COP to be this big. 'Climate change is a huge issue in Bangladesh because it's a low-lying country. We have floods almost every year, as well as typhoons. So the COP summit is really important for us. 'I got to attend Secretary Kerry's speech this week. It was inspiring to hear how the Obama Administration is taking real action not just plans and how other countries are also collaborating.

Yet, I'm beginning to think the big Paris climate change conference known as #COP21 may actually accomplish some real change.<nl/> Oddly enough, my optimism is rooted in something I would have seen a few years ago as a fatal flaw: that the results will be based in voluntary, not mandatory, compliance.<nl/> Why? Because:<nl/> We can't GET mandatory compliance. In the US, that would require a yes vote in each house of Congress, or\~even worse, the 2/3 Senate support required to adopt a treaty. But even as far back as Kyoto, US electoral politics had become a toxic swamp of attack-dog partisanship. No climate change bill with teeth is going to pass Congress any time soon. And without US (or China's) participation, any\~agreement would be useless. The US and China have already agreed to take climate seriously, and have negotiated their own agreement. Weaker than I'd like, but a heck of a good start, and one that seems to have helped apply the brakes on China's mad rush to coal (the worst scenario\~for averting climate disaster). The business community has woken up. Often a force for conservatism, the business world now understands the catastrophic consequences of failure to make meaningful progress on climate change[1] and the profits to be made in doing the right thing. If the government won't act, they will force action through other channels. The emergence of environmental activism among evangelical Christians[2] and even a subset of Tea Party activists who care deeply about the environment [3]is also very encouraging. The growing use of carbon markets[4] provides additional\~financial incentives for cutting carbon. New technology makes it easier to\~do more with less, use.\~our resources far more effectively, and solve engineering problems with biological thinking (for example, letting bridge engineers study spiderwebs). We understand now, for instance, just how much energy and carbon we can save by going for deep conservation. Early discussions about whether the world should agree on a 1.5 degree Celsius vs. 2 degree C cap in global temperatures compared to what existed before the Industrial Revolution means we've finally gotten past the question that's been holding us back for so long: why do we need to contain\~rising temperatures\~in the first place?\~For the first time, the world is pretty much in agreement that it has to be done. Not just scientists, this time, but governments, too. Climate deniers (other than in the US Republican Party leadership, apparently) are now as marginalized as environmental activists were 20 or 30 years ago.<nl/> I could keep going, but you get the message we can do this!<nl/> You just finished reading Cautiously Optimistic about #COP21[5]!

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA253","NWF Hosts Deforestation Events in Paris","January 5, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington: National Wildlife Federation has issued the following news release: As we have updated over the past 2 weeks, the National Wildlife Federation had a team in Paris for COP21United NationsClimate Change Conference. This year\' s COP was a big one because it created an agreement that ramps up governments\' ambitions to limit global carbon emissions. The National Wildlife Federation\' s international team focused on a key piece of the negotiations \- the  land sector \- which plays a large role in emissions from deforestation and agriculture, carbon sequestration (forests are able to store carbon pollution), and wildlife habitat. Beyond our work to highlight the land sector\' s importance in the agreement, we participated in a number of side events that surrounded the COP. NWF held two main events along with several co-sponsors to showcase zero-deforestation agriculture and make clear the importance of the land sector. The events discussed how progress has been made and how private and public sector initiatives can work together to decrease deforestation. Zero-deforestation Commodity Supply Chains: Linking Corporate Actions with REDD+ During the first week of the COP, the National Wildlife Federation held our first side event with co-sponsors Environmental Defense Fund, the Governors\' Climate & Forests Task Force, and the United Nations Office for REDD+ Coordination in Indonesia (UNORCID). This event took place in the Climate Generations Area which is a specific space at the COP venue open to badged delegates and the general public. Our panel, co-moderated by Helen Crowley of Kering Group and our own David Burns, was made up of representatives from the private sector, including Walmart Brazil, Kering Group (the parent company for a range of brands, such as Gucci, Puma, Volcom, etc.), and the Consumer Goods Forum (a group of 400+ companies), as well as a state government representative from Brazil and a United Nations Environment Programme Goodwill Ambassador. This combination of private and public sector actors examined the successes of voluntary private sector actions for eliminating deforestation in agricultural supply chains, such as certification, roundtables, and moratoria on sourcing products from recently deforested areas, concentrating on major commodities such as soy, palm oil, and cattle. They then discussed the ways in which private sector activities can create synergies with government actions such as law enforcement and forest conservation under programs like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Deforestation-free Agriculture: Converting Pledges into Action NWF\' s second side event took place Tuesday, Dec. 8 in the  blue zone of the COP where attendees must be badged by the United Nations. The co-hosts \- NWF, SNV Netherlands Development Organization, and the Rainforest Alliance (RA) \- each had a speaker on the panel alongside representatives from Walmart Brazil and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands. \~ The focus of this discussion was the prospect for deforestation-free agriculture. Food, feed, and fiber production need to increase to meet population growth and improve diets, yet without expanding into forests and other native ecosystems. As agriculture moves into these areas, deforestation harms wildlife and habitat. So, how do we proceed? This discussion, like the prior side event, examined the role of certification and moratoria in decreasing deforestation. Speakers noted that  first-mover companies (those that are the first to take these initiatives) need to incentivize others. A zero-deforestation impact is only achievable through working with all companies and smallholders. The event also examined the lessons learned from  landscape-level approaches which involve having a well-planned mosaic of production and conservation areas across a large area of land to provide social protections while conserving important ecosystem services. In this case, one example of a  landscape-level approach is combining shrimp farming and mangrove conservation. Speakers supported the need for government action to provide enforcement at the sub-national level (i.e. state or provincial level) to increase the chance of success for these voluntary private sector actions. Dr. Nathalie Walker, the National Wildlife Federation\' s Senior Manager of Tropical Forests and Agriculture, presented how the Brazilian Soy Moratorium dramatically decreased deforestation in the Amazon driven by the expansion of soy farming. A voluntary initiative implemented by the private sector since 2006, the Moratorium has been five times more effective at stopping deforestation for soy than government policy alone. NWF supported continuation of the moratorium last year, when soy traders threatened to end it. Dr. Walker received several questions from the Dutch government and civil society members in the room about how private sector action can support government policies in this endeavor. This topic is a central component of NWF\' s international work, and the active discussion between panelists and the audience continued well after the end of the formal event. These panels were two of many during COP 21 that demonstrate the key role the land sector needs to play in a world shaped by climate change \- preferably as part of the solution and not a continued source of climate pollution and habitat loss.

COONS ""WE CAN CREATE NEW JOBS AND SPUR ECONO....","December 5, 2015 Saturday","States News Service","The following information was released by Delaware Senator Christopher Coons:U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement from Paris after visiting the negotiations at Le Bourget, France as part of the 2015 United Nations , or COP21. Representatives from 195 countries have gathered in Paris to produce a new international agreement on climate change to keep the global average temperature increase to below 2C.One thing that has been clear from these negotiations in France is that governments alone cant solve climate change, said Senator Coons. If we want to truly address one of the greatest challenges our world faces today, which threatens human health, the environment, and international security, the United States and nations around the world must work together with the private sector and NGOs to set responsible policies while supporting the development of new technologies and innovations.If the United States is going to lead this effort, we have to be at the forefront of setting ambitious policies and supporting the impressive innovations in energy efficiency and clean energy technology that both our public and private sectors are capable of producing.To do that, it is critical for Congress to enact responsible and forward-looking energy policies, but shifting to an energy-efficient and low-carbon economy will also require action and investment from businesses across the United States. Many American businesses, including several in Delaware like DuPont, Bloom Energy, and White Optics, are already leading the way and proving that we can create new jobs and spur economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the same time.In the Senate, Ive been working to support bipartisan legislation that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and facilitates clean energy growth from working to level the energy playing field through the MLP Parity Act to advocating for increased funding for research and development in innovative energy technologies through the energy title of America COMPETES.Im heartened by the progress being made here in Paris and am optimistic that the outcome of the negotiations will prove the international community is ready to meet the challenge of climate change head on and do what is necessary to keep the future of our children and our planet safe. We cannot afford to delay action any longer.\l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA257","COP21: China's Dual Identity - Analysis","January 29, 2016 Friday","Eurasia Review","By Tenzin LhadonThe 30 November to 11 December 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21) placed special interest to receive the much awaited cooperation and effort from China.In particular, the focus was on whether China identifies itself as a global player, aligning with other developed nations, or among the developing nations, despite being the second largest economy. China and COP21China is recognised as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and therefore, its position at the international climate change negotiations \- as one of the leading and most influential actors in addressing global climate change \- is not just crucial but sets the tone for the success of global efforts towards combating climate change in the future.Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at the opening ceremony of the COP21 and Beijing's commitments and assurances on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions have been highly appreciated. There have been several debates and questions on whether or not China is to be regarded a developed country, because, it is the world's largest exporter, with a GDP growth rate of 50 per cent, making its economy worth $26.98 trillion \- bigger than that of the US', which stands at $22.3 trillion.A recent New York Times commentary illustrated how Beijing likes the Renminbi to be treated at par with other leading currencies, as well as for recognising China as one of the world's leading economic powers. However, contradictorily, at the COP21, China shied away from identifying itself as a developed nation, apprehensive of the fact that it might have to face more regulation and responsibilities if categorised as a developed country. In fact, Beijing spoke on behalf of developing countries at the conference, calling on all the developed nations to reaffirm their promises to assist financially and otherwise, to help develop the poorer countries in their growth and sustainable development.China and G77In 1964 China joined the G77 group that mostly comprises of poorer countries affected by global climate change, and where developed nations were deemed responsible for providing annual financial assistance worth $100 billion. China asserted its position as a global player at the COP21 because it not only provides Beijing with a perfect platform to raise a justified voice and act as a spokesperson for the G77 nations but also helps project itself as a benign global power.Although many observers in China felt the international climate change agreement could help with the restructuring of the economy, Chinese citizens and Beijing feel that they have a lesser say in international proposals that which are dominated by the US and EU. Many observers in China also feel the need to find a better way to communicate the country's position and improve its international standing. Despite the recent economic slowdown, Beijing's economic prowess and its participation and agreement on climate change issues have a bearing on China's global stature.China's Special Representative on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua lauded the adoption of the historic climate change agreement at , and while simultaneously reiterating China's status as a developing country, stated that it will take actions according to its national capacity and development stage.Climate DiplomacyThere is a general perception that countries in the northern hemisphere are developed and that those in the southern hemisphere, are not. In the global configuration of developed and developing countries, this 'North-South divide', and the problematic nature of this division \- i.e. based on economic capabilities \- always featured in international climate change negotiations.Ideally, developed nations should shoulder more responsibility towards reducing global carbon emissions and consumption of the world's resources, as well as contribute more towards the progress of developing countries with a particular focus on those most-affected by climate change.The Beijing Review underscored the Chinese foreign ministry's call for fairness in dividing responsibilities between developed and developing countries, calling the Paris climate change agreement a ""a new beginning in international cooperation.""""In broad terms, richer countries wanted to build new and less restrictive processes, while developing country blocs wanted to focus on 'fairness' and historical emissions, and to protect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities,"" said Yu Jie, communications strategist with China Dialogue, and former director, Climate Policy,The Nature Conservancy.However, China's proclaimed status of a developing nation has becoming increasingly disputable given how it is the world's largest CO2 emitter and an economic giant itself. In fact, the Beijing Review continues to project how China can play major role in G77/China, Brazil, South Africa, India, China (BASIC) and Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), to bridge differences between these groups as well as between parties in a broader manner.Reflecting on China's significant role in the international climate debate, it is apt to conclude that Beijing's encouraging stance at the COP21 is not only momentous but essential to the country's task to behave like a global player. Although it is an positive effort by China, several questions still remain on its achievements towards improving the global climate situation and the amount of efforts invested towards addressing the matter.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA258","Massachusetts: Climate negotiation role-play in Paris feels like the real thing","December 7, 2015 Monday","US Official News","Boston: Massachusetts Institute of Technology , The State of Massachusetts has issued the following news release: The MIT Energy Initiative is sharing reports from the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where MIT faculty and students are participating as observers to climate negotiations and hosting several programs, which will be covered over the coming week. As delegates work to cut global greenhouse gas emissions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) talks in Paris, a vibrant hub of activity next door in the conference\' s ""Climate Generations"" area attracts people from around the world. Environmental and energy non-governmental organizations and agencies engage visitors in their work through visualizations and demonstrations, while numerous conference sessions range in topics from ocean sustainability to green growth in Africa. In one of the conference rooms on Friday, Dec. 4, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon instructs delegates on how to begin their climate negotiations. Only the Secretary-General isn\' t himself today: His part is being played by MIT Professor John Sterman. And the  delegates are actually visitors to COP21, some here on behalf of organizations, others as interested citizens. All have gathered to play ""World Climate,"" a live-action role-playing simulation developed by Sterman and MIT alumnus Andrew Jones of the not-for-profit Climate Interactive. ""World Climate"" helps policymakers, business leaders, and citizens understand first-hand the complexities of the climate and global negotiations  and what\' s needed to limit anthropogenic climate change. The ""World Climate"" Project was launched in August 2015 at the White House and has since been used in more than 45 countries, from Argentina to Zimbabwe  with more than 10,000 participants to date. The simulation held here at the Paris climate talks brings diverse perspectives together.  The participants came from a wide range of countries and ethnicities, and about half were women, which was great to see, Sterman says. Sterman and Jones, with MIT researcher and Climate Interactive program director Travis Franck, University of Massachusetts professor Juliette Rooney-Varga, and Climate Interactive\' s Ellie Johnston begin the role-play for the large group that has assembled. Sterman asks,  Who here is from the European Union? Hands go up.  Great! Today, you represent China. Now, who here is from China? Today, you are the United States. Taking roles completely different from their own backgrounds helps participants experience challenges they might not otherwise consider. Others such as Thango, a young woman from South Africa well versed in the issues facing her country and continent, play more familiar roles. She joins the group representing the developing nations. For Thango, it\' s an opportunity to share with fellow delegates the struggle of the developing nations to develop sustainably even as they stand to suffer the most from climate change. Discussions quickly become heated, with delegates taking their new national identities seriously. At the end of the first round of negotiations, a representative of each delegation addresses the plenary assembly. In their roles as national leaders  Barack Obama of the U.S., Vladimir Putin of Russia, Narendra Modi of India, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande of France, and Xi Jinping of China  participants explain their emissions pledges and financial commitment or demands. Then Sterman and Franck plug the delegates\' pledges into the C-ROADS climate policy simulation developed by Sterman and Climate Interactive. C-ROADS is a peer-reviewed model that matches the dynamics of the models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but runs in about one second on an ordinary laptop. The model and materials to facilitate the entire ""World Challenge"" exercise are freely available through Climate Interactive\' s website. As Sterman enters the pledges, the delegates see global emissions flatten, but when the last pledge is recorded, the model shows that the world will still warm by 3.5 degrees Celsius (6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, leading to ocean acidification and other harms, including about a meter of sea level rise. Sterman and the team drape the participants with a billowing cloth to show how many parts of the world will be inundated despite the emissions reductions they have pledged.  The first round\' s pledges produced results extremely close to the initial pledges here in Paris  nowhere near enough to curb climate change, Sterman says.  When the delegates in the workshop saw this, some were shocked, because they thought their pledges would get the job done. Sterman and team give the participants another chance to reach stronger agreements. Raymond Song, a high school student from China representing the U.S. in the game, channels President Barack Obama with an impassioned plea for the other developed nations to step up  and pledges that the U.S. will do more. Intense negotiations ensue, with India agreeing to emissions cuts in exchange for financial assistance from developed nations and China pledging future emissions cuts, leading to a much more promising outcome.  The model provides people with immediate feedback on the consequences of their proposals, Sterman says.  They saw how much their countries will suffer without deeper emissions cuts, and that motivated them to reach a much better agreement, limiting warming to just about 2 C (3.6 F), the limit the nations of the world have declared must not be exceeded. The passionate dialogue generated by the mock-debate is an example of why MIT representatives are here in Paris: to help make climate issues more accessible and understandable; to convey the monumental importance of taking strong collective action to combat global climate change; and to share climate research with scientific peers and journalists. For participants in the ""World Climate"" role-play, the simulation has been an eye-opening experience:  I really liked the game. It made me understand how negotiations work, [and] the importance of talking about the impact of climate change on [people\' s] lives, says Thango. She plans to use the game to educate girls she works with in South Africa on how countries can use the negotiations to collectively meet global emissions reductions goals.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA263","AFRICA HANGS ITS AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION AGENDA ON COP 21'S OUTCOME","December 7, 2015 Monday","IPS - Inter Press Service","A famous saying goes: To whom much is given, much is expected. This is the message that the African Development Bank (AfDB) is carrying and delivering for, and on behalf of Africa at the global conference on climate change, COP21, which opened Monday, 30th November. ""All fingers are not equal. Those who pollute more should do more in saving our planet,"" said AfDB President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is leading his bank's team at the climate change conference in Paris.Adesina, a former Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria, knows what climate change has done and what its implications are for Africa's agricultural development if nothing is done to halt global warming.""The danger that Africa will not be able to feed itself is a real one. And if we don't have resources to adapt to climate change, Africa will not be able to unlock potential in agriculture,"" said Adesina, highlighting the implications of climate change variability on Africa's agricultural transformation agenda.He says the bank's message at the COP 21 was clear: a new climate deal that does not work for Africa is no deal at all.According to Dr. Adesina, the major and historic polluters must take a fair share of responsibility not only to cut their emissions but also help the suffering adapt to climate impacts.The AfDB's stance resonates with a long standing position of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN)which has been pushing for a common but differentiated principle demanding historic emitters to cut emissions to keep warming below 1.5 degrees celsius and provide funding for adaptation for vulnerable countries, most of which are in Africa.With impacts ranging from droughts and floods affecting agricultural production and water availability in the southern and Sahel regions of Africa, to shrinking rivers, a classic example being Lake Chad, African countries are hoping for a climate deal that would address these challenges both in the short and long term.""Adaptation as you know is key for Africa but this time we are demanding a high level of adaptation equal to mitigation because we know that the two are closely linked,"" Chair of the African Group of Negotiators Nagmeldin Elhassan told a high level panel discussion at the on-going climate talks in Paris.Nagmeldin said African heads of state are expecting nothing short of a fair and just deal for the continent, a victim of circumstances it never caused.He said adaptation would be a key issue at the COP 21 negotiating table for Africa as over the years, the African Group of Negotiators has been seeking for parity between mitigation, adaptation and provisions for enhancing means of implementation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries.""When we speak adaptation, we link it to means of implementation as a way of getting developed countries involved to provide support,"" the AGN chair said.And the African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Rhoda Peace Tumutsime puts it categorically that, ""Unless we get a good deal here, that will help with the right technology, we will not be able to modernize and transform agriculture.""The question of means of implementation is a critical component of this year's COP. According the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa-(UNECA), climate change could stimulate developing economies into adapting sustainable development paths, through entrepreneurial opportunities, and spaces for policy makers to address equity concerns in gender and youth policies.Dr. Carlos Lopez of UNECA argues Africa's possible positive outcome from danger. ""Despite all the negative news that is reported about Africa, there are opportunities that we can take advantage of. It is very important to get the perceptions right about Africa's challenges and available opportunities. In all the bad news are potential areas for growth,"" he said.Dr Lopez said Africa has a massive advantage to develop differently by embracing the opportunities that climate change offers to develop sustainably.""It is also important for us to realize that we are not going to make it using the same carbon intensive model...let's take for example, under the 2063 agenda we have to create 122 million jobs. Following the carbon path, we will only create 54 million jobs, but what about the deficit?"" he asked.Citing various examples of opportunities among which is renewable energy owing to Africa's natural potential of solar, the UNECA Chief is more than convinced that the continent should be part of the solution and ""achieve industrialization which is cleaner, greener, without following the carbon model.""However, the question of resources still remains. Will the climate deal offer Africa this opportunity? The next week or so will decide what and which way forward.(End) \l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA265","WILL THE NEXT UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CONFERENCE GO VEGAN? PETA CALLS FOR COP 22 TO RIGHT COP 21'S WRONGS BY SERVING ECO-FRIENDLY, PLANT-BASED MEALS","December 16, 2015 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA):At the United Nations' Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 in Paris, 196 countries agreed to approve a plan to combat global climate change that included a call for more vegan eating. But the meals served at the conference were far from green, prompting PETA'whose motto reads, in part, that animals are not ours to eat'to send a letter to the U.N. today calling on officials not to repeat this year's mistake and to ensure that next year's COP 22 in Morocco sets an example by serving only vegan meals.The U.N. itself has acknowledged that a global shift toward vegan eating is imperative both for slowing climate change and for eradicating global hunger, writes PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. COP leaders must surely set an example, eating as if they mean business, enjoying only planet-friendly vegan foods during COP events.For more information, please visit PETA.org or click here.PETA's letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres follows. December 14, 2015Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United NationsChristiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate ChangeDear Mr. Secretary-General and Ms. Figueres,We send our best wishes concerning the adoption of the agreement to curb global greenhouse-gas emissions and congratulate you on including conscientious consumption as a necessary part of the strategy to reduce carbon emissions and protect our planet.It's of concern, therefore, that the meals at COP21 were far from green. A Financial Times editorial called the lack of even vegetarian food disconcerting for committed environmentalists, and a reporter for The Huffington Post wrote of being unable to find adequate wholesome meat-free options during the summit.As you must know, the meat industry is responsible for 85 percent of soil erosion in the U.S., and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers the farming of animals to be the number one source of national water pollutison. In the U.S., more than 50 percent of all water use is dedicated to the raising of animals for food. More than one-third of fossil fuels and raw materials also go toward the farming of animals. The U.N. itself has acknowledged that a global shift toward vegan eating is imperative both for slowing climate change and eradicating global hunger.On a global scale, the farming of animals for food releases a substantial percentage of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions. The Worldwatch Institute also points out that [r]oughly 2 of every 5 tons of grain produced in the world is fed to livestock, poultry, or fish; decreasing consumption of these products, especially of beef, could free up massive quantities of grain and reduce pressure on land.You have recognized the negative impact that the farming of animals has on the planet, but COP leaders must surely set an example, eating as if they mean business, enjoying only planet-friendly vegan foods during COP events.It's imperative that COP22 not repeat the mistake of COP21 by ignoring the largest contributing factor to global climate change. May we hear from you that you're committed to making COP22 a completely vegan event in 2016?We're available to provide vegan meal planning assistance. I look forward to your reply.Very truly yours,Ingrid E. NewkirkPresidentPETA\l"

That includes their actions relating to climate change,"" Mr. Knox said in Paris, where he is taking part in the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - COP 21.""I call on Governments to honour their human rights obligations as they negotiate the climate agreement,"" the expert stated. ""Even including a reference to human rights in the agreement itself would be of great symbolic and practical importance.""""It is now beyond debate that climate change threatens the enjoyment of a vast range of human rights. Moreover, it is inherently discriminatory, harming most those who have contributed least to the problem.""""An increase of even 2 degrees would have devastating effects on the human rights of the most vulnerable,"" he said. ""The Climate Vulnerable Forum countries' proposed target of 1.5 degrees would better accord with human rights principles.""The Special Rapporteur also noted that States must also take human rights law into account in their actions to adapt to climate change and to undertake response measures.""Governments do not check their human rights obligations at the door when they respond to climate change,"" he said. ""They must respect the rights of their people to receive information about proposed climate actions and to have their voices heard in the decision-making processes.""Mr. Knox recalled that the Governments on the Human Rights Council have unanimously agreed that human rights obligations and principles can strengthen climate policy-making by promoting coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes.""The Paris Agreement is vital to the protection of human rights of present and future generations, in every country of the world.

The French automaker has deployed a fleet of 200 EVs to shuttle delegates during the confab, which started November 30 and ends today. In fact, the Renault-Nissan Alliance has invested more than $4 billion in electric-vehicle technology and is looking for the green-minded event to improve the automakers' return on investment.<nl/>As part of the conference, Renault is publicizing recent patents that have led to shorter charging times and longer single-charge range figures for models such as the Renault Zoe. Renault also says its Zoe sales have surpassed 30,000 units in Europe while its Kangoo Z.E. sales have topped 20,000 units. Renault is also touting its position as the electric-vehicle expert for the Formula E electric-vehicle racing circuit. See more information from Renault here[1].<nl/>The Alliance said in September that it had moved more than 265,000 electric vehicles globally[2], or more than General Motors and Mitsubishi (the two next-largest plug-in vehicle sellers) combined, and accounts for about one in four EVs since the Nissan Leaf started sales a few years back.

These two events seem to have spurred exceptional interest in the atom, even when the summit or the upcoming U.N. climate change conference are not explicitly mentioned. From The Los Angeles Times[1]: Nuclear energy's importance in reducing emissions is beyond dispute. In January, the International Energy Agency called nuclear power £ critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions.' It calculated that global nuclear generation capacity must more than double by 2050 (to about 750 gigawatts) if there is any hope of limiting temperature increases to the 2 degrees that is widely agreed as acceptable.This story[2] from Power covers the Washington summit: Even some former nuclear opponents are getting behind the energy source now. Ken Caldeira, climate scientist working for the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, noted that he was arrested while demonstrating against nuclear power near the front gates of the Shoreham facility which was never placed into commercial operation in the early 1980s. After studying climate science in graduate school, Caldeira changed his tune. 'The environmental community should be embracing nuclear power as one of the very few technologies that can provide high-density power in an environmentally acceptable way,' Caldeira said.Another story[3], this one tied to COP21, tries a local angle to make a more general point: America's contributions toward combating climate change will fall short of what's expected from this country - and seem double-faced - if the U.S. is also shutting down nuclear-generating capacity, which is its largest source of carbon-free energy.This is from the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press. It makes the point that New Jersey generates most of its electricity from nuclear and yet Oyster Creek plant is closing in 2019. That's what the 'double-faced' comment refers to.<nl/>We know that COP21 might be delayed due to the terrible events in Paris last Friday. COP21 remains important, but it's not the most important thing occupying our minds right now. <nl/>Even so, the conference will happen and it will likely issue the first viable global climate change solution since the Kyoto Protocol. Nuclear energy, it is safe to say, will enjoy more attention than it has received in these quarters for some time. If we have to wait for it a bit longer, we'll wait.<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bryce-nuclear-power-20151113-story.htmlhttp://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bryce-nuclear-power-20151113-story.html [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.powermag.com/experts-nuclear-power-must-be-expanded-to-limit-climate-changehttp://www.powermag.com/experts-nuclear-power-must-be-expanded-to-limit-climate-change/ [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/11/mcgovern-nuclear-plants-help-combat-climate-change/75565866/http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/11/mcgovern-nuclear-plants-help-combat-climate-change/75565866/ \l"

India is among the few that has given a comprehensive INDC,"" Ashok Lavasa, a key official of India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and part of its COP21 team at Paris, told IPS. A new report by Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) bears out India's demand at COP 21 for resources to adapt. The CSE report finds in 2013, five states were impacted and 0.35 million hectares of standing crops affected which in 2014 increased to six states being affected, and 5.5 million hectares of crops, just a month away from being harvested, were damaged. In 2015, as many as 15 states were hit and 18.23 million hectares or one-third of cropped area was damaged. The losses to farmers were in excess of 4 billion dollars.Around 62 per cent of India's people depend on agriculture. Six out of ten farmers depend on rain for irrigation and at high risk to the vagaries of changing weather patterns.Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, a prominent 88-year-old geneticist known as the father of India's Green Revolution of the 1960s, said the impact of weather events on agriculture was indicated by the fact that India recently imported 10 million tonnes of pulses. ""Fifty years ago when India started the green revolution, it was importing 10 million tonnes of wheat. We seem to be back to the same situation because of climate change,"" he said.According to a new United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) report, The Human Cost of Weather-Related Disasters 1995-2015, says in the last 20 years there have been 6,457 floods, storms, heat waves, droughts and other climatic events. Asia bore the brunt of these mainly due to its large and varied landmass, including multiple river basins, flood plains and other zones at high risk from natural hazards, plus high population densities in disaster-prone regions.Over this period, 805 million Indians have been affected out of 4.1 billion people globally.Overall, annual economic losses from disasters globally are estimated by UNISDR at between 250 billion and 300 billion dollars.Underscoring the need for resources by developing countries to adapt to climate change, Lavasa said, ""India being a developing economy, there are lots of demands on its resources.

On behalf of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), I would like to welcome you all to this side event of the 21st Climate Change Conference (COP21).I would like to start by thanking our co-organizer for this side event, the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.Collaboration between ADB and the Government of Japan regarding climate changeCollaboration between ADB and the Government of Japan on climate change has a long history starting in 19911.COP21 meeting.Climate actions and importance of climate technologiesThe actions toward tackling of climate change are at a critical stage. The impacts and consequences of climate change pose the greatest threat to human society and they are expected to become more intense in the coming years, if the increase of global mean temperature is not kept below 2 degrees Celsius. Crucial to meeting this target is the new international agreement by all nations at the ongoing COP21.ADB's contributionADB is strongly committed to climate action, and is working with development partners and engaging the private sector to support developing member countries (DMCs) transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies.ADB has consistently delivered more than $3 billion annually for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In 2014, ADB invested $766 million in private sector climate mitigation projects.ADB will double its annual climate financing to $6 billion by 2020, up from the current $3 billion. $4 billion is for mitigation and $2 billion is for adaptation. ADB's spending on tackling climate change will rise to around 30% of its overall financing by the end of this decade.Objectives of the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM)The Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism or JFJCM is new collaboration with the Government of Japan to promote the transfer of the low carbon technology.ADB established the JFJCM in 2014 with contribution from the Ministry of Environment, Japan. The fund aims to address the barriers to adoption of advanced low-carbon technologies such as high up-front costs and perceived risk that the technology will not perform to expectations.The fund will provide grants for the incremental cost of adoption or the cost of deploying advanced low carbon technologies from the cost of ""business as usual"" technology. Areas for financing include technologies for smart grid, waste to energy, advanced renewable energy systems, and energy efficient infrastructure.The CO2 emission reduction by these mitigation technologies in the projects will be certified by the Joint Crediting Mechanism and will be contributed to host country's and Japan's CO2 emission reduction targets. A total of $31.6 million has been contributed to the JFJCM.Two JFJCM supported projects are being implemented and processed. The first project for a grant of $ 5 million to a solar power project in Maldives and the other is a grant of $10 million for an energy distribution project in Mongolia. Several such projects are being developed in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Myanmar on the energy, and water sector.For this side event, ADB aims to share the experience of the JFJCM on the transfer of the low carbon technology. We will also discuss the expectation of the JCM and the JFJCM with MOEJ and developing member countries.I wish you all a productive discussion.Thank you.\l"

Dr Martin Junge, general secretary of the LWF, and Pauliina Parhiala, ACT Alliance's director and chief operating officer.The pilgrims, who began walking from Rome to Paris 36 days ago, want to deliver a strong message of climate justice to the leaders gathered for the COP21.At her welcoming speech to the pilgrims, Phiri pointed out that the People's Pilgrimage is also a clear expression of the Pilgrimage of Justice and Peace, a call from the 10th Assembly of the WCC.As part of the programme of the pilgrims at the ecumenical centre, a panel on the approach to faith organizations to was organized. ""Facing the climate crisis: ethical and spiritual challenges"" had the participation of Nadia Gonella (Peoples' Pilgrimage), Martin Kopp (LWF), Vitumbiko Chinoko (ACT Alliance) and was moderated by WCC's programme executive for Care for Creation and Climate Justice, Dr Guillermo Kerber.Kerber evaluated the panel as a positive experience. ""All panelists agreed that COP21 will just be a relevant milestone in the longer journey for climate justice"", he said, stressing that ""mobilization of faith communities, such as the various pilgrimages and fast for the climate campaign, contribute to raising awareness and involving more people to address the climate crisis"", he added.One of the key points of consensus among participants was also the fact that the international community has the opportunity to deliver a fair, ambitious and binding treaty, as faith and spiritual leaders recently requested, to keep average temperature rise below 1.5degreeC. An increase beyond this would imply further dramatic consequences to the most vulnerable populations suffering the consequences of climate change.One of the pilgrims, Alan Silyan of the Philippines, commented, ""Climate change has evolved from a political to a moral issue.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA280","COP (out) 21","November 20, 2015 Friday","Ka Lee O Hawaii: University of Hawaii-Manoa","COP21, the United Nations climate Change conference, beginning on November 30th, will have over 190 members of the UN convene in Paris to discuss legally binding agreements on addressing climate change. The event has been heralded as the last chance for world leaders to address climate change. Unfortunately, the COP21 isn't going to save us in time.According to the proposals presented by 146 countries and the European Union (which make up about 86 percent of global emissions), we would still see global temperatures rise three degrees celsius by 2100, one degree more than the prescribed two degree limit. Though one degree may not seem like much, it would cause severe droughts in the western United States which would mean food shortages and desertification, according to National Geographic. As far as sea level rise is concerned, tens of thousands of homes would be flooded in the Bay of Bengal. For us in Hawaii, that means we could see Aiea become the new Waikiki.What do we do?Though there is little information about how countries are planning to achieve their carbon reduction goals, one thing is for sure: carbon pricing is clearly not a big enough part of the conversation.If it were, we would certainly be able to avoid breaking the 2 degree threshold. Carbon pricing is the most effective solution for reducing CO2 emissions. Here's how it works. A fee is assessed on all fossil fuels. That fee will rise every year until industries can no longer find it profitable to invest in fossil fuels. As a result, they will be forced to invest in the only other option available: renewable energy. Bill Gates thinks it's a good idea. So does former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. At least three Nobel Laureates also agree. One of those three, economist Joseph Stiglitz, insists that a carbon tax is our only viable option for stopping climate change.Revenue Neutral Carbon TaxA carbon tax could hurt the world's most economically disadvantaged people and potentially destabilize the economy. This is true if we're talking about a pure carbon tax. A revenue neutral carbon tax, however,would do the opposite. Such a tax would rebate all money generated from the fees back to the public or through other such mechanisms as reducing income taxes. It certainly worked in Vancouver.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA281","COP21: How the Paris Climate Talks Could Succeed","November 27, 2015","Newsweek","For 20 years running, the U.N. has held an annual conference on climate change. Never in the two decades of meetings, talks and lobbying have the assembled delegates managed to procure what is needed most: a legally binding and universal agreement on how to slow the rise of global temperatures. They came close in 1997 (Kyoto) and in 2009 (Copenhagen), but those two conferences, like the other 18, failed to achieve this goal.The importance of the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris cannot be overstated. The host city is reeling from a deadly terrorist attack on November 13 that left over 120 dead and 300 wounded. A number of planned demonstrations, concerts and festivities will be canceled, but the core event of COP21 will go on: starting on November 30, leaders and high-level officials from 196 parties have 12 days to reach an accord that could save the planet. The primary objective of COP21 is to divvy up carbon cuts to the developing and developed nations to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and cap global warming at 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-Industrial Revolution levels by 2100. That's roughly the point at which, research suggests, the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will start to melt at an unstoppable pace, prompting a catastrophic rise in global sea levels. Parts of the world will be hit by devastating floods while others will experience severe droughts that will lead to famine as crops fail and potable water supplies dry up.

""We have a long history of countries saying they'll do something and then not doing it,"" says Scott Barrett, a professor of natural resource economics at Columbia University. The protocol that came out of the Kyoto climate conference in 1997, for example, was legally binding, committing 37 industrialized countries and the European Union to reducing their emissions by an average of 5 percent against 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. But it collapsed. Though the U.S. signed the document, Congress later refused to ratify it. Other countries, including Canada and Japan, failed to meet their targets--without repercussion. And developing countries, such as China and India, were exempt from emissions reductions entirely.In 2009, COP15 again tried to reach a universal, lasting agreement. After days of fraught negotiations, the conference frantically pulled together a document at the last minute called the Copenhagen Accord. It included an agreement that deep cuts to worldwide emissions were required and that global temperatures should be limited to the 3.6-degree increase, but there was a crucial deficiency: It wasn't legally binding. The conference as whole voted only to ""take note"" of it. Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Cuba didn't agree to the accord--their delegates criticized the fact that they were excluded from the drafting process by the larger, wealthier member states. Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, a New York-based climate change campaign, told news outlets at the time that the Copenhagen Accord was "" a declaration that small and poor countries don't matter.""'This time around, to engender stronger feelings of inclusion and generate greater participation, the U.N. has asked each member state to submit an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution prior to the meeting. Essentially, this allows each country to list the emissions reductions it intends to make by 2025 or 2030, as well as other planned efforts to combat climate change. The idea is that the conference can then draft a protocol knowing in advance what member states are prepared to accept. Despite the inclusionary approach, many countries still seem resistant: By the submission deadl"

Dr Richard Sezibera has cautioned the international community that the world was at a crossroads and the outcome of the Paris Climate Conference shall either bequeath a better, safer planet to future generations ""or destroy our common heritage and our shared humanity"".Speaking at the 21st Session of the Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also serving as the 11th Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP11) currently underway in Paris, France, the Secretary General expressed the wishes and expectations of the East African citizens on the Paris Climate Change Talks and reckoned that the Agreement must take into consideration the interest of the vulnerable and poor by ensuring that adaptation is equally prioritized and differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries reflected in the Agreement.Amb. Sezibera further urged that issues related to loss and damage associated with climate change impact must be firmly anchored in the agreement through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and country ownership of adaptation and mitigation programmes and projects, and ensure transparency in the provisions of financial, technology transfer and other forms of support including capacity building which should be customized to specific needs of beneficiary countries.""EAC is ready and committed towards supporting implementation of the Paris Agreement by supporting EAC Partner States through the process of ratification of the agreement to pave way for its early entry into force in 2020"", the Secretary General reiterated.The EAC official reaffirmed the region's commitment to aligning its existing Regional Climate Change Policy (2011), the 5 year EAC Climate Change Strategy and Master Plan (2033) to the Paris Agreement as well as fast tracking the process for enacting a Regional Climate Change Bill through the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA).He called for international support in the capitalization of the EAC Climate Change Fund through pioneering the accreditation of EAC as a Regional Implementing Entities (RIE) under the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF).Speaking at the African Day of COP21 convened under the theme; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCS): implications, prospects and Africa's readiness to contribute to climate solutions, the Secretary General applauded the EAC Partner States for submitting their INDCs to address climate change mitigation and adaptation.""Information included in the INDCs should facilitate negotiations and deliver a new Climate Agreement in Paris"" said the Secretary General. He stated that region was looking forward to the implementation of INDCs based on associated support requirements of finance, technology transfer, and capacity building, to be provided by the developed countries.He asserted that EAC was fully in support of the continental climate resilient and low carbon development initiatives and programmes such as the Africa Climate Smart Agriculture Alliance (ACSA); the African Adaptation and Loss and Damage Initiative, and the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) launched in Paris.

As medical students, we too turn our eyes to Le Bourget. The approaching negotiations will have a profound impact on human health, and as a result, on our futures as clinicians.Projections from the World Health Organization, World Bank, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest that climate change will affect billions of people and present a major public health crisis in the coming decades. Reports from The Lancet\~Commission on Health and Climate Change have echoed these concerns, concluding that climate change is the ""biggest global health threat of the 21st century.""Many of the health impacts of climate change are direct. Warming can increase transmission rates and broaden ranges of vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, and schistosomiasis. With malaria, for example, higher temperatures allow the parasite to mature exponentially more rapidly. Even with modest warming, tens of millions more people will be exposed to malaria. Notably, dengue fever stands to spread even more widely than malaria. Increased humidity and mosquito prevalence may put billions more at risk for contracting the virus.Climate change also has a direct impact on the extremity of weather events. Droughts, heat waves, floods, and storms all stand to increase in severity and frequency. Without major changes to our energy system, the new norm will include ""unprecedented"" disasters time and again. These events may lead to acute medical problems that can be especially devastating to developing health systems.The indirect consequences of climate change on health are less obvious but perhaps of even greater importance. A warming planet spells a range of health problems resulting from an unstable food and water supply, massive migratory upheavals, increased armed conflict, and other disruptions to the essential infrastructure of society. Climate change threatens basic human needs, risking the stability required for good health.As medical students and future physicians, we will spend much of our time and this nation's resources treating and managing diseases already affecting our patients. The cost-effective and lifesaving power of preventive medicine reminds us that taking action early in the course of a disease often allows for greater quality of life at a reduced cost. Our perspective on\~climate change should be the same. With catastrophe looming on the horizon, we need to take action as soon as possible.If no substantial agreement emerges at COP 21, we will continue down a path that forces us to reactively treat the consequences of our short-sighted actions. But, if we instead forge a comprehensive emissions reduction plan, we have the opportunity to prevent climate change from defining the next generation of medicine.Riley Brian, Cheyenne Smith and Andrew Wilmington are first-years at the\~Pritzker School of Medicine.\l"

The Agency showed how to achieve an early peak in emissions as one of four key pillars that it believes are needed to make the upcoming UN climate talks a success, from an energy perspective.The world is at a critical juncture in its efforts to combat climate change, with momentum building towards the 21st UN Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015. World greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from energy production and use are double the level of all other sources combined, meaning that action to combat climate change must come first and foremost from the energy sector. The IEA proposes that the following four key pillars are needed to make COP21 a success, from an energy perspective:1. Peak in emissions - set the conditions to achieve an early peak in globalenergy-related emissions.2. Five-year revision - review national climate targets regularly, to test the scope to raise ambition.3. Lock in the vision - translate the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal.4. Track the transition - establish a process for tracking achievements inthe energy sector.""As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence,"" said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. ""It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept.""A peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 if governments implement just five key policy measures, as shown in the IEA's ""Bridge Scenario"". This major climate milestone is possible utilising only proven technologies and policies, and without changing the economic and development prospects of any region. Intended as an effective bridge to further action, the five measures focus on: Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors Reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction Increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from $270 billion in 2014 to $400 billion in 2030 Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030 Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas productionFor countries that have submitted climate pledges for , the proposed strategy identifies possible areas for over-achievement.

Even the United States and China signed on, despite both being loth to agree to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.While the whole affair seemed miraculous, in many ways it was business as usual. Of course the signing parties promised to limit global climate change. Any self-respecting national would do so, lest it be seen as complicit or implicit in the suffering of future generations. Yes, the international community did agree something had to be done. The implementation will be much trickier.Fiona Harvey of the Guardian remarked Dec. 13 that this was the world's greatest diplomatic success. When previous benchmarks include the Treaty of Versailles, the regular dealings of the U.N. Security Council and the Israel-Palestine peace process, I suppose this is true. When every nation, no matter how small, has a say at a massive forum, this is indeed a special moment.In the next few months we will start to see the finger pointing, name calling and general wilting of this deal as wealthy nations call on the developing ones to change, and developing nations demand the developed world pay for hampering their development.Even more bruising will be President Obama facing down a Republican Senate likely hell-bent on making another political fight. Obama will once again be accused of somehow violating the constitutional purview of the Senate to ratify treaties, and Obama will be cornered into soapboxing about the moral implications of not agreeing to this pledge. Even some Democrats from coal country will have a hard time ignoring the angry miners.For those who know me well, it is a poorly-held secret that my politics are quite ... rarified.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA293","BNY Mellon Continues CSR Leadership with Third Consecutive Perfect CDP Score","December 1, 2015 Tuesday 2:43 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Dec 01, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.comhttp://3blmedia.comCOP21DESCRIPTION: Continuing its leadership in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and carbon reduction, BNY Mellon has been named to CDP's global Climate 'A' List for climate performance leadership and its S...limate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI). For the third consecutive year, BNY Mellon has received perfect scores on both climate change disclosure and performance. The company's ""A"" for performance and score of 100 for disclosure make it the only financial institution globally and one of two S...00 companies to receive a perfect score for the past three years. CDP - formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project - is an international, not-for-profit organization providing the only global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information.<nl/> The disclosure and performance scores reflect BNY Mellon's assessment of potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change, management of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and progress toward emission reduction goals. Since 2008, BNY Mellon has reduced its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 32 percent, excluding data centers. It also continues to offset over 60 percent of its global electricity consumption through the purchase of renewable energy, on-site solar generation, and renewable energy credits.<nl/> BNY Mellon's recognition by CDP's Climate 'A' List and CDLI is the latest top CSR ranking for the firm. Within its peer group, it was the only firm named to the DJSI World Index[2] , one of the most highly regarded global sustainability indices, in both 2014 and 2015 and has the top ranking from Bloomberg for CSR disclosure. BNY Mellon has also been included three years in a row in the FTSE4Good Index of firms demonstrating strong CSR performance.<nl/> 'Our very strong CDP scores over the past three years demonstrate our well-established commitment to the highest standards of environmental performance in the actions we take to reduce our carbon impact and to transparency in the disclosure of climate change-related information,' said Karen B. Peetz[3], President of BNY Mellon. 'Beyond our recognition by CDP, we're proud of our leading performance across CSR rankings from respected industry organizations. Taken together, these ratings show that BNY Mellon is a leader in responsible business practices, benefiting both our stakeholders and society.'<nl/> Furthering its leadership in climate change accountability, BNY Mellon is encouraging others to act strongly and swiftly to create a low-carbon future. In the lead up to COP21, the United Nations' Climate Change Conference in Paris, BNY Mellon has signed the White House's American Business Act on Climate Pledge to voice support for a strong outcome from the climate negotiations in Paris and commit to ongoing support for climate action.<nl/> 'Businesses, in partnership with governments, non-governmental organizations and others, have an important role to play in shaping a low-carbon future. Taking strategic action to mitigate climate change is good for our clients, our investors, our people and our world,' said Peetz.<nl/> BNY Mellon's pledge builds on its successful track record of environmental stewardship and can be viewed here[4].<nl/> Related<nl/>CEO Q...BNY Mellon's Gerald Hassell on Corporate Social Responsibility\~[5] Karen Peetz Q...Investment Opportunities Emerging from Global Social and Environmental Trends\~[6] BNY Mellon Highlights 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Achievements in Latest Report\~[7]<nl/> Tweet me: <nl/> KEYWORDS: Awards and Recognition, Business ...ade, COP21, White House, American Business Act on Climate Pledge, CDP, climate performance, climate disclosure, BNY Mellon<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/BNY-Mellonhttp://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/BNY-Mellon [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/press-releases/bny-mellon-named-to-dow-jones-sustainability-world-index-for-second-consecutive-year.jsphttps://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/press-releases/bny-mellon-named-to-dow-jones-sustainability-world-index-for-second-consecutive-year.jsp [ 3]: \~ https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/who-we-are/leadership/peetz.jsphttps://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/who-we-are/leadership/peetz.jsp [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/30/white-house-announces-additional-commitments-american-business-acthttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/30/white-house-announces-additional-commitments-american-business-act HYPERLINK https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/ceo-q-and-a-bny-mellons-gerald-hassell-on-corporate-social-responsibility.jsphttps://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/ceo-q-and-a-bny-mellons-gerald-hassell-on-corporate-social-responsibility.jsp [ 6]: \~ https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/karen-peetz-q-and-a-investment-opportunities-emerging-from-global-social-and-environmental-trends.jsphttps://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/karen-peetz-q-and-a-investment-opportunities-emerging-from-global-social-and-environmental-trends.jsp [ 7]: \~ https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/company-news/bny-mellon-highlights-2014-corporate-social-responsibility-achievements-in-latest-report.jsphttps://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/company-news/bny-mellon-highlights-2014-corporate-social-responsibility-achievements-in-latest-report.jsp \l"

Cramer focused on the role of the tech sector in offering transformative solutions a timely discussion vis-\'e0-vis last week's news about the formation of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition[2], as well as Google's decision to join the Climate Group and CDP's collaborative initiative RE100[3] and triple its purchase of renewable energy by 2025.<nl/> The same day, BSR Senior Vice President Eric Olson participated in a discussion led by CDP and L'Or\'e9al that focused on supply chain resilience[4]. The companies represented in that session including Kellogg Company, L'Oreal, Accenture, BT, and Johnson Controls all emphasized how their ambitious goals to get 75 to 80 percent of their suppliers to set carbon-reduction targets required collaboration to ensure success. L'Or\'e9al's Chief Procurement Officer R\'e9gine Lucas called collaboration the 'magic snowball effect' because it inspires others to join in with their own ambitious commitments.<nl/> Collaboration was a fitting theme for that event, where BSR and CDP announced our new partnership focusing on building supply chain resilience.<nl/> In another part of Paris, at Le Bourget, Cramer spoke at an event on short-lived climate pollutants that BSR hosted with the UNEP-Climate and Clean Air Coalition. There, too, the theme of collaboration was central: If all sectors take immediate action on short-lived climate pollutants, the probability of remaining below 2\'b0C increases by 50 percent.<nl/> Now, the final and most important chapter of the collaboration story is on policy. As negotiators enter their second week of discussions, we hope they follow our advice and engage in radical collaboration that results in an ambitious Paris Agreement at the end of this week.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/>More businesses and investors than ever are committing to a clean, vibrant, low-carbon economy. Developing countries are legitimately asking for equitable finance for sustainable development but it will also require far larger investment from all financial institutions globally.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA295","ESA hosts panel on COP21 conference","January 28, 2016 Thursday","Daily Trojan: University of Southern California","In an effort to spread awareness on environmental issues and current attempts to address them by talking about the recent climate summit COP21, the Environmental Student Assembly hosted USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Steven Lamy, Shannon Gibson, a professor in international relations, and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute Global Director Bonnie Reiss Thursday afternoon.The talks began with background about COP21 and the concept of global warming as a whole. Held in Paris shortly after the November terrorist attacks, COP21 addressed the issue of climate change and how different countries and communities could reduce carbon emissions. It was the 21st of a series of meetings following the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on climate control and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Talks at the summit centered around not letting the average global temperature rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius and countries constructing goals for lowering greenhouse gas emissions.After explaining the purpose of the meeting, the speakers delved into the implications concerning the standards that each country set up in order to decrease carbon emissions.""This is like Weight Watchers, people come in and make promises but the enforcement mechanism is not there,"" Lamy said. ""There is going to be smaller countries that will be leaders in reducing carbon emissions like Sweden or Norway.""Lamy explained that more skeptical countries like Russia could look to these ""leader"" countries to mold their policies, reducing emissions yet boosting their economies.Reiss echoed this sentiment by saying the lack of global enforcement to hold these countries accountable poses a challenge for the world.""The problem seems to be that there is no enforcing programs that will make these 'intended commitments' come true,"" Reiss said. ""This issue is still in the hands of nation states. We have not yet decided on a system of global governance.""She followed this up by stating that the consumer has the most power by choosing to support or not support corporations that aren't environmentally friendly.""Individuals should divest from companies that contribute lots of emissions,"" Reiss said.She then transitioned into her talks about how spreading environmental awareness should begin on a microscale. She stated that despite its difficulty, it's important that the U.S. effectively convey the severity of the issue to its citizens.""In a country like the United States, anything complicated is avoided,"" Reiss said. ""We need to communicate in a way that is more relevant to people and voters.""Gibson added to this argument by stating that students should be critical consumers, buying products based on background research and figuring out how much of an impact it actually makes on the environment. She talked about how green symbols on many big company products are actually industry markings that have low standards and mean next to nothing.Reiss brought it back to the USC students by urging the those in attendance to be smart consumers.""The kind of transition it's going to take for a low-carbon system is going to be huge,"" Reiss said. ""But it begins with your generation - you guys.""\l"

The Agency showed how to achieve an early peak in emissions as one of four key pillars that it believes are needed to make the upcoming UN climate talks a success, from an energy perspective.The world is at a critical juncture in its efforts to combat climate change, with momentum building towards the 21st UN Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015. World greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from energy production and use are double the level of all other sources combined, meaning that action to combat climate change must come first and foremost from the energy sector. The IEA proposes that the following four key pillars are needed to make COP21 a success, from an energy perspective:1. Peak in emissions \- set the conditions to achieve an early peak in globalenergy-related emissions.2. Five-year revision \- review national climate targets regularly, to test the scope to raise ambition.3. Lock in the vision \- translate the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal.4. Track the transition \- establish a process for tracking achievements inthe energy sector.""As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence,"" said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. ""It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept.""A peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 if governments implement just five key policy measures, as shown in the IEA\' s  Bridge Scenario . This major climate milestone is possible utilising only proven technologies and policies, and without changing the economic and development prospects of any region. Intended as an effective bridge to further action, the five measures focus on: Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors Reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030 Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas productionFor countries that have submitted climate pledges for COP21, the proposed strategy identifies possible areas for over-achievement.

Khosla. ""We are committed to conducting cutting-edge research and disseminating our knowledge to improve our world.""The 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) will be held from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 and negotiators are hopeful that the accord will yield a binding agreement among countries to meet targets for reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases. ""Our role in these climate conferences is to bring science into the conversation as much as possible so that the strategies that may become national policies have the best chance to be effective in mitigating the changes in nature that human activities have precipitated,"" said Margaret Leinen, the director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and the head of the UC Revelle delegation.At COP21The side event is one of hundreds of UNFCCC-sanctioned events that take place at the COP21 venue, Le Bourget. Side events are intended to be platforms for NGOs to brief negotiators on myriad aspects of the climate change issue.David Victor, a professor of international relations at UC San Diego's School of Global Policy and Strategy and director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation, will also attend the Paris talks. Victor said that his observations of early COP meetings led him to believe they would lead inevitably to inaction, a process he described in his 2011 book Global Warming Gridlock: Creating More Effective Strategies for Protecting the Planet.""That's what we've seen all the way through the Copenhagen conference (COP15) in 2009,"" said Victor. ""When that conference ended in failure, it also opened a space for countries to try new strategies and ideas. That included a larger role for ""bottom up"" approaches in which countries would set their own policies - giving them flexibility to tailor their contributions to what they were willing and able to do at home. For years I have thought that kind of approach would be more effective, and in Paris, we will see it on display. So that's why I am going - to see how countries grapple with this new system and because I think, finally, it will have an impact.""In all, more than 30 researchers and students from throughout the University of California system are expected to attend .Additionally Scripps Oceanography climate and atmospheric scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan will take part in several events at COP21 related to a June 2015 encyclical from Pope Francis, Laudato Si, that calls on Catholics to understand the importance of environmental protection as an social justice objective. Ramanathan, a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences since 2004, played a pivotal role in the creation of the encyclical. In May 2014, he organized a historic joint workshop of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and made a personal appeal to the pope to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on society, especially on the world's poor.Ramanathan will also participate in panel discussions hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a union of 46 countries, the European Union, and UNEP formed in 2012 largely to address pollutants that pose a dual problem of accelerating global warming and posing a hazard to public health.For students attending COP21, the event is an opportunity to observe how their science is translated to diplomacy and public policy arenas. Scripps Oceanography will co-host exhibits at which students and researchers can directly engage with other conference participants.""You could not find a better target audience,"" said Yassir Eddebbar, a fifth-year PhD candidate in oceanography at Scripps. ""While working at the Scripps booth, you can interact with delegates from dozens of countries within a couple hours. The gap in awareness of ocean topics in these meetings is concerning, and highlights the importance of the presence of ocean scientists in these conferences.""""I'm also excited for the opportunity to interact with people from all around the world and get to learn more about the wide variety of issues that are being faced in connection to climate change, many of which may not be as obvious,"" said Mariela Brooks, another PhD candidate in oceanography at Scripps.The UC San Diego delegation will be presenting news throughout COP21 via its website and several social media channels.

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA308","ABB leaders at COP21 to promote renewables, microgrids and energy efficiency","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","US Official News","Zurich: Asea Brown Boveri has issued the following news release: ABB\' s innovative electric bus charging technology was one of the highlights of a show of sustainable transport systems around the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where world leaders are meeting to seek a global agreement to tackle climate change. At separate events in the French capital, ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer and Bazmi Husain, Country Managing Director in India and incoming Chief Technology Officer, said a sustainable energy supply could be created by shifting to renewable power and using energy more efficiently, provided supportive policy was in place. In the \' blue zone\' , where world leaders are deliberating under tight security, Spiesshofer told a high-profile audience on Dec. 7 that expanding wind and solar power generation capacity was insufficient on its own. To ensure the reliability of our energy supply, the growth of renewable generation must go hand-in-hand with investment in technology to integrate their intermittent output into the grid. Spiesshofer also encouraged the faster deployment of low-carbon microgrids to bring clean energy to the millions of people without electricity. ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer (left) speaking at COP21 in Paris Access and resilience  We need to lower carbon emissions, but we also need to ensure that this is done in way that expands access to energy, and at the same time increases the resilience of the power grid, Spiesshofer said.  The task is a vast one, which is why the private and public sector must collaborate closely to bring this vision to reality. The CEO was speaking at the invitation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) after ABB joined its Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative a year ago. ABB is supporting an SE4ALL project to help developing and emerging economies transition their markets to energy-efficient products through an integrated policy approach. ABB's incoming CTO, Bazmi Husain (right) speaking at the World Climate Summit forum Innovation and leadership A day earlier, Husain had spoken at the World Climate Summit, a business, finance and government forum running alongside the negotiations of the 2015 climate conference, known officially as  COP 21 . He was part of a panel looking at the innovation and leadership required to reach the internationally agreed goal of keeping global warming below 2&deg;C. Husain highlighted the unique opportunity available to emerging markets such as India to leapfrog traditional power technologies. These markets could bring clean power to off-grid communities by giving them low-carbon microgrids - small networks powered by renewable energy - rather than by investing heavily in expanding their traditional transmission grid. The role of policy But the panelists disagreed on the importance of governments\' role in driving the low-carbon transition.  Get the largest companies together and there\' s nothing we can\' t do, said Paul Dickinson, Executive Chairman of the Carbon Disclosure Project, which has persuaded 800 large companies to factor the cost of carbon into their activities and says this is resulting in a change in their behavior on capital expenditure.  The private sector needs certainty, and the hesitation of governments is damaging, said Felipe Calderon, Chairman of New Climate Economy, an initiative to analyze the economic benefits and costs of acting on climate change. Government action could trigger trillions of dollars of investment, he added. This view was endorsed by Sir David King, a British government advisor, who noted that the low-carbon sector was the fastest growing industry in Britain. Its expansion rate was 30 percent over the past five years, and government policy had been the driver, he added. The technology exists\'   Most of the technology needed for sustainable development exists today, Husain said in his concluding remarks,  but if we are looking for people to adopt it without policy help, it will not work. Policy is a must, as it will be some time before many of the technologies are economically feasible. On Dec. 7, Husain represented ABB at a meeting of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in Paris. Through the WBCSD\' s Low Carbon Technology Partnerships initiative (LTCPi), ABB has been collaborating with customers and competitors on proposals to scale up and develop low-carbon technologies. Over the past year, ABB experts for energy efficient motors and distribution transformers have contributed to the creation of models to quantify the potential energy, financial and CO2 savings on a country and regional level. This work is an important basis for SE4ALL\' s next steps of proposing ambition levels for new performance standards and of persuading governments to adopt them.

More than 150 solar exhibitors will interact with innovators, project developers, and buyers to experience the latest solar innovations, learn about solar trends, and network with solar experts at the WFES conference.Morocco's signature solar project is Noor, which is set to be the world's largest concentrated solar power plant in the world, with a capacity of more than 500 megawatts and set to power 1.1 million homes by 2018, according to the World Bank.Supporting Morocco's renewables, the World Bank has joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, BMCE Ban, and Clean Technology Fund in investing in solar plants and wind farms in Morocco. Morocco will also host COP 22 in 2016.Masdar and the Moroccan government recently announced a partnership to install solar home systems in more than 17,000 homes in rural Morocco. Furthermore, Masdar recently announced that Morocco is one of three key markets in the Middle East and North Africa for renewable energy investment over the next 10 years.WFES 2016, hosted by Masdar, will be co-located with the International Water Summit and EcoWASTE at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre from 18-21 January 2016.\l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA311","COP21 Gets Underway in Paris","December 1, 2015 Tuesday 9:41 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Coal Association issued the following news release:The COP21 climate negotiations opened yesterday morning in Paris, with the much-expected Leaders' Day. Great expectations would be perhaps a good way to summarise the mood in the room La Seine in Le Bourget. With a list of 150 leaders, including heads of state and government, we heard encouraging messages for negotiators in an effort to set the political momentum for the summit to be a success.Leaders have made calls for an ambitious and successful outcome at COP21, highlighting the COP as a turning point. President Hollande of France, followed by other European and developed countries, have pointed out the need for a universal, differentiated and legally binding agreement. Developing countries have emphasised the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the need for flexibilities in a balanced and fair agreement.Several recurring themes were mentioned such as the universal scope of the agreement, it's legally binding nature, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and technology transfer, amongst others. Climate finance has been called many times a crucial element for a successful agreement and pledges for increasing funds have been made. However, it is still very early to say if the pledges that have started today will meet the previous Cancun commitment of reaching USD 100 billion and if the Paris negotiations will provide the additional and new funds required to support mitigation and adaptation purposes.Technology transfer and intensifying innovation, research and development of clean technologies were also mentioned many times. Leaders called for support for developing countries, especially the poorest and more vulnerable, in their efforts to achieve sustainable development through access to and transfer of technology. Many countries including the USA, China, Russia and Germany have pledged to increased efforts and funds for innovation, research and development and have also mentioned the role of business in those efforts.All those pledges and announcements are positive signs, particularly when many developing countries have noted their reliance on receiving the appropriate financial and technical support in their intended nationally determined contributions (INDC).For those countries that need to use coal to meet energy demand and other development needs, it is important to receive the necessary support for investing in cleaner technologies, such as high efficiency low emission coal technologies and carbon capture and storage. Those technologies will be instrumental in achieving their mitigation commitments, while increasing access to energy for their population and using that energy for economic growth and development.The leaders have generated a sense of optimism and it seems we can expect a Paris agreement based on the INDCs. Whether the text will be a substantial and ambitious way forward, providing countries with the necessary tools to make their INDC a reality, including those who have identified a role for low emission coal technologies, will only be seen at the end of the negotiations. It will be an interesting two weeks ahead.[Category: Energy]Copyright Targeted News ServicesAutoTriage17jl 151202 30TacordaCheng-5370442 30TacordaCheng\l"
"COP21","USA","COP21_USA312","How the Paris Agreement Could Impact Your Energy Bills \u8211  January 2016","February 1, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Houston: Direct Energy has issued the follwoing news release: Since the United Nations 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) Paris Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015, energy consumers have been watching for signs of price changes and hearing information on how the agreement will affect their energy bills. But because the agreement is part of a much longer process playing out on both political and market stages, the resulting higher prices haven\' t actually appeared. Indeed, there are still scenes to be played and players to be heard before Paris Agreement (COP21) takes effect in 2020. As this process unfolds, our monthly Paris Climate Conference series will discuss the facts and trends to help you understand how these developments will impact your world and daily life. Let\' s briefly review the core aspects of the Paris Agreement:Goals: Limit greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2), in order to hold  the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2KC above pre-industrial levels and limit global  temperature increase to 1.5KC above pre-industrial levels.  Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production. Provide funding ($100 billion) to assist emerging and developing countries create  a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development. Emissions: As part of the Paris Agreement, participants had to submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for reducing emissions for the post-2020 period. As of December 15, 187 countries representing 98% of global population had submitted plans. Canada intends to achieve an economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 levels by 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. Agreement Status: The agreement is not binding. There are no penalties for not complying, but there are binding rules to participate. The agreement won\' t be officially signed until April 22, 2016 and won\' t take effect until 2020. Time frame: In 2018, all parties to the agreement will reconvene to discuss ways to further reduce emissions. In 2023, all parties will present their updated NDC\' s to further reduce emissions, and these will be updated every five years until 2030. Business Thought Leaders\' ThoughtsWhen COP21COP21. The WEF\' s own survey of 750 people from business, academia, civil society, and the public sector found that developed world business leaders were primarily concerned with energy shocks, cyber attacks, and unemployment. The Annual Global Price Waterhouse Cooper CEO Business Survey also conducted at the forum found similar results with 1,300 global business leaders, showing that over-regulation was thought the biggest threat to business  especially among North American CEOs, followed by geopolitical uncertainty and cyber attacks. Those in the power sector (worldwide) shared the over-regulation concern  but 81% said new battery and power technologies could transform their industry. The important point here is that new power technologies have been moving away from utilizing fossil fuels for decades and are almost now entirely focused on cleaner, green energy: solar in particular. Solar panel prices have fallen by 70% since 2009, making residential installation more and more affordable. Essentially, technology now lets you control your own home\' s power generation and usage with your iPhone. And it\' s getting cheaper to do it. Many US utilities understand the real market potential behind changing energy technology. The thinking goes like this: since consumers want the cleaner power technology, there\' s more money to be made selling the stuff to them rather than fighting them and losing their green dollars to someone else. During a recent National Press Club panel on the impact of the Paris Agreement on US utilities, Joe Garcia, former Chairman of the Florida Public Service Commission, explained consumers want the benefits that come with new power technologies,  It isn\' t that regulation got us what we\' ve got. It\' s that the market has created this tremendous opportunity. Large institutions like electric companies don\' t change course overnight, though it does sound like a metamorphosis of power utility structure is happening&hellip;ish. While new fields of opportunity are opening up, old methods of operating are showing their long-concealed high-costs. In the next installment of the Paris Climate Conference series, we\' ll look at where the planned NDC programs for Canada and the United States intend to reduce emissions and where those programs are in their development.

Meteorologists, environmentalists and climate change experts have been warning for four decades regarding the hazards of ozone depletion owing to green house gas emissions and the resultant global warming consequential droughts, inclement weather and natural catastrophes. It was not till 1995 that the first Conference of Parties (COP) was held and another three years elapsed before the Kyoto Protocol was adopted at COP3, a nonbinding agreement by 192 parties to lower greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Eight years later, at COP11 the Montreal Action Plan was generated to ""extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol beyond its 2012 expiration date and negotiate deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions"". Set in this backdrop, COP21 assumes great importance since this year leaders of 150 nations, along with 40,000 delegates from 195 countries, attended the conference of parties for climate talks to adopt major steps towards setting up legally binding mechanisms which will keep the world at bay from crossing the 2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise barrier. Some previous conference of parties ended in a fiasco because the major industrialised nations refused to abide by the rules and take cognitive steps for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example the 2009 Copenhagen COP15 is deemed a failure for it concluded without reaching any agreement. COP21 held greater promise because of the dynamic participation of the Chinese President, who has been actively canvassing for reining in this peril to nature and humanity. In 2014, President Xi Jinping took the bold step of signing a joint statement with the United States on climate change sending strong political signals to the world through its solemn promises demonstrating its determination to take a green, low-carbon and sustainable development path. So far, China has signed a series of bilateral statements on climate change with India, Brazil, the European Union (EU), the United States, France and others, and submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2015 the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which details China's own contribution to combating climate change for the sake of all mankind. China itself has also included the fight against climate change in its 13th Five Years Plan for national socioeconomic development in the 2016-2020 period, which demonstrates its serious commitment to support the protection of the environment and its attitude towards climate change. China also supports a comprehensive review every five years of the progress made towards the achievement of the approved long-term objectives, which also demonstrates China's capability for and confidence in meeting its commitments. President Xi believes that an active engagement in the fight against climate change is not only the duty from which ""a responsible major country"" cannot evade, but is also in l"

Whether just a modern day delusion or not, virtually all political leaders now buy into the idea of man-made warming, and most of them seem willing to do something about it.<nl/><nl/>The question, as always, is what should be done. We have long taken the above view: the truth or not of climate change is not the important point. Politics is about what people believe, not the truth. Thus we've been advocating a carbon tax on the grounds that we know they're going to do something so we might as well tell everyone to do what will cure the problem, if it exists, at least cost. Usefully, it's also what every economist looking at the problem has also said, from Stern through Nordhaus to Tol.<nl/> However, there's an implication of that:<nl/><nl/>Much fiercer carbon taxes are coming, driving huge change not just in energy consumption and production, but in all the myriad industries that depend on hydro-carbons, from plastics to automotive, metal bashing and even many service activities, which can be surprisingly energy intensive.<nl/><nl/>That's actually not true, not here in the UK at least. Because we largely already have a carbon tax. It's not distributed correctly, this is true (too much on petrol, not enough on farming) but overall we're already coughing up about the 'correct' amount as calculated by Stern (and more than Nordhaus or Tol would suggest for today). The combination of the fuel duty escalator, the EU's cap and trade, the minimum carbon price and so on, while they're not quite exactly the way it should all be done, do have roughly the right effect and size. According to Stern's numbers the UK should be paying something like \£330 billion a year in carbon tax given the roughly 500 million tonnes CO2 a year. We're already paying that much when you tot everything up so we're done.<nl/> Yes, it's entirely true that some other people might have a lot of work to do to meet whatever is agreed in Paris. But as far as the UK is concerned we're done, we've already put the correct and recommended policies into place. We've nothing else that we need to do except perhaps a little tinkering here and there. There's most certainly no justification for significant rises in the general tax level, whatever COP21 agrees. Not that that's what we'll be told of course .<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/12022838/Higher-carbon-taxes-are-coming-get-used-to-it.htmlhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/12022838/Higher-carbon-taxes-are-coming-get-used-to-it.html \l"
"COP21","USA","COP21_USA319","Fossil Free freshmen respond to criticism of civil disobedience","October 27, 2015 Tuesday","The Stanford Daily: Stanford University","Last Monday, a fellow freshman posted a piece criticizing Fossil Free Stanford's pressure on the University to divest from fossil fuels. He expressed his fear with regard to our recent pledge for civil disobedience, in which 114 students have committed to civil disobedience if the University doesn't divest before the COP21 negotiations at the end of November, because he didn't want to be ""signing a pledge before [he] even [knew] what [he'd be] doing."" As new members of Fossil Free Stanford, we want to recognize his concern as reasonable, and do our best to replace it with knowledge and understanding of what we are trying to do.On the logistical side, we want to clarify that while the specific logistics of the planned civil disobedience are not public, they will be shared with individuals who sign the pledge to join us. Signing the pledge does not, of course, commit them in any way to participating if these details make them uncomfortable. Additionally, we fully acknowledge that there are risks inherent in nonviolent civil disobedience. We have lawyers directly involved in the planning of our action, and will host mandatory trainings on legal risks and expected behavior in the run-up. Please see our website for more questions: fossilfreestanford.org.In response to questions of rashness, it's important to note that long before we arrived and joined the team, FFS had been working intensively with Stanford's Administration (for three years).In the seven days before launching our pledge for civil disobedience, for example, members of our team met with the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing, with whom they've met regularly, and the Office of the President, and had a letter read aloud to the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Board of Trustees. In that same time period, a firm but civil letter was delivered to the every member of the Board of Trustees by our ASSU President and Vice President, John-Lancaster Finley and Brandon Hill, in coordination with FFS. Additionally, both the ASSU Senate and the Graduate Student Council have passed resolutions calling for full fossil fuel divestment.And we in FFS are committed to continuing to build our relationships with the administration moving forward. As our campaign has grown in numbers and determination, we have seen administrators become increasingly interested in talking about solutions. But there's really only time for a couple more weeks of talk, not a couple more years. After three years of work, our Board of Trustees continues to maintain a vested interest in the success of fossil fuel companies, companies which have understood the consequences of their product for 40 years and have buried the truth beneath irresponsible lies.Therefore in protest we've turned to civil disobedience - because time is running out.Three years is a long time for an administration to discuss something this urgent without coming to a decision. The United Nations Climate Change Conference starts on Noc. 29, and the U.N. has declared it the ""last chance to adopt a global agreement that makes it possible to secure a safe climate."" We cannot allow Stanford's Board of Trustees to deliberate any longer. It is imperative now, more than it ever has been, to definitively announce that U.S. civil society does not see a future for fossil fuels. The strongest statement that Stanford can make is to pull financial support for this destructive, distortionary industry.The fossil fuel industry has controlled the political space around climate discussions for decades, while the impacts of fossil fuel combustion have approached dangerous levels. The harm caused will and already does affect communities disproportionately. These effects are today being felt much more immediately and severely by communities of color and low-income communities already facing other injustices like systemic racism and profiling. By divesting from companies that contribute to climate change, Stanford can refuse to support further oppression of these communities and encourage the U.S. negotiators heading to Paris to do the same by supporting a robust international climate agreement.Authors Beck Goodloe, Sadie Cwikiel, Sarah Ribeiro-Broomhead, Luke Miller, Sarah Vernallis, Hallie Dunham, Aitan Grossman, Emily Lemmerman, and Natalie Baker are all freshmen (Class of 2019) members of Fossil Free Stanford.While you're here...We're a student-run organization committed to providing hands-on experience in journalism, digital media and business for the next generation of reporters.

The foundation of this Paris Agreement are the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by countries in the lead-up to COP21. Countries must be supported in the implementation of their INDCs, which for many include a role for low emission coal technologies, such as high efficiency low emissions coal and carbon capture and storage. With the commitments countries made going into COP21, the International Energy Agency said electricity generation from coal would grow by 24% by 2040. We welcome the renewed commitment to climate finance and call on the various finance, technology and capacity building mechanisms to support countries implement all aspects of their INDCs. The increased ambition of this agreement also underscores the need to speed up efforts to deploy carbon capture and storage. We call on governments to move quickly to support increased investment in CCS and through providing policy parity for CCS alongside other low emission technologies.For media enquiries, please contact HYPERLINK mailto:media@worldcoal.orgmedia@worldcoal.org HYPERLINK mailto:wca@cnc-communications.comwca@cnc-communications.com[Category: Energy]Copyright Targeted News ServicesAutoTriage6yd 151214 30VitinMar-5382751 30VitinMarLoad-Date:\~December 14, 2015\l"

"COP21","USA","COP21_USA328","5 things you need to know about COP21","October 30, 2015 Friday 2:49 PM EST","CNN.com","Today marks one month until world leaders converge in Paris for COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. Here are five things you should know as we head toward this critical event.What is COP21COP stands for Conference of Parties, an annual meeting of all nations that make up the United Nations Framework on Climate Change -- 195 nations in total. This is the 21st meeting (thus COP21), with the first occurring in Berlin in 1995.The purpose of the meetings is to continually assess the nations' progress in dealing with climate change and, every so often, negotiate agreements and set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that are the primary drivers of climate change. Previous memorable meetings include COP3 in Kyoto, Japan, which brought about the Kyoto Protocol; COP11, which generated the Montreal Action Plan; and COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, which was largely deemed a failure because a binding agreement wasn't reached.What is the goal of the 2015 conference?The goal for Paris in December is pretty clear-cut: to achieve a legally binding agreement, with universal participation among all nations, to keep global warming below what most scientists say is the critical threshold of 2 degrees Celsius of warming. (This refers to the increase in globally averaged temperature since the Industrial Revolution.)This will not be an easy goal to reach, since the planet already has been warmed by 0.85 degrees Celsius since 1880, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2014, and many scientists say the gases we have already emitted into the atmosphere will ""lock us in"" to around 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Therefore, it will take significant reductions in emissions in the near future, especially from the largest emitters such as the United States and China, as well as commitments to sustainable development from all countries, which must be financed by the developed (i.e., rich) nations.Who will be there?With more than 40,000 delegates from 195 countries all over the world, it's a huge meeting. In fact, this is the largest conference the French government has ever organized. The host country's President, Francois Hollande will welcome many major world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leaders of three countries with the largest carbon emissions.Many national leaders will be present for the beginning of COP21, which will hopefully kick off the negotiations with some political momentum. This is a stark change from COP15 in Copenhagen, when the heads of state, including Obama, came in for the last two days of negotiations. This resulted in slow negotiations until the end and talks that ultimately stalled and left the delegates frustrated and embarrassed.It is not clear if Pope Francis will attend the Paris climate conference. The Pope has been a very vocal leader for climate activism and the battle against climate change, and his encyclical, which was released in June, was widely seen as a call for action to put pressure on delegates at COP21 to come up with an agreement.What is necessary for it to be a success?Since the goal is very clear for COP21, it is necessary for the nations to unanimously adopt a legally binding agreement that will reduce global carbon emissions and aim to keep warming below the 2-degree threshold. Anything resembling Copenhagen in 2009, where some limits to greenhouse gases were agreed upon but no treaty was ultimately signed, would be deemed a failure. The limits that were put in place in the Kyoto Protocol will run out in 2020, so it is imperative that the attendees leave Paris with a new agreement to begin in 2020 and enable long-term change beyond that.The negotiations in Paris will not just focus on national commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, but will also have a financial aspect, which could prove to be a sticking point. Previous meetings have established a $100 billion-per-year commitment, starting in 2020, from developed countries to help developing countries combat climate change and build through sustainable development. Where this money comes from will be a major negotiating point -- how much from public vs. private sources? What role will businesses play? Answering these financial questions will be crucial to the success or failure of the Paris talks.Why is it important to me?Assuming you plan on living on this planet for the next few decades, as opposed to joining the Mars One colonization project, you will be affected by climate change and should care about the outcome of the Paris climate conference, as it will be critical in framing the international response to man-made climate change.A warming climate will lead to more frequent and extreme heat waves, droughts and flash floods. In addition to extreme weather, melting glaciers and ice sheets are raising sea levels, which will continue and affect the lives of hundreds of millions of coastal residents worldwide. Other effects such as water scarcity and changes in food supply will also accompany climate change and, like most of the other effects, will hit the developing world disproportionately.So even as the holiday season is in full swing next month, take a minute from your shopping and keep an eye on the proceedings in Paris, as the fate of the world as we know it could be at stake. \l"

""Climate refugees will become a new challenge - if we do not act swiftly.""Calling on the European Union and its international partners to be more ambitious about climate protection, Juncker warned that ""the EU will not sign just any deal"" at the United Nations (COP21), scheduled to be held in Paris in December.The COP21Climate change marked by longer-lasting droughts, more violent storms and rising sea levels is worsening the living conditions of hundreds of millions. Particularly in the poorest countries, climate change has the effect of forcing people who are unable to adapt to leave their homes.In the Sahelian countries, Bangladesh and in the South Pacific people have already had to flee because of climate impacts.According to Jan Kowalzig from Oxfam, ""climate change is already causing a lot of damage in the global South. It could ruin all progress which has been made in the fight against global poverty over the last decades.""However, it is the relationship between climate change and the refugee phenomenon that is attracting the attention of many experts.Earlier this year, a study by a research team from Columbia University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) held global warming partly responsible for the civil war in Syria.The study noted that between 2006 and 2010, Syria faced the ""worst drought in the instrumental record"", leading to crop failures and mass migration within the country. According to climate models, this drought would have been highly improbable without climate change.""For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest,"" the study concluded. The number of refugees entering Europe this year is the highest on record and Syrians are by far the largest group - an estimated nine million Syrians have left their homes so far.Besides the Syrian crisis, the United Nations warns that, worldwide, climate change could increase the number of refugees dramatically.Srgjan Kerim, president of the United Nations General Assembly, has estimated that global warming could cause up to 200 million refugees until 2050. ""Tomorrow we will have climate refugees and we have to know that,"" Juncker told the European Parliament.Oxfam's Kowalzig explains what needs to be included in a climate treaty to mitigate a potential refugee crisis: ""Climate change expels people from their homes and this is where a potential climate treaty in Paris comes in: first, we need to cut emissions and keep global warming below two degrees; secondly, people in poor countries need support to adapt to climate change; and thirdly, a climate treaty in Paris has to lay down rules for damages and losses caused by global warming where adaption is not possible.""In his speech in Strasbourg, Juncker also admitted that the European Union ""is probably not doing enough"" to tackle climate change. The EU has announced greenhouse gas emission cuts of 40 percent by 2030 as part of its 'Intended Nationally Determined Contribution' (INDC).INDCs are the commitments every country is supposed to announce before the climate conference in Paris.However, because a treaty in Paris based on the INDCs will not be enough to keep global warming below 2oC, many organisations and countries from the global South are demanding a five-yearly ""review and improve"" process to make climate commitments more ambitious over time.Any agreement reached in Paris should at least offer a perspective for effective climate protection and this depends heavily on the process of creating a regular built-in review that would enable countries to improve that agreement.Last week, formal negotiations ahead of COP21 in Paris were held, but while there was support for long-term goals, short-term commitments seemed to be far less popular.An agreement in Paris with short-term commitments and five-year cycles without a concrete long-term goal might not be perfect. It would lack a perspective beyond 2030, but it would enhance climate protection and greenhouse gas reduction in the next 15 years.On the other hand, an agreement with an ambitious long-term goal but no effective short-term measures would allow countries to fall far behind with their greenhouse gas reductions and many would just not be able to catch up after 2030.Edited by Phil Harris\~\~\~\l"

They also might negotiate new agreements or set goals aimed at cutting emissions in the future.Here's a sampling of unique language surrounding COP21. See if you can figure it out. It's from a document about workflow -- and be warned -- it may give you a headache:""... the ADP shall hold its first session of 2016 in conjunction with the first sessions of the SBSTA and the SBI in 2016 to organize its work on the implementation of the work programme referred to in paragraphs 7--9 above and to prepare draft decisions to be recommended by the COP to the CMA for consideration and adoption at its first session; ...""It brings to mind a more familiar acronym: WTF.I'm wondering who ADP is.

This Call echoes the recommendations formulated by representatives of the scientific community and civil society through a day of discussions organized by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and the Ocean and Climate Platform at UNESCO Headquarters.The Day was opened by UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova in the presence, notably, of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, the United Nations and UN-Oceans representative Miguel Serpa Soares, and the Director of the French National Museum of Natural History and representative of the Ocean and Climate Platform, Gilles Boeuf. The workshops, round tables, UNESCO Campus open to students and exhibitions that set the pace of the Day were designed to highlight the ocean's essential role in climate processes. Yet international climate negotiations have not paid nearly enough attention to it.""It is imperative that we improve our understanding of the link between ocean and climate, and that we raise awareness regarding what we already know"" declared the Director-General of UNESCO, recalling the launch of the Ocean & Climate Platform at UNESCO a year ago ""to share scientific knowledge with negotiators and the general public"".""There can be no sustainable development without a living ocean. Any attempt to reach a climate agreement must take the ocean's role into account in order to succeed"" further highlighted Irina Bokova.""The COP [United Nations ] in Paris must help to accelerate public awareness because the ocean is part of the solution. It is a critical ally in the fight against climate change"" stressed Laurent Fabius, who pledged that a day would be dedicated to the ocean during COP21. The Day concluded with a Call aiming to mobilize the Member States and raise the awareness climate negotiations stakeholders. The signatories (members of the Ocean and Climate Platform comprising NGOs, private sector representatives, scientific institutions and IOC-UNESCO) stressed the importance of protected and functioning marine ecosystems in view of the services they provide, such as their natural capacity to capture CO2. Additionally, their role as ""lung"" of the planet is as important as forests'.The Call also pleas for an integration of sustainable marine biodiversity management projects into climate finance mechanisms. The need to support scientific research, as a means to expand our understanding of climate processes and thus improve political action is another component. It will be presented to Member States during COP21 in December 2015, together with a set of recommendations to include the ocean in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.It was read by Sandra Bessudo, the Columbian High Presidential Counselor for Environmental Management, Biodiversity, Water & Climate Change, to the attendees of the closing ceremony, notably HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco, Tommy Remengesau, President of Palau, Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister of Barbados, and Danny Faure, Vice-president of the Seychelles.Everyone is invited to give the ocean a voice by signing the Call on change.org/oceanforclimate (#OceanForClimate), thus joining forces with the scientists, skippers, and associations that will champion this vital call for the planet's future during climate negotiations.About the Ocean and Climate PlatformThe Ocean and Climate Platform stems from an alliance of non-governmental organizations and research institutes, with the support of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. It was established in on 10 June 2014 on the occasion of World Oceans day. Today the Platform includes scientific organizations, universities, research institutions, non-profit associations, foundations, science centers, public institutions and business organizations, all acting to bring the ocean to the forefront in climate discussions.Media Contact:- Agncs Bardon, UNESCO Press Service, +33 (0) 1 45 68 17 64, a.bardon(at)unesco.orgMore information:- Call of the Ocean for the Climate HYPERLINK http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7NpEcZN6K2Zxks6T3Od7UHh8ZbthIxLumUxh0Zus&b=5http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7NpEcZN6K2Zxks6T3Od7UHh8ZbthIxLumUxh0Zus&b=5- Brochure on World Oceans Day (pdf) HYPERLINK http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8stRssdFId9xhaGBumMzcx%2FAyEGN2K%2BN0MVq79hc2w5Ol61qKFajjD0yjlIEY4DEzwA%3D%3D&b=5http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8stRssdFId9xhaGBumMzcx%2FAyEGN2K%2BN0MVq79hc2w5Ol61qKFajjD0yjlIEY4DEzwA%3D%3D&b=5- Event website HYPERLINK http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7MBJcYF3aStyicTdxuciEG91ZfF%2FJwboqQpgmsb7rRqXVvW4RhvjitMTqmw0wzXrQMyXtEuzpxgMqMTjm9pLluCH25akJs3O%2BNsBcpLSle3fqXRmv9%2F%2FCuJF7xKFDyUiy8PcQ4zfHU%2FTrYwZF2UGGpG%2Flysk9WOsDu9Td6%2BL%2F1%2FT3e3n&b=5http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7MBJcYF3aStyicTdxuciEG91ZfF%2FJwboqQpgmsb7rRqXVvW4RhvjitMTqmw0wzXrQMyXtEuzpxgMqMTjm9pLluCH25akJs3O%2BNsBcpLSle3fqXRmv9%2F%2FCuJF7xKFDyUiy8PcQ4zfHU%2FTrYwZF2UGGpG%2Flysk9WOsDu9Td6%2BL%2F1%2FT3e3n&b=5- Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC-UNESCO) HYPERLINK http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7MBJcYF3aStyicTdxuciEG91ZepwNgD5p0kon8D8vAfbQ%2FT%2BVRHzit0eqyA51XY%3D&b=5http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7MBJcYF3aStyicTdxuciEG91ZepwNgD5p0kon8D8vAfbQ%2FT%2BVRHzit0eqyA51XY%3D&b=5- Ocean and Climate Platform HYPERLINK http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7NpEcZN6K2Zxks6T3Od7UHh8ZQ%3D%3D&b=5http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=9%2BU8sM1%2B7NpEcZN6K2Zxks6T3Od7UHh8ZQ%3D%3D&b=5Copyright Targeted News Services18EstebanLiz 150609 30FurigayJane-5167953 30FurigayJane\l"

Institutional investors have committed to decarbonising over $100bn of equity portfolios.<nl/> It is reasonable to assume that such voluntary initiatives will, over the course of the next decade, be accompanied by mandatory regulatory requirements as national governments seek greater transparency from investors and their agents over whether and indeed how Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) analysis is being incorporated into the portfolio construction process.<nl/> All this is occurring against the backdrop of a growing global fossil fuel divestment campaign, with over 440 institutions pledging to drop fossil fuel holdings by September 2015. The primary driver for this action comes from the risk that company reserves will become stranded as governments move to limit rising global temperatures.<nl/> 2014 also saw the United States and China, the world's largest polluters and economies, agree an historic deal to cut their emissions, while the European Union announced that it would reduce its emissions by 40% by 2030.<nl/> Action at the national, city, state and region level is also growing rapidly. Since January 2012, the number of carbon pricing instruments already implemented or scheduled for implementation has almost doubled, jumping from 20 to 38. Moreover, the share of emissions covered by carbon pricing has increased threefold over the last decade.<nl/> As of 2015 there are now 39 national and 23 sub-national schemes putting a price on carbon. Together, carbon pricing instruments cover about half of the emissions in these jurisdictions, which translates to about 12% of global emissions.<nl/> 2015 has seen countries announce in increasing numbers their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), their pledges to limit emissions in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. As of September, 33 submissions have been received by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, reflecting 60 countries (including the European Union member states), and covering around 66% of global emissions.<nl/> Meanwhile, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has become increasingly vocal on the issue of a carbon assets becoming stranded. In September 2015 he warned that investors face 'potentially huge' losses from climate change action that could make vast reserves of oil, coal and gas 'literally unburnable'.<nl/> Perhaps the most significant event of 2015 was the introduction of 'la loi transition \'e9nerg\'e9tique pour la croissance verte' in France which has made it mandatory for institutional investors to begin disclosing the full carbon footprint of their portfolios with a view to reducing their exposure to carbon over time from 2016.

It's not only the global players with their apotheosis industrial boom, require to implement the carbon reduction policies but also the whole world needs to opt for the domestic policy framework of decarbonisation in order to keep the world safe from the disastrous future implications through their collective contribution. The COP21 meeting that held in December 2015 took the world as a whole to the sustainable path through the national pledges as Nationally Determined Contributions that settled through negotiations among states to combat the climate change. A great emphasis on energy sector extracted from COP21 was based on the four pillars, as position those factors which will achieve the preliminary energy related global releases; Secondly, to evaluate the five-year contributions that boost the ambition for climate change; Thirdly, engaging the short-term obligations to longer-term prospects to climate change and Fourthly, structure an arrangement to track the accomplishments of energy-sector. Developing states committed to an agreement to switch from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels with much of a cost bearing agreement, though 84 states participated in the protocol for a major cut off. In the protocol 55% of the states agreed for a reduction of 55% carbon emissions and this was the 55/55 target at the COP21. Largest emitters incorporate states, therefore, held several policies of reduction. Switzerland in accordance with the 2012 decree of reductions in the CO2 emissions committed to level down its emissions to the extent of 1990 level or below by limiting the emissions in energy sector, as from buildings 78%, industry 93% and transport not to overreach by 100%. To trim the greenhouse gas, targets by 2025 is 35%, whilst 50% or below to the level of 1990 by 2030. Objectives of 40% domestic reductions for European Union as according to the 2014 framework of Climate and Energy Policy, achievement of 27% renewables and energy productive goals with 40% reductions in emissions of GHG by 2030. Same as Norway in compliance to the 2015 White Paper areas of priority, Norway to minimize its GHG emissions by industry and the transport, emphasis on renewables and shipping of low-carbon. United States opted strategy for new and prevailing industries to comply with the carbon pollution norms, as reduction of about 40-45% in methane proportion from the oil and gas and to implement the fuel effective norms for the heavy-duty vehicles after the 2018. Moreover, US committed for the net reductions of 26-28% GHG releases relative to the 2005 level by 2025. According to the 2012 Climate Action, Gabon planned in reducing the 50% emissions of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and methane by 2025 and to cut down releases from the sectors of energy production and forestry. Russia opted for its 2010 energy policy till 2030 as to reduce the intensity of energy. Russia in its primary energy demand opted to use the non-fossil fuels to a wider capacity as 13-14% by 2030. Furthermore, to level down the GHG releases of 25-30% by 2030 and 15-20% by 2020 lower than 1992 level. Japan in 2015 held decisions in the cabinet and took a divergent energy planning strategy for the betterment of energy saving functioning of buildings. And through nuclear power plants, aimed to generate the electricity and to lower down the 25% GHG releases by 2020. Greater number of green house gas emissions is widely seen in Korea due to routine business activities. So Korea is narrowing down the emissions to 30% by the year 2030. China set up its five year strategic plan and developed plans for Climate Action and Energy development from year 2014 to 2020. Consumption of primary energy of 4.8 billion tones of coal and 20% by non-fossil fuels with a trim of 62% quantum of coal is targeted by 2020. India as the world's fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter marked to increase the number of renewables by 175 GW and 100 GW of solar by 2020 with accordance to the National Action plan of 2008 on Climate Change. BRICS as Brazil, Russia, India and China, these four member states were considered as the five largest CO2 emitters including the US. Brazil has now opted a ten year strategic plan of energy effective and energy expansion with aim to reduce the number of green house gases by 36% till 2020 through reductions from business. Phenomenal changes in climate are occurring across the world. In the last five decades extreme heat waves have doubled its frequency with prolonged heated days. The drastic weather conditions are turning disastrous due to human activities as by combustion by likely producing immense greenhouse gas emissions. For the last three decades, bushfire situations are occurring rapidly in densely populated regions as in many parts of Australia and Tasmania. Triple times increase in the sea levels at Sydney and projection of double the number of people deaths in Australian cities would occur due to extreme heat over the coming four decades. At the COP21 conference China agreed to the principle fact that the first world states are liable for the vulnerable situation, irreparable loss and for the long term impacts of climate change though supporting a 1.5C goal. Believing to the facts that richer states need to do more than the poorer states with finance and differentiation, it would come as a great challenge to decarbonise the systems. The structure of five-year appraisal (2016-2020) that set up as a segment of Paris Pact would make a difference, if the national pledges for the climate change are consciously followed up. So by the end of this century 2.7C or 3C warming will hopefully be reduced. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Columnists.

All the conclusions will be presented on Tuesday, the last day of this informal ministerial consultation. According to the organizer, the purpose of this pre-COP21 is not to negotiate the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP), but rather to ""provide the necessary political guidance to the ADP negotiating process and to come up with proposals for common ground on some of the key political issues that remain open"". Representatives from more than 70 countries, along with Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), have accepted the invitation of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Peruvian Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal to gether in Paris to prepare for the upcoming COP21. .

Speaking in an interview with Xinhua ahead of the 21st United Nations climate change conference (COP21 Integral to China's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which was submitted in June this year, is the country's ambition to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. In its INDC, China also announced plans to achieve the peaking of carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20 percent while increasing the forest stock volume by around 4.5 billion cubic meters compared to 2005 levels. China's 3.1 billion U.S. dollars support to a South-South cooperation fund, which will help developing countries combat climate change, is also considered a step in the right direction by Smith. ""China put quite big committee on the table,"" Smith added. ""From all the things we can see, China is determined to play leading and constructive role as the biggest developing country."" These actions come as countries from across the globe unite under the auspices of COP21, whose aim is to reach a legally binding, universal agreement on climate to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. As NGO delegate to join in the negotiation, Smith noted ""almost all countries want some kind of agreement but what they want in the agreement has yet to be determined."" Undertakings by industrialized nations to provide funds amounting to 100 billion U.S. dollars per year by 2020 to support tangible mitigation actions by developing countries have fallen short as gaps between what is being pledged and what is being delivered come to light. The issue of post-2020 financing is also topical according to Smith, as developing nations strive to industrialize without fossil fuels, a task which requires access to reliable and long-term financial sources. In light of this, she welcomed the fact that since 2005 there has been a revolution in the energy sector together with a progressive shift from a reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The WWF expert hailed that China has played an important role in bringing down costs in energy transformation technologies, and that renewable energy has become a top priority for policy makers in Beijing.

The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), not only defined a blueprint for tackling global climate change after the year of 2020, the organization of the conference itself has also fully reflected the principles of low-carbon and sustainable development. The COP21 Greenhouse gases emission is generally considered as the fundamental cause of the global warming. With an increasing worldwide environmental awareness, organizers of some major public events, such as Olympic Games, World's Fair or FIFA World Cup, usually take various measures to help to cut down the CO2 emission and thus to reduce environmental burden. The Paris climate talks was expected to generate around 21,000 tCO2e, but 9,200 tonnes has been emitted at last, said Pierre-Henri Guignard, Secretary General in charge of the COP21's preparation and organization, on Thursday. Even though this figure is still equal to the carbon footprint of about 800 French people over a one-year period, the Paris COP 21 achieved significant progress in addressing greenhouse gases emissions, with a CO2 emissions per capita much lower than many previous COPs. Implementing efficient gas boiler, distributing free public transport cards to accredited participants, 100 percent use of recycled papers, issuing reusable cups and bottles ... are all among the measures taken that contributed to the success of this green and low carbon event. In terms of waste recycling, the organizer said that 94 percent of the 16,000 tonnes of materials used in building the venues have been reused. France is also committed to offsetting these emissions by providing 100,000 euros to finance environmental projects in countries from Asia, Africa or South America, said Guignard.

China contributed about 11 percent to the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850-2011, while the US and the EU contributed 27 percent and 25 percent, respectively.Although not historic polluters, emerging countries are under increasing pressure in the global negotiations, for example India, the world's fourth-largest emitter in 2014.Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said this week, ""Historically, for the last 150 years, they have reaped the benefits of growth, and now they can't say the past is past.""I really think more empathy is needed to make the Paris deal a real landmark, when I was covering the negotiations and when I spoke with Maurice.""Common but differentiated responsibilities"", a core principle of the United Nations , remains the key solution to understanding and solving contradictions between developed and developing countries.Emerging countries also have common responsibilities for greatly reducing emissions and improving air quality because addressing climate change is common challenge, while history should be respected.Contact the writer at HYPERLINK mailto:lanlan@chinadaily.com.cnlanlan@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 12/07/2015 page3) HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/72/144945063930.jpghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/72/144945063930.jpgf04da2db112217cf192f16.jpg HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/32/144945064076.jpghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/32/144945064076.jpgf04da2db112217cf193417.jpg\l"

""Droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions are putting children at an increased risk of disease and malnutrition, as well as destroying their families' homes and livelihoods,"" said Perry in a news release issued by UNICEF. ""The worst part about this is that some of the youngest and most vulnerable citizens of our world are bearing the most unfair burden of climate change,"" she said. Perry was appointed as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2013 with a special focus on engaging young people to improve the lives of the world's most vulnerable children and adolescents. In her weather report, Perry highlighted the extreme weather patterns that are emerging across the world and forcing millions of children and families to flee their homes. According to a major report launched by UNICEF in November, over half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million live in high drought severity areas. The report also revealed that of the 530 million children in flood-prone zones, some 300 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty, surviving on less than 3.10 U.S. dollars a day; and of those living in high drought severity areas, 50 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty. UNICEF stressed that climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions, which can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. Further, the climatic activities can create a vicious circle. For example, a child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. In the exclusive weather report, Perry called on viewers to share their story on how they are helping reduce climate change as part of the #FightUNfair campaign. ""Let's encourage our world leaders to take this issue seriously,"" she said. ""Together we can help change the forecast for millions of children."" \l"

However, thanks to the joint efforts, our two countries managed to overcome difficulties and obstacles of various kinds and succeeded in advancing this relationship further.A Chinese saying goes: ""the past not forgotten is a guide for the future"". It means we must take lessons of the past as a guide for our action in the future.What can we learn from 2015 for China-US relationship? Three things come to my mind:1. Dialogue is the best way to address our differences.President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to US from Sept 22nd to 25th. It was his first state visit to US since his assumption of office. Prior to his visit, I made two trips to the US where I met a lot of American friends and discussed China-US relationship with them. They all sounded depressed and were genuinely worried about the prospect. They cited divergences on numerous questions between the two countries, such as cyber security, South China Sea, human rights, etc. American media played up these divergences. They presented Cyber security as the most contentious issue and asserted that the US was a major victim of hacker attacks ""originating from China"". The Chinese side kept denying it. The atmosphere surrounding China-US relationship was worsening. Rumors had it that the US government was considering sanctions on China for hacker attacks. People feared Xi Jinping's state visit to US may end up in failure.From Sept 9th to 12th, Mr. Meng Jianzhu, State Councilor and a member of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau, paid a surprise visit to the US, as President Xi Jinping' s special envoy. Mr. Meng met Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and National Security Advisor Susan Rice. They engaged in intensive talks on the issue of cyber security. After three days of candid and pragmatic exchanges, the two sides reached a consensus. It was incorporated in the fact sheet at the end of President Xi's state visit to the US. It says:""China and the United States agree that timely responses should be provided to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber activities. Both sides are committed to making common effort to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyberspace within the international community.

A major finding of our latest report is that most companies are implementing their commitments, many have gone further than they pledged, and some new companies have made their own pledges,"" Pasztor said.The UN report, released on Thursday and titled ""Trends in Private Sector Climate Finance"", reveals that the private financial community is forging a strong relationship with the public sector ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) to be held in Paris in December.It lists five major points as evidence of this shift.Private companies across the world have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change, and 50-70 billion dollars of green bonds will be issued in 2015.Meanwhile, the number of companies using internal carbon pricing increased by around 300 percent last year. Many investors are now divesting high-carbon investments by decarbonizing their portfolios, and insurance companies are developing new tools to cover growing climate risks and resulting vulnerability.While acknowledging that the Chinese private sector had not gone as far, Pasztor praised the country's efforts, including its new emissions trading scheme.""We have had some contracts with Chinese institutional investors, although the input has not been as broad. That is still to come,"" he said. ""However, in areas like green bonds, China is very strong.

The COP serves to report on the implementation of the UNFCCC, adopt resolutions on regulations and conduct discussions about new commitments. The 21st COP (COP21) will be held in Paris, France in December 2015.My reply to the question raised by Hon Emily Lau is as follows:(1) I will attend the C40 Steering Committee Meeting, C40 Forum, etc. to be held in Paris this December. I will also join the national delegation in attending various activities of COP21 including the High-Level Segment, and will conduct and chair a seminar in the COP21 exhibition centre to discuss Hong Kong's strategies for addressing extreme climate risks. We will keep in view the discussions conducted and agreements reached at COP21, and will study the agreements in detail, particularly the relevant carbon reduction commitments. We will also review our policies in the light of the latest developments worldwide and local circumstances in addressing climate change in the post-COP21 era.As regards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation, we will continue to encourage the use of public transport services and develop a transportation system with railway as the backbone. The ""Railway Development Strategy 2014"" recommends that seven new railway projects be completed in the planning horizon up to 2031. The expanded railway network will cover areas inhabited by about 75 per cent of our total population. We will keep in view and make reference to the experiences of other regions in transport emissions reduction. Furthermore, the Government has been actively promoting the wider use of electrical vehicles (EVs). With no roadside emissions, EVs are more energy-efficient than conventional vehicles and can help reduce GHG emissions.As at end-October 2015, there were over 3000 EVs in Hong Kong, which was a remarkable increase when compared with the figure in end-2010 (less than 100 EVs). We will continue to develop low-carbon public transport, keeping in view and making reference to the relevant experiences of other regions in their transportation systems.(3) The C40 Cities Awards (formerly known as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Awards) encourages healthy competition among cities around the world to step up their efforts in environmental protection.For the C40 Cities Awards this year, over 216 entries from 94 cities, including Hong Kong, were submitted. Most cities including Hong Kong did not win the Awards. Nevertheless, the two entries from Hong Kong have been recognised as among the 100 global best practices in addressing climate change this year.They will be included in the C40 database of best practices, and will also appear in a new publication titled ""Cities100"".The Government of Hong Kong has been actively taking mitigation and adaptation measures to address climate change. The ""Hong Kong Climate Change Report 2015"" published earlier consolidates the efforts of the relevant Government departments. We will continue to review and optimise our policies and actions on carbon reduction in the areas of optimising our fuel mix, maximising energy efficiency, promoting green road transport, using clean fuel for motor vehicles and turning waste to energy.Thank you, President.Source: Hong Kong SAR Government\l"

Rousseff's five-day tour from June 27 to July 1, which includes New York, Washington and San Francisco, is the first attempt to rebuild the bilateral relationship that was chilled when the United States was exposed to spy in 2013. This visit was ""carefully planned and preceded by a series of high-level contacts,"" said Carlos Antonio da Rocha Paranhos, director of the United States, Canada and Interamerican Issues Department within the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. A series of conversations have taken place between Rousseff and Obama in recent weeks, including meeting at the Summit of the Americas in Panama in April. These events have allowed the leaders to establish the bases of this visit which represents the rapprochement of the two governments after years of estrangement, Paranhos said. In 2013, Edward Snowden, former employee of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), revealed that the agency was conducting a global electronic espionage mission, spying phones and emails of U.S. citizens as well as foreign leaders, including Rousseff. This scandal infuriated Rouseff, so the Brazilian president postponed her visit to Washington which was planned for October 2013. But that crisis is now ""water under the bridge, "" Paranhos said. During this visit, Brazil and the United States would discuss issues like renewing the dialogue mechanism between the two sides, cooperation on defense and strategic dialogues on energy and so on. In preparation for the topics relating to defense, the Brazilian defense minister Jaques Wagner met with U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter in Washington on Friday. Three important agreements with the United States are in the advanced stages of being approved in the Brazilian Congress, said Paranhos. One of the agreements involves cooperation in terms of defense and another involves protecting sensitive information. The third one is about combating tax evasion. Rousseff and Obama will discuss the possibility of a coordinated approach to the 21st United NationsClimate Change Conference (COP21 The two leaders will also discuss the possibility of Brazil entering into the ""Global Entry"" program which facilitates visas benefiting first of all Brazilian travelers who frequently visit the United States. Apart from the political dialogue, Rousseff's visit also aims to reach agreement with the United States on technology, innovation, trade and investment. In terms of economy, one main objective will be meeting with investors and showing them ""Brazil is taking fiscal adjustments and the logistics infrastructure program seriously,"" said Paranhos. ""We will make an effort to show Brazil's investment opportunities and a seminar is planned for Tuesday in New York to show the Investment in Logistics Program to investors,"" said Paranhos, adding that the Brazilian Minister for Planning Nelson Barbosa will be present at the seminar. The United States is Brazil's second-largest trading partner after China with a trade exchange that has permanently grown and makes up 14.7 percent of foreign trade, according to Paranhos. \l"

This is the first time that the head of state in China attends the climate change conference, whose full name is the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) and the 11st Conference of Parities on Kyoto Protocol. Reviewing the past more than two decades, a reporter from China Youth Network noticed that China is playing a big role in the UN climate change conference, featuring striving for quality, making voice heard and daring to take actions.Striving for qualityPresident Xi Jinping mentioned when taking interview from Reuters, ""The developed and developing countries bear different historical responsibilities and also have distinct demands and capabilities of development. It's like a car racing, in which some have got off earlier while some just start. It's improper and unfair to limit the speed with unified standards."" China has always standing with the developing countries to strive for equality and proper rights and interests.At the opening ceremony of Paris climate change conference, President Xi mentioned again that the developed countries shall honor the commitment to aid the developing countries with 100 billion US dollars each year before 2020 as the climate funds. Meanwhile, President Xi also noted that to combat the climate change shall not hinder the proper demands of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve people's living standard.Early as the 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference, Chinese government stressed that the developing countries should not take the old path of developed countries' industrialization at the cost of resources and environment while the developed countries should understand and support the developing countries and meet their commitments in financial and technological support.Faced with global climate change, China, India, Brazil and South Africa reached consensus on jointly dealing with this issue.The four countries convened to exchange views and basic standpoints before the Copenhagen climate change conference, thus named BASIC. In the 2002 Doha conference, Mr. Su Wei, director of the NDRC Climate Change Department of China and deputy head of the China delegation, spoke on behalf of the BASIC. He noted that the developing countries are facing pressing challenges of sustainable development and poverty reduction, but strong and powerful actions have been taken. ""The developing countries have made greater contributions to slowing climate change than the developed counterparts, while the latter should shoulder more historical responsibilities and take the lead to combat climate change. We urge the developed parties to honor commitments to increase carbon emission cuts and support the developing countries by providing supports in funds, transfer of technology and capability building.""In the 2014 Lima conference, Mr. Su Wei spoke as China's top climate change negotiator and director of the NDRC Climate Change Department of China that China is still standing with the developing countries.

""It showed a very prospective meeting to accelerate steps toward an agreement,"" said Xie in an exclusive interview with Xinhua. Prior to the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (COP21) to be held in Paris in December, around 40 delegations, including about 30 ministers, took part in the Paris informal ministerial consultations on Monday and Tuesday. ""The atmosphere was upbeat and friendly. Many constructive suggestions were raised,"" Xie said. ""We can feel that everyone was working hard to solve problems rather than making things more complicated."" The second gathering was scheduled for Sept. 6-7 to discuss the financing of proposed policies to tackle climate change. ""If the COP21 reached an agreement eventually, it would be a great contribution, guiding all parties in cooperating on climate change and helping nations realize constructive transformation and upgrade their economies,"" added Xie. Xie noted that the Chinese government, which has attached great importance to climate change, is responsible and ambitious. ""China has taken responsibility in tackling the global challenge, and China's solution established a successful example for the world,"" he said. Xie emphasized that China's initiatives on climate change are driven by its domestic needs to ensure economic and ecological security. ""China's energy conservation, environmental protection and new energy industries have become the new economic growth point of the country,"" Xie said.

It's my pleasure to address you at the Green Council 15th anniversary ceremony and Hong Kong Green Awards 2015 presentation dinner gala.As we enter the month of December, I cannot help but notice that we have yet to experience the cool temperatures of a typical winter. Indeed, I have not put aside my summer clothes, and perhaps some of us will be disappointed in missing out on the chance to wear the latest winter outfits. But of course the disappearing winter is far more serious than a wardrobe choice; it implies that climate change is an imminent challenge for all of us.In this regard, I am grateful for the work of the Green Council in helping in the fight against climate change. Since its establishment in May 2000, the Council has put forward inspiring green incentives for the industrial and commercial sectors to follow. The Council has awarded its Hong Kong Green Label to environmentally qualified plastic products, electrical appliances, construction materials and more to encourage businesses to supply green products. The Hong Kong Green Award is a further recognition of corporations' efforts in green procurement and management practices.Green building is the way forward---------------------------------I am sure you are aware that today so happens to be Buildings Day, a highlighted feature of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris.Buildings Day tells us that the building and construction sectors can play a key part in fighting climate change. New buildings of today are the existing building stock of tomorrow, and failure to pursue sustainable building would lock in growth of greenhouse gas emissions for decades. Indeed, more than 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are building-related, and emissions could double by 2050 if we do nothing with our buildings.This is why we are pressing for green reforms, not only in terms of international efforts, but also in the development of our nation and also in Hong Kong.International collaborative efforts in ParisAs we speak, more than 190 countries at COP21 are hoping to succeed the legally binding Kyoto Protocol with a new agreement which can allow us to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.More than 50,000 participants from governments, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations are discussing possible reform measures to make this goal a reality. In particular, we expect green buildings will be at the top of their agenda.Hong Kong is also a member of the global village, and that is why the Secretary for the Environment is co-ordinating a party of 10 as part of the Chinese delegation at COP21.As a prelude to COP21, our nation unveiled its climate pledge in June this year. China will lower carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 per cent by 2030 from the 2005 level, together with a pledge to peak carbon emissions around 2030. This shows our commitments in the global green movement.Green buildings in Hong KongBack in Hong Kong, we intend to learn from the experiences at , and put them into practice by adopting green building reforms. This is a step forward to meet our Energy Saving Plan pledge, which targets a 40 per cent reduction in energy intensity by 2025 using 2005 as the base. Allow me to elaborate further on four aspects.First, the Government has taken the lead in promoting green government buildings. To meet this Energy Saving Plan pledge, we will strive to reduce electricity consumption in government buildings by 5 per cent by 2020 using 2014 as the base year, based on a host of measures.New government buildings with construction floor area above 5,000 square metres are to achieve a high grading under recognised green building labelling schemes. We have also extended the maximum payback period for energy efficiency measures for new government buildings from nine years to 12 years. The longer payback period encourages the use of more new and innovative energy efficient features, such as building management systems.With the establishment of the Innovation and Technology Bureau last month, targeted measures will be devised to incentivise private organisations and capital funds to invest in innovation and technology. Indeed, technological advancements of today will bring about developments of tomorrow. I would ask for the support of all corporations here to invest in the future of our city.Second, we strive to extend the life span of existing buildings by turning them to other uses. This is to avoid extensive demolition and reconstruction works.As we all know, the 27-storey Murray Building was where the Development Bureau was situated before it was relocated to the Central Government Offices at Tamar. When Murray Building was vacated in 2012, it was largely retained and subsequently sold for conversion into a hotel, retaining much of its architectural merits and energy efficient features.Three government buildings in Wan Chai, namely Revenue Tower, Wanchai Tower and Immigration Tower, will also have their 10,000 staff relocated to create new Grade A office space. We envision that the towers will not be torn down, which would result in much wastage, and the towers will be refurbished instead to suit future commercial needs.Indeed, retrocommissioning can help improve the energy efficiency of equipment and lighting systems in an existing building. A building upgrade can even help rectify problems that stem from the design and construction stages.The commercial sector has also done its part in green buildings with regard to its developments. Taikoo Place, one of Hong Kong's best-planned business hubs, offering 550,000 square metres of prime commercial place, has been recognised for its excellence in urban planning and environmental sustainability. Two International Finance Centre, with its almost column-free floors to maximise natural light penetration, was awarded Gold Certification by the US Green Building Council.Third, it is not just buildings that need reworking. With a broader regional perspective, we seek to apply district-wide green technology like the District Cooling System (DCS) in Kowloon East to reduce power consumption. The DCS is an energy-efficient air-conditioning system which consumes 35 per cent less electricity compared to traditional air-cooled air-conditioning systems and 20 per cent less electricity than individual water-cooled air-conditioning systems using cooling towers. The system helps us achieve the new Energy Saving Target by reducing energy intensity.Finally, we are working to expand the green concept from development areas to our comprehensive Hong Kong development framework.The Government is now updating Hong Kong's holistic development strategy, known as ""Hong Kong 2030+: Towards a Planning Vision and Strategy Transcending 2030"". We have aspirations to make Hong Kong a smart, green and resilient city, and aim to optimise the use of transport infrastructure to reduce commuting demand. More integrated green and blue spaces will be explored as part of planning for a more sustainable Hong Kong.In the process, we will not sacrifice housing demand for green developments. Rather, an environmentally friendly city creates synergy among communities, and provides the necessary green spaces for citizens to settle comfortably.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, I am sure you will agree with me that green buildings can not only revitalise a city, but also make a substantial difference to the world.Last but not least, I wish the Green Council every success in the years to come, and congratulate all awardees for your dedication to the green movement. Thank you.Source: Hong Kong SAR Government\l"

Photo: AFPChinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a key UN climate conference in Paris on Monday as world leaders gather to reach a deal to tackle global warming amid political and economic obstacles. Nearly 150 heads of state and government are gathering in Paris for the conference, known as COP21. The meeting, from Monday to December 11, aims to clinch a long-term deal to cut carbon emissions after two decades of talks that failed to effectively curb global warming. So far this year, 183 of 195 nations have issued long-term plans to tackle climate change, with a flurry of more than a dozen in the past week including from South Sudan, Kuwait, Yemen and Cuba.The national plans, including a commitment from China in June to peak its rising carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, cover about 95 percent of world emissions, the UN said.Yang Fuqiang, senior advisor on climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the Global Times Sunday that the main objective of the annual Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) is to review the convention's implementation, and COP21 is more important since it hopes to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 C.""As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and the world's second-largest economy, China has a growing sense of responsibility for curbing climate change and will play an important role at the conference,"" Yang said. Gloomy forecastDespite hopes for the COP21 to generate an agreement, differences remain on whether the deal should be legally binding.Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change, said on November 19 at a press conference that he wished the upcoming Paris climate change conference can yield a powerful, ambitious and legally binding agreement.Xie's statement came after US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Financial Times this month that any deal reached in Paris was ""definitively not going to be a treaty."" A legally binding deal would prove to be politically impossible for the Obama administration since the Republican-dominated Congress will not ratify any treaty imposing legally binding cuts on the US. Kerry's remarks drew a stern response from French President Francois Hollande, who said ""if the agreement is not legally binding, there won't be an agreement, because that would mean it would be impossible to verify or control the undertakings that are made.""Another issue which remains under negotiation is how to divide the responsibilities between developed nations and developing ones.In an interview with Reuters in October, Xi said developed and developing countries have different historical responsibilities for climate change, and different development needs and capabilities.

""Yes, it was about seven or eight hours after the incident,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that Putin had been informed about the call. Erdogan said Thursday in an interview with France 24 TV channel that he had tried to call Putin after the incident, but could not reach him. On Thursday, however, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied there had been such a call.

A ""historic"" pact was inked after a week of painful negotiations. Photo: AFPThe landmark climate agreement reached in Paris is expected to set the course for a shift that relieves the world from its reliance on fossil fuel, but analysts remain concerned over the effective implementation of the plan to arrest global warming. Adopted by the 196 Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on Saturday, the Paris Agreement sets a target of holding the global average rise in temperature below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees.It also requires rich nations to maintain a $100 billion a year funding pledge beyond 2020, and use that figure as a ""floor"" for further support agreed on by 2025, providing greater financial security to developing nations as they wean themselves away from coal-fired power.China's foreign ministry said on Sunday that the agreement is fair in splitting responsibility between developed and developing countries. Hong Lei, China's foreign ministry spokesman, called the agreement ""comprehensive, balanced and powerful"" and said China appreciates the efforts that all parties have made.The agreement, which takes effect in 2020, acknowledges ""common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances."" The language means that developing countries, such as China and India, can gradually enhance their emission reduction efforts without engaging in absolute reductions. Ambiguity remainsFollowing the adoption of the agreement, China's Special Representative on Climate Change, Xie Zhenhua, said although the agreement is not perfect and there exists provisions that require improvement, the agreement represents the broad consensus reached by different sides. Xie stressed that China, as a responsible developing country, will take international obligations commensurate with its own national conditions, development stage and actual capacity.He called on developed countries to abide by their promises to provide funding, technological development and transfer, and capacity building to developing countries.""The Paris agreement provides a roadmap for global de-carbonization  It is not a plan that solves the climate change problem once and for all but rather the beginning of a long-term transformation that leads the world away from its reliance on fossil fuels,"" said Bai Yunwen, director of the policy center at Greenovation Hub, a Chinese NGO which focuses on climate change and environmental protection. Although the agreement claims that developed countries should reach a collective quantified goal of financial support from a floor of $100 billion per year by 2025, the amount between 2020 to 2025 remains unclear, Bai said. The agreement also fails to detail how that amount will be shared among different countries. ""The ambiguity in the description of the document concerns China and some developing countries,"" Bai told the Global Times. Furthermore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the last major climate deal reached in 1997, the Paris pact will not be a fully legally-binding treaty. The benchmark $100 billion-a-year aspiration is mentioned in the ""decision"" part of the document, not the ""action"" section to avoid triggering a review by the US Senate, The New York Times reported, as many Republicans still see the pact as a dangerous endeavor that threatens to trade economic prosperity for an uncertain if greener future. China's movesAnalysts believe that the Paris agreement will lead to a structural shift in China's energy sector. ""More clean energy will be introduced to replace coal, oil and gas in order to achieve the emissions reduction goal,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times. ""Government policy and foreign capital will favor environmentally friendly projects such as electric cars, triggering innovations and bringing changes in various industries,"" Lin said. China aims to hit the carbon emissions peak by around 2030, promising to make the best efforts to realize the target early, according to the country's action plan on climate change.China hopes to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030. The share of non-fossil fuels in its primary energy consumption will be increased to around 20 percent from the 11.2 percent in 2014, and the forest stock volume is expected to add 4.5 billion cubic meters on the 2005 level by 2030.Agencies contributed to this story\l"

Over the next year - and especially at the organization's September summit, to be held in Hangzhou - China plans to help lay the groundwork for a world economy that is more ""innovative, invigorated, interconnected, and inclusive."" The question is how.The G20 has gained some momentum, and China can benefit. If the current United Nations Climate Change Conference produces a binding global agreement to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, that momentum will become even stronger. Given that the G20 countries represent two-thirds of the world's population and 85 percent of its GDP, they would be integral to the implementation of any deal. By providing a framework for these countries to meet regularly to discuss global challenges like climate change, the G20 - which is, at best, a club of self-selected members - gains legitimacy.All of this bodes well for China's capacity to help counter the global slowdown in growth, trade, and investment. And not a moment too soon: The ongoing slowdown is among the greatest risks the world currently faces, because it could exacerbate desperation and instability in already-fragile countries, while compelling more robust economies to turn inward, rather than address proliferating crises.Fortunately, China has lately been showing its commitment to becoming a more responsible global stakeholder. Perhaps most notable, it recently led the establishment of the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which will serve largely as a vehicle for Chinese foreign investment.\l"

Analyzing trends in the key emitting sectors, researchers conclude that China\\'s greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to peak as late as 2030, the upper limit set by the Chinese government last year, and are much more likely to peak by 2025, or even earlier than that, the report stated. The researchers also say that if China\\'s greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, they would reach between 12.5 and 14 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This finding suggests it is increasingly likely that the world will avoid global warming of more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

""It does not sound like much when you consider that global sea levels rise three millimeters per year, but when you put in a hundred year period, you have to worry,"" Mirko Orlic, a professor of geophysics at the University of Zagreb, told Xinhua in a recent interview. The sea level of the Adriatic has risen rapidly in the last two decades, partly due to an increase of water volume and melting ice from glaciers and Greenland, Orlic said. The coastal flooding would occur more frequent in the future, costing lives and causing economic damages, he said, adding ""German colleagues from Kiel and Berlin estimate that floods in Croatia alone could cause losses of one to nine billion dollars per year at the end of this century."" In addition, he said, rising sea levels would threaten the supply of fresh water in the coastal areas because salt water would spill over into fresh water. Kreso Pandzic, a climatologist for the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service (MHS) also worried about the decrease of rainfall and heat waves in Mediterranean areas in summer months, the results of climate change. It is expected that there would be more droughts in these areas, threatening water resources, he said, adding ""precipitation higher intensity in a shorter time will also be unfavorable for water supplies, and we will have more flood and soil erosion."" The rise of the sea level of the Adriatic would particularly threaten low-lying coastal areas, such as a fertile area of the Neretva River, he said. ""If we do not take protective measures, some islands of the Kornati Archipelago, consisting of more than 100 islands in the Adriatic along the Croatian coast could disappear,"" said Pandzic. But there is some good news, Orlic said. The Croatian coast is very steep and is better placed than the Netherlands, for example, where a third of its surface could be sunk if the global sea levels further rise at the end of this century, according to conservative estimates of scientists. Orlic said he hoped a final agreement would be drafted in Paris, enabling the target of keeping the rise of global temperature under two degrees Celsius to be reached. He said, however, for the new agreement to be both successful and fair, countries which contributed more greenhouse gases in last 200 years should shoulder more of the climate change burden. In addition, the responsibilities and obligations should be assigned not only based on greenhouse gas emissions, but also on emissions per capita, he said. The needs of developing countries' economic development should be considered, he added. Pandzic expressed his optimism an agreement would be reached, telling Xinhua that the temperature did not go up by 3.5 to 5 degrees Celsius in one day. ""We have time to take effective measures to deal with it. Of course we must act in a hurry."" Ivan Cacic, director of MHS and president of the Europe Regional Association of the World Meteorological Organization, too expected compromise solutions would be found in Paris that could stop the rise in global warming. ""Politicians are aware that global climate change could lead to considerable political turmoil,"" he said, adding they would have to act if they wanted a stable world. Britain's Meteorological Institute warned that the temperature on earth in 2015 was one degree Celsius higher than in pre-industrial times. Extreme weather and climate events are increasingly frequent and more intense. Thirteen of the 14 hottest years ever recorded occurred in the 21st century, with the warmest decade ever recorded being the decade from 2001 to 2010, according to the institute. \l"

In coastal areas with suitable conditions, some nuclear power plants are already being built and technology is being upgraded.

China's nuclear power development was put on hold following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in March 2011. Approvals for new nuclear plants were also suspended and a nationwide safety review launched after the incident. Approvals were cautiously resumed in October 2012. The State Council approved major hydropower and nuclear power projects last Wednesday, vowing to continue developing clean energy to secure steady economic growth. It is hoped that hydro- and nuclear power projects will help stabilize economic growth, optimize energy structure and improve people's livelihoods, said a statement released after an executive meeting of the State Council. China, during the United Nations climate change conference, pledged to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent from 2005 levels by 2030; increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent; and peak its carbon emissions by the same date. ""If the emission targets are realized, China's air pollution will also be reduced by about 42 percent,"" Xie said. On Tuesday, 40 cities in north China issued alerts for air pollution. Beijing issued its second red alert this month, the most serious level of the four-tier warning system. \l"

Investment in fuel-guzzling industries has been strictly controlled, said Zhou Dadi, a senior researcher at the commission's Energy Research Institute.Changes to the economic structure have also borne fruit. The service sector, which accounted for 51.6 percent of GDP in the first quarter, has outpaced the growth of the industrial sector.""The country should maintain an ambitious energy-saving target of not less than 16 percent for the next five years,"" Zhou said.Meanwhile, China is making preparations for the United Nations Climate Change Conference due to take place in Paris at the end of the year. It will submit its proposals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, to the UN by the end of June, Zhang said.Janos Pasztor, the UN's assistant secretary-general on climate change, said in New York in early May that 37 countries have submitted their INDCs.Zhang said: ""China's action plan is in tandem with energy-saving and emissions reduction efforts. We will earnestly implement our commitments to the international community.""Zhang was appointed vice-chairman of the commission in December, and he is in charge of climate change issues, investment in fixed assets and rural development.The State Council issued a document on Tuesday that said the environment should be protected in a sustainable way alongside efforts to boost economic prosperity.The document revealed that a lifelong accountability system should be established to track officials' performance in the field of environmental protection.Officials will assume accountability for their decisions if they damage the environment, even after they leave their posts.""This accountability should not be limited to single projects, but should also apply to the formulation of policy,"" Zhou said.A suspension bridge spanning the Baling River in Guizhou is one of the longest vehicle-worthy bridges in Asia.

The new report presented an assessment of the 119 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The report covers 146 countries (including the European Union submitting as a bloc) and up to 88 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2012. The INDCs represent GHG emission reductions of 4 to 6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (GtCO2e/yr) in 2030 compared to projected emissions under current policy trajectories. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report scenarios, which assumed no additional climate policies are put in place after 2010, 2030 projections based on current policies are themselves 5 GtCO2e per year lower than the estimate of 65 GtCO2e. This indicated that efforts to tackle climate change, including those taken before the Paris agreement and full implementation of the INDCs, could cut up to 11 GtCO2e from projected emissions in 2030. However, even all INDCs are fully implemented, the 2030 emissions gap would still be 12 GtCO2e, putting the world on track to a temperature rise of around three degree Celsius by 2100, and bringing significant climate impacts. Further actions to limit global temperature rise to 2 degree Celsius by 2100 should be addressed by all sides in the upcoming 2015 United Nations , held in Paris from November 30 to December 11. The report said enhanced energy efficiency and expanded use of renewable energy technologies for power production will be critical to close the emission gaps. Other key sectors emphasized in the studies also include forestry, agriculture and waste. \l"

The remarks followed the announcement of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that Australia would redistribute a large portion of the nation's foreign aid budget to cash-poor Pacific countries over the next five years, helping them enact their climate change policies. Turnbull unveiled the policy in his opening address at the Paris climate change summit, the 21st Conference of Parties (), Monday night (local time). But, back in Canberra, Bishop spent Tuesday morning hosing down talks from the Labor and Greens parties that the government was playing accounting tricks, which would ultimately leave the smaller Pacific island nations without sufficient funds if a natural disaster were to occur. ""They won't lose funding because this is exactly what the small island developing nations of the Pacific are asking for,"" she told the Chanel Nine on Tuesday. ""We provide aid in a partnership with each country and they discuss with us where they want the aid dollars spent ... and many of them ask for it in the natural disaster resilience area ... because the Pacific is one of the most natural disaster prone regions in the world. ""This is what the aid budget is designed to do."" The Climate Institute, Australia's leading independent climate change watchdog, said the five-year commitment only represented two thirds of what the organization deemed a ""fair contribution"" -- 1.10 billion U.S. dollars -- on the global scale. In other developments at the COP21 summit in Paris, Turnbull officially signed Australia on for the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol. The second commitment makes Australia's pledge to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5 percent, based on levels recorded in 2000, by 2020.

The Chinese economy's slowdown is partly due to the country strengthening adjustment of its economic structure and adopting the stricter standards on environmental protection, Li said.""It's a tough process of structural transformation and changing the economy's driving forces, but we must continue down this path,"" he said.China must find new growth points for its economy, and green and environmentally friendly industries have great potential for becoming one of these points, the premier said.He encouraged Chinese and French companies to cooperate and tap into the Chinese market by joining the nation's industrialization and urbanization process, which is becoming more environmentally friendly and saving more energy. These companies should also work together to explore third-party markets for developing green industries.Dealing with climate change imposes pain and pressure on developing countries in the short term, ""but in return, we will get sustained and healthy development in the future,"" Li said.Hollande said at the forum that through his visit to China he wants to send a message that dealing with climate change is an opportunity to develop the green economy, which will bring various forms of new growth and new investments.When meeting with Hollande after the forum, Li said China wants to enhance cooperation with the international community, including France, to deal with climate change issues. He said China and France should make full use of Sino-French joint funds and implement projects in the environmental protection industry.\l"

Stronger political will and closer international cooperation are badly needed to cope with the increasing threat of global terrorism.As a country that is also a victim of terrorism and extremism, China stands in firm unity with France in this battle, and the Chinese people share the deep sorrow of the French people and send their condolences to the bereaved.In their letters of condolences to their counterparts in France, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang condemned the attacks in the strongest terms and pledging to join hands with the international community to combat terrorism in all forms.What happened in Paris on Friday is a blatant crime against humanity and an open defiance to justice and peace. Violence targeting innocent people has become the most frequently used terrorist tactic, as random mass killings sow the seeds of fear and cause social frictions.But France and the rest of the world will not be cowed by this cowardly act of terrorism. They will only rally more closely together in the fight against terrorism.The IS group has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks. As France is part of the US-led international coalition fighting the IS group in the Middle East, one of the purposes for the group to stage the brutal killings is retaliation.The perpetrators may also want to disrupt the United Nations climate change conference to be held next month in Paris, where the leaders of more than 80 countries are due to participate. The French government announced on Saturday that the conference will be held on schedule, and the world has the confidence that France will host safe and successful talks.As an enemy of mankind, terrorism can only be suppressed by joint efforts from all countries, and the attacks in Paris should be a clarion call for more concerted endeavors to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism.It is high time that all forces that are willing to fight the evil group stepped up their cooperation and improved their strategies so that terrorism is defeated at an early date.\l"

""To resolve the climate crisis, good will, statements of intent are not enough. We are at a breaking point,"" Hollande told a high-profile gathering in Bourget in Paris northern suburbs. ""By Dec. 12, a deal must be reached in Paris. The accord must be universal, binding and differentiated,"" he added. Hollande said states committed to stopping climate deterioration should accept a restrictive accord, show further solidarity towards most vulnerable countries and stick to a planned trajectory aimed at curbing global warming at 2 degrees Celsius. ""We are going to decide during few days for few decades. The greatest danger is not that our target is too high and that we miss it. The greatest danger is that it is too low and we meet it,"" he told participants at the 21st United Nations conference on climate change. About 150 heads of states and governments are participating in the climate conference, widely considered as the last chance to forge a crucial accord to reduce green gas emissions, which caused severe droughts, rising sea level and frequent droughts and floods. At the beginning of the talks, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on world leaders to take swift action to reduce global warming. ""Paris must mark a decisive turning point. We need to go much faster, much further if we are to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius,"" he said. ""The agreement must be dynamic and must adapt the changes without the need to renegotiate it continuously,"" Ban added, calling on rich countries to deliver on their promises to provide 100 billion U.S. dollars to the poorest countries to face climate change challenges. At Copenhagen summit in 2009, negotiations failed to limit greenhouses and rich nations' promise to grant 100 billion U. S. dollars to world's poorest countries to cope with climate change remained on paper. ""We have an obligation to succeed because we know an accord is no longer just about the environment. It's about justice, refugees and peace,"" he said, noting ""encouraging signs"" to come out with an accord on global warming. So far, 184 countries out of the 195 participating countries have submitted their national contributions to trim global warming. They represent about 95 percent of global greenhouse emissions, according to French top diplomat. \l"

During his stay in the European nation, the first by a Chinese premier in nearly a decade, Li will visit the French cities of Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, deliver a speech at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and attend the closing ceremony of a China-France business summit.

Amid increasing criticism in the past seven years for being weak and hesitant in using military means to deal with security challenges, Obama said solutions to pressing global issues need to be ""more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians."" ""That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world age,"" he added. Obama was apparently responding to criticism from Republican presidential candidates that he continuously shies away from calls to send troops abroad to fight Islamic State (IS) militants in the Middle East or remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power to end the prolonged Syrian civil war. Republican critics have also accused Obama of refusing to intensify U.S. airstrike operations against IS in Syria and northern Iraq, thus enabling the terror group to continue to pose a grave threat to the security of the West, including the U.S. ""We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us,"" Obama said, citing the lessons of the U.S. wars in Vietnam and Iraq. Obama has made pulling all U.S. troops out of Iraq at the end of 2011 a major foreign policy goal. But some critics blamed the U.S. pullout for leaving a vacuum for IS to take over large swaths of northern Iraq. The president stressed that on global concerns the U.S. ""will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight."" Obama said that is the strategy he used in dealing with the conflict in Syria and securing a historic deal on Iran's controversial nuclear program, which helped prevent a possible military conflict in the volatile Middle East. Obama also mentioned the historic deal on fighting global warming reached at the United Nationsclimate change conference in Paris late last year, the containment of the spread of Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world ...or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling,"" he said. Leadership means ""a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right,"" Obama said, adding that the strength of American leadership depends on the power of example. \l"

There will be all the usual political intrigue and drama.Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by his wife Peng Liyuan, arrives in Paris, capital of France, to attend the opening ceremony of an international conference on climate change on November 29, 2015. [Photo/Xinhua]D\'e9j\'e0 vu in Paris: 21st time lucky? Of course notIf you don't learn from history, you're bound to repeat it. Here in Saint-Denis, northern Paris, a history lesson is sorely needed.All because this summit is ""the last chance"" to avert dangerous temperature rises, if we listen to the Earth League or a bunch of others. It's going to be ""too late"" if a meaningful treaty isn't negotiated here in the next few days, says the French president.It's a familiar script, though, isn't it? I remember people including then UK prime minister Gordon Brown all agreeing that the 2009 global warming meeting in Copenhagen was the world's very 'last chance'. ""If we do not reach a deal,"" Brown went so far as to say, ""no retrospective global agreement in some future period can undo that choice. By then it will be irretrievably too late.""Even by 2009, Brown was a late hanger-on to a crowded bandwagon. Doom-laden warnings about the 'last chance to save the planet' date as far back as the earliest climate summits, 20 years ago.TIME Magazine declared 2001 ""A Global Warming Treaty's Last Chance"", and in 1989 the UNEP executive director warned that the planet faced an ecological disaster ""as final as nuclear war"" by the turn of the century.Amid this alarmism, for 20 years well-intentioned climate negotiators have tried to do the same thing over and over again: negotiate a treaty that makes an impact on temperature rises. The result? Twenty years of failure with no significant effect on climate change.These summits have failed for a pretty simple reason. Solar and wind power are still too expensive and inefficient to replace our reliance on fossil fuels. The Copenhagen-Paris approach requires us to force immature green technologies on the world even though they are not ready or competitive. That's hugely expensive and inefficient.Thanks to campaigning NGOs, politicians and self-interested green energy companies which benefit from huge subsidies, many people believe that solar and wind energy are already major sources of energy. The reality is that even after two decades of climate talks, we get a meager 0.5 percent of our total global energy consumption from solar and wind energy, according to the leading authority, the International Energy Agency (IEA). And 25 years from now, even with a very optimistic scenario, envisioning everyone doing all that they promise in Paris, the IEA expects that we will get just 2.4 percent from solar and wind. That tells us that the innovation that's required to wean the planet off reliance on fossil fuel is not taking place.Instead of hoping that the experiment will succeed at the 21st attempt, the leaders gathering here this week should change course and invest a lot more in research and development of green energy technology. If we could innovate down the price of green energy so it could genuinely compete in the market, everyone would be interested in a transition away from fossil fuels.Over the next two weeks, I will report from Paris on developments. I am sure we will hear nice speeches and grand promises. There will be all the usual political intrigue and drama. Anything could happen. But I can tell you one thing for sure right now: history suggests this ""last chance"" will unfortunately come and go with no real impact on temperature rises.Dr. Bjorn Lomborg is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and Visiting Professor at Copenhagen Business School.

After a 20-year run of tough negotiations, an agreement is expected to be signed during this UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Chua Chin Leng [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]Touted as the last chance to save Mother Earth from global warming due to carbon emissions, world leaders are heeding the calls from environmental scientists and experts to ink a series of measures in this conference. According to a BBC report scientists are expecting the leaders to agree to an eight-point action plan in Paris.The plans would include limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, keeping CO2 emissions to 1,000 gigatonnes, a zero carbon society by 2050, the richer countries giving assistance to the poorer ones, protection of forests and oceans, research and a strategy to address the loss and damage due to climate change, and lastly to provide financing assistance to developing countries.The urgency and seriousness of global warming would see leaders of more than 140 countries arriving in Paris for a summit. President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have arrived early for a pre conference bilateral meeting to set the tone and direction for the conference and to provide the necessary leadership needed to take the agenda forward. Both countries would have a common objective to work together and lead the community of nations to overcome a dire problem facing all nations caused by global warming.The atmosphere in Paris this time is less adversarial but more consultative and cooperative. Most of the hard negotiations have been done by the respective countries' representatives over the years and there is great hope of a historic agreement for the good of the human kind.There are still some disagreements on the fine details, but there is a general agreement to cap the global temperature change at 2 degrees Celsius. There will be repeated calls and measures for countries to cut down their carbon emissions from fossil fuels and switching to cleaner energy sources. Financial assistance would be needed, so are technologies on renewable and clean energies. Agreements would be signed, pledges would be made by the participating countries but the difficult part would be the implementations of these commitments, the change to new and clean technologies and the supply and construction of new energy manufacturing plants and facilities.There would still be the demands from the developing nations, particularly the island states that would face the most direct impact of higher sea level, on the developed nations for more financial assistance to meet the challenges of shrinking islands. The pledges are voluntary though some leaders are pushing for them to be legally binding. What needs to be addressed quickly is the cost of implementing the pledges to the fullest instead of just a thought of what the countries would like to do. Many of the countries would be hard pressed when cost of cutting carbon emission is prohibitive. Who is going to finance the measures to be taken?Countries like China with their manufacturing capabilities and technologies in windmills and solar panels would play a bigger part in assisting countries in transforming their energy production to clean energy. China could showcase its knowhow and clean energy products and processes to countries to meet their pledges and commitments to cut carbon emissions. It is infrastructure development of a different kind where China is well positioned to play a big role for the island nations.The Paris meeting will generate demands and opportunities for clean and renewable energy technologies between the users and manufacturers of such technologies. The transition to new and clean energy will revolutionize human activities and behaviors in a very major way. New industries will emerge to support the needs of countries going green and to cut carbon emissions. Lifestyle and living will not be the same again.China's investment and development in lowering the cost of green technology could be a game changer for countries wanting to make the change to new energy sources. No amount of talks, scientific presentations and pledges will make the earth better unless the cost is addressed and reduced to an acceptable level. After Paris the talking must stop and serious work begins.Saving the earth from climate change is an enormous task involving every country and every citizen of the world, and is a continuous process of human endeavor.The author, Chua Chin Leng, is a political observer from Singapore.

""This confirms the importance to reach in Paris at the COP21 an agreement that sets the rules to revise periodically the national contributions,"" French top diplomat said.""The national contributions' process is a first in the history of climate negotiations. This is a solid basis for the essential success in Paris,"" he added.A total of 146 countries out of the 195 participating countries have submitted their national contributions to trim global warming. They represent about 86 percent of global greenhouse emissions, according to the UN report.France will host the climate conference in Paris (COP21) in December where officials aim to find a global and binding agreement to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius.Some 80 top officials from across the world will participate in the summit.About 40,000 visitors, including more than 3,000 journalists, were expected to take part in the event.\l"
"COP21","China","COP21_China101","AfDB says global climate deal could enhance Africa's progress","November 25, 2015 Wednesday 12:32 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","The African Development Bank (AfDB) said on Wednesday the global climate deal that will push down greenhouse gas emissions could transform Africa's progress. According to a new paper from the AfDB, climate change poses a severe threat to Africa, but it also offers a huge opportunity. ""The current climate financing architecture is not providing the finance Africa needs. Much more needs to be done to increase Africa's access to climate finance,"" AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina said in the paper published by the Bank on Wednesday. The UN talks will start in Paris, France on Monday and run until Dec. 11, with 138 heads of state expected to attend. The international community is expected to finalize a new global climate agreement and decide how to finance it, at the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). COP21 presents a unique opportunity to meet that challenge. The voice of Africa is crucial to ensure the success of . And the voice of Africa will be heard,"" Adesina said. The paper, Africa's Climate Opportunity: Adapting and Thriving, explains how the COP21 climate talks in Paris can help Africa deal with the threat and seize the opportunity. The continent is particularly vulnerable to climate change, yet it produces only 4 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. Countries that caused global warming have a moral responsibility to help Africa adapt to its effects. But the new AfDB paper argues that Africa can do much more than adapt, noting that adapting to climate change while minimizing emissions can help drive the economic transformation that Africa needs. Climate-resilient, low-carbon development can boost growth, create jobs and lift people out of poverty. It can also bridge Africa's crippling energy deficit: 620 million Africans lack access to modern energy. To take advantage of this opportunity, Africa needs investment. The paper argues that COP21 must deliver the finance that will unlock Africa's potential. Rich countries have pledged to give poor nations 100 billion U.S. dollars a year by 2020 to help them reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. They are currently giving them just over half that amount. ""To meet the 100 billion dollars per annum target by 2020, we must improve the predictability and mobilization of finance,"" Adesina said. Developing countries also want ""loss and damage"" funds, for example, to help repair the damage caused by climate change-related events, such as hurricanes. In the paper, the AfDB spells out how it is investing its own resources and mobilizing new sources of finance. Adesina recently announced that the Bank would nearly triple its annual climate financing to reach 5 billion dollars a year by 2020. AfDB's climate spending will increase to 40 percent of its total new investments by 2020. \l"

[Photo by Fu Jing/chinadaily.com.cn]China and the EU are amongst the most active and critical players in tackling climate change and preparing for the COP 21. Both are effectively embarking on sustainable, resource efficient, green, low-carbon and climate resilient development and working constructively together at bilateral and international level for ambitious climate actions.The 13th Five Year Plan highlights the goal of China to nurture an open and innovation-driven economy featuring inclusive, green and coordinated growth, which will enable China to better address climate change in the next five years. Prior to this, China has already been working proactively to ensure the full, effective and sustained implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Convention. Up till the end of 2014, China has reduced GHG emission per unit of GDP by 15.8% compared with 2010 levels. Pilot emissions trading systems have now been operating smoothly in seven regions to prepare for the launch of the nationwide carbon market in 2017 covering key industry sectors. The ratio of non fossil fuels has now accounted for 11.2%of the total primary energy supply. Statistics released by the World Bank demonstrate that in the past two decades, energy saved by China has accounted for 52% out of the world\' s total. IEA reports recognize that China has contributed almost 40% to the increase of the global renewable energy capacity and helped to cut by half the cost of wind power and photovoltaic power generation.Additionally, China has already submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, committing to peak GHG emission by 2030 at the latest, lower the carbon intensity of GDP by 60% to 65% below 2005 levels by 2030, increase the share of non-fossil energy carriers to around 20% by that time, and increase its forest stock volume by 4.5 billion cubic meters, compared to 2005 levels.Being as the largest developing country, China is devoted to helping the rest of the developing world. China has set up a US$ three-billion fund to help other developing countries to combat climate change. In the past three years, China has provided US$ 62 million financial support to developing countries to improve energy efficiency and use of renewable energy,and helped to train over 1000 officials and technicians from over 120 developing nations in capacity building.The EU is also a strong advocate for the Convention. It has adopted at European level a comprehensive package of policy measures - the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each of the EU member states has also put in place its own domestic actions that build on the ECCP measures or complement them. So far, the EUhas reduced GHG emission by 17.9% compared with 1990 levels and planned to cut the emission by 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2030.China and the EU have maintained frequent mutual exchange on climate change policies, planning and good practices for low-carbon and climate resilient cities. They have been successfully cooperating on building emission trading capacity, collaborating on climate-related scientific research and technology innovation, including the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies and adaptation solutions. Their shared commitment and vision brings them to significantly enhancing their partnership on climate change established in 2005 and building on a decade of successful cooperation. The synergy of China\' s One Belt and One Road Initiative with the Juncker plan and the establishment of the connectivity platform will enable the two to elevate their cooperation on climate change and co-produce tangible results in developing a cost-effective low-carbon economy, launching a Low-Carbon Cities Partnership, enhancing climate resilient investments, exchanging and exploring more policy instruments in terms of energy conservation and energy efficiency.Their cooperation is not limited to the bilateral level. China and the EU have reinforced their coordination and cooperation in the framework of the UNFCCC, and other relevant fora such as the G20, MEF, Montreal Protocol, ICAO and IMO. The two partners have reaffirmed their commitment to reaching an ambitious and legally binding agreement in Paris that enhances the implementation of the Convention on the basis of equity and reflecting the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances. They have also called for the developed countries to provide and mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries.And there is still more that can be done.Apart from securing joint statements on climate change with the EU, France, the US, India and Brazil prior to the Paris, China has been coordinating intensively with the other BASIC and LMDC countries as well as members of the G77 to narrow down the differences. The EU canleverage its impact by taking the lead among developed countries in fulfilling their emission reduction targets and providing financial and technical support to developing countries. China and the EU should continue to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities on the basis of equality, with a view to facilitating a comprehensive, balanced and ambitious pact in Paris. They should continue to enchant green and low-carbon development worldwide and call forstronger global climate action to ensure the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention now, up to and beyond 2020.Much has changed after Copenhagen. The challenge of climate change has never been so imminent. Luckily enough, the international community has never been so close to reach consensus.

The leading papermaker was awarded an honorary title of a national role model for emissions reduction at the China Summit on Caring for Climate in Beijing on July 22. The company's environmental protection practices will be recorded in an achievements collection that will be reported by the United Nations Global Compact to the United Nations in Paris in December. The company considered the move a landmark in coping with global climate change, after Teguh Ganda Wijaya, chairman of Asia Pulp and Paper Group - the parent of APP-China - signed an anti-deforestation pledge at last year's United Nations Climate Summit in New York to protect the world's forests. ""It was a great honor and the best recognition of our efforts made during the implementation of a sustainable development strategy over the past years,"" said Zhai Jingli, deputy CEO of APP-China. ""Many people today believe the paper industry runs counter to environmental protection, and this award helped us prove that the industry can also realize green development,"" Zhai added. Papermaking has faced challenges of high resource and energy consumption and high pollution, but APP-China realized from the very beginning that only the harmonious coexistence of environment and resources could lead to sustainable development. APP-China, therefore, invested a large sum of money and put great effort into introducing clean production technologies and promoting product innovation. As of this year, the company has invested more than 8.4 billion yuan ($1.35 billion; 1.24 euros) in these fields, according to Zhai. She said water resource management is a key part in clean production, so the company's subsidiaries and plants focus on improving related facilities and technologies. Ningbo Asia Pulp and Paper Co, one of China's largest industrial paper suppliers, invested 25 million yuan to build an anaerobic treatment system to increase the efficiency of sewage treatment. The biogas and sludge produced during the anaerobic biological treatment process can also be recycled and used for the production. In addition, the company collects wastepaper every year as a major raw material for production. In 2013, the company and another APP-China subsidiary, Ningbo Zhonghua Paper Co, recycled more than 510,000 metric tons of wastepaper. Statistics show that using one ton of wastepaper as raw material is equivalent to protecting 17 trees, each 12 meters in height and at least 1.8 meters in girth, and saving 1.2 tons of coal and 100 cubic meters of water. ""We believe that creating environmental and social benefits is the foundation of long-term development and also the direction of APP-China's continuous efforts,"" Zhai said. As one of the global partners of the China Pavilion at the ongoing Milan Expo 2015, APP-China will host a Corporate Day on Sept 25 at the pavilion to showcase achievements by modern papermaking companies in seeking harmonious development with nature and ecosystems.

This, the experts say, is expected to help create a global equity in climate justice where all countries have a shared responsibility toward instituting mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change. Ndegwa said that the scale of these programs cannot be uniform between developed countries and poor developing countries. He observed that funding for poor and vulnerable countries has been a major point of contention in previous global meetings on climate change. ""This is the major reason behind the recent creation of the Vulnerable 20 (V20) group in October this year, a lobby group that comprises some of the smallest and poorest countries in the world,"" he revealed. Ndegwa's remarks came as nearly 150 leaders are attending the UN Climate Change summit, also known as the 21st session of Conference of the Parties or COP 21 in Paris, France. The meeting kicked off amid optimism from African leaders that world leaders meeting for COP21 However, Ndegwa said that a lot still needs to be done to bridge the climate change financial and technological mitigation shortfall from developed countries. This, he said, is a moral obligation for developed countries toward developing countries including Africa, whose state of underdevelopment has been largely attributed to the unbridled exploitation of its natural resources. The expert hailed China's efforts in using innovative solutions in minimizing the high emission levels from its combined industrial activities, noting that China has done exemplary work in managing pollution in some of its major industrial cities. Ndgewa said that since developing countries contributed little emission toward global warming, China's contribution through its green initiatives will help the countries avoid the environmental pitfalls that more developed countries have experienced. ""China's commitment to implementing massive environmentally friendly projects and programs in poor and vulnerable countries will make developed countries fund and implement similar initiatives where they are needed most,"" he added. ""China's commitments toward the establishment of a 3 billion U.S. dollars China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund to help other developing countries combat climate change and the proposed launch of the projects for 10 pilot low-carbon industrial parks are good examples worth emulating,"" said Benjamin Kimani, another climate change expert. China has also committed to starting more than 100 climate mitigation projects in other developing countries and providing 1,000 training opportunities for tackling climate change next year. \l"

The two-day assembly follows the theme ""from Negotiation to Action"" after the COP21 climate conference in Paris where nearly 200 states participated. It aims to implement concrete steps to accelerate the ongoing global energy transition. ""The Paris Agreement set a long-term vision for the deep reduction of global emissions and the need to de-carbonize the energy sector,"" said IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin in his opening speech. He called on the IRENA Assembly to take now the next steps and establish a blueprint for action to meet global climate goals and set the world on a path to a sustainable energy future. Amin also said that Paris showed that despite huge challenges in global security, the world can stand together. The ambitious objective agreed at COP21 to keep global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius and to step up actions to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius also proofed that the global community was ready to take serious steps to reduce global warming. ""Sustainable development depends on the richness of renewable energy resources,"" said Mohamed Hamed Shaker El-Markaby, Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy. ""I am confident in IRENA's ability to perform its mission in mobilizing the entire world's efforts to build more sustainable economies, which rely mainly on renewable sources,"" Markaby, also president of the assembly, added. IRENA, a UN affiliate founded in 2009, assembles 144 member states along with the European Union. Notable non-member states are Canada, Brazil and Ukraine. COP21 in Paris reached a global agreement to reduce climate change and can only become legally binding if the agreement is joined by 55 states that represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse emissions. The concerned states are called on to sign the agreement between April 22 2016 which marks this year's Earth Day, and April 21 2017.

Post ""Of course, everyone hopes that on a state-to-state level, a strong climate agreement can be made, but cities also play a key role in energy and emissions,"" Wong said. Nearly two-thirds of global carbon emissions were generated in cities and there was a need for further cooperation among city-level players to work to find measures to tackle them, he said. ""Cities are the source of the problems, but are also the source of the solutions,"" he said. After the city dialogue, Wong's team will attend COP21 as part of the mainland's national delegation. He will spend time at the China pavilion to share information about how Hong Kong is dealing with climate change. Premier Li Keqiang has pledged that the nation's carbon emissions will peak by 2030. Beijing has set a goal to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix by 20 per cent. Hong Kong has set a similar carbon-intensity target for 2025 and pledged to reduce energy intensity by 40 per cent, both from 2005 levels. Wong said the city's emissions should be able to peak ""around 2020"" as coal plants were retired and a new fuel mix involving more electricity generated by natural gas started. But Cheung Chi-wah, WWF Hong Kong's senior head for climate, said that while Wong was readying for ""peak 2020"", most other nations and cities, including those in China, attending COP21 were already looking at targets by 2030 and beyond. ""We hope Wong will come back from Paris and give us a more detailed explanation on when we can set targets for 2030.

Bernie Fraser, former head of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Climate Change Authority, joined 60 other prominent signatories in an open letter published on Tuesday calling for a moratorium on coal mining to be negotiated at the upcoming United Nations climate change conference in Paris. The smaller pacific nations have been vocal opponents to the snail's pace of reform to the global climate policies, seeking an agreement to limit warming to a 1.5 degree Celsius rise, fearing their islands will be swallowed up by the eventual sea-level rises if a two-degree increase is agreed. ""We in the Pacific did not cause climate change, but we suffer because of it,"" Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill told the Pacific Islands Forum leaders summit in September that was dominated by climate change. It has been reported the small island nation of Kiribati has bought land in Fiji in case the country must evacuate and that seawater is encroaching on grave sites in the Marshall Islands. Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who boycotted the Pacific Island Forum leaders summit, urged Australia to abandon the ""coalition of the selfish"" and put the welfare of the Pacific islands ahead of coal industry interests. Australia's Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg believes there is a moral case for the country to continue developing coal interests for export as a way to provide electricity to impoverished and developing nations such as India. However Fraser said this view is ""nonsense,"" arguing it is the vulnerable people who are going to suffer the most and have the greatest difficulty in adjusting to global warming, including those in India. Fraser said current post-2020 policies, which he predicts will actually see temperature increase by three degrees, are not without cost. ""But the costs of not doing these kinds of things and having to contend with a three-degree increase in global warming, or even something bigger than that, those costs are even greater,"" Fraser said. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull defended Australia's coal industry, saying a moratorium would not make ""the blindest bit of difference to global emissions."" ""If Australia stopped exporting coal to the countries to which we export, they would simply buy it from somewhere else."" Coal is an important part of Australia's energy agenda as ""energy poverty is one of the big limits on global development,"" Turnbull said, while acknowledging the improvements in renewable energy technology had been ""extraordinary.""

""This is one of the best recognitions for our efforts made during the implementation of a sustainable development strategy,"" said Zhai Jingli, deputy CEO of the company. The practices of APP-China and other model companies in environmental protection will be compiled into a report that will be submitted by the United Nations Global Compact to the United Nations in Paris in December. A warmup for the climate change conference, this year's summit, organized primarily by the Global Compact Network China, aimed to showcase tangible actions and achievements by Chinese governments, companies and regions in handling climate change and achieving sustainable development. Zhai said papermaking has faced challenges of high resource and energy consumption and high pollution. ""Many people believe the paper industry runs counter to environmental protection, and this award helped us prove that the industry can also realize green development,"" she said. ""Nowadays, grim challenges brought about by climate change can no longer be ignored, so a green and low-carbon development strategy should be implemented and promoted as a top priority by Chinese companies and governments at all levels,"" she added. For example, Teguh Ganda Wijaya, chairman of the Asia Pulp and Paper Group, attended last year's United Nations Climate Summit in New York, during which he signed an anti-deforestation pledge, together with a group of government, nongovernment and corporate representatives, to protect the world's forests and cope with climate change, Zhai said. APP-China has considered its ""plantation-pulp-paper integration"" a core business concept for more than two decades to realize sustainable operations in China and uses plantations to supply the primary raw materials to its subsidiaries. The company has 300,000 hectares of plantations in China, which can capture 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year and store 2.17 million tons of carbon. APP-China also values investments in environment protection technologies and related equipment to improve management of water resources and energy and control polluting gases and solid waste. As of this year, the company has invested more than 8.4 billion yuan ($1.35 billion; 1.24 billion euros) to build environmental protection facilities. Its energy consumption and emissions are now both ""far better than the national standards"", Zhai said. Last year, it initiated the largest photovoltaic project in the pulp and paper industry, with a total investment of nearly 2 billion yuan, which will cover its eight plants in Jiangsu and Hainan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. The project requires 4 million square meters - an equivalent to 560 football fields - of solar photovoltaic panels and would realize an annual power output of 200 million kilowatt hours when completed. Compared with a thermal power plant with the same generating capacity, it can annually save nearly 80,000 tons of coal and reduce 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions and 17,000 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions.

To some extent, this was understandable. Opposition to environmental action  from the fossil-fuel industry, political parties, and portions of the media  has been formidable.But the result was a discussion that was far removed from the issues that are most important to ordinary people. Instead of discussing how ineffective public transport and polluted air was making life worse for billions of people, the talk centered on carbon trading, emissions trajectories and the industrialization of China.Fortunately, the discussion is now being brought back down to earth. In less than 35 years, some 66 percent of the global population will live in cities. Much of this urban growth will occur in developing countries, especially in Africa. In Latin America, nearly 80 percent of people already live in urban centers.For city dwellers, the environment can be an existential priority. If droughts continue to threaten the water supply of Sao Paolo, for example, Latin America\' s most populous city could be at risk of urban failure. This crisis and others like it provides an opportunity for citizens to take control and deploy innovative solutions that might inspire others.When national and municipal governments ask people about their priorities and needs, the answer is clear. Chile\' s government set a precedent in the region by meticulously mapping citizens\' priorities on the environment and climate. According to the government\' s poll, air pollution is Chileans\' top environmental priority (33 percent), followed by waste (21 percent) and noise (11 percent).Costa Ricans also see air pollution as an environmental priority (22 percent), followed by waste (20 percent) and water (17 percent), according to a poll conducted by the United Nations Development Programme. In China, environmental protection is increasingly becoming a top public concern. More than shopping centersIn today\' s world, people expect more from their countries and cities than growth and shopping centers.As we develop a better understanding of ordinary people\' s needs and priorities, those negotiating a global agreement at the United Nations in Paris later this year would be wise to take note. It is crucial that governments make their citizens\' concerns the top priority.Chile has set a positive precedent in the developing world by carrying out extensive consultations on its national climate commitment for Paris. Mexico and Brazil have launched formal consultation processes, too. Other countries in the region might follow suit.National and local politicians are being held to increasingly higher standards of environmental protection.

Since its founding in 2009, the annual conference has brought together nearly 10,000 government leaders, ecological experts and entrepreneurs from China and abroad including big names like British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. An independent international organization committed to improving the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders in shaping global, regional and industry agendas, the Eco Forum Global promotes sharing knowledge and experience in implementing policies regarding green economic transformation and ecological security, thus contributing to the construction of a more environmental friendly and resourceful society.The three-day conference in 2014 drew over 2,000 guests from governments, academia, enterprises, UN organizations, NGOs and media around the world. The Guiyang eco forum has become a platform to spread ecological concepts and promote exchange between stakeholders from all walks of life as well as promoting the construction of ecological civilization.The concept of ecological civilization results from human reflection on traditional civilizations, especially industrial civilization which, over the past two centuries, has created modern society and kindled tremendous social change, but at the same time wrought massive damage on the planet. Therefore, an ecological civilization which advocates respect for nature and the laws of nature is the last available choice for human beings. In February 2013, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) first included ideas for ecological civilization proposed by Chinese participants in its documents, a development evidencing the recognition and resonance of China\' s ecological civilization concepts by the international community.  I think everyone has noticed that the public is more sensitive and concerned about our living environment, remarks Zhang Xinsheng, executive chairman of the forum.  Eco Forum Global echoes the aspirations and calls from the inner hearts of the people. The only national-level eco conference, Eco Forum Global has been held six years in a row. Its persistence stresses that ecological problems have become a key issue both in China and abroad. Internationally, the year of 2015 will witness the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio +20) in September and United Nations in Paris in December. Also, 2015 marks the final year of China\' s 12th Five-Year Plan, in which the eco civilization has become a priority of the Chinese government. This month, the central leadership of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a document to authorize accelerating construction of an ecological civilization. The document noted that the declining ecology is already limiting the nation\' s further development and emphasized that China\' s ecological civilization is an integral component of national rejuvenation.  When we examine our own lives and realize that the most basic living requirements such as air and water are worsening, we become more willing to pursue green and sustainable lifestyles, which leads to changes in development modes, continues Zhang.  The pursuit of GDP and economic growth at the expense of the environment is abandoned. Such ideas are what our forum wants to communicate and promote. Guiyang, the host city of the forum, has been a national pioneer in ecological development. Guiyang has been honored several times as one of China\' s lowest-carbon cities. Its goal of achieving green development has paid off, further driving transformation of the city\' s development mode.?\l"

He hoped the leaders make commitment in Paris to reach an agreement aiming to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius. The main temperature of Adriatic Sea was around 20 degrees Celsius in the 20th century, but reached 27 degrees Celsius during recent 2 decades, a record high 31 degrees Celsius has been seen in recent years in the sea nearby Hver Island, the southern coast of Croatia, according to Dulcic. He warned that ""sea temperature could rise by about 3.5 degree at the end of 2100 if we do not take measures to control."" Rising sea temperature has affected not only the composition and quantity of phytoplankton and zooplankton, the food for fish, but also species of fish, subsequently the marine ecosystem, said Dulcic, the author of the book New Fish of Adriatic Sea and Mediterranean. A total of about 40 new species of fish recorded in the Adriatic ichthyofauna in last ten years, including 14 Lessepsian migrants, a name given to the fish from the Red Sea and the Indo-Pacific following the operation of Suez Cannel after Ferdinand Lesseps the constructor of Suze Cannel, according to Dulcic. Adriatic fishermen found, for example, in their nets more and more the subtropical and tropical fish, algae and snails, he said, adding that a flock of tropical dolphin fish, living in warm waters of Indonesia and the Atlantic have been seen in Pula, Istria Peninsula of northern coast of the Adriatic in Croatia. ""The scientists are working on if new species are threatening local and endemic species of the Adriatic, but it was sure that alien fishes are definitely a factor damaging the ecological and biological balance of all the communities of the Adriatic Sea,"" he said. He added some species, such as Siganus luridus, are in competition for food completely suppressed and significantly reduce the number of native species, Bamboofish Salema. Some alien species have a direct impact on the food chain, for example, Fish Bluespotted Cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), an express predator favouring anchovies, girom, beech as food, does not have natural enemies in the new ecosystem that led to out of control of its numbers. Thus, invasive species was believed as one of the main causes of threat to biodiversity worldwide, as well as in Croatian, he said.

The aim of IRENA is to activate the COP21 Paris agreement held in December 2014, where over 190 countries conceded to limit global temperature increase to below two degrees Celsius. Ministers, bankers and green energy experts said at the sixth annual IRENA assembly Sunday that investment in green energy can only be increased through developing sector research, closing current gaps between funding and green energy companies and the transformation of policy into action. Rachel Kyte, CEO of the UN's initiative of Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, said at the ministerial roundtable that future investment into wind, solar or bio-energy must be based on specialized research in order to identify why funding for renewable energy supply and demand is still lacking."" According to Adnan Z. Amin, IRENA Director-General, investment into renewable energy reached approximately 329 U.S. billion dollars in 2015. The Paris COP21 clarified that investment must progress throughout all industries and regions, he said. While renewable energy currently accounts for over 22 percent of total global capacity in the global power sector since 2011, the industry is still growing, said Kyung-Ah Park, Managing Director and Head of Environment Markets Group at the United States investment bank Goldman Sachs. ""Stock-listed green energy firms worldwide have a combined market capital of 300 billion dollars, equal to the U.S. oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil's market value,"" Ms. Park added. Ms. Park also said that while 's objective of limiting global temperature increase to below two degrees Celsius is an important symbolic step, ""markets focus on action and on matching supply with demand rather than on semantics and policies."" She also pressed for increased transparency regarding credit histories of green energy producing firms. In response, SE4All's Kyte stated that further research is needed to discover the reasons why clean energy succeeded with some projects whereas in other cases funding failed to jumpstart further projects. ""We also need additional data on risk appetite among potential investors"" she added. Maximus Johnity Ongkili, Malaysia's Minister of Energy, Green Technology and Water, said Malaysia already reached a 33 percent green energy per capita share, ""surpassing the 27th ASEAN summit agreement held in Kuala Lumpur in November. However if hydro energy is reduced in Malaysia, shares will drop to below 20 percent, and we won't risk developing solar and wind energy."" Malaysia is prepared to cooperate with IRENA to mitigate funding of sustainable energy projects. \l"

"COP21","China","COP21_China123","Clean coal to keep emissions at bay, propel use of renewable energy","December 15, 2015 Tuesday","China Daily","Coal-fired power will continue to be the mainstay of China's electricity supply and will see a 45 percent growth from the current levels by 2040, despite expectations that the country may gradually move away from the commodity, experts said.Though the government has said that it will cap China's coal use at 4.2 billion metric tons by 2020, the country's energy strategy for 2014 to 2020 shows that coal will be the main source of energy for a long time. At the same time, the government has also made it clear it would step up research into cleaner coal technologies.China Shenhua Energy Co Ltd, the nation's biggest coal producer by volume, has already started to offer clean coal as part of its product range. Eager to cut pollutants and emissions, the company has built two ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plants in Ninghai county and Zhoushan of East China's Zhejiang province.Benjamin Sporton, chief executive officer of the London-based World Coal Association, said the approach taken by the Chinese government is in many ways a roadmap for other countries looking to reconcile use of coal with a desire to increase use of renewable energies.""From a long-term perspective, lower-cost, cleaner coal technologies will have an important role to play alongside other low-emission technologies such as wind and solar,"" said Sporton.China plans to increase the share of non-fossil energy in its primary energy consumption to 20 percent by 2030. Sporton said this is an ambitious target, but it means that by 2030 China will still get 80 percent of its energy from coal, oil and gas.As the world's top coal producer and consumer, China consumed 3.51 billion tons of coal and imported 291 million tons of coal in 2014, data from the National Development and Reform Commission showed.Mick Buffier, group executive for coal business at Anglo-Swiss mining giant Glencore Plc, said: ""Urbanization and government efforts to promote sustainable development are driving demand for more energy-efficient technologies and solutions in China.""To better use the energy, Buffier said the government can convert excess industrial heat into urban heating through new technologies and international cooperation, as well as building more modern high-efficiency low-emission supercritical and ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plants that emit 35 percent less carbon dioxide than older sub-critical plants.In the United Nations climate change conference that closed over the weekend in Paris, the Chinese government stressed that cutting emissions ""is not at others' request but on our own initiative"" and the promotion of clean energy and energy efficiency has been highlighted in proposals for the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20).The country's cumulative investment in promoting non-fossil fuels and developing low-carbon technologies is likely to exceed 40 trillion yuan ($6.2 trillion) between 2015 and 2030, according to the Beijing-based National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, a government think tank.Ding Rijia, a professor at the China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing, said coal-fired power plants are not the major cause of pollution. Rather, industrial boilers and small, inefficient coal-fired boilers are mainly to blame for carbon emissions.According to Ding, such boilers cause more pollution than coal-fired power plants, although they only use 70 percent as much coal.China's total share of the energy mix will fall from 76 percent to 52 percent in 2040. During the same period renewable energies will grow by more than 300 percent. The demand for electricity in the country will roughly double through to 2040, according to Paris-based International Energy Agency's New Policies Scenario.

"COP21","China","COP21_China125","The net zero imperative in fighting climate change","December 16, 2015 Wednesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","The world has reached an historic agreement on climate change. The deal concluded at the United Nations in Paris commits countries to take steps to limit warming to  well below two-degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels and to pursue  efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. It also obliges developed countries to provide US$100 billion per year in assistance to developing countries. But, unfortunately, the final negotiations dropped the one number that truly matters for the future of our planet: zero.That is the net amount of carbon dioxide we can emit if we are ever to stabilize the planet\' s temperature at any level. Zero, none, nada. The Earth\' s atmosphere-ocean system is like a bathtub filling up with CO2 and other greenhouse gases: the higher the level, the warmer the planet will be.The emissions tap must be turned off once the bathtub reaches a level associated with a certain level of warming  say, two degrees, above which, scientists nearly unanimously agree, the risks become severe, tipping points become possible, and civilization\' s ability to adapt is not guaranteed. Otherwise, the atmospheric bathtub will keep being filled, warming the planet three, four, five degrees, and so on, until emissions eventually stop  or we go extinct. The sooner we turn off the tap, the lower the temperature at which the climate stabilizes, the less risk we will face, and the lower the cost we will incur in adapting to a warmer planet.Only about half the CO2 we dump into the atmosphere stays there  the rest is quickly redistributed into the oceans and biosphere. But, as the oceans become increasingly saturated and able to absorb less, the amount that is redistributed is declining. The only way to get CO2 out of the bathtub once it\' s there is, almost literally, to bail it out. There are natural processes that  re-fossilize CO2, but they are far too slow to matter.So we are in a race. Can we turn the tap to zero net emissions before the tub hits a level that takes us above the two-degree threshold set in Paris? In fact, even that level may not be low enough. Change or dieAs the Paris agreement recognizes, many scientists believe that warming above 1.5 degrees is risky and that adaptation to it will be extremely expensive, particularly for developing countries and island states.The good news is that if we somehow stopped all emissions today, temperatures would continue to rise only for a decade or so, before stabilizing. But with the emissions tap still on high, we are rapidly running out of room in the tub. We can emit less than half of our historical CO2 emissions to date before we probably exceed the two-degree threshold. On our current course, we will reach that point by 2040-2050.This is why most scientists and a growing number of business leaders and investors are calling for a clear goal that emissions must go to net-zero before warming reaches two degrees. In May 2015, the International Chamber of Commerce and CEOs from around the world called for a zero-emissions goal. It is a goal that sends an unambiguous signal that CO2-emitting industries will either have to change or die. While the net-zero objective was dropped by the negotiators in Paris, it should be endorsed by individual countries in their plans, reinforced by the G-20, and eventually enshrined in the UN agreement. For the planet, it is zero or bust.Eric Beinhocker is Executive Director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford.

Korean parliament ratifies FTA with China, step toward regional integration","November 30, 2015 Monday 4:47 AM EST","Xinhua General News Service","South Korea's parliament on Monday ratified its free trade agreement (FTA) with China, taking an important step toward regional economic integration. The ratification bill on the China-South Korea free trade accord was passed through the National Assembly by a majority of 196 to 33 with 36 abstentions. China and South Korea signed the bilateral FTA in June after three years of negotiations. Under the deal, the two sides will eliminate tariffs on more than 90 percent of traded goods each within 20 years after implementation. South Korea expected the free trade accord with China to raise its real GDP by 0.96 percentage points and create about 53,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. The South Korean government said in a statement that it will make best efforts to implement the deal by minimizing necessary local procedures and closely consulting with the Chinese side. Seoul anticipated that the FTA with China will help boost its exports, which have been suffering this year from the global economic slowdown. South Korea's export tumbled 15.9 percent in October from a year earlier, logging the biggest monthly reduction in more than six years. The China-South Korea FTA is also expected to help accelerate regional economic integration. ""The (South) Korea-China FTA is a good starting point that leads to negotiations of the trilateral FTA between South Korea, China and Japan as well as of the RECP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership),"" said Kim Young-Gui, research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP). Kim said that the FTA will serve as growth engines for both countries, noting that the FTA will create a chance to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation. ""The (South) Korea-China free trade agreement is now about a bilateral trade, but is anticipated to play a pivotal role that will affect Asia and the whole world,"" said Han Jae-Jin, a senior research fellow at Hyundai Research Institute. Han said that the bilateral FTA has a significant meaning in the region as it will not confined to South Korea and China and can be connected to other Asian nations. KIEP's another research fellow Lee Jang-Gyu also told Xinhua that the free trade accord has a significant meaning as it is the first bilateral FTA in Northeast Asia, saying that it opened door to various possibilities like trilateral FTA between Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo. If the trilateral free trade accord, including Japan as well as China and South Korea, is inked, it would help further strengthen regional economic cooperation. Economic cooperation between China and South Korea has expanded in the past 23 years since the two countries set up diplomatic ties in 1992. After the 2008 global financial crisis, Seoul and Beijing strengthened cooperation further via the won-yuan currency swap deal to stabilize foreign exchange market. Now, China becomes South Korea's largest trading partner while Seoul is Beijing's third-biggest trading partner as a single country. The parliamentary voting was conducted during a plenary session after wrangling between rival parties about the sensitive issue on how to protect farmers from possible damage following the FTA implementation. Before leaving Seoul to participate in the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, South Korean President Park Geun-hye repeatedly urged lawmakers to ratify the deal rapidly, saying that the delayed ratification would make South Korean exporters lose an export opportunity worth about 4 billion won (3.5 million U.S. dollars) every day. The rival parties finally reached a common ground on Monday, agreeing to 1.6 trillion won (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) worth of supplementary measures, including a 1-trillion-won fund to support farmers. \l"

Xi stressed China and the United States should stick to the right direction of building a new-type of major-country relations and the principles of non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect as well as cooperation and win-win results. He urged China and the United States to advance their practical communication and cooperation at bilateral, regional and global levels and manage differences and sensitive issues in a constructive manner, so as to maintain the sustained, healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, and safeguard and promote peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific and the world at large. The Chinese president called on China and the United States to maintain exchanges at high and other levels and plan for their institutionalized dialogues and consultations to make sure that more positive and substantial achievements will be made. In the face of weak global economic recovery, Xi said, countries should attach great importance to stabilizing growth, opposing trade protectionism and safeguarding a multilateral trade mechanism of openness, transparency and inclusiveness. China and the United States should enhance coordination and cooperation on macro-economic policies and within the international financial framework, and strive for early conclusion of negotiations for bilateral investment agreement to create an environment of fair competition for each other's companies. The Chinese president also called for greater contribution from both countries to properly solving major international and regional issues. Pointing out that China and the United States should respect each other's core interests and major concerns, Xi urged the two countries to properly deal with differences through dialogue and consultation. It is in the common interests of China and the United States to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Xi said, demanding concrete actions from the U.S. side to support the peaceful development of the cross-strait relations. On cyber issues, Xi urged China and the United States to meet each other half way, show sincerity and join efforts with the international community to formulate global rules for cyber space and build a peaceful, safe and transparent cyber space. Obama said the United States is ready to maintain close communication with China on bilateral cooperation, global security, marco-economy, climate change and other hotspot issues through bilateral mechanisms like the strategic and economic dialogue and the army-to-army dialogue. The United States and China further strengthening cooperation on global issues will benefit the whole world, Obama said. The U.S. side is convinced that the United States and China have more common interests than differences, and is confident of the deep development of bilateral cooperation, according to the U.S. president. Obama said he is looking forward to attending the G20 summit scheduled next year in China's eastern city of Hangzhou.

The European economy is recovering because investment and growth are returning and the euro has become more stable, Hollande told Chinese business leaders at a breakfast seminar hosted by the China Entrepreneur Club in Beijing on Nov 3. ""France is one of the eurozone countries that has been building a more flexible and open monetary system to help some eurozone nations to adjust their economic policies,"" said Hollande, whose visit came days after that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel to China and President Xi Jingping's trip to Britain from Oct 19 to 23. Hollande said foreign investment had been growing impressively, and he called for Chinese investors to continue to invest more in France, especially in innovative and green industries. ""I can feel the vitality of the Chinese economy from Chinese entrepreneurs' global vision and strategy,"" he said. ""Not a single door is closed against"" Chinese investors and ""no sovereignty issue comes between us"" in terms of business exchanges, as France believes sustainable Chinese investment will give it more vitality, he said. Hollande's audience included business figures such as, Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, which has recently set up a representative office in Paris; Guo Guangchang, chairman of investment group Fosun, which took over the French resort chain Club Med for $1.3 billion in January; and Liu Chuanzhi, founder of the computer company Lenovo, the products of which can be found in homes throughout France. ""Club Med is the longest, toughest and at the same time happiest acquisition in my life,"" Guo says. ""The acquisition has convinced me that France is an open and transparent market and shows no bias against private companies like ours."" About 200 Chinese companies operate in France, creating more than 20,000 jobs, and 3,000 French companies employ more than 500,000 people in China, Hollande said. He also met President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing to explore how the two countries can work together to make the United Nations in Paris, which begins on Nov 30, a success. Xi and Hollande issued a joint statement on climate change on Nov 2, vowing to push an ambitious and ""legally binding"" agreement in Paris based on equity, and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The 12-day conference is widely expected to result in a global and binding agreement on tackling climate change. The two presidents witnessed the signing of 17 documents covering collaboration in areas including energy, aerospace and electricity. In a meeting with Hollande, Li said the two sides should build demonstration projects together in green industries to tap third-party markets. Collaboration in third-party markets is a pioneering and innovative move for deepening South-North cooperation and is conducive to global economic recovery, Li said. He noted the positive progress Chinese and French companies have made in third-party market collaboration and urged both sides to continue on this course. During Xi's visit to Britain last month, Chinese and French companies signed an agreement to build an 18 billion pound ($27.8 billion; 25.4 billion euros) nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C, with a Chinese consortium holding a one-third stake.

French President Fran?ois Hollande is paying a state visit to China on Nov. 2-3, a major event for Sino-French relations. It\' s Hollande\' s second visit to the nation, since he assumed office. This visit occurs amidst growing high-level exchanges between China and Europe. Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to the United Kingdom on Nov. 19-23, which was a tremendous success. Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel had just visited China over the weekend. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang had accompanied her to Hefei, his hometown. It''s Merkel\' s 8th visit to the country. The King of Netherlands paid a state visit to China on Oct. 25-29. Before the end of year, the China and Eastern and Central Europe Summit will take place in China. It''s the first time China and Europe have held such intensive exchanges. China-Europe cooperation is gathering strong momentum. Better cooperation is not accidental. The Chinese and European economies are complementary. Europe holds numerous assets, such as high-tech products, innovations, great brands and a mature market. China has a huge market with strong growth potential. Chinese companies are going global. Europe is an important destination for them. Further cooperation can give a strong boost to both sides in economic development. And since the end of the Cold War, the world has moved into a transitional period. The major issue for international affairs has been mono-polarity versus multi-polarity. China and Europe stand for multi-polarity. Hollande''s state visit offers an excellent opportunity to develop China-French cooperation in many areas. Climate change is a major challenge facing humanity. France will host the United Nations from November 30 to December 11. Sino-French cooperation is crucial for its success. Last July, Premier Li visited France and signed a joint statement to target the third country market, an important break-through for international cooperation to defuse futile rivalries. On Oct 21, the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group and EDF had agreed to jointly build and run a nuclear power station in Hinckley Point, UK. Additionally, China and France can do much more together in Africa as well. Cooperation between Chinese and French SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) offer huge potential. France has many excellent SMEs, but they have difficulties penetrating the Chinese market. Hollande''s visit gives opportunity for the two sides to facilitate more cooperation between Chinese and French SMEs. France has strong capacity for innovations, which needs the market to fly. China can provide those market conditions. France has proven to be open-minded with China in terms of the transfer of technology. Paris was the first to sign a science and technology agreement with Beijing. France is the world''s 6th largest economy. However, bilateral trade between China and France lags behind that of China and the Netherlands. Last year, the trade volume between China and France was 55 billion US dollars, while trade volume between China and the Netherlands was 86.4 billion US dollars. There is no reason for France to lag behind the Netherlands, if they work together. The Chinese appreciate French culture. For many Chinese tourists, France is their first destination of choice. So, what stands in the way of further cooperation? Chinese tourists'' safety is a major concern. At the meeting of a visiting Chinese Entrepreneurs Club delegation in France in June 2013, Hollande promised to ensure more safety for Chinese tourists. France was the first to establish diplomatic ties in 1964 with Beijing among the major Western powers. Sino-French relations are mature. Hollande\' s China visit may push ahead for better bilateral relations.\l"

"COP21","China","COP21_China133","Climate change action both moral and economical","June 17, 2015 Wednesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","Nowadays, people are too often forced to choose between doing what is morally right and doing what is economically beneficial. Indeed, their options sometimes appear to be mutually exclusive, making the decision of which path to take exceedingly challenging. Sometimes, however, moral rectitude and economic interest merge, presenting an opportunity that must not be missed. That is the case from the perspectives of this Archbishop and former finance minister with the world\' s response to climate change.The moral imperative is indisputable, as the effects of climate change are felt most keenly by the global poor, who have also benefited the least from the economic activities that cause it. Moreover, climate change could accelerate poverty and inequality in the future, meaning that, unless we address it in a timely manner, it will diminish  or even eliminate  future generations\' chances to achieve their development goals. Making every effort to minimize climate change today is, quite simply, the right thing to do.Fortunately, the economic benefits of addressing climate change are also clear. After all, climate change carries significant economic costs. Moreover, building a green economy, based on continued technological innovation, is the smartest and most efficient way to create new engines of sustainable growth and job creation for the next generation.A global problemAction at the individual, company, municipal, and national levels is crucial. But the fact is that climate change is a global problem  and thus requires a global solution. The most important tool the world has for doing the right thing  and reaping vast economic benefits  is a universal climate-change agreement. That is why world leaders must take the opportunity presented by the United Nations in Paris this December to develop a single global framework for action.In fact, world leaders already pledged to do so. The UN Climate Change Conference in 2011, initiated and hosted by South Africa, produced an agreement to adopt a universal legal agreement on climate change as soon as possible, no later than this year.Important progress has been made since the Durban conference. Last month, more than 30 countries submitted their post-2020 plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. In the coming weeks and months, this momentum will continue to build, as other countries submit their commitments as well.But if the Paris meeting is to be successful  in terms of both fulfilling the moral imperative and capturing the economic benefits of confronting climate change  every participating country must submit its national contributions for the period beginning in 2020 as soon as possible. Furthermore, the final agreement must include an effective and ambitious plan for de-carbonization over the next 50 years.The fact is that short- and medium-term commitments alone are simply inadequate to fulfill the pledge, made by the world\' s governments in 2009 and reiterated in 2010, to cap the rise in global temperatures at two degrees Celsius relative to the pre-industrial era. It is crucial to create  and adhere to  a progressive long-term emissions-reduction strategy that sends a clear signal to capital markets that governments are serious about confronting climate change.The moral and economic imperatives to act on climate change could not be stronger. Although the road ahead will be difficult, with new and unexpected challenges arising along the way, we can find inspiration in Nelson Mandela\' s famous dictum:  It always seems impossible until it\' s done. We face an unprecedented opportunity to achieve a more sustainable, prosperous, and socially just future. Desmond Tutu is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town.

[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]Eager to enhance the world's ability to tackle desertification, China's Elion Resources Group conducted the study on the Kubuqi Desert - China's seventh largest desert in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region as an example to promote the awareness of environmental protection in France.The study released in the World Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) at Le Bourget, near Paris, showed that Elion Resources restored 12,700 square kilometers of the desert over a 27-year period in a remediation project that helped with poverty relief and benefitted 100,000 people and created jobs for more than 1 million.Wang Wenbiao, president of Elion Resources, said the control of desertification is very important for coping with climate change and that hot, arid desert areas accounting for around a fourth of the planet's land surface have a great effect on climate change. He told the gathering at COP21.The Kubuqi Action Plan of Global Desertification Control (2015-25) was passed at the Fifth Kubuqi International Desert Forum in July in China.The action plan is one of the initiatives supported by the UN convention. It includes targets to improve technology management around the world, especially in developing countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt, which runs through Asia to Europe.""It will promote a public-private partnership to encourage the participation of enterprises and individuals. Elion Resources will finance the planting of 130 million trees along the belt in the next three to five years,"" said Wang.Desertification is a thorny problem that faces many countries. Over 110 countries are beset by desertification, which costs them up to $50 billion annually and affects the livelihoods of about a billion impoverished people.

"COP21","China","COP21_China137","The surprisingly simple solution to climate change","January 12, 2016 Tuesday","China Daily European Edition","We are at a crucial juncture in the history of our planet. The global agreement at COP21 is an unprecedented commitment to pre-empt a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. Now is the time to change fundamentally the way we use the world's resources - or face the consequences. The opportunities, and benefits, of acting now are immense. Governments have taken a significant step in the right direction by submitting national pledges to reduce emissions. The collective pledges by 185 nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions mark a historic breakthrough. For the first time, there is a shared commitment to limit global warming to less than 2\\xB0C.Improving energy efficiencyA bottom-up approach to setting national targets, country by country, has achieved more at this stage than attempting to impose a framework for cooperation from the top down. However, the sum of these individual pledges is not yet sufficient to achieve our shared goal, as this chart shows. The crucial next step is a review mechanism, agreed at COP21, to revise national targets over time.Energy efficiency gives us the power to make up the deficit. The stated goal in this process is a rise of 1.5\\xB0C in global temperatures. If we can double the annual rate of improvement in energy efficiency, the ambitions set out at COP21 will become reality. This is a pivotal moment, an opportunity to do business differently.Clever use of energy will unlock a host of economic and social - not to mention environmental - benefits. Best of all, solutions to this great energy challenge already exist. We know that we have to do more to reduce carbon emissions. We don't have to wait for answers or new inventions. The digital, energy-efficient technologies that we need are already available.Lighting is one of the easiest places to start. At Philips, we believe there are two key strategies for energy efficiency: first, in developed countries, we should speed up the pace of renovation of existing infrastructure; second, we can help developing countries to leapfrog to solar-LED lighting, effectively a zero-energy solution.Climate change: a light-bulb momentLighting accounts for a staggering 19% of global electricity consumption, yet we still cling to outdated and inefficient alternatives. LED lighting consumes at least 40% less energy than conventional lighting - and that's just the beginning.Intelligent LEDs, embedded with sensors and connected wirelessly, can be managed remotely via the internet. Their potential in tackling climate change is immense: connected lighting can deliver savings of up to 80% as households, businesses and entire cities reduce their environmental impact.Our most recent estimate is that a universal switch to LED could slash lighting's share of electricity consumption to just 7%, a saving of (EURO)272 billion and a reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions of about 1,400 megatons by 2030.Two years ago, Los Angeles began installing 140,000 LED street lights. Last year, the city reported energy savings of 63% and cost savings of nearly $9 million. Now consider this: of approximately 300 million streetlights across the world, only about 10% are LEDs. And just 1% are connected. Failure to bring this technology to scale would be a missed opportunity.Social and economic benefitsEnergy efficiency does not entail sacrifice - quite the opposite. It can help reduce climate change, while bringing huge economic and social benefits. Simply doubling our progress in energy efficiency - from the current rate of 1.3% to, say, 3% per year - would create 6 million new jobs within five years. At the same time, by 2030, that would cut the world's energy bill by more than $2 trillion.Cleaner, energy-efficient light is also an urgent humanitarian need. Around one in seven people are trapped in light poverty. That's 1.1 billion people, cut off from the grid with no access to electric light in their homes. Many resort to kerosene lamps and candles, pollutants which claim 1.5 million lives every year through respiratory illnesses and fires.Off-grid solar LED can end this injustice, at a fraction of the cost of kerosene or grid lighting. Bringing these communities out of darkness would trigger a huge stimulus for development, with positive effects for global growth. These countries have an opportunity to start from scratch with greener, money-saving lighting while the rest of the world still has to play catch-up.Teaming up to safeguard the future of our planet In pleading for a global wake-up call to prioritize energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, we at Philips are playing our part. In two decades, we've cut our usage of non-renewable sources from 92% to 45%. We are walking the talk, adopting energy-efficiency measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our business. At COP21 we pledged to shrink our carbon footprint to zero by 2020. Making a real difference requires a potent combination of political will, entrepreneurial drive and new financial models. To limit global warming will take a revolution, one that will safeguard the future of our planet by unlocking massive benefits for the economy, for business, and for society. Acting together, we can achieve both the detailed targets and the greater vision agreed at COP21.\l"

The president ""welcomes the adoption of the Paris Agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,"" said a statement issued here by his spokesperson. ""Today's agreement signals nothing less than a renaissance for humankind as we collectively embrace the global challenge of climate change and endeavor to transition to a more sustainable way of living that respects the needs of people and our planet,"" the statement said. The historic Paris Agreement on climate change is finally adopted Saturday by the 196 Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) during the COP21 hosted by France. The new agreement has 31 pages with 29 articles, including objective, mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. On the basis of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, the Paris Agreement calls for aiming to hold global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and strives for limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ""This is a turning point in human history that brought us all together in a global effort to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5\'b0C,"" the statement said. ""This agreement reaffirms the value of multilateralism in addressing global challenges."" The General Assembly congratulated the French presidency of the Conference on successfully steering this process and all Parties to the Convention on their constructiveness and determination to reach this outcome, said the statement. ""This Agreement lays the foundations to achieve the transformation to a low-emission and climate-resilient global economy,"" the statement said. ""This Agreement signals a transformation that seeks to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication, while preserving planet's integrity for future generations.""

"COP21","China","COP21_China139","Long march against climate change likely to pay off","December 7, 2015 Monday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","AT first glance, the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Paris from November 30 to December 11 looks a lot like the 2009 conference in Copenhagen, when negotiators were unable to agree on an effective accord. And indeed, the desired outcome remains unchanged: an international deal that will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.But there are notable differences this time around. The stiff economic headwinds that negotiators confronted six years ago have been replaced by a tailwind of opportunity. No longer is the conversation limited to burden sharing and sacrifice; increasingly, there is talk of innovation and technological breakthroughs that make sustainable development possible.Furthermore, the agreement to be reached in Paris is being built from the bottom up. It is clear that whatever shape the agreement takes, it will not be totally top-down. So countries have been asked to propose what they think they can achieve in terms of reducing emissions after 2020, through so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). And while this solution may not yet be adequate to the challenge of heading off the consequences of climate change, it is a strong step forward.Meanwhile, in the years since the Copenhagen summit, there has been a surge of concrete progress on the part of the non-state actors whose cooperation will be needed to implement an international agreement. An unprecedented number of scientists, business leaders and sub-national government politicians such as mayors and governors have made clear the need for an agreement in Paris. Broad support for a robust accord is reflected in the more than 10,000 commitments to combat climate change made by cities, regions, companies, and investors.Emerging consensusThis emerging consensus was also reflected in May at the Business & Climate Summit and Climate Finance Day, where investors and business leaders pledged to lead the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Participants at the two events called for setting a price on carbon, phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies, more partnerships with governments, and the coupling of public and private finance to diffuse the risks of low-carbon investments.And in July, more than 2,000 researchers meeting in Paris at a conference called Our Common Future Under Climate Change concluded that ambitious efforts at mitigating carbon dioxide emissions would be economically feasible and have numerous knock-on benefits.

"COP21","China","COP21_China140","Improving political, economic environment could lead to climate breakthroughs in Paris","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","IN 2009, when Copenhagen hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference, I was there as a member of parliament, and I had the feeling that I was witnessing a world-changing event.For years, negotiators had been working toward an ambitious, binding agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, and the world\' s attention was directed toward Denmark.Unfortunately, the global financial crisis and national special interests colluded to derail a comprehensive deal.Now, climate negotiators are gathering once again  this time in Paris, where expectations for an agreement are equally high. This time, however, chances are good that a robust deal will be struck. I believe that this year\' s conference will mark the moment when the world got serious about bringing global warming under control.The political environment is very different from that of six years ago. When the conference in Copenhagen took place, the world was still reeling from the near-collapse of global finance, prominent politicians were questioning whether human activity was responsible for climate change, and industry groups were campaigning against binding emission cuts.Today, the global economy is recovering, climate scientists have dismissed the last doubts about the causes of climate change, and the business community has entered the fight on the side of the environment.In 2009, green business leaders could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Today, their ranks have grown into an army. In November, for example, Goldman Sachs announced that it would invest US$150 billion in green energy by 2025.Changing dynamicsThe dynamics of the negotiations themselves have changed fundamentally. The goal is no longer to forge an agreement dictating the emission cuts that countries must make; instead, we are developing a framework for reducing emissions that allows governments to decide what their countries can put on the table.As a result, individual countries are driving the deal forward. They have realized that the consequences of doing nothing will be dire, and that cutting emissions will pay off over the long run.Signs of progress are everywhere. Last year, for example, the United States and China entered into a bilateral agreement to fight climate change. The US agreed to reduce its CO2 emissions by 26-28 percent by 2025, and China committed to reaching peak emissions around 2030 and bringing emissions down thereafter.More needs to be doneThis new approach has broadly expanded the scope of the climate negotiations. The agreement in Paris is set to include more than 180 countries, and cover at least 90 percent of global CO2 emissions. By comparison, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol covered less than 15 percent of global emissions.To be sure, much more can and needs to be done. Denmark will continue the fight against climate change.Over the next 25 years, global demand for energy will increase by almost a third, and we must ensure that this demand is met in as sustainable a manner as possible. Organizations such as the International Energy Agency could play an even larger role in helping to drive the clean-energy transition.The international community seems on track to reach the goal agreed to in Copenhagen of mobilizing US$100 billion a year in climate financing for developing countries by 2020. To accomplish this, we will need to harness the power of the marketplace, leveraging public funds to attract private investment.In this, the Danish Climate Investment Fund, through which the government invests, together with large Danish pension funds, in climate projects for the benefit of Danish companies, could serve as an example for others.The effort will also involve phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies, as well as developing new financial tools to motivate investors to help solve problems on their own, without relying on public funds.An agreement in Paris would put in place the much-needed global framework the world needs to reduce total greenhouse-gas emissions.And while it would by no means mark the successful conclusion of the fight against climate change, it would provide a strong foundation for the global transition to a green economy.Lars Christian Lilleholt is Denmark\' s minister for energy, utilities, and climate.

So far, however, no such stabilization has taken place.Earlier conferences of the UNFCCC signatories sought to reach legally binding agreements on emission reductions, at least for the industrialized countries that have produced most of the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere. That strategy faltered  partly owing to US intransigence under President George W. Bush  and was abandoned when the 2009 Copenhagen conference failed to produce a treaty to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol (which the US never signed).Instead, the Copenhagen Accord merely asked countries for voluntary pledges to cut their emissions by specific amounts. Those pledges have now come in, from 154 countries, including the major emitters, and they fall far short of what is required.To fathom the gap between what the pledges would achieve and what is required, we need to go back to the language that everyone accepted in Rio.The wording was vague in two key respects. First, what would constitute  dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system ? And, second, what level of safety is assumed by the term  prevent ?The first ambiguity has been resolved by the decision to aim for a level of emissions that would cap the increase in average surface temperature at two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level.Remaining ambiguityThe second ambiguity remains. The London School of Economics\' Grantham Research Institute has analyzed the submissions made by all 154 countries and concluded that even if they are all implemented, global carbon emissions will rise from their current level of 50 billion tons per year to 55-60 billion tons by 2030. But, to have even a 50 percent chance of keeping to the 2 degree limit, annual carbon emissions need to come down to 36 billion tons.A report from Australia\' s National Centre for Climate Restoration is no less alarming. The level of emissions in the atmosphere today already means that we have a 10 percent chance of exceeding two degrees, even if we stopped adding further emissions right now (which is not going to happen).Imagine if an airl"

Considering that there are nearly 900 million people across the globe suffering from hunger, the food wasted in developed countries is roughly the same amount as food produced in the poorest regions. This, he said, demonstrates that the current ways of production and consumption are not sustainable.Identified as the ""year of development,"" during which many important meetings, including the UN Sustainable Development Summit, have been successfully held, by the end of 2015 many other highly anticipated meetings, including the United Nations in Paris will also be conducted.Global governanceWu believes these processes are an example of the type of global governance that can put the world on a sustainable pathway to foster human prosperity while protecting our planet. ""Agenda 2030, with its 17 SDGs and 169 targets, offers us a paradigm shift in the current dominant model of development. It also provides us with new avenues to rethink how we construct a global partnership among countries,"" said Wu.Effective global governance that takes into account the economic, social and environmental dimensions can help achieve Agenda 2030, he added, explaining that it will be essential in achieving the targets that require concerted international action, especially targets on increasing the voice and participation of developing countries in global decision-making.""Global governance can help facilitate the exchange of resources, technologies and capacities countries need to make progress on the targets that have to be implemented,"" he said in the speech.Global governance will also be effective when addressing issues that require fostering and implementing new and existing international law and treaties, such as when dealing with global public goods such as oceans, the climate and forests or when governing trade. This will provide an integrated framework that encourages holistic approaches to sustainable development in which all actors can take action and participate.Strong leadershipThe conference was jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).

The United Nations in Paris in December could mark a turning point in world history: unanimous recognition of the need to act to prevent the most harmful consequences of global warming.But if a deal is to be secured, participants in the conference will have to overcome the mistrust that has led to polarization and inaction during past negotiations. Implementing an agreement with robust limits on greenhouse-gas emissions will first require honoring the commitments that have already been made, including promises by developed countries to spend US$100 billion a year by 2020 to help the developing world mitigate its contribution to climate change and adapt to a warming world.Given the scale of the challenge and the costs that inaction imposes on the world\' s most vulnerable people, development financial institutions and other interested parties must demonstrate their commitment to preventing the most harmful effects of climate change. Doing so requires a renewed and transparent dedication to the effort.That is why the World Bank Group is examining what more can be done to help put economies on a sustainable path. Keeping a keen eye on the national plans being submitted ahead of the Paris summit, we are surveying the full spectrum of our work in order to find opportunities to help countries in the areas of energy, transport, agriculture, forests, urban management, and much more.Indeed, the fight against climate change must be carried out across a wide variety of fronts. Rising global temperatures and an increasingly unstable climate will influence all aspects of development and jeopardize existing investments unless adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies  which are also central to the new Sustainable Development Goals that the United Nations will adopt later this month  are put in place.Part of this effort to fight climate change must involve addressing sources of economic inefficiency, such as fossil-fuel subsidies and inadequate accounting of the cost of pollution. And there is a growing recognition that development funds and climate finance can be used to spur and catalyze investment from public and private sources.But, above all, a successful climate deal will have to include proper measures for the management of the trillions of dollars that will need to be invested in low-carbon infrastructure and increased resilience to the harmful effects of rising global temperatures. This must be carried out in as public and transparent a fashion as possible. Climate financeIt is crucial that we ensure that financial flows being channeled into the fight against climate change can be tracked, so that citizens can hold their governments and institutions to account.In order to accomplish this, the six large multilateral development banks and the International Development Finance Club  a network of national, regional, and international development institutions  have been painstakingly working on developing common principles for tracking climate finance. These principles should apply to all projects intended to help countries adapt to or mitigate the impact of climate change.In a report released in June, the six banks described how they have provided more than US$100 billion in climate finance in the four years since joint reporting began. The World Bank Group finances can also be tracked under its access to information policy.The conference in Paris offers the opportunity to establish a clear path toward averting the most harmful effects of climate change; world leaders attending the meeting must not allow it to slip through their fingers. By credibly and transparently honoring their promises, rich countries can demonstrate their commitment to the effort and increase the likelihood of an effective agreement.The time to invest in the fight against climate change is now.

""The situation of glaciers on the Italian side of the Alps is very worrying,"" Gianfranco Bologna, scientific director of WWF-Italy and co-author of the report, told Xinhua in an interview. The Hot Ice report was unveiled earlier this week, ahead of a crucial United Nations due to be held in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. It contained several warnings, suggesting that drastic measures should be adopted at the Paris summit to prevent the further deterioration of glaciers in Italy and worldwide. With respects to the Italian Alps, the report stated glaciers currently cover a total area of about 368 square kilometres (km2) compared to 609 km2 in the 1980s. Friday's figures came from the New Italian Glacier Inventory, which was presented at the 19th Alpine Glaciology Meeting held in May in Milan, and were compared with the 1989 World Glacier Inventory (WGI) based on data collected in the 1980s. The comparison suggested an area reduction of some 240 km2, or over 39 percent. Researches showed that glacier melting is undoubtedly caused by human activities, and the WWF report stressed that ""the extent and scale of the interactions between the biosphere and the human species in recent centuries is unprecedented"". ""The scientific community has been coordinating the collection of standardized data about glaciers worldwide since the end of 18th century,"" Bologna explained. ""We have seen them retreating slowly for over a century, and much more sharply in the last 50 years"". ""Another important change is taking place: the number of glaciers is increasing,"" he stressed. Indeed, Italy currently counts 903 glaciers against 824 registered in 1962, and such increase ""does not suggest the situation has improved"". ""On the contrary, it is a result of ice fragmentation, which is a phenomenon linked to global warming,"" Bologna said. The melting process is affecting the Arctic and Antarctica the most, but also glaciers around the world, such as in the Himalayas, Patagonia, Alaska, the Ural Mountains, and, of course, the Alps; and the environmental watchdog warned the future does not seem bright. ""Unfortunately, we have to forecast a further reduction of Alpine glaciers because we have no elements indicating that emissions have been reduced since the year 1990 (set as a basel"

Hollande hopes to persuade China, a key country in the fight against global warming, to give a decisive push to negotiations ahead of a key climate conference in Paris. Photo: AFPPresident Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Francois Hollande issued a joint statement on climate change in Beijing on Monday, vowing to include checks on compliance in the deals to be negotiated at the upcoming climate change conference in Paris. Xi and Hollande called for an enhanced transparency system to build trust and confidence in the Paris pact, as well as a means to review the actions and support of various parties.France will host the climate summit in Paris (COP21) in December, which will be attended by at least 80 world leaders, including Xi and US President Barack Obama.COP21 seeks to unite all the world's nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change, with the goal of capping warming at 2 C over pre-Industrial Revolution levels.Each signatory's progress should be reviewed every five years, China and France said in a joint statement, to ""reinforce mutual confidence and promote efficient implementation,"" AFP reported. During Hollande's two-day state visit to China starting Monday, he said that Chinese support was ""essential"" to reaching an effective deal at COP21, from November 30 to December 11, AFP reported.Analysts believe that seeking more support from China prior to the climate change conference tops Hollande's agenda, since he has strived to seize the opportunity to elevate the international standing of France and the EU.""France and the EU can no longer bear another failure in the climate change negotiations after only reaching a legally non-binding agreement at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference,"" Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times.""It is urgent that the EU retakes its predominant position in tackling global issues at a time when Europe has been plagued by crises over Syrian refugees, debt and Ukraine,"" Wang said.Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Union Studies at Beijing's China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that Hollande has also attempted to make use of the conference to consolidate the status of France in the field of global governance, as its position has been eroded by Germany's increasing influence.Nicolas Hulot, special envoy of the French president for the protection of the planet, and Laurence Tubiana, special representative for COP21, accompanied Hollande to China, the Nandu Daily reported on Monday.Hollande added that ""The fight against global warming is a humanitarian issue  and it is also an issue of considerable economic importance, of what we call green growth.""France also sought practical cooperation with China, one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world, in a bid to be an establisher of international criteria and technical specifications in the carbon emissions market after China and the US announced their respective post-2020 goals of coping with climate change on the basis of the US standard, Wang added.The US has announced a target of cutting its emissions by 26 to 28 percent from its 2005 level by 2025, while the EU is eyeing a reduction of at least 40 percent by 2030 on the basis of the 1990 level, the Xinhua News Agency reported in July.Bilateral collaborationBesides drumming up China's support for the conference, experts said France will also strengthen economic cooperation with China in sectors like nuclear power, environmental protection, communication, food manufacturing technology and pharmaceuticals.Hollande is accompanied by around 40 heads of French firms and a number of ministers. On the first leg of his journey, Hollande visited a Sino-French water treatment company in Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality to highlight cooperation in green growth industries.Cui said the two countries will also jointly explore third-party markets, such as Africa and other Asian countries.French nuclear group Areva said Monday that the State-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) could take a minority stake in its capital under a draft deal signed in Beijing, AFP reported.

Zhai Jun said China Daily and Le Figaro have set a good example in media collaboration. ""I found there was great potential to explore media collaboration after both sides celebrated their 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations last year,"" Zhai said. Last month, China Daily launched the new French product, a version of China Watch, a special monthly report prepared by China Daily. China Watch is already published in English in the United States and the United Kingdom, in conjunction with The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The Daily Telegraph. The French edition represents the first time China Daily has published in a non-English-speaking European country. The publication has been well received by readers interested in learning more about China through China Daily's original reporting. The two-page debut issue of China Watch in French covered China's efforts to host the 2022 Winter Olympics and the country's new Made in China 2025 action plan, which aims to improve the country's manufacturing capability and competitiveness. Zhu Ling, publisher of China Daily Group, said: ""I am delighted to offer our French readers an opportunity to read and know more about China in their own language.

""We very much appreciate Minister Fabius' presence today,"" Ji said. ""With such tremendous encouragement, China Daily will be working hard with French partners to deepen understanding between China and France, China and Europe."" David Gosset, director of the Euro-China Forum and founder of the New Silk Road Initiative, said China Daily both illustrates and explains China's global views for the future. ""The Chinese renaissance is arguably our world's most significant factor of change,"" he said. ""It is therefore of the highest importance to have global public opinion better informed on the Chinese dynamics and their external implications."" Zhang Xiuqin, ambassador for the Permanent Delegation of the People's Republic of China to UNESCO, said the French version's launch meets a need for media working together. ""UNESCO has been advocating international cooperation and exchange in the media industry. We believe that the communication between media is an important way to carry out the dialogue among civilizations to promote cultural diversity,"" Zhang said.

While describing the talks with visiting French President Francois Hollande as ""constructive,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the joint press briefing that the two sides decided to share military intelligence on combating Islamic State (IS) the terrorist group in Syria, which is a step toward forming an international anti-terror coalition. The two leaders showed their determination to punish perpetrators of terrorist acts against Russia and France, both of which were victims of terrorist attacks believed to be conducted by the IS. ""We all suffer from terrorism, so we should make concerted efforts. This is the point of our meeting,"" Hollande said, stressing the urgency to reach consensus on forming a broad global coalition. Putin and Hollande also believed that forces fighting the IS and other terrorist groups will not be targeted in both countries' military operations in Syria, and vowed to support those forces on the common mission. Russia launched its air campaign against IS targets in Syria late September at the request of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which the Kremlin said have significantly diminished the combat capability of the terrorist group. France intensified its air strikes against the IS after the militant group conducted a string of deadly attacks in Paris earlier this month, which left at least 129 people dead, with more than 300 others injured. Difference, however, remains between the two leaders over the future of Assad when it comes to the political solution to the protracted crisis in the war-torn country. Hollande insisted that Assad could not have any place in Syria's future, while Putin, who viewed Assad and his troops as allies in the fight against terrorism, stressed that the fate of Assad should be decided by the Syrian people. When asked about the downing of Russian Su-24 warplane by Turkey, Putin warned that Russia would not consider cooperation with any one or any coalition if similar incident happens again. ""We believe that this will not be repeated. Or else any interaction with anyone or any coalition with any party would not be needed by Russia,"" said Putin. Hollande said to avoid such incidents from happening again, it is necessary for all countries fighting against terrorists in Syria to strengthen coordination of military forces deployed in the region. ""Those claims of Turkey are all excuses, saying they didn't know the Su-24 belongs to Russia,"" Putin said, noting that the warplane has necessary visual military markings on it. According to Putin, the Russian-Turkish relation was destroyed ""thoughtlessly and stupidly,"" stressing that ""it could not even occur to us that we could receive a blow from a country which we used to consider as an ally."" Putin also doubted the functions of information exchange mechanisms established between Russia and the U.S.-led coalition, as well as inside the coalition itself. The Russian president insisted all flight information was provided by Russia to the coalition in advance, and ""the American side who leads the coalition knew about the place and time of stay of the Russian aircraft during its flight."" Serious consultations would be held with the U.S. on information exchange in Syria in regard to the downing of Su-24, said Putin. According to him, Russian air forces and Syrian army intensified strikes in the area where the Russian Su-24 fighter jet was downed Tuesday, leaving one of the two pilots killed. The other pilot was later rescued. Putin stressed that the S-400 air defense system was deployed in Syrian Hmeimim airbase for protection of Russian aircraft located there, ""without contradiction of what we do with the coalition."" Putin also urged Ankara to take actions to cut off illegal and ""industrial-scale"" oil supplies from territories controlled by the IS to Turkey.

Roy, who was born in Nanjing, China in 1935 and served as the U.S. ambassador to China from 1991 to 1995, said that the Xi-Obama summit addressed ""a whole range of issues"" from climate change to Afghanistan and ocean conservancy. ""If you don't follow U.S.-China relations closely, you'd be blown away by the number of areas where we are cooperating with China,"" Roy said. Roy noted that the summit produced a ""breakthrough"" on the most contentious issue of the cyber theft of intellectual property, as the two leaders agreed that such a behavior is a crime and both governments will seek to curb it. The two leaders agreed to set up a high-level dialogue mechanism on cyber security, with the first meeting scheduled for the end of the year. The dialogue will occur twice a year thereafter. ""We've agreed to set up a senior working group to deal with norms in cyberspace, and we have a senior joint dialogue mechanism to deal with issues of cyber crime. It was an important step forward,"" Roy said. On another hot topic of the South China Sea, Roy lauded Xi's commitment not to militarize Nansha Islands, which have been Chinese territory since ancient times and where China has been conducting reclamation activities. ""The president of China said for the first time China has no intention to pursue militarization"" of Nansha Islands. ""So that's an important development,"" he said. Roy said that the U.S. businesses ""appreciate those words"" spoken by Xi in his speech at a welcome banquet on Sept. 22 in Seattle, Washington state, that China will continue its policy of reform and opening up, and that foreign firms investing in China will be given fair and just treatment. Roy also mentioned that ""lengthy agreements"" were reached by the two leaders on dealing with climate change to build on the historic progress they made at their summit in Beijing last November.

""Climate change is not only a common challenge for China and the US, but also a shared opportunity to strengthen cooperation in developing a green and low-carbon economy,"" said Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change.He said the summit would serve as a new start for both countries to enhance their pragmatic collaboration in low-carbon cities, low-carbon technologies, the low-carbon market and other related areas.""We often hear the phrase 'Think globally and act locally.' Today's gathering is a great example of that,"" Vaughan Turekian, science and technology adviser to the secretary of state, said in addressing the summit.The people who gathered here are day-to-day implementers at different levels and in various areas, such as governors, mayors, business leaders and innovators, who seek a path to a sustainable future and ""have the will to make it happen"", he said.Among the participating leaders were 11 governors and mayors from Beijing, Sichuan province, Hainan province, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Zhenjiang, Jinchang, Yan£n and Jilin; the California and Connecticut governors; and the mayors of Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Atlanta, Carmel, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Miami and Des Moines.In signing the declaration, the US and Chinese cities and states announced their targets to reduce emissions and establish climate-action plans to trim emissions and enhance bilateral partnerships and cooperation.\~ Beijing and Guangzhou have committed to peak their carbon dioxide emissions by the end of or around 2020 \- 10 years earlier than the national target \- and the Chinese cities and provinces making commitments represent approximately 1.2 gigatons of annual carbon dioxide emissions, about 25% of China's urban total and roughly the same level of carbon dioxide emissions as Japan or Brazil.\~The declaration also features new initiatives, such as China's formulation of the new Alliance of Peaking Pioneer Cities (APPC). All cities and provinces in the alliance have for the first time established peak years for carbon dioxide emissions that are earlier than the national goal to peak around 2030.Nine agreements or Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) were signed between the two sides, including an MoU between Los Angeles0 and Shenzhen and Guangzhou to share best practices and lessons learned in reducing emissions, and an arrangement between Los Angeles and Beijing to cooperate in low-carbon urban planning and transportation.Los Angeles and Zhenjiang, in Jiangsu province, also announced that they have\~become the first cities to endorse the Sub-national Global Climate Leadership MoU \- an effort led by California Governor Jerry Brown under which the two cities commit to either reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 or achieving a per capita annual emission target of less than 2 metric tons by 2050.The ""Under 2 MOU"" is expected to provide a template for the world's nations, states and cities to follow as work continues toward an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of December's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.\l"

He is cycling, having left the Antarctic late last year, while the friend runs from the Arctic. Daniel Price, 27, has a doctorate in satellite assessment of sea ice from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. He is leading a public awareness campaign, ""Pole to Paris"", ahead of the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), which will convene in the French capital later this year. Price's team of environmental scientists is traveling 20,000 km by bicycle and foot from the Polar Regions to Paris. He arrived in China three weeks ago. He and his two teammates, Thomas and Theo have cycled from Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, to Beijing, passing through five cities. ""Climate change is closely related to each of us, no matter where we live,"" Price said during an exclusive interview with Xinhua. He hopes to inspire the public, especially younger generations, to understand the impacts of climate change. Cycling 80 to 100 km a day, Price's journey began in the Antarctic, moving to New Zealand, Australia, Southeast Asia and now China. They have attracted attention along the way. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, local people joined them. ""I could not calculate the number of the people who have been directly influenced by us,"" Price says. But the task is not without its risks. One teammate fell off his bike in the dark in Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi Province. His right leg was badly injured and covered in blood. ""We took him to the local hospital and spent five hours there while they bandaged the wound,"" says Price. They have no regular suppliers of food and drink either. ""We have to prepare enough reserves, especially before entering under-developed regions. His Norwegian friend Erlend Moster Knudsen, a specialist in the Arctic climate, is leading the 3,000-km northern route. ""But he does not pass through China,"" Price says. They share the experiences on the way though the social network services like Facebook. They definitely met or will meet severe weather conditions. ""But we have been doing our best to arrive at Paris on time,"" the cyclist says. Along the way, they are recording the effects of climate change and they have many short videos so far. Representatives of governments around the world will meet to negotiate a ""climate deal"" at COP21 ""Hopefully our work can be shown ahead of the meeting,"" Price says. He expects the COP21 to provide international commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, to signal confidence in a renewable future to businesses and investors, and clearly lay out how funding will be provided to the developing world. ""We hope to raise society's awareness,"" Price says. ""And we are looking forward to the negotiations paving the way to serious reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions at the meeting in Paris."" The team will leave Beijing on Aug. 22. ""We will ride through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia for the next step,"" Price says. Then they will travel through Russia and Europe. Huang Yan, communications officer of the Climate Change Program for WWF-Beijing, says young people like Price and Knudson are role models for their peers. ""They are trying to help more people understand climate change and realize the potential crisis brought by the carbon emissions and deforestation,"" Huang says. Today's youth will be the first generation that has to deal with severe climate and environmental changes, says Huang, but also the first generation with the opportunity to respond appropriately. \l"
"COP21","China","COP21_China157","Stop deforestation, protect the trees and imperiled people who live among them","August 11, 2015 Tuesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","When Pope Francis visited Latin America in July, he made an impassioned plea for the protection of the Amazon rainforest and the people who live there. Heeding Francis\' s call for action is not only a moral issue; it is a practical one. When world leaders meet at the United Nations in Paris later this year to craft a response to the challenges of global warming, they should put in place policies to protect tropical forests and the people who make them their home.Francis is hardly the first missionary to have visited the Amazon. Franciscan, Jesuit and Dominican priests have been spreading the gospel in the region for centuries. What makes Francis\' s appeal different is that his words were directed not so much at the local population, but at the residents of North America and Europe, where demand for timber, biofuels, and agricultural products drives the destruction of the rainforests and imperils the lives of indigenous populations.Communities in the Amazon have suffered grievously from the economic incentives to cut down the rainforests. Around the world, indigenous people are being threatened, murdered, and driven from their homelands. Of the 116 environmental activists killed in 2014, 40 percent were indigenous leaders. In September 2014, for example, Edwin Chota and three other leaders of the Ash\'e1ninka communities in Peru, were brutally murdered, most likely by illegal loggers. Two months later, Jos\'e9 Isidro Tendetza Ant\'fan, a leader of the Shuar people in Ecuador, was tortured and killed while headed to a protest against a mining project that threatened his people\' s homeland.In addition to being an affront to human rights, deforestation and the accompanying assault on indigenous cultures is a serious threat to the fight against climate change. The links between the loss of forest cover and global warming has been well documented. Carbon-dioxide emissions from forest clearing and burning account for nearly 10 percent of global emissions.Meanwhile, forest people have demonstrated that they are often the best guardians of the trees on which their livelihoods depend. The forests where indigenous people live often hold more carbon than those managed by any other owners, public or private. Indeed, indigenous reserves in the Brazilian Amazon have played a critical role in lowering deforestation rates  at a considerable cost. During the proceedings in Paris later this year, countries will be expected to present national plans  known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining the specific steps they will take to reduce CO2 emissions. If Francis\' s appeal is to be respected, these steps must include commitments to help indigenous people secure the right to their land and empower them to protect their forests against destruction.So far, only a little more than one-quarter of the world\' s countries have submitted preliminary INDCs for review. Unfortunately, few countries with tropical forests have submitted their plans, and not one of the Amazon countries has done so.Mexico: good exampleMexico, by contrast, is setting a good example. The government has used its INDC to set several ambitious goals, including commitments to zero deforestation by the year 2030 and to restoring forest ecosystems in the country\' s watersheds. And yet, while Mexico has relatively strong formal land and property rights for indigenous peoples and local communities, those rights have yet to be integrated with other regulations  hindering any kind of economic development.Industrialized countries, such as the United States and the members of the European Union, bear a special responsibility for providing solutions to the problem of deforestation. Forest communities must be provided with assistance in managing their resources and maintaining their livelihoods. The Green Climate Fund, established by the United Nations to help developing countries mitigate CO2 emissions and adapt to climate change, should include provisions specifically for indigenous people, along the l"
"COP21","China","COP21_China158","Earth was the hottest ever in June","July 22, 2015 Wednesday","China Daily European Edition","The world experienced temperatures in June that were the highest since modern record-keeping started in 1880, according to scientists. Environmental experts said the record heat should put greater pressure on nations to tackle climate change in upcoming talks in Paris.The average temperature on land and sea last month was 1.58 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, the highest in a 136-year period of record, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's monthly summary released on Monday. June 2015 also was the fourth month this year so far that has broken monthly temperature records, the report said, and so far, the first six months of the year have been the warmest on record.There were record temperatures in China, with places like the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region reaching 113 degrees Fahrenheit, and Hong Kong experiencing its hottest June since 1884. The United States had its second-warmest June on record. Only June 1933 was hotter. Five western states- California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Utah- were all record warm.The heat is partially due to El Nino, the warming of the ocean along the equator that can create influxes in weather patterns across the planet, causing unusual weather events.But experts said that El Nino alone can't be the only reason for the warm temperatures- 2014 was also a record year with temperatures and the El Nino was not present- which they said strengthens the need for positive climate change discussions at the United Nations in Paris in December. Then 196 countries will meet to sign a legally binding climate change agreement.""This is a story that we've been hearing over and over again and El Nino alone can't account for the full global warming that we're seeing. We know that 14 of the 15 warmest years have occurred since 2000, and the trends we've been seeing suggest that El Nino alone can't really explain this,"" said Kelly Levin, senior associate at think tank World Resources Institute.""What it does suggest is that given the trends in warming and the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that we're pumping into the atmosphere every year, that it is likely that 2015 could again be a record warm year,"" she said.Levin said that the record warmth- experienced in the western parts of the US and across China, as well as parts of South America and Africa- will hopefully continue to be ""wake-up signs"" to decision makers that meet in Paris to reach agreement to phase out emissions.""Especially in the lead-up to Paris and coming out of the New York summit last year, there certainly is a lot of momentum. We know we need more, we know we need more quickly, and I think the hope is that we'll come out with a very strong agreement in December that not only brings countries back to the table repeatedly, to set commitments over five-year cycles, but also has a long-term goal to phase our emissions,"" and to provide those signals to governments around the world as well as the private sector to really transform their economies, she said.Clayton Munnings, a research associate at think tank Resources for the Future, said that climate negotiators will view recent high temperatures as a symptom of the climate change issue.""I think the negotiators are likely to see the increase in temperature as a symptom of the disease that they're all collectively trying to cure, which is excess global warming and climate change. It might personally motivate some negotiators, it might compel some advocacy groups to put more pressure on negotiators,"" he told China Daily.But Munnings also said that ultimately the warmer temperatures- which have been rising consistently over the last few years- won't fundamentally change negotiations, though the China-US partnership on climate targets has been ""very encouraging.""The two countries announced in November their plans to curb emissions. The US said that it will reduce carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent in 2025, compared with 2005 levels. China for the first time announced that it would peak emissions by 2030.China submitted its proposal for climate change actions to the UN late June, repeating its commitment to peak emissions in the next decade and a half, increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy use, and reducing carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 percent in 2030 compared to 2005 levels.

In an open letter, CEOs from 78 companies, a cross-sectoral coalition facilitated by the WEF that includes banking, manufacturing, construction and energy, extended ""an open offer"" to governments to co-design climate solutions ahead of the upcoming climate conference, COP21, in Paris. The conference will see leaders of nearly 200 countries meet to finalize a global agreement on climate change. The CEOs hope to capitalize on the momentum created by pledges from over 160 countries, notably from the United States and China, to bolster the case that governments have industry support to take decisive action to combat climate change. As well as pledging support, the CEOs committed to reducing environmental and carbon footprints and collaborating with supply chains, managing climate risks and including them in decision-making, and to act as ambassadors for climate action. They also advocated explicit or implicit carbon pricing, innovation in alternative and renewable energy sources, climate action through greater corporate disclosure of carbon risks, and projects such as green bonds. The message was welcomed by the UN's top climate official, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which is hosting COP21. She said climate action represented a ""massive economic opportunity,"" adding: ""This is the first intentionally directed industrial revolution and will be the source of good new jobs and strong growth for the coming decades, something developing countries are increasingly realizing and taking the lead on."" The business leaders collectively represent 2.13 trillion U.S. dollars in revenue, equivalent to India's gross domestic product. Many of them lead companies from outside of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations and pledge support for developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. \l"

""I strongly urge the participation of all Governments at the highest level."" The Signature Ceremony will be the first opportunity for governments to advance the process that will lead to the implementation and ratification of the Paris Agreement, he added. The secretary-general laid out four topics that he expects leaders to address, namely an update on the implementation of national climate plans, a roadmap to limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, a timetable for ratifying the Paris Agreement, and a plan to accelerate climate action before 2020. On April 22, Ban will also hold a high-level summit lunch for Heads of States and Government and heads of delegation and a high-level event in the afternoon to highlight the critical importance of climate action and partnerships from all sectors of society.

""Fiji welcomes this move by the government of the People's Republic of China to allocate 3 billion U.S. dollars to help developing countries address the challenges posed by climate change,"" Emberson told Xinhua on Thursday in an e-mail interview. ""For the Fiji government, this is both a bold step and a positive indication of China's commitment to assisting small island developing states (SIDS) like Fiji. It also affirms that China recognizes the importance of mobilizing climate finance to transition towards low-carbon futures, whilst building resilience to climate change in developing countries. This assistance is also China's recognition of the special circumstances of least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states and the African countries alike,"" Emberson said. China announced the China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund on Sept. 25, when a China-U.S. joint presidential statement on climate change was signed in Washington, D.C. during Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to the United States. The fund will also enhance developing countries' capacity to access the Green Climate Fund, according to the statement. ""Fiji appreciates that the main objective of this fund titled the China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund is to enhance developing country capacities, to better access the Green Climate Fund.

""Obviously, it's a very commendable action on the part of China as a large developing country. It fosters South-South cooperation,"" Kumar said. ""I think the important thing so far is: China is concerned that it's faced with rising emissions because it obviously needs to provide energy to its millions and millions of people. But I think it has come out with a very ambitious plan to try and proceed on a low-carbon development pathway, and I think some of these announcements in terms of reducing energy intensity per GDP, enhancing efficiencies, promoting clean power, renewable energy and so on are extremely commendable,"" added Kumar. \l"

Such an accord is seen as crucial for keeping the rise in global temperatures within 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, a goal scientists say should be met to avoid risky changes in the climate.The following are quotes in Chinese President  Xi Jinping 's speech at  Paris climate change conference.- China aims to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from 2005 levels by 2030;- China promises to increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20% and peak its carbon emissions by the same date;- China will set up a South-South cooperation fund worth 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) to help other developing countries cope with the effects of climate change;- Developed countries should share more and take more responsibilities on climate change.

As UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pointed out, ""For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience, and join in common cause to take climate action."" But high hopes and widespread optimism do not guarantee that the current momentum is unstoppable, especially given the dim global growth prospects and increasing instability in international relations.To this joint effort of the mankind, indeed the first ever of its kind in history, a claim of ostentatious leadership or expression of verbal ambition won't be of any help. It is action that counts. Whether the goal of COP21 can be realized is only determined by every government's effectiveness to deliver its promise, backed by the needed resources.As a responsible developing country, China will not hesitate to take international obligations commensurate with its own national conditions, development stage and actual capacity in the global fight against climate change.The Paris deal has now created the much-needed mechanism, framework and architecture for continuous global measures to avoid the worst scenario of climate change and build a solid foundation of mutual trust for enhanced actions before and after 2020.However, for this accord to work its magic in cutting carbon emissions as much as we expect, policymakers around the world must seize this chance to make full use of their nations' will and ability to take on this challenge. Investors should be encouraged to promote technological progress that can help build a clean-energy economy and consumers should assume their responsibilities by embracing low-carbon lifestyles.Beijing's hazardously thick smog during the past two weeks may have born full testimony to the need of a historic breakthrough in Paris. Now, it should galvanize the whole world for no more words but rather hard work to implement this deal.(China Daily 12/14/2015 page8)\l"

Consequently, although public transport vehicles account for less than 2 percent of all motor vehicles, they produce one third of total tail pipe emissions.So BYD's 'Urban electrified public transportation total solution' is the fastest and most efficient way to cut these gases.BYD is testing five electric double-decker buses in London which are powered by two battery packs, and is designed to operate for a whole day on a single charge. Recharging takes four hours. London has over 9,000 double-decker buses carrying an average of 6.5 million passengers a day.BYD Europe's Managing Director Isbrand Ho made clear that in BYD's view all vehicles in cities would ultimately be electrified.""In three years we anticipate ceasing production of fossil-fuel powered passenger cars and replacing them all with pure electric or hybrid models,"" said Ho.Also attending COP21 were the environmentally focused NGOs and charities and one of the leading organizations in Paris was C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), an organization of Mayors collaborating to fight climate change founded in 2005 by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.""When we were in office in New York, we were shameless in stealing other cities' great ideas, this is the only way we can get ahead in this war on climate change"", said Bloomberg.This year BYD partnered with Bloomberg Philanthropies to host C40's premier event, the City Leadership Awards, where the C40 compete on green initiatives they implemented over the past calendar year.""C40 is the ultimate platform for the implementation of green initiatives"", said BYD Motors President & CEO Stella Li.\l"
"COP21","China","COP21_China172","China pushes to reduce coal use","January 29, 2016 Friday","China Daily European Edition","Country has committed to reducing CO2 emissions by boosting renewable energy like hydroelectric, wind, solar and nuclear power Coal is going to make way for new energy in China through reforms in the 13th Five Year Plan (2016-20) as the country battles air pollution, experts say. ""China has to build a strong and efficient alternative energy industry in order to cope with the environmental challenges,"" says Zhao Yong, associate researcher of the Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission. ""Using less energy to drive more output is the key solution to China's healthy growth."" The country has committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions per GDP unit by 60 to 65 percent by 2030 compared with 2005, according to the pledge it submitted last year to the United Nations . The consumption of nonfossil energy would count for 20 percent of the primary energy consumption. To achieve these goals, China plans to add new installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts of nuclear power, 150 million kW of hydroelectric power, 300 million of kW photovoltaic power and 400 million kW of wind power between 2016 and 2030. However, the high cost of clean energy is the biggest obstacle to China's green power development. Government subsidies are critical to encourage enterprises to engage in the green energy industry, Zhao adds. ""Solar and wind power generation, which is seen as a great hope for China's clean energy endeavor, has remained at the same level in the past two years,"" says Zhao. Shi Lishan, deputy director of the new and renewable energy department of the NEA, had been pointing out that supply side reform is key to overall power generation reform. A lot of power generated by new energy is not integrated with the national grid. Worse, since new energy companies rely heavily on subsidies, this installed capacity lies idle if subsidies are canceled. Pilot programs have been put in place in some places to experiment with integration of new energy with the power grid. For instance, SPIC Mengdong Energy Group Co Ltd, based in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, is running China's first regional grid to successfully integrate both coal and wind energy. The company has been working for the past three years in Huolinhe, Inner Mongolia, to power its electrolytic aluminum production. ""The biggest obstacle was that wind power fluctuates greatly depending on the weather,"" says Liu Jianping, SPIC Mengdong Energy's deputy manager. ""If the wind slows, it affects aluminum production."" To resolve the issue, the group adopted a ""complementary coal-fired and wind power system"", which he says is able to counter-balance any suspension in wind-generated power by adjusting the wattage of coal-fired power and the rate of aluminum production. Apart from providing encouragement to new-energy production, China is to suspend approvals for any new coal mines for three years. This decision, to eliminate stockpiles and increase new-energy consumption, was taken at a national energy conference held by the central government in December. Nur Bekri, NEA director, says that, with production overcapacity expected to last for some time, green and low-carbon forms of energy will be the main focus of the new five-year plan. In some regions, China has introduced a ""coal to electricity"" reform. Beijing and its neighboring provinces are to replace coal-fired heating systems with electrical systems. All coal-fired boilers in key areas of the city will be removed, according to a plan released in April. ""China's coal consumption is divided largely into two sectors: half for power generation and half for other use,"" says Lin Boqiang, a professor of energy economy at Xiamen University. ""Currently, 70 percent of the coal-fired power capacity was installed around 2003, which is relatively new given that such installed capacity is usually able to serve for 40 to 50 years. If these installed units run at peak efficiency, they will be able to replace other coal-consuming sectors to a great extent. ""Statistics have shown that, with every 1 percentage point increase in the proportion of electricity in terminal energy consumption, energy intensity, or the ratio between energy consumption and economic output, drops by 4 percent. Therefore, replacing low-efficiency energy with electricity is going to reduce energy consumption,"" Lin says.

the UN expects the planet's human population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100.That growth will happen disproportionately in the Muslim world, including the Middle East and the Sahel.Indeed, the countries with the highest fertility rates are predominantly Muslim, led by Niger, with 7.6 live births per woman, followed by Somalia with 6.7, and Chad with 6.According to the Pew Research Center, the number of Muslims in the world will nearly equal the number of Christians by 2070, and Islam will become the world's largest religion by 2100.Rapid population growth in countries where the environment is already failing to meet people's needs and where economies show scant signs of creating new employment opportunities, provides a fertile ground for fanaticism.Consider Mali, where Islamist militants attacked a hotel filled with foreigners just one week after the attacks in Paris.Drought and desertification have exacerbated poverty -- the country's per capita GDP is just US$765, placing it 168th worldwide -- and extremely perilous living conditions are reflected in the world's seventh-highest child-mortality rates: 123 of every 1,000 children will not make it to their fifth birthday.In such a poor society, inadequate education leaves people without the knowledge they need to improve their lot, such as by limiting pregnancies or taking advantage of opportunities to boost economic productivity.Under these conditions, it should not be surprising that Islamist terrorism has been a consistent scourge.In short, much of the Middle East and the Sahel are locked in a vicious cycle of environmental degradation, economic failure, and Islamist extremism.The question is how to break out of it.The Paris summit is likely to be a buttoned-down diplomatic battle among countries for grants to support their pledges to mitigate and adapt to climate change.Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the pledges that will be made, particularly in ravaged lands like Somalia, northern Nigeria and Iraq's Anbar province, is entirely uncertain.The most important factor in the long-term effort to save societies in the Middle East and the Sahel from environmental and economic ruin -- with major implications for combating Islamic extremism -- will not be discussed in Paris.That factor is education.After all, to improve their health and preserve their environment, people need access to information about birth-control methods, modern farming and cooking practices and much else.And to improve their economic prospects, they need the knowledge and skills that employers require.Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who serves as UN Special Envoy for Global Education, is working tirelessly to promote access to education among the millions of refugees in the region.It is time for more global players to support this effort, so that it can be expanded across the Middle East and the Sahel.Education is the key to giving strained populations hope for a better future. And hope is fundamental to negating the allure of extremism, in all of its forms.Copyright: Project Syndicate\l"

[Photo/Agencies]Global leaders are gathered in Paris for the COP21 climate summit. Given Asia-Pacific's size and its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, its voice and commitment are critical to achievinga comprehensive agreement on climate change. Many Asia Pacific countries are developing and must focus on achieving sustained economic growth and development. Of the 49 regional members of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 43 have a light climate footprint, contributing only 10 per cent to global emissions.For these countries, notably the least developed countries, Pacific islands and low-lying states, vulnerability to climate-related natural disasters will grow with climate change. At the other extreme, the region is home to six of the top 10 emitters in the world - China, India, Russia, Japan, Indonesia and Iran \- which account for about 43 per cent of global emissions.Of these top six Asian emitters, fossil fuel-based energy is responsible for about 80 per cent of their collective emissions, with emissions from industrial processes, agriculture and waste playing a lesser role. Mitigating the emissionsof these countries requiresmultiple actions,key among which is a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.Of the 183 countries that have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 43 are from the Asia-Pacific region.Countries across the region have indicated both conditional and unconditional reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.Theseincludeeconomy-wide emissions targets or deviation from a business as usual (BAU) scenario to an intensity targets of emissions per unit of GDP. Many INDCs, particularly those from the developing countries, include an overall rise in emissions by 2030.While this is remarkable in its own right, they still leave a significant gap between the INDCs pledged and the cuts required to keep the temperature increase to below two degrees Celsius warming limit. This gap is close to 16 billion tonnes of CO2 reductions per annum by 2030, roughly equal to the current emissions of China, India, and Russia combined. The only way we can bridge this gap is if we collectively treat the INDCs announced as the floor to be raised by enabling countries to adopt and implement additional measures needed with technical, financial and capacity support.Despite the present gap between the INDCs and the necessary emission reductions, progress is underway in our region.This not only sets specific economies on course for a low carbon future, but will also alter the global dynamics. China's INDC, for instance, targets emissions to peak by 2030 at the latest, and for emissions intensity of GDP to decl"

Cooperation between developing countries, known as South-South cooperation, can play a vital role in addressing climate change issues and implementing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), said Wang. The SDGs are a set of 17 economic, social and environmental goals UN member states hope to achieve by 2030. South-South cooperation can take many forms, said Wang. For example, China has made impressive pledges recently to finance climate change actions. South-South cooperation also goes beyond countries like China, South Africa, India and Brazil helping smaller countries, she said. Cuba, for example, has shared its knowledge about disaster risk management with other Caribbean countries, including the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. ""I think the most important thing for South-South cooperation is that it can offer more relevant and more cost-effective solutions that can be shared and adapted to similar development contexts,"" said Wang, a Chinese national based at the UNDP headquarters in New York. Addressing climate change can be challenging, particularly for developing countries affected by conflict, Wang said that even these countries are finding ways to work together to protect the environment. South-South cooperation goes beyond sharing knowledge and resources, and has seen developing countries working together to address climate change at the global level, such as during the current UN conference on climate change in Paris, France, according to Wang. ""One important outcome of South-South cooperation is (the) collective voice of developing countries -- for example, we know the least developed countries, land-locked developing countries, small island developing states, they come together to define and articulate their special needs in development,"" said Wang.

Up to 30 crop calories are needed to produce one meat calorie.At any given time, the global livestock population is more than 150 billion compared with just 7.2 billion humans, meaning livestock have a larger direct ecological footprint than we do.Livestock production causes almost 14.5 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions and contributes significantly to water pollution.Moreover, livestock production consumes one-third of the water resources used in agriculture (which accounts for 71 percent of the world's water consumption), as well as more than 40 percent of the global output of wheat, rye, oats, and corn.And livestock production uses 30 percent of the earth's land surface that once was home to wildlife, thereby playing a critical role in biodiversity loss and species extinction.It took more than a century for the European diet to reach the point at which meat is consumed at every meal, including breakfast.But in large parts of Asia, a similar shift has occurred in just one generation.Meaty diets have created a global obesity problem including, of all places, in China, whose expanding international clout is accompanied by expanding waistl"

China's energy consumption has increased from 1.5 billion tons of coal equivalent in 2001 to 3.76 billion in 2013, with an annual growth rate of 8 percent. ""China is the biggest energy consumer in the world, mainly due to the huge population and vast territory. China, however, has been investing in the research of clean energy for a long time,"" Wan said. ""Clean energy industries have been developing very fast in China since we began researching at the beginning of this century. The government also facilitates the industry with supportive policies for the manufacture and application of clean energy equipment,"" he said. As the world's largest producer of solar power equipment, China has the second largest installed solar capacity and is expected to become the largest by the end of 2015. Meanwhile, the country's installed hydro power capacity accounts for as much as a quarter of the global capacity. Its installed wind power capacity also ranks as the first in the world. Wan said the development of clean energy is also facing some challenges, including further improving quality, increasing the application scale, strengthening research and reducing costs. He pointed out that research and development should fully cooperate with the industrialization procedure. The development of electric cars is a real-life example, he said. China started to promote research in 2008, and by 2013, the cost of the battery had been reduced 50 percent, with doubled energy density. ""Mass production can help increase the automation and the battery's service efficiency,"" Wan said. Promoting fundamental research and exploring the frontiers of science and industrialization can help reduce costs and improve the reliability and durability of the products with an expanding scale. Therefore, he said, the government should issue a series of policies covering all important procedures like research, production and application to facilitate the development of the clean energy industry.8 All countries should show ""real conviction"" if progress is to be made toward clean energy, Wan said. To reduce harmful greenhouse gases, countries must cut back on the use of fossil fuels, he said, urging governments to promote clean energy as a way to bring CO2 emissions down to acceptable levels. In the past 10 years, China has promoted public transit systems that run on renewable energy sources, he said.

The global marine ecosystem is arguably the world's most precious resource, providing over 1 trillion U.S. dollars per year to the global economy via direct and indirect exploitation. Since the industrial revolution, the world's oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of all carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, playing a critical role in slowing the rate of global warming. However, a price has been paid. Increasing carbon dioxide emissions from industrialisation, the main cause of climate change, has led to lower sea-water pH and a reduction in carbonate ions needed to help protect keystone species from increased predation and sustain productive marine ecosystems. Despite global leaders agreeing to reduce carbon emissions to limit human-induced global warning to a two-degree Celsius rise at the Paris climate talks in December (COP21), the ocean's chemistry will still significantly change.

Around 11:16 a.m. local time (1516 GMT), Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, the special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping, ascended the podium in the United Nations General Assembly Hall to sign the thick and weighty document. ""The Chinese people honor our commitments. We will work hard to earnestly implement the Paris Agreement,"" said Zhang while addressing the signing ceremony earlier. A total of 175 countries inked the agreement on the first day of its opening for signature, a new record in the United Nations' 71-year history. China was the 21st to sign, while the whole signing process lasted some 2.5 hours. ""Today you are signing a new covenant with the future,"" UN Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon told the world leaders and government representatives present. The UN has picked the April 22 Earth Day for the event to highlight its significance. On Dec. 12, 2015, after nearly two weeks of hard bargaining, climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in Paris sealed the pact, aiming to reverse the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions. Experts said that China helped resolve several thorny issues to bring about some key breakthroughs. After the signing, the Paris Agreement still needs 55 nations that together account for 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions to ratify before it can enter into force. Zhang also announced on Friday that China aims to finalize domestic legal procedures to ratify the pact before the Hangzhou summit in September this year, which Ban called a ""great news."" ""China has played an extremely constructive leadership role,"" Selwyn Hart, director of the Secretary-general's Climate Change Support Team, told Xinhua in an earlier interview. ""The ambition level of the Paris Agreement would not have been possible were not for China."" To fulfill its commitment to the Paris climate pact, China would have to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent, and peak its carbon emissions by 2030. These targets were reflected in China's intended national determined contribution and also in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).

"COP21","China","COP21_China186","A fair, efficient and feasible climate agreement","December 18, 2015 Friday","EJ Insight","How should one evaluate the agreement reached in Paris this month at the United Nations ?No sooner was the deal announced on Dec. 12 than the debate erupted.Some avid environmentalists were disappointed that the agreement did not commit firmly to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050.But such a commitment would not have been credible.Individual countries pledged to limit their emissions in the near term, with provisions for future monitoring and periodic reviews of targets.This is far better than setting lofty goals for the distant future while giving little reason to think that they would be met.The important thing is to get started. In four key respects, the agreement is a good one for those who regard global climate change as an important problem and want to take feasible steps to address it.First, and most important, participation is comprehensive, with 188 countries offering individual commitments, called intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs).In the past, only rich countries were expected to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions; developing countries were explicitly spared that within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.That had to change, partly because it is in developing countries, not the advanced economies, that emisssions are growing the fastest.Furthermore, countries like the United States would not agree to limit their emissions if they feared that carbon-emitting industry would simply migrate to developing countries.Second, the agreement includes a process of future assessment and revision of targets.Every five years, the parties will take stock and renew the commitments.Targets can be adjusted in light of future developments to be more or less aggressive, (probably more, if the scientists' predictions are borne out).Negotiations on the INDC revisions are to begin in 2018, even though the first set of targets is scheduled to take effect in 2020.Third, the Paris deal takes steps toward transparency in monitoring, reporting and verifying countries' progress.Starting in 2023, countries are to report every five years on compliance with their emissions targets.The US and Europe had to push China and India to agree to this. But without transparency, the INDCs would not be credible.Fourth, the agreement contains mechanisms to facilitate international linkage, including scope for residents of rich countries to finance emissions reductions in poor countries.This is important, because it is cheaper to pay a poor country to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants than it is to shut down an existing plant in a rich country.And achieving the first period's INDCs at low cost will be an important determinant of countries' willingness to take further steps in future periods.Achieving more aggressive environmental goals, particularly limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C, or zero greenhouse-gas emissions in the second half of the century, would of course be desirable in terms of minimizing the risk of disaster scenarios.In fact, the first INDCs, by themselves, are nowhere near enough even to limit warming to 2 degrees C (the global goal that was agreed in Canc\'fan in 2010).But proclaiming ambitious targets is very different from achieving them.It is almost beside the point that the economic cost of pursuing a goal of 1.5 degrees C would be very high.In any case, leaders can't make credible commitments 35 years into the future.Some developing-country leaders may be displeased for another reason: the figure of US$100 billion in finance from rich countries does not appear in the legally binding body of the agreement.The rich countries did admit their moral responsibility to help small island states, for example, cope with ""loss and damages"" from sea-level rise.But they rejected demands for formal acceptance of legal liability.This was a reasonable outcome in a difficult situation.Rich countries can't deny that their past emissions have inflicted harm on the world.In a domestic legal system, an entity whose land was, say, flooded would have a claim to compensation from the entity that had caused the damage.But sovereign countries are not operating in such a system.The US$100 billion in finance has always seemed problematic.The developing countries fear that the rich countries won't deliver the money, at least not in cash; and they are right.The rich countries fear that such ""reparations"" would disappear into the pockets of local elites; and they, too, are right.So it is better not to make promises.The poor countries do have a strong case.The average American still accounts for 10 times the emissions of the average citizen of India, and India should not be deprived of the right to develop economically.But the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets.The efforts that richer countries promised should be - and generally are - greater than the efforts of poor countries.The richer a country is, the earlier the date at which its emissions should peak.The richer it is, the more sharply its target should cut emissions relative to the basel"

Birol, who is also the Executive Director-elect of IEA, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua. He praises China\\'s efforts in transforming its energy mix by investing huge money in renewable energies projects and improving energy efficiency. CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE The global economy grew by around three percent in 2014 but energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stayed flat, the first time in at least 40 years that such an outcome has occurred outside economic crisis, said IEA in its special report on energy and climate change. The Paris-based international energy policy consulting organization estimates that a peak in global energy related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 and at no net economic cost, if governments implement five key policy measures, including improving energy efficiency, increasing renewable energy technologies and the like. \\""China is playing a very important and constructive role when it comes to climate change issues,\\"" Birol said, adding that he expected the spirit of U.S.-China joint announcement on climate change, made in November 2014, to encourage the upcoming meeting of COP21 (the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015). In November last year, presidents of both China and the United Statesannounced both countries\\' respective post-2020 actions on climate change in Beijing. China intends to achieve the peaking of greenhouse gas emissions around 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20 percent by 2030. \\""I would expect China to continue its constructive role both for Chinese citizens and also for the rest of the world. I\\'m sure China will make a contribution for both sides, being a very distinct member of the global community,\\"" Birol said. IEA also tunes positively on the increasing global consensus on cutting GHG (greenhouse gas) emission, which has been laying a solid ground for the COP21 event. He said: \\""Unlike in Kyoto, this time both the developed and developing countries are making pledges, they are Ethiopia, Gabon, Russia, Europe, U.S., Canada, Mexico and others. China also made a very important statement about the peak (of GHG emission) and about the role of the renewable energies and nuclear power.\\"" \\""So China has already been making major efforts, and today when we look at renewable energy for example,\\"" the investment made by China in renewable energies is bigger than that by United States, by Europe and by Japan, he said.

"COP21","China","COP21_China200","Uniting against climate change","November 6, 2015 Friday","China Daily European Edition","Sino-French declaration lays foundation for Paris summit China and France issued a joint presidential statement on climate change on Nov 2 during a visit by President Francois Hollande to Beijing, building diplomatic momentum for a strong outcome at the summit in Paris at the end of the month. Both nations agreed that a new global agreement should include provisions for regularly updating countries' nationally determined contributions for cutting emissions and support a review every five years. They also stressed the importance of shifting the global economy onto a low-carbon path moving toward clean energy systems to meet the challenge of capping warming below two degrees. China firmly supports France in hosting the United Nations climate change conference and hopes it can achieve balanced results, President Xi Jinping said while meeting Hollande. The two countries also reaffirmed their resolve to work together, and with other countries, to reach an ""ambitious and legally binding"" agreement in Paris on the basis of equity and reflecting the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. Leaders of 190 nations will gather in Paris over 12 days from Nov 30 to discuss a new global agreement on climate change that is expected to lead to an action plan after 2020 to avoid the catastrophic results of global warming. France has given priority to building momentum in the fight against climate change, and Hollande is determined to make his mark on history by brokering an agreement to address the problem. The joint declaration between China and the host country lays the foundation for a solid outcome in Paris, although there are still disputes and tensions between countries following last month's UN climate talks in Bonn, Germany, the last round before the Paris summit, observers said. Deepening South-South cooperation and South-North cooperation are equally important, said Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change at a news conference in Beijing on Oct 31. This year China has issued joint announcements on climate change with the United States, the European Union, Brazil and India. ""China has adopted a more active and bold attitude this year, compared with six years ago when the Copenhagen meeting was held,"" said Li Shuo, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace China. ""Also, China sees declining coal consumption and robust momentum for renewable energies. All indicate that China is on track to become a global climate leader."" Leaders have stepped up their efforts in exchanging views before the summit and say finance will be a decisive factor at the meeting. Climate change ministers from Brazil, South Africa, India and China, also known as the BASIC countries, met in Beijing last month at the two-day 21st BASIC ministerial meeting on climate change. As emerging developing countries, the four share common grounds on crucial issues. Developed countries should define a clear path toward achieving their goal of providing $100 billion per year by 2020, Xie said. In addition, ""developed countries should substantially increase their support after 2020, with $100 billion a year as a starting point."" Developing countries need the financial resources, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support from developed countries to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce likely damage from climate change. Ministers expressed their ""unequivocal commitment"" toward a successful outcome in Paris and committed to work with other parties to reach an ""equitable, ambitious, comprehensive, balanced and durable"" Paris agreement. The Paris agreement will be in full accordance with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, ministers said at the Beijing meeting. Also, differentiation between developed and developing countries should be reflected in each element of the agreement, according to a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting. Contributions should be nationally determined and comprehensive, covering mitigation, adaptation and provision of support by developed countries to developing countries, ministers said. BASIC countries are taking robust action domestically, despite the multiple social and economic challenges facing them, Xie said. For instance, China pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60 to 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030, and peak its emissions by around 2030. Developed countries should revisit and increase their emissions reduction commitments under the convention or the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the statement said. ""Developing countries have pledged more than their fair share, and developed countries pledged less than their fair share,"" said Prakash Javadekar, India's minister of state for the environment, forests and climate change. More than 150 countries are presenting national commitments, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program with the World Resources Institute, says that with such commitments, there was now an unprecedented level of cooperation on climate change. ""The Paris agreement has not yet been sealed, but is already raising our sights about what's possible."" A UN report issued on Oct 30 found that current commitments are not enough to meet the world's needs. ""Countries must accelerate their efforts after the Paris summit in order to stave off climate change,"" Mogan says. China will make new contributions to global ecological security by sticking to green development, a notice from the Communist Party of China Central Committee said on Oct 31, when it announced broad proposals for the country's 13th Five-Year Plan. The plan also cited construction of a highly efficient modern energy system and the promotion of zero emission projects. Dennis Pamlin, founder of 21st Century Frontiers, a consultancy in Sweden, says it was encouraging to see China embedding the environment in its economic planning. ""It's a very encouraging thing.

Marches were held in several cities around the world, in what appeared to be one of the biggest demonstrations on global warming ever arranged. In the Italian capital, demonstrators held placards reading: ""Stop fossil sources"", ""There is no Planet B"", and ""#COP21: a true deal to change"". Some 15,000 to 20,000 people attended the rally, according to local media and organizers. The long march cut through the historical heart of Rome, as climate activists chanted slogans and danced along the way with the help of a music band of street performers. Meanwhile, leaders from nearly 150 countries were gathering in Paris for a 12-day-long UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP21, which is due to deliver a long-term agreement on global warming and carbon emission cut to be implemented from 2020. ""I would like the summit to deliver a legally binding deal, and clear sanctioning mechanisms for those countries not complying with the agreed targets,"" Francesca Mingro from Rome told Xinhua. As a member of non-governmental group ""Italian Climate Network"", the 22-year-old student will move to Paris with fellow volunteers to keep a close eye on the summit's works. ""So far, each country is pledging its own voluntary targets and there is no binding mechanism expected. They should do more: science has clearly showed us we are not doing enough"". In the young activist's home country Italy, there has been an increasing number of events linked to extreme weather in recent years. Environmental groups have warned its natural resources were being heavily affected by climate change. For example, a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report show glaciers in the Italian Alps have lost an estimated 40 percent of their total area in the past three decades as a result of climate change. Those taking to the streets in Rome seemed very aware of risks connected to climate issue. ""I teach a course on climate change at the Sapienza University here, and I am not very hopeful the Paris summit will give us a real project to reverse global warming,"" Marcello Vitale told Xinhua. ""We need clear binding commitments and also the necessary resources to implement them. But it seems to me economic interests within energy policies are still too strong to allow such a change,"" he added. Marching hand in hand with his young daughter, the professor said his greatest source of concern was the current unpredictability of weather. ""This is a subject of my studies, and I see the frequency of extreme weather events has visibly increased at global level, it is really too high,"" he stressed. Security was quite visible during the march, since Italy, like many other European countries, raised its terror alert in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people on November 13. For example, activists of Italy's main environmental association Legambiente held a large banner reading ""No to terrorism, yes to peace"". Right behind them, a group of students made their way adding their chants to the rally's cry. ""What I ask from the world leaders in Paris is to have courage,"" Francesca Tonolo, a chemistry student from the north-eastern city of Padua, told Xinhua. ""They have to acknowledge clearly the situation is dire and there is a need of concrete answers"". The student said she was volunteering with local groups in Padua to oppose current policies seen as detrimental to the environment of her city, which ranked as one of the most air-polluted in Europe according to a study from Legambiente. ""Yet, I feel completely powerless concerning the Global Summit in Paris,"" she stressed.

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Jean Charles Hourcade from the France-based International Center for Research on Environment and Development (CIRED), said that taxing carbon emissions is something far more difficult to do than establishing positive pricing on carbon emission reduction. Hourcade was in Rio this week to attend the Rio Climate Challenge, a conference organized by Brazilian NGO Centro Brasil no Clima (CBC). In the conference, experts from several countries and institutions debated the problems caused by climate change and some already ongoing initiatives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas. Hourcade is behind what is regarded as a promising French initiative: positive pricing of carbon reduction through bonds, which would be used to finance the transition to a greener economy. The French proposal is supported by Brazil and will feature at the COP-21 (Conference of Parties 21) -- a U.N. summit on climate change which will be held in Paris in December. The proposal depends on countries agreeing to acknowledge that carbon emission reduction has a convertible monetary value, which is expected to be achieved in the COP-21. After that, a value for the reduction of carbon emissions can be established and the mechanisms to take advantage of this acknowledgement can be put in place.

The new report comes as many cities across China are currently experiencing levels of air pollution 10 to 20 times higher than the WHO-recommended safe levels, coinciding with the start of winter.""Air pollution and climate change pose serious risks to the health of our environment. And they pose serious threats to human health,"" said Dr Bernhard Schwartl\'e4nder, WHO Representative in China. ""The people of China know this only too well: grey sky and frequently unbreathable outdoor air is part and parcel of daily life in many parts of the country.

"COP21","China","COP21_China224","Digital disruptors key to lower carbon","December 18, 2015 Friday","China Daily European Edition","Companies are not waiting for global agreements but adopting transformations using new technology Among those holding their breath before the United Nations Climate Change Conference reached an agreement in Paris on Dec 12 to limit carbon emissions were corporate leaders anxious to understand the implications for their businesses in the near future. For China, with its strong national resolve to build the largest low-carbon economy in the world, the outcome was music to the ears of many green investors. But a large portion of industries view compliance with the outcomes as direct pressure and costly obligations. For instance, China's coal industry is already struggling with a dramatic downturn amid sluggish prices. Overcapacity and shrinking demand, resulting from the transition to lower-carbon alternatives, has resulted in nearly 80 percent of these companies reportedly being challenged by deficits. Even in China's colossal logistics industry, with its growth tied to the prosperity of e-commerce and previous economic expansion, there are worries about new operational costs associated with truck fleet compliance with the country's emissions regulations. Historically, every 1 percent increase in global GDP led to a 0.5 percent rise in carbon dioxide emissions. To many it seems unimaginable to decouple economic gains from emissions considered inevitable. But it is possible. In addition to China's aggressive investment in renewables and electrification, the country is actually pretty close to the key: Internet Plus (digitization of industries by mobile Internet), Internet of Things (Internet-connected products), big data analytics, cloud computing and other smart technologies. Digital disruption is seen by many as the avenue to pave a way to profitability and innovation while reducing carbon emissions. In fact, our research finds that digital technology can offset all new emissions worldwide over the next 15 years. By applying digital technology and moving to low-carbon models in a range of industries, companies around the world can share the estimated $11.4 trillion of new value by 2030. That prize of low-carbon transformation via digital technology nearly equals China's current GDP, and is a welcome alternative to paying the significant costs for complying with tighter emissions rules. Digital technology is so capable of offsetting CO2 emissions that it has great potential to decouple emissions growth from economic growth, according to research by Accenture, the management consulting and technology services company, carried out with the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, a consortium of global information, communication and technology companies. Consider areas like transportation and logistics, manufacturing, agriculture and energy. Digital technology drives down carbon and enhances competitive positioning in each of them. In transportation and logistics, it does so through faster, cheaper and safer mobility, real-time traffic management, smarter logistics, and intelligent lighting. In manufacturing, it occurs with virtual manufacturing, customer-centric production and circular supply chains. In smart agriculture, use of techniques like geographic mapping, machine-to-machine connectivity and data analytics drives water and energy efficiencies to boost crop yields, reduce food waste and ease access to markets. And in the electricity sector, digital technology will enable the integration of renewables like solar and wind on the electricity grid, improving the efficiency of transmission and passing those savings to customers. This unprecedented scale of digital disruption makes low-carbon business opportunities possible - opportunities that weren't feasible five to 10 years ago. To capitalize on the opportunities, Chinese companies hoping to unleash digital technology to combat emissions challenges will need to rethink their businesses on a fundamental level or risk losing out. They need to grasp the need for increasingly blurred industry boundaries because the biggest disruption takes place at the intersection of previously disconnected discipl"

They said faster and wider implementation is needed to achieve the goal of limiting the rise in the average global temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Carbon pricing aims to set a cost to polluters and create schemes through which they can pay that cost and be incentivized to lower emissions  for instance, through  cap and trade systems that allow polluters to buy and sell carbon credits, as well as direct taxes on emissions.The ambitious targets were announced by the World Bank and IMF-organized Carbon Pricing Panel a day before leaders and envoys from more than 160 countries gather in New York to sign the COP21 climate-change pact the world agreed to in Paris last December.

"COP21","China","COP21_China231","In Paris climate conference coal will still be elephant in the room","November 30, 2015 Monday","Global Times (China)","Illustration: Shen Lan/GTOutside the UN General Assembly the Paris Conference of Parties (COP21) will be the largest gathering of world leaders. Such an impressive turnout of 147 heads of state and governments is a remarkable achievement for those who root for a binding global treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But behind the climate kumbaya lies a painful truth: Many of those leaders will not attend the summit out of concern for the world's changing climate, but rather to ensure that their countries, mostly developing ones, don't end up sacrificed on the altar of climatism.It is a sad testimony to the human condition that 2 billion people still suffer from energy poverty, having no light to read, no energy to cook a meal and no power to provide clean water. Energy poverty is a damper on global growth as it prevents the poor from elevating themselves economically. Many climate proponents argue that poverty is partly a result of harsh climate conditions. It is the droughts, floods and storms that exacerbate poverty. Some go even further, linking wars and conflicts, like the Syrian civil war and the attendant mass migration, to climate change. According to this view, if we only cooled the planet slightly, the poor will be spared from all these problems. However, the reality is that if COP21 leads to a legally binding cap on carbon emissions the developing world could be worse off. The reason is that the workhorse of developing Asia, where most of the world's poor reside, has always been and will continue to be coal. Coal fires nearly 80 percent of China's power sector. India, where the number of energy poor is larger than the entire US population, uses coal for 60 percent of its power generation. The combined 600 million people of the 10 Southeast Asian countries are also heavily dependent on coal. The region's energy demand is projected to increase 80 percent in the next 20 years, a rise equivalent to Japan's current demand, and three quarters of the newly approved installed power capacity in the region is coal-based.It is not that Asians particularly like coal. To the contrary, coal is a major source of air pollution which causes numerous health problems. But at the same time coal is vastly cheaper and more plentiful than any other source of baseload electricity. Natural-gas power plants are twice as expensive to construct as coal plants, and natural gas in the region is more than four times as expensive as in the US. Renewables will take decades - if ever - to reach cost parity with coal, and there are problems of reliability. Rich countries may be able to afford to rid themselves of coal. And this they do. Amber Rudd, the UK's secretary of energy, announced recently that Britain will shut down all of its power plants within a decade. In the US where natural gas prices are extremely low, coal has been under attack for some time. The Obama administration is not only making it impossible to build new coal plants domestically, but it also pressures other countries to deny financing to coal projects abroad.Coal will therefore be the elephant in the room in Paris. The rich will try to coerce the developing world into using less coal, using various carrots and sticks as well as peer pressure. This will leave the poor with only two choices: resist and cause the collapse of the talks or agree to accept goals that will never be fulfilled.Instead of vetoing coal altogether, the developed world should direct its resources to steering and incentivizing the coal sectors of the developing world toward better and more efficient coal utilization. But such an incremental approach may not be as emotionally satisfying for leaders of the rich as delivering coal a coup de grace. Those leaders who are unable to defeat IS, pull their economies from stagnation and protect the borders of their countries will try to deliver a phony victory against what they view as the planet's public enemy No.1.

"COP21","China","COP21_China232","Bamboo Matters","December 17, 2015 Thursday","Beijing Review","Africa's ability to achieve sustainable economic growth will depend on a functioning green economy capable of serving the needs of its growing population. As they work to create stronger economies that will bring jobs and prosperity, Africa's leaders are also facing a new climate reality: rising temperatures, drought and increasingly unpredictable rainfall.Water scarcity, land degradation and the emergence of new pests and diseases are compelling them to act. African decision makers were active in the recent UN Conference of Parties (COP21) climate change negotiations in Paris, for instance--contributing ideas, exploring solutions and pushing for a settlement to reduce emissions.Sustainability was also at the core of discussions at the Forum on Cooperation between Africa and China (FOCAC) in Johannesburg. At the meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled the next phase of China's strategic partnership with Africa, pledging $60 billion in sustainable development investment over the coming three years. This will add to the $3.1 billion that China has already committed toward South-South cooperation on climate change.As part of this growing economic partnership, China can help the continent mobilize a new green resource, which although widely available, has not yet reached its full potential. That resource is bamboo.China is the world's leading producer and processor of bamboo. From a subsistence crop three decades ago, the country's bamboo industry now generates around $30 billion yearly, and sustains more than 7 million jobs.Africa can build on Chinese expertise to develop its own abundant supplies of indigenous bamboo. Ethiopia, for example, has an estimated 500,000 hectares of indigenous bamboo. Other African countries have similar resources.Much of the bamboo development knowledge is shared by the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR), the inter-governmental organization dedicated to improving the social, economic and environmental benefits of bamboo and rattan.Hosted by China and headquartered in Beijing, INBAR harnesses international expertise to develop bamboo sectors across Africa--18 of our 41 member states are African. Many are benefiting from the experience of Chinese agencies, such as the International Center for Bamboo and Rattan, the State Forestry Administration and the China Green Carbon Foundation.Over the past two decades, this cooperation has brought African experts and policy makers a wealth of practical knowledge on bamboo sector development, policy advice, and capacity strengthening in the areas of bamboo forest management and processing. That includes product development and design, and the creation of value chains to help develop local bamboo regions.The progress and growth of China's bamboo sector demonstrates how African countries can craft action plans for sustainable development using bamboo. Bamboo cultivation supports climate change mitigation and adaptation, land restoration and the creation of rural enterprises or larger businesses that could bring jobs and attract investment.For climate change mitigation, bamboo helps sequester carbon in many ways. It offers an alternative and highly renewable source of biomass energy, a substitute for wood fuel and charcoal, and for fossil fuels in power generation.Those familiar with bamboo recognize its versatility. There are some 10,000 recorded uses for bamboo products. These include household items, construction materials, cutting-edge designs specified by the world's leading architects, fiber for textiles or cellulose and replacements for products made from steel and PVC.Its production also drives local business and economic growth, and bamboo value chains link rural and forest communities to national and international markets. This economic importance is likely to increase as other forest resources come under increasing pressure, and as the imperative to mitigate climate change fosters less dependence on fossil fuels.Bamboo also helps rural communities become less vulnerable to climate change once they include it in their sustainable forestry and agroforestry systems. Its rapid growth makes frequent harvesting possible, which limits exposure to disaster, and allows farmers to flexibly adapt their management and harvesting practices to new growing conditions as they emerge under changes to the climate.As we emerge from the COP21 meeting and countries develop their climate change action plans, we have a unique opportunity to ensure knowledge transfer in this field. These plans, which specify where countries will focus their mitigation/adaptation efforts, will help identify the areas where bamboo can add significant value--whether it's increasing forest cover, reducing land degradation, or supporting climate-smart agriculture.Commitments expressed at FOCAC further demonstrate the emergence of a strategic China-Africa partnership that African countries can tap into to realize this potential. If sustainability is to be a defining characteristic of China-Africa relations, bamboo needs to play a more prominent role.\l"

With a significant commitment to combat climate change, experts estimate China may reap 1.5 trillion yuan ($230 billion) for renewable energy and environmental projects within the next five years. In 2015 the global green bond market was worth only $46 million, and was only created in 2008 when the World Bank issued the first green bond.Green bonds are bonds issued to finance environmentally-friendly projects, and are expected to revamp the global financial industry by realigning investor risk-return expectations with environmental objectives. ""Green bonds represent a change of dialogue. In a normal bond, you talk about the end result, rating and price, which are reflections of financial management, financing pricing and risk management.

The report, jointly released by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that these World Heritage sites are vulnerable to climate change, highlighting the urgency to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees Celsius, Haq said at a daily news briefing here. The World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report documented climate impacts including increasing temperatures, melting glaciers, rising seas, intensifying weather events, worsening droughts and longer wildfire seasons, at iconic tourism sites such as Venice, Stonehenge and the Galapagos Islands. It also covered other World Heritage sites such as South Africa's Cape Floral Kingdom; the port city of Cartagena, Colombia, and Shiretoko National Park in Japan. The report included a complete list of World Heritage sites that are at risk. ""World governments, the private sector and tourists all need to coordinate their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to protect the world's most treasured cultural and natural resources from the impact of tourism activities,"" said Elisa Tonda, head of UNEP's Responsible Industry and Value Chains Unit. ""Policies to decouple tourism from natural resource impacts, carbon emissions and environmental harm will engage a responsible private sector and promote change in tourists' behaviour to realize the sectors' potential in some of the world's most visited places,"" she said. Because World Heritage sites must have ""Outstanding Universal Value,"" the report recommended that the World Heritage Committee consider the risk of prospective sites becoming degraded by climate change before they add them to the list. In particular, the report underscored the urgent need to identify the World Heritage sites that are most vulnerable to climate change, and to implement policies and provide resources to increase resilience at those sites. Meanwhile, the report also urged increased global efforts to meet the Paris Agreement climate change pledges, in order to preserve World Heritage sites for future generations. On Dec. 12, 2015, after nearly two weeks of hard bargaining, climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in the French capital sealed the Paris Agreement, aiming to reverse the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions. Experts said that China helped resolve several thorny issues to bring about some key breakthroughs. On April 22, a total of 175 countries, including China, inked the Pairs Agreement on the first day of its opening for signature at UN Headquarters in New York, a new record in the United Nations' 70-year history. ""Globally, we need to better understand, monitor and address climate change threats to World Heritage sites,"" said Mechtild Rossler, the director of UNESCO's World Heritage Centre. ""As the report's findings underscore, achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees Celsius is vitally important to protecting our World Heritage for current and future generations."" In addition, the report also recommended engaging the tourism sector in efforts to manage and protect vulnerable sites in the face of climate change, and to educate visitors about climate threats. ""Climate change is affecting World Heritage sites across the globe,"" said Adam Markham, lead author of the report and deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. ""Some Easter Island statues are at risk of being lost to the sea because of coastal erosion.

This necessarily requires an ""all of the above"" energy strategy: hydropower, nuclear, geothermal, biomass, biofuels, wind and solar - are all important sources of non-GHG-emitting energy.But far and away, it is solar and wind that are the fastest growing sources of renewable energy, though at present they supply less than 3 percent of the world's energy. They are leading the world on a path to post-petroleum era. But will they arrive soon enough to solve the problem? A new report on renewable futures by the Atlantic Council suggests it is possible.There is a concerted push to expand the use of renewables. Both the EU and US plan to have 20 percent of their energy from renewables by 2020; EU 27 percent by 2025. One recent report says that OECD nations will get 54 percent of their energy from renewables by 2040.For emerging economies, particularly China and India, which are still heavily dependent on coal for electricity, a renewable future cannot come soon enough. China has invested tens of billions of yuan in building solar and wind capacity; at COP21 in Paris, India pledged to replace coal with renewables if rich nations provided the economic support to do so. But both still rely on coal for more than 50 percent of their electricity, as it is cheap and plentiful.The price of solar and wind energy have been falling for nearly three decades, but both plunged dramatically over the past decade. In the US, solar energy grew by 418 percent since 2010, accounting for 38 percent of new electricity capacity; from 2010-14 wind accounted for 28 percent of new US capacity.Though in some areas, wind and solar are cost competitive with coal and natural gas, in the US and EU, both have been dependent on government subsidies. Yet as costs continue to fall and both wind and solar become more efficient, they are increasingly competitive.But both wind and solar are intermittent technologies - they only work when the sun shines and the wind blows. Cheaper, more efficient energy storage is the critical ""X factor"" to create a new tsunami of wind and solar usage and displace fossil fuels,Both the US and China are investing billions of yuan in R&D in energy storage technologies. In addition to a wave of private venture capital, the US Department of Energy is funding 21 R&D projects into battery technologies. If wind and solar energy can be effectively stored for use whenever needed, they can be more easily and effectively integrated into electrical grids and would become more cost-competitive. Such a development would also create a ""virtuous circle"" of clean energy for electric vehicles, which currently depend on coal or gas for their power sources.Predicting when emerging technologies will become fully commercialized is impossible. But the enormous amount of R&D worldwide being carried out in energy technologies and a wide array of batteries and other energy storage technologies suggest it is not a matter of if the world will see a transition to a post-petroleum era, one dominated by clean, renewable energy. Rather it is a matter of when this occurs. As climate change continues to warm the planet, timing is critical. The COP21 climate conference in Paris seeks to keep climate change below a 2 degree centigrade warming. If transformational technologies that can enable a world of GHG emission-free energy continue to improve incrementally, that is unlikely to be enough to prevent the levels of climate change 190 nations in Paris seek to avoid. For such technologies to reach a tipping point moving the world beyond coal, oil and gas will require renewed efforts, trillions of dollars in investment and new levels of global cooperation.The author is a senior fellow of the Brent Scowcroft Center for International Security at the Atlantic Council.

"COP21","China","COP21_China256","Green Insights","December 24, 2015 Thursday","Beijing Review","During the in Paris, Zhou Dadi, an energy expert and former Director General of the Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission, shared his views in an exclusive interview with Beijing Review reporter Deng Yaqing. He talked about the significance, difficulties and goals of China's green and low-carbon development. Excerpts of the interview are as follow:Beijing Review: How do you define green and low-carbon development? What does it mean to China? Zhou Dadi: Green and low-carbon development is totally different from what China has pursued in the past. The focus is on both promoting economic development and improving the quality of people's life. Before, China valued industrialization, therefore the economy was based on the wholesale construction of industrial facilities, manufacturing of consumer goods, improvement of housing conditions, motorization of transportation, etc. However, such a massive use of materials has resulted in excessive per-capita energy consumption, serious pollution and climate change. The negative effects of traditional industrialization in less populated countries are not as glaring as those in China. Therefore, China should not blindly copy, but instead explore a new and unique development pattern.Now, China's economy is at a bottleneck, and it can no longer be supported by low-end capacity expansion, mass production of traditional consumer goods, and low environmental standards and labor costs. China's per-capita GDP is roughly $7,000 annually. To achieve the developed countries' GDP per-capita level of $20,000-$30,000, China has to expand its production capacity by three or four times its current level if it sticks to the old development pattern. The market, however, is saturated.Green and low-carbon development can not only alleviate environmental pollution, reduce energy consumption and boost productivity, but it can also raise the added value of labor. Currently, although many Chinese people can afford to own a car, the traffic gridlock in large cities is debilitating. Though housing conditions have been significantly improved, air pollution can't be stomached. Such phenomena indicate that the old development pattern should be phased out.What challenges does China face in pursuing green and low-carbon development? Firstly, green and low-carbon development relies on a high level of technology and innovation. However, China now mainly serves as a manufacturing base for the developed world, which specializes in producing high-end equipment and has mastered core technologies. For example, the output of cement, precious metal, iron and steel in China is very high, but many production equipment and technologies are imported from developed countries. That is to say, there is huge potential for economic growth if we invest more in innovation, research and development.Secondly, people with vested interests, and even consumers, are reluctant to abandon profitable methods and technologies that they are used to using. The replacement of old production capacity also takes a long time to accomplish. If policy makers don't take the initiative to promote new and more rational models of production, the process could even be lengthened.Since China abounds in coal and its policy makers believed at one time that more coal exploration and utilization would contribute to energy security, the coal industry has had excessive investments poured into it. Now, overcapacity has led to low price competitions, which hinders the expansion of renewable energy and natural gas usage. For example, households often prefer burning coal instead of natural gas when heating up their houses during winter, and many factories refuse to pay more for the use of renewable and clean energy. Therefore, policy makers need to provide guidance and impose restrictions.Thirdly, social awareness needs to be enhanced. The government should let people know why they have to behave the way they are told to and which sector needs more investment and input. Of course, if the government doesn't clarify the reasons, it will be difficult to convince people. Besides that, some local governments and enterprises don't take green and low-carbon development as a positive measure, and instead see it as an obstruction to economic growth. The government should work to change that mindset.How is green and low-carbon development progressing in China? In fact, the country is already working on it. The Central Government has emphasized ecological awareness, drafting green development into its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), and shown a proactive attitude by making bilateral announcements on tackling climate change with countries like the United States and France. Some companies have also started exploring new consumption models and pursuing energy conservation methods.However, when mentioning economic growth, what occurs first to most people is the construction of industrial parks and factories, real estate investments and the sale of land. From this perspective, most people are not too familiar with the new developmental pattern and therefore tend to slide back into old habits. They have not managed to integrate tapping into new social demands by building resource-efficient and environmentally friendly societies. In the future, more work needs to be done to achieve this.In President Xi's speech at the opening ceremony of the Paris climate change conference, an emphasis was made on the creation of a low-carbon energy system. What is your view? Low-carbon energy systems feature high efficiency from the conversion of energy into services. It requires people to minimize the consumption of high-carbon fossil fuels, do their best to save energy, and make non-fossil fuels their main sources of energy. For this process, low-carbon fossil fuels such as natural gas should be promoted. In the future, when renewable energy power generation is popularized throughout the nation, natural gas can still be used effectively. As a matter of fact, some developed countries have already realized the transition.Under the 13th Five-Year Plan period, China will have to control its total energy consumption and undergo structural adjustments. Only then will we see energy use heading toward green and low-carbon sources, representing national governance innovation and the demands of green development.When will China complete the construction of the low-carbon energy system? Each and every country in the world is required to reach zero carbon emissions by the year 2100. As the world's largest developing country and second largest economy, China has to take a lead in the low-carbon initiative to achieve that goal ahead of time.How do you evaluate the 2015 climate change conference? Will China manage to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in the primary energy mix to around 20 percent? Over 180 countries have so far submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, which indicates that they have all realized the effort that is needed to combat climate change and are willing to make contributions according to their capabilities and obligations.China has shown a positive attitude and is likely to scale up its efforts in the future. According to my calculations, the chances are good for China to peak its carbon dioxide emissions ahead of 2030. In addition, if the consumption of fossil fuels doesn't increase rapidly and new energy consumption mainly comes from non-fossil fuels, China is likely to achieve that 20-percent goal.Now, China is striving to curb the use of fossil fuels. In my view, it's likely to exceed the 20-percent goal. But I hope that policy makers can still harness the coal-to-liquid and coal-to-gas industries, the production of coal power and the like.\l"

At the meeting in Paris, the heads representing each country have attempted to cement their efforts to stave off the catastrophic consequences predicted as a result of rising global temperatures.According to calculations by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), without an agreement in Paris, the world will likely experience an increase of 4-5 degrees Celsius by 2100. That far exceeds the limit that scientists have proposed--declaring that temperatures should rise no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Reviewing the Earth developmental history, one can find that the temperature differences between the pre-industrial world and the last ice age were merely 4-8 degrees Celsius.

The sea level along the country's coastal areas rose by 2.9 millimeters per year from 1980 to 2012, and the average temperature in China increased by 0.9 to 1.5 degree Celsius in the 100 years since 1909, according to an assessment report on climate change in China. The report, the third of its kind since 2007, also shows that from the 1970s to the beginning of 21st century, China's glaciers have retreated by 10.1 percent. These findings indicate that China will continue to warm, with the report projecting a temperature rise of 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The report will be presented at the Paris climate change Conference of the Parties (COP21) on Nov. 30, according to Chen Chuanhong, head of the Department of Science and Technology for Social Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST). The findings are the result of more than three years of work by over 500 scientists. The project was led by the MoST, China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering, with contributions from 16 other central authorities.

He said that China's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) differed from other countries in that the Chinese document was very complete and included ""mitigation and adaptation, strategy and policy, as well as specific measures, even several operational and specific projects."" A key difference was in its ""adaptation"" to climate change, which had not been mentioned by several countries in their respective INDCs. According to Xie, China has presented detailed measures in its INDC such as how it will focus on areas such as agriculture, forestry, water resources, urban and ecologically fragile littorals in order to resist climate change and to improve gradually early warning, forecasting, disaster reduction and prevention system. Xie revealed that ahead of the climate change conference, China had been supported by many countries in the practice and plans for adapting to climate change in several previous negotiations and consultation meetings amongst ministers. Recently, some international media doubted that China would adjust the emissions reduction target in their INDCs because of China's adjustment in coal consumption in 2012 and its new two-child policy. Xie said China was seriously determined to stimulate the economic development with higher quality and higher efficiency to deal with climate change.

"COP21","China","COP21_China265","Green financing to take root at bank","June 19, 2015 Friday","China Daily European Edition","China-led financial institution gives Europe a way to plan action on climate change as Paris summit nears The fledgling Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is expected to shoulder more responsibility in the fight against climate change by offering green financing in developing countries. In April, Jin Liqun, the bank's secretary-general, pledged the bank would be ""lean, clean and green"". This is among the encouraging developments leading up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. The China-led bank's charter is set to be signed late this month, and 14 of the 57 prospective founding members are European Union member states. This provides an opportunity, says Jeff Swartz, director of international policy at the International Emissions Trading Association, which aims to encourage a functional framework for trading in greenhouse gas emissions. ""The EU should carry on support and provide opportunities to finance low-carbon activities in developing countries, through either international carbon funds managed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, or the newly established AIIB,"" Swartz says. The EU has been a role model in its environmental efforts. It was early in its public declaration of the actions it intends to take under a new global climate agreement, which is expected at the Paris conference. The EU is also urging other major players to get on board both multilaterally and bilaterally. Noting that the G20 countries, which represent major world economies, account for 75 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions, the EU says it welcomed the November joint declaration of China and the United States, the world's two largest emissions sources. According to the ambitious bilateral agreement on emissions reduction goals, China set a target for its carbon dioxide emissions to peak by 2030 and pledged to increase the proportion of non-fossil fuels used in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent by that year. Under the agreement, the United States would cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28 percent before 2025. The US repeated its pledge in its INDC, submitted at the end of March. So far, 39 countries have sent their INDC proposals to the UN. Beijing is seeking to submit the INDC by the end of next month, says Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who is also the head of the National Leading Group on Climate Change, Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction, chaired a meeting regarding the country's INDC proposal on June 12. ""The binding targets on energy conservation and emissions reduction set in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) could well be achieved as scheduled,"" he said. He pointed out that last year China's energy consumption per unit of GDP and its carbon dioxide emissions dropped 29.9 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively, compared with 2005. Li says China looks forward to joining those concerned to push for a ""comprehensive, balanced and strong agreement"" in Paris. Countries will reconvene in Bonn at the end of August for the next round of negotiations, and a further round is scheduled for October. Brussels also hopes Li will make a bold resolution at the EU-China Summit scheduled to take place at EU headquarters on June 29. At a news conference in Bonn, the EU's chief climate negotiator, Elina Badram, said the EU assumes a meaningful and ambitious commitment from their partner is likely to be a highlight of the summit's joint communique. The EU Emissions Trading System is by far the world's biggest carbon market and is at the core of the international carbon market. ""Policy action on climate change is not only relegated to the EU,"" Swartz says. Instead, he stresses the carbon markets in Europe can be linked to 40 others around the world, including China's carbon market, to keep costs low and growth possible. Such a move would allow more international collaboration to help finance South-South cooperation on global warming, Swartz says. Meanwhile, China is expected to start operating its national carbon trading market on a trial basis by the end of next year or in early 2017, says Su, the climate negotiator who is director-general of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission. Seven Chinese cities' pilot carbon trading schemes are all operational at present, which means the country has the second-largest carbon market in the world. ""China's plans to launch a national carbon market will be an exciting policy as it will be one of the main drivers for China to meet targets in its 13th Five-Year-Plan,"" Swartz says, emphasizing that experience in the EU and California indicates it is ""entirely feasible"". The Chinese government says it has taken climate change very seriously, and gives priority to green, low-carbon and circular economic development in promoting ecological progress. Circular economies aim to rebuild and reuse resources. China now leads world in terms of energy conservation and development of new and renewable energy, Li says. According to the latest World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate issued by the International Energy Agency on June 14, China has implemented a range of complementary energy and climate policies domestically. Besides the formation of the nationwide emissions trading scheme, the report says, China has carried out measures to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy, cut reliance on coal and introduce more stringent fuel-economy standards in transport. It also shows the growth of China's energy sector is expected to slow in l"

Announced ahead of the opening of the Paris climate conference , known as COP21 climate change summit in Paris, where world leaders are expected to adopt a new climate accord, the Commonwealth Finance Access Hub was expected to help countries successfully bid for climate action funding. Launching the initiative, Prime Minister of Mauritius Anerood Jugnauth told reporters that he is ""confident that the climate finance access hub will be instrumental in our endeavour to address climate change issues."" He said: ""The flow of international climate funds for small island developing states and least developed states, which are the most vulnerable to climate change, has remained problematic. The hub will assist in unlocking existing and new climate funds for urgent adaptation and mitigation."" Mauritius has agreed to host the hub which will be linked to technical advisers across the Commonwealth. The hub was set up after small state leaders said they had experienced difficulty securing financial support, Commonwealth general-secretary Kamalesh Sharma said at the press conference on the first day of Malta commonwealth summit. ""These small states are often told about money but none of them know the number to dial,"" the outgoing secretary-general said, adding the hub will make ""climate finance, a reality."" He also announced that the leaders had agreed on a new mechanism to help states manage debt accrued on climate management. But the details of how this would work were still being worked out. Australia have pledged 1 million U.S. dollars to the hub. However, no more countries in the 53-member-state association announced further help by now. \l"

Speaking of the future of climate project financing and how to get more private investors involved, Hoyer said the idea of Green Bonds should be ""further developed,"" and ""the depth should be dug deeper."" In 2007 the EIB became the first financial institution to issue an environment-themed bond by launching the Climate Awareness Bond. Money raised through this type of bonds can only be allocated to so-called ""green projects,"" including renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture and other forms of adaptation to climate change. Having raised 7.6 billion euros (8.05 billion US dollars) in 10 currencies so far, the EIB remains one of the largest issuers of Green Bonds. The EIB aims to establish itself as a leader in financing climate actions. Earlier this year it announced a new climate lending strategy and agreed that 35 percent of future lending in countries most vulnerable to climate change will support climate-related projects. The bank expects to provide a total of 100 billion euros for investment in such projects over the next five years around the world, according to Hoyer. ""I believe by far we are the biggest multilateral development bank acting in this field, and we have a lot of expertise over many years, so we can bring in our experience and our experts,"" he added.

"COP21","China","COP21_China270","Half-time: A view from the Paris climate talks","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","Hong Kong Free Press","By\~John Sayer.The climate talks in Paris, known as COP21, quietened down on Sunday.\~ For the most dedicated, issues related to the environment, development, business and science continue to be discussed in meetings, \~conferences and workshops all around Paris. For those who need a break, there are musical evenings and sightseeing tours \- but many of these are still themed on the environment. For those at the heart of the talks, we must hope they are holed up in their hotels working with a spirit of compromise and vision to ensure the Paris meeting keeps the planet on the right track.The good news is that the key working groups last week delivered a draft text on Saturday to their countries\' ministers, who will start work today to achieve a worthwhile agreement.\~ Most of the negotiating blocs, representing alliances of countries in the north, the south, the big, the small, the low-lying and the high-flying, have expressed some optimism that the document they have passed to their ministerial bosses is a good basis for achieving a meaningful outcome. HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/500314068View image| HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.comgettyimages.comThe bad news is that the document contains a huge number of unfinished sections, with lots of suggestions for alternatives and additions included in brackets for the ministers and their teams to work through, wrangle about and sort out over the next week.Although there are a few discussions continuing about the negotiation process, there is a feeling that the Paris meetings have avoided the host of complaints about lack of transparency and poor procedure that led to the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate meetings.Protests during the Copenhagen Summit in 2009. Photo: Wikicommons.Few are predicting that the Paris talks will lock us into a binding agreement on emissions that will hold the earth\' s temperature below two degrees.\~ Any definite reduction targets in the agreement are likely to be derived from  nationally-determined plans worked out by countries separately. This will establish some definite reduction targets by all nations, and will demonstrate an acceptance by all countries that we must walk in the same direction on the same path and all be willing to climb the mountains ahead, even if we do so at different speeds.\~ It is also hoped that the final statement will contain an aspirational target on the overall global temperature rise, at either 1.5 degrees or \' well below two degrees.\' HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/500190912View image| HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.comgettyimages.comAn important part of the agreement will set out arrangements to ensure all countries report in an open transparent way on emissions reductions, and to establish a clear timetable for reviewing how we are all living up to our promises, taking note of the latest information from the scientists.\~ Some hope that these continuing processes will enable nations to exceed and improve on the initial Paris-agreed targets in future years to achieve the targets that scientists tell us are necessary to avoid catastrophe. The years after Paris need to be marked by a deepening of \~trust and a spirit of  we-are-all-in-this-together. The key sticking point in all of this remains the degree to which the richest countries, who have been pumping out greenhouse gasses for the longest time and at the highest levels, should bear more responsibility for reducing emissions and provide more money to help others both to reduce emissions (mitigation) and cope with the already-harmful effects of a warming planet (adaptation, loss and damage).\~ All agree on this principle of  common but differentiated responsibility between the wealthy and not so wealthy countries. But the unresolved question is  how differentiated? And what does this mean in cash terms? A protester at Hyde Park, London. Photo: Alisdare Hickson via Flickr.Related to this is the question of the role and responsibility of those countries which are neither very poor nor very rich, but rapidly-developing in terms of wealth and carbon emissions. These nations place themselves firmly in the poor country camp for the purposes of these talks, but some feel they could and should do more and that we should not be locked into country categories established over 20 years ago when climate talks began. Some middle-income countries are nervous that the review process planned for every five or so years after the Paris meetings could become an occasion for renewed pressure on them to improve their emissions reduction targets.The representative from the Marshall Islands reminded the meeting that, while a favorite phrase in the talks is  nationally determined , nations are gathered in Paris  to fight for what is globally necessary.

Given Asia-Pacific's size and its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, its voice and commitment are critical to achievinga comprehensive agreement on climate change. Many Asia Pacific countries are developing and must focus on achieving sustained economic growth and development. Of the 49 regional members of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 43 have a light climate footprint, contributing only 10 per cent to global emissions.For these countries, notably the least developed countries, Pacific islands and low-lying states, vulnerability to climate-related natural disasters will grow with climate change. At the other extreme, the region is home to six of the top 10 emitters in the world - China, India, Russia, Japan, Indonesia and Iran - which account for about 43 per cent of global emissions.Of these top six Asian emitters, fossil fuel-based energy is responsible for about 80 per cent of their collective emissions, with emissions from industrial processes, agriculture and waste playing a lesser role. Mitigating the emissionsof these countries requiresmultiple actions,key among which is a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.Of the 183 countries that have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 43 are from the Asia-Pacific region.Countries across the region have indicated both conditional and unconditional reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.Theseincludeeconomy-wide emissions targets or deviation from a business as usual (BAU) scenario to an intensity targets of emissions per unit of GDP. Many INDCs, particularly those from the developing countries, include an overall rise in emissions by 2030.While this is remarkable in its own right, they still leave a significant gap between the INDCs pledged and the cuts required to keep the temperature increase to below two degrees Celsius warming limit. This gap is close to 16 billion tonnes of CO2 reductions per annum by 2030, roughly equal to the current emissions of China, India, and Russia combined. The only way we can bridge this gap is if we collectively treat the INDCs announced as the floor to be raised by enabling countries to adopt and implement additional measures needed with technical, financial and capacity support.\l"

He first cultivated the hybrid grass in 2013 and has led research ever since.Hunan\' s Changsha County was quick to identify the potential of the grass in its zero-carbon strategy. Over the past two years, Changsha has allocated over 20 hectares for planting and given Lei\' s team financial support to optimize the carbon-capture vegetation.The grass, similar in appearance to sugarcane or sorghum, regrows rapidly after cutting, and can grow three to five rounds a year. The crop can be ground and processed into standard carbon products like paper, construction materials and fertilizers. The grass is able to withstand high temperatures and drought, and can survive in poor soil.Every hectare of the grass can absorb and solidify over 200 tons of carbon dioxide every year, whereas trees hold 15 tons per hectare annually.The grass can lower the cost of carbon capture and storage, and reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said Xu Heping from the Ministry of Science.Changsha hopes that by expanding the grassland, establishing a carbon exchange system and reducing carbon emissions, the industrial county will achieve zero-carbon growth, according to Yang Yiwen, chief of the county committee of the Communist Party of China.Lei said the county must now develop an industrial chain that will make cultivation of the grass profitable, and encourage farmers to plant it.The local government also plans to introduce standard carbon products made from the grass into the carbon trading market, Yang said, meaning that polluting companies can purchase carbon products to offset their emissions.There are, however, doubts about the merits of the grass. Wang Guangjun, a professor of ecology and colleague of Lei, told a Hunan newspaper that the speed at which the grass grows could have negative side affects, as invasive species have been shown to unsettle the ecological balance.\l"

COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. The conference should lead to the adoption of ""a binding agreement, with mandatory compliance, between all countries,"" on cutting harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, Badenier told a gathering of foreign correspondents. He said such an agreement should also surpass the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming. With additional financial support, ""we could cut the gases by up to 45 percent by the same year,"" said the minister. In 2007, Chile emitted 1.02 tons of CO2 per million pesos in gross domestic product (GDP), and aims to cut the figure down to 0.71 over the next 15 years. The overall target is to reduce greenhouse gases by between 40 percent and 70 percent by 2050, in an attempt to prevent global warming from going over 2 degrees Celsius. Experts have warned of a 4.8-degree temperature rise by the end of the century. To spur industries to use cleaner production processes, Chile will also introduce a tax on CO2 emissions of 5 dollars per ton in 2017, said Badenier. United Nations studies show 2014 was the warmest year since records started to be kept in 1880, and several months this year have already registered higher rates. Badenier warned that if participants at the Paris meeting fail to reach a firm agreement, ""commitments may be watered down"" with the passage of time, and ""if each country carries out its own accounting of emissions, using different methods, it's going to be very difficult to reach the targets.""

In its lastest World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate Change, the institution said a peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 if governments implement just five key policy measures. These measures included increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction, increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from 270 billion U.S. dollars in 2014 to 400 billion U.S. dollars in 2030, gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030, reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production. IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol said the link between economic growth and emissions weakened significantly, but was not broken. ""As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence,"" said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. ""It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept,"" she added. The agency also proposed that the key pillars, which are needed to make the 21st UN Conference of the Parties () a success, not only contained an early peak in global energy-related emissions, but also concluded three other targets. They are reviewing national climate targets regularly, translating the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal, establishing a process for tracking achievements in the energy sector. IEA, which is founded in 1974, was initially designed to help countries co-ordinate a collective response to major disruptions in the supply of oil.

The meeting comes days ahead of the Paris Climate Conference (COP21). A special session will be dedicated to climate change, and a statement will be issued by the leaders. This summit is viewed as particularly important as the leaders of more than 50 countries gather in Europe just two weeks after the Paris terrorist attacks, which killed at least 120 people. Thus, another main topic for the meeting will be violent extremism and radicalism. The leaders' discussion will focus on ways Commonwealth countries can work together to defeat terrorist groups. The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 independent states with a combined population of 2.2 billion. It emerged in 1949 after the decolonization of the British Empire. Symbolically headed by Queen Elizabeth II, the Commonwealth includes some of the world's largest, smallest, richest and poorest nations. The CHOGM, held every two years since 1971, is the association's ultimate policy-and decision-making forum. The summit is held in different Commonwealth countries and organized by the host government and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Malta is hosting the summit for a second time. Today's summits evolved, in stages, out of the Colonial Conferences of the late 19th century and Imperial Conferences of the early 20th century. At that time, the British prime ministers and leaders of the dominions met to discuss, in particular, constitutional issues, foreign affairs, defence and trade. From 1944, the summits were called Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meetings, but were still held in Britain, chaired by Britain's prime minister and organized by the British Commonwealth Office. In 1966, at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the conference venue was moved out of Britain and was held in another Commonwealth country, Nigeria, for the first time. In 1971, when the first regular summit was held outside Britain - in Singapore - leaders also decided to change its name to Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM), as there were an increasing number of republics headed by presidents rather than prime ministers. \l"

China will host the G20 presidency this September in Hangzhou (JORDYN DAHL)When China hosts the Group of 20 (G20) Summit in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, this coming September, the world will be watching not just the country's leaders for signs of how its economy is performing, but also what steps the G20 countries are taking to maintain order in an increasingly fraught period of economic and social unrest.This is the first time that China, a non-Western world power, has held the presidency at the G20 summit, marking both China's rise as an economic powerhouse and world leaders' recognition of the power of emerging economies. The presidency responsibilities rotate to a different country each year.The G20 is comprised of 19 countries, plus the European Union. Born out of crisis--it was first created in 1999 in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial meltdown--the organization strives to promote economic cooperation. The first G20 Leaders' Summit was held in 2008 in response to the global financial collapse.""I think when we study global governance, we will look at the creation of the G20 and its role as one of the most important episodes of global governance in all of contemporary history,"" Bruce Jones, director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution, a prominent American think tank, said at a March 22 panel discussing the G20. The event was held in conjunction with the 10th anniversaries of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center and the John L. Thornton China Center, also located at Tsinghua University.But the G20's overall global reach is being called into question, with scholars and world leaders looking to the Hangzhou summit to gauge what the future of the organization will be. The organization thrives in times of crisis, but a lack of urgency has created a lackluster response to the current financial constraints some member countries are experiencing. ""We're seeing a slowdown in a number of major economies, and how [the G20] acts this year and next will be very consequential on whether we see a stable economic situation,"" Jones said.Setting the agenda Indeed, between the collapse of the commodities market, an oil glut and many emerging economies going into recession, the world has no shortage of economic crises. It is within this context that China developed the agenda for the coming summit, said Wang Xiaolong, special envoy on G20 affairs for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the G20 panel.As host of the presidency, China is responsible for setting the agenda and is largely focusing on four issues: development, trade and investment, reform, and for the first time, innovation. Development is the main focus, though Wang said it has not traditionally been a top priority for the G20. ""China wants to serve as a bridge--and it's uniquely qualified to do so--between developing and developed countries,"" said Jeffrey Bader, a senior fellow at the Thornton center, during the panel discussion.Growth has stagnated in many developed and emerging economies, and some central bankers are using negative interest rates to push money back into the market. Other countries, such as Germany, have lambasted the debt growth model. ""The global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,"" read a communiqu\'e9 released at the end of a two-day G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Shanghai in February.Another major topic at the G20 will be innovation, which is on the agenda for the first time in the organization's history. China is pushing through reforms to try and transform its economy from a manufacturing-based one to one centered on innovation to help drive growth forward as the economy experiences a broader slowdown. ""China has to move up the value chain to take advantage of the next wave of GDP growth and become a more innovative economy. This is true of all emerging countries in the G20,"" Charles Freeman, a nonresident fellow at the Thornton center, said at the Brookings event.Tensions in the world order One goal of the summit is to formulate a coherent and unified response to the economic slowdown and market turbulence. The big question, panelists said, is whether or not the world's two leading economies can work together like they did during the 2015 United Nations held in Paris last December.The United States and China played a leading role in finalizing the Paris Agreement, which would not have come to fruition without the two countries' cooperation, said Qi Ye, Director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center. The agreement commits signatories to lowering their greenhouse gas emissions and limiting a global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, a hard-won battle for all those concerned about climate change and something that seemed politically impossible just a few years ago.Yet tensions have risen between the world's two largest economies over the past year in part because of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and their unwavering, opposing positions. Another factor at play is China's increased share of global economic growth and place in the world order. Media headl"

Further progress was made in strengthening rural infrastructure such as roads, housing, and water, power, and methane supply capacity. In order to increase cooperation and connectivity, urban and rural areas moved faster to jointly build and share infrastructure as well as public service facilities.

The fact that we reached such a consensus was amazing in itself, but now we need to act on this collective momentum, with many wondering who will lead this charge, and where the ""big wins"" will come from.Those who follow these issues can now celebrate, as 2016 brought a large unexpected global gift - Oil at $30/barrel, or even less. No one ever expected these low prices, with assumptions of ""Peak Oil"" constraining supply, and China and India's growth driving demand, most assumed high revenues and continual investment attraction, while government subsidies kept the machine well-oiled.A major factor in the price drop has been the disruptive innovation of fracking which now happens almost in Internet time, and virtually guarantees that oil prices will not rise for a long time coming (unless there are significant international political disruptions which could increase in likelihood with some oil countries losing their main revenue sources). Fracking is the ability to extract gas from shale in previously unreachable locations and quantities, and with relative ease. This means that the large incumbents and oil nations who have relied on high prices have had the rug pulled out from under their feet with a multitude of smaller players now competing with production and supply.Environmental groups do not like the potential dangers and impact of fracking, but there is a big unintended silver lining for renewable energies. Now with low oil prices, even the new, smaller fracking players will not want to enter the market. So where will the money go? To clean energy, because there is no turning back technology, and fracking has now opened the flood gates, creating enough supply that the U.S. can now become an oil/gas exporter.The old school of thought used to be that high oil prices made renewable energy more competitive, but this did not remove the need for clean energy to also compete against over $650bn in global subsidies to the oil industry. Now, contrary to popular belief, with oil at $30/barrel, and the reverse oil shock, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to shift investment into the much needed clean energy.\l"

The two presidents reaffirmed joint efforts to push forward an ambitious and  legally binding Paris agreement on the basis of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  The agreement must send out a clear signal for the world to transition to green, low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable development, said the statement. They stressed that developed countries should continue to offer enhanced financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries in the post-2020 period. Xi and Hollande also pledged stronger cooperation in countering climate change in areas such as low-carbon transportation, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage technologies.  China is committed to ensuring the success of the climate conference, Xi told Hollande in their talks Monday afternoon. Xi said China supported France as the host of the conference, voicing confidence that it would successfully play its role as a coordinator to facilitate a balanced and comprehensive result.  I\' m confident for the progress of the conference. Our statement has injected positive energy to the multilateral process of addressing climate change, Xi told a press briefing after the talks. China has made multiple climate pledges. These include a decision to launch a national carbon cap-and-trade system in 2017 to help contain emissions, establishing a 20-billion-yuan (US$3.1-billion) fund to help other developing countries combat and adapt to climate change, and cutting carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030.  The French president\' s China trip is part of his climate change diplomacy which aims to regain Europe\' s leading role in addressing climate change after the unprosperous Copenhagen conference, said Cui Hongjian, a specialist in China-Europe relations at the China Institute of International Studies.

[Photo/Agencies]UNITED NATIONS - While looking back on 2015 with its seemingly disparate challenges, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday that the world's problems are ""tightly interconnected"" with root causes in ""abject poverty and lack of good governance"".Yet, he believed the year ""will be recorded as one of the most important, historic, years in the history of the United Nations,"" because, ""We have laid down all good foundations"" for solving global issues, citing adoption of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by world leaders here in September.Ban also announced the next session of talks on the Syrian conflict, known as the Vienna process, would be held Friday in New York City, followed by a Security Council meeting on the topic.""Syria is an open sore on the Middle East and the wider world,"" the secretary-general said. ""We are pressing for a nationwide cease-fire and for the start of negotiations in January on a political transition, and we must not relent.""During a year-in-review session with reporters at UN Headquarters in New York, dominated by questions relating to the more-than four-year-old Syrian conflict, Ban was asked, if he saw any link between major global crises and ""the entailing consequences, such as the refugee crisis and terrorism.""""In this world nothing is operating in isolation so everything is tightly interconnected whether it is migration or terrorism or peace and development and human rights,"" he replied. ""We can find some causes of certain issues which are tightly connected. Some of the root causes would be abject poverty, lack of good governance, when there is a complete despair among the people.""""When there is a complete disregard by the leaders on the wishes and aspirations of the people, then people try to find other ways to address their own difficulties and concerns and sufferings,"" said the secretary-general.""Nobody wants to suffer from any reason, whether it is of poverty, disease or abuse of authorities or abusive powers,"" he said. ""That is why I've been always asking for good governance and inclusive dialogue and addressing abject poverty, those are the answers.""Ban said foreign terrorist fighters alone cannot be blamed as the cause of violence when other factors have driven people ""to flee, to migrate or to become radical.""""We have to address all this in sync, in closer coordination,"" he said. ""I think world leaders have provided some good sense of promise and hope"" in adopting the ""17 SDGs and the climate change agreement.""If implemented, ""most of the people will be able to live in a much better, in much more stable situation and with much more prosperity,"" the UN chief said. ""The year 2015 I believe will be recorded as one of the most important, historic years in the history of the UN where we have laid down all good foundations.""In his opening remarks at the 45-minute session, Ban said 2015 was ""a pivotal year"" not only for the SDG and Climate Change agreements, but also in marking the world organization's 70th anniversary, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda adopted as a blueprint for financing for development, to ""avert crises down the road,"" and ""The Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction.""These plans and pacts have set the stage for a future that leaves no one behind, said the UN chief.""This year we have seen epic flows of refugees and internally displaced people,"" he said, referring to the multitudes fleeing the Middle East, West Asia and North Africa.Calling for ""a new global compact on human mobility,"" the secretary-general said, ""Demonizing and scapegoating these people based on their religion, ethnicity or country of origin has no place in the 21st century.""In another positive move, he recalled talks on Yemen got underway Tuesday ""towards a lasting cease-fire and a resumption of the political transition.""While saying he would present to the Member States of the United Nations a plan of action on preventing violent extremism next month, Ban insisted many of today's conflicts have ""provided a breeding ground for the spread of terrorism and violent extremism.""""I am alarmed by the escalating violence in Burundi,"" the UN chief said. ""What we have seen over the past few days is chilling.

On November 13, eight IS militants launched a string of terror attacks on Paris again, claiming at least 130 lives, and shocking the world. In early December, a radicalized married couple massacred 14 people at a social service center in San Bernardino, California.2. Hong Kong reform planOn April 22, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government published the electoral reform plan. The package of proposals abided by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and within a framework issued by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on August 31 last year. On June 18, the Legislative Council vetoed the reform plan, meaning no elections next year. The NPC condemned opposition lawmakers for insisting on their stubborn confrontation with the central authorities, which they said impeded the development of Hong Kong's democracy.3. Big financial changesThe AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) was proposed as an initiative by China and supported by 37 regional and 20 non-regional prospective founding members. The article of agreement was signed on June 29, with China, India, Russia, Germany, South Korea and Australia are the major stakeholders. On November 30, the International Monetary Fund put RMB into the SDR, making China's currency the fifth to enter SDR after US dollar, Japanese yen, Euro and British sterling. 4. Accidents shock ChinaOn the evening of August 12, a huge explosion of dangerous chemicals happened in Tianjin, with warehouses and factories as well as nearby residence heavily damaged. It killed 165, including 99 firefighters. At the beginning of the year, a stampede in Shanghai killed 35 and injured 42. On June 1, the Oriental Star passenger vessel was shipwrecked in Yangtze River in Jianli of Hubei Province, with 12 people rescued but 442 killed, the worst shipwreck incident on inland river since 1949. In late December, a landslide that left more than 70 missing in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province was ruled to be a work safety incident rather than a natural disaster, the State Council investigation team said, after the collapse of a waste pile heap. 5. Drowned toddler On September 2, the picture of a 3-year-old Syrian boy's body that had washed ashore on a Turkish beach spread widely. More than 1 million migrants reached Europe this year, mainly those fleeing war in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. They try to reach the West Europe via route from Turkey, Greece and the Balkans. Countries including Austria, Germany and Hungary re-introduced border controls within the Schengen passport-free zone. The quotas system within the European Union for distributing refugees raised a divisive debate, making spaces for the anti-immigration political parties. The EU formed a plan to relocate asylum seekers but encountered opposition from some countries unwilling to shoulder their share.6. Wartime anniversariesThe year of 2015 marked the 70th anniversary of victory in the World Anti-Fascist War. On May 8, events were held in Western European countries to commemorate the V-day. One day later, Russia staged its biggest ever celebrations of the anniversary of the Red Army's triumph over Nazi German in 1945 with more than 150 cities joining in the celebrations and military parade. On September 3, China held a grand military parade at Tiananmen Square, Beijing to mark the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. 7.

"COP21","China","COP21_China297","Experts: Give children a greener education","August 21, 2015 Friday","China Daily European Edition","Varied, tailored teaching methods called for to prepare youth to tackle emissions challenge As greenhouse gases build up in the Earth's atmosphere, the planet is getting warmer. Extreme weather conditions, drought and rising sea levels are already affecting the environment and people's livelihoods. Kenny Webster, head of learning operations at London's Science Museum, believes there are two main reasons why teaching children about climate change is so important. ""The first is that the true impact of climate disruption is going to affect our children and our grandchildren. It is vital that they are informed of the reasons and mechanisms that have led to mankind developing the situation in the first place,"" he says. ""The second is that it is most likely that it will be our children who find the solutions to living with or reversing the effects of climate disruption that we have created for them."" Webster also notes that in the UK there are fewer children choosing to study science, technology, engineering and math subjects at university, and this is creating a skills gap. ""While it is indeed a global problem, each country must do its part toward finding a solution."" In China, although environmental education is now part of the curriculum and interest in the subject is growing, more needs to be done to fully engage children in the environmental issues they will inherit. The World Wide Fund for Nature is the world's largest conservation organization and was the first international conservation organization invited to work in China. Yi Yong, program manager of public education at the WWF, believes China's environmental issues are now going through the toughest stage. ""If we expect future generations to have environmental awareness and take action in conservation, then we need to begin today to pay greater attention to environmental education,"" he says. Yi says environmental education needs to be tailored for the age of the child: ""In nursery and early primary schools years, environmental education can simply be observation of nature. In later primary school years analytical thought can be introduced to prepare students in secondary school to face greater problems and seek methods to solve them. ""These methods should emphasize teaching out of the classroom and practice in society, rather than conventional methods of teaching. But in China today the collaboration between formal and informal education is limited,"" Yi says. ""Most are confined to formal education in the environment, and only explore the topic once or twice a term. Some creative projects encourage students to use science and technology to solve environmental problems, such as water conservation and clean energy use, but concern about real environmental issues is still relatively small."" Yi believes more needs to be done in China to teach children about the environment. ""A real system of environmental education still needs to be strengthened. Environmental education needs to be more interactive, heuristic and exploratory, as well as more often take place outside the classroom. ""Environmental education should also be relevant to the students' lives, learning what is happening in today's society and exploring the root causes of these problems. Solutions should not be seen as limited to technology. Instead, children should be encouraged to use communal and management methods to tackle these problems, such as research, debate and realizing mutual interests. The learning process is often more important than the outcome,"" Yi says. In the United Kingdom, environmental education is finding its place in the school curriculum, and many are taking it a step further to give children a greater opportunity to learn about the environmental issues that affect today's world. The Science Museum showcases a range of exhibitions on climate science and sustainability, and the subject is one of the museum's strategic themes for the next 10 years. In addition, the museum also provides climate science learning programs, as well as temporary exhibitions and art installations. However, Webster points out more needs to be done to teach children about climate change. ""Currently, many people do not actively engage with the concept of climate change because it involves people having to do things that they do not want to do, such as change their behavior."" Nevertheless, Webster believes greater familiarity with the subject will allow people to see the benefits of sustainability and actively encourage it.

Rao Aimin / For China DailyThis is among the encouraging developments leading up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December.The China-led bank's charter is set to be signed late this month, and 14 of the 57 prospective founding members are European Union member states.This provides an opportunity, says Jeff Swartz, director of international policy at the International Emissions Trading Association, which aims to encourage a functional framework for trading in greenhouse gas emissions.""The EU should carry on support and provide opportunities to finance low-carbon activities in developing countries, through either international carbon funds managed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, or the newly established AIIB,"" Swartz says.The EU has been a role model in its environmental efforts. It was early in its public declaration of the actions it intends to take under a new global climate agreement, which is expected at the Paris conference.The EU is also urging other major players to get on board both multilaterally and bilaterally.Noting that the G20 countries, which represent major world economies, account for 75 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions, the EU says it welcomed the November joint declaration of China and the United States, the world's two largest emissions sources.According to the ambitious bilateral agreement on emissions reduction goals, China set a target for its carbon dioxide emissions to peak by 2030 and pledged to increase the proportion of non-fossil fuels used in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent by that year.Under the agreement, the United States would cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28 percent before 2025. The US repeated its pledge in its INDC, submitted at the end of March.So far, 39 countries have sent their INDC proposals to the UN. Beijing is seeking to submit the INDC by the end of next month, says Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who is also the head of the National Leading Group on Climate Change, Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction, chaired a meeting regarding the country's INDC proposal on June 12. ""The binding targets on energy conservation and emissions reduction set in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) could well be achieved as scheduled,"" he said.He pointed out that last year China's energy consumption per unit of GDP and its carbon dioxide emissions dropped 29.9 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively, compared with 2005. Li says China looks forward to joining those concerned to push for a ""comprehensive, balanced and strong agreement"" in Paris.Countries will reconvene in Bonn at the end of August for the next round of negotiations, and a further round is scheduled for October.Brussels also hopes Li will make a bold resolution at the EU-China Summit scheduled to take place at EU headquarters on June 29.At a news conference in Bonn, the EU's chief climate negotiator, Elina Bardram, said the EU assumes a meaningful and ambitious commitment from their partner is likely to be a highlight of the summit's joint communique. The EU Emissions Trading System is by far the world's biggest carbon market and is at the core of the international carbon market.""Policy action on climate change is not only relegated to the EU,"" Swartz says. Instead, he stresses the carbon markets in Europe can be linked to 40 others around the world, including China's carbon market, to keep costs low and growth possible.Such a move would allow more international collaboration to help finance South-South cooperation on global warming, Swartz says.Meanwhile, China is expected to start operating its national carbon trading market on a trial basis by the end of next year or in early 2017, says Su, the climate negotiator who is director-general of the Department of Climate Change of the National Development and Reform Commission.Seven Chinese cities' pilot carbon trading schemes are all operational at present, which means the country has the second-largest carbon market in the world.""China's plans to launch a national carbon market will be an exciting policy as it will be one of the main drivers for China to meet targets in its 13th Five-Year-Plan,"" Swartz says, emphasizing that experience in the EU and California indicates it is ""entirely feasible"".The Chinese government says it has taken climate change very seriously, and gives priority to green, low-carbon and circular economic development in promoting ecological progress. Circular economies aim to rebuild and reuse resources.China now leads world in terms of energy conservation and development of new and renewable energy, Li says.According to the latest World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate issued by the International Energy Agency on June 14, China has implemented a range of complementary energy and climate policies domestically.Besides the formation of the nationwide emissions trading scheme, the report says, China has carried out measures to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy, cut reliance on coal and introduce more stringent fuel-economy standards in transport.It also shows the growth of China's energy sector is expected to slow in l"

It uses such fuels as wheat and cotton straw, corn cobs, plant stems, branches and leaves to generate electricity, pioneering renewable energy in the region. ""We burn everything -- from crop straw to forestry residue -- that has calorific value,"" said Ding Jin, general manager of Jinan Weiquan Biomass Power Generation Company, which owns the plant. PIONEERING USE OF BIOFUEL The plant consumes around 300,000 tonnes of biofuel annually. In 2015, it generated 230 million kilowatt hours of electricity while using 170,000 tonnes less coal, and producing 1,500 tonnes of sulfur dioxide and 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide less than conventional power plants. The raw material comes from farmers within 50 km who would otherwise burn up the straw themselves, causing air pollution or even wildfires. The company collected 131,000 tonnes of straw last year. ""We use green and environmentally-friendly resources which benefits the local people,"" Ding said. Yang Rongmin, deputy head of the Publicity Department of Pingyin County where the company is based, said, ""It is a win-win situation where villagers earn money for their straw and the environment improves,"" Yang said. Su Shuqin, 52, from nearby Dong'e Township, said her family has been supplying straw -- mainly wheat and soybean -- on a regular basis, bringing in an annual income of up to 60,000 yuan (9,300 U.S. dollars. Weiquan is just one example of such plants not only in Shandong but also across China. Fu Bing, deputy general manager of Weiquan, said four plants owned by rival companies are being built this year in Shandong, and that Weiquan's parent company, Shandong Qiquan Group, has affiliates in Hong Kong and the southwestern province of Guizhou. Globally,renewable energy still relies heavily on government subsidies and for the first time in 2015, investment in renewables was higher in developing countries than in developed ones, mainly attributable to China's investment, a March UN report showed. According to the report, Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2016, investment in renewable energy hit a record 286 billion U.S. dollars in 2015. China invested nearly 103 billion U.S. dollars in clean energy, up 17 percent from 2014 and 36 percent of the world total. Yet the ultimate goal of a ""carbon neutral"" economy enshrined by the 195 nations attending the UN climate talks """" in Paris last December is ""still a long way off,"" said the report.

"COP21","China","COP21_China302","What can business do to make cities more efficient and sustainable?","January 12, 2016 Tuesday","China Daily European Edition","As we undergo the fourth industrial revolution, companies are uniquely positioned to partner with governments to address some of the world's greatest challenges. Urbanization continues to spread globally, with 70% of the world's population expected to live in cities by 2030. This trend brings with it the urgent need for more efficient use of energy, cleaner energy generation and cost effective energy storage. While the public-sector must lead, it should work closely with the private-sector to rapidly implement best practice policies, programs and projects that will improve urban efficiency and sustainability.Buildings are responsible for up to a third of greenhouse gas emissions globally. The most cost effective time to reduce energy consumption in buildings is before construction where integrated designs and off-the-shelf building technologies available today can yield up to a fifty percent reduction in energy use and positive returns on investments. For existing buildings, energy efficiency retrofits using these same principles can deliver 15-40 percent savings that pay for themselves over time through energy cost savings.Best practices for improving building energy efficiency in cities include: 1) adopting and enforcing building codes and appliance standards, 2) setting reduction targets and adopting sustainable construction and leasing policies, 3) establishing retrofit programs for public and private-sector buildings, 4) introducing certification, benchmarking and transparency programs, 5) accepting innovative financial models and programs and 6) coordinating efforts with local utilities. While results are promising, very few cities globally have implemented a comprehensive set of these elements.To help cities, the World Resources Institute (WRI), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Global Environment Facility announced the expansion of the Building Efficiency Accelerator1 during Paris COP-21. The Building Efficiency Accelerator is a partnership between WRI, the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative and other organizations and industry partners including ICLEI, Global Green Growth Forum, Johnson Controls and Ingersoll-Rand. This program focused on doubling the rate of global energy efficiency improvement emerged from an initial dialog at the 2014 Annual Meeting in Davos. One early engagement of the Building Efficiency Accelerator is in Mexico City. Mayor Mancera of Mexico City announced at Buildings Day during COP-21 that it plans to integrate building energy performance in local construction codes, retrofitting hospitals with solar hot water and efficiency measures, and auditing and retrofitting municipal buildings. A launch event in March included over 100 participants from city and federal government and the private sector. The engagement is now being supported by four working groups chaired by Mexico City staff and managed by WRI/CTS EMBARQ.While buildings represent a great opportunity to improve demand-side urban efficiency, district energy systems are seeing a resurgence of interest in urban sustainability on the supply-side. Modern district energy systems provide centralized heating and cooling to urban areas with efficiency gains of up to 80-90 percent over conventional solutions. Paris initially developed a district heating system in 1927 to reduce air pollution from burning coal. Today, renewables provide over 50% of co-generated heat to the equivalent of 500,000 households. Paris also developed Europe's first and largest district cooling system using water from River Seine while improving energy efficiency by 35 percent. The UN SE4ALL District Energy Accelerator builds upon the success of the UNEP District Energy in Cities2 initiative which has documented best practices from 65 cities around the world. The District Energy Accelerator includes many institutional and industry partners including ICLEI, UN Habitat, Danfoss and Veolia. In Dubai, air conditioning represents 70 percent of electricity consumption. The city is developing the world's largest district cooling network which will cut this electricity use in half while also reducing its consumption of fresh water through use of treated sewage effluent. The city of Anshan, China is integrating isolated boilers into their district heating network and capturing waste heat resulting in a 1.2 million ton reduction in annual coal use. Finally, Tokyo is capturing waste heat from buildings and metro stations, heat pumps connected to local water sources and solar thermal energyStanford University has implemented an innovative strategy for building energy efficiency and modern district energy technology. Driven by aggressive State of California goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, the university developed a plan to reduce building energy use up to 30% less than code, increase renewable energy generation to 73 MW, decommission an existing natural gas fired combined heat and power plant and build a new water and energy efficient central energy system3. The new energy system provides 90% of campus heating needs from heat recovery chillers and reduces water consumption by 15%. The design includes chilled and hot water storage systems managed by sophisticated predictive control algorithms that forecast weather conditions, campus energy requirements and energy costs ten days in advance.Increasing urban efficiency must be a priority for leaders at all levels as we collectively strive to promote the quality of life for city residents and address the great challenges of global climate change, energy security and economic development. A number of global partnerships are helping build capability and capacity through increased collaboration between the public and private sectors. With a record numbers of cities, businesses and institutions making ambitious commitments during Paris COP-21, now is the time to leverage the experience, resources and solutions of the private-sector combined with the leadership of local governments to accelerate action toward urban efficiency and sustainability.The author is CEO of Johnson Controls.

El Nino is also causing droughts and floods in parts of Asia, the Pacific and Latin America, it added. The consequences could ripple through generations unless affected communities receive support amid crop failures and lack of access to drinking water that are leaving children malnourished and at risk of killer diseases, UNICEF said in a report called ""A Wake Up Call: El Nino's Impact on Children."" Besides the immediate risks of death and injury, El Nino can lead to significant increases in diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, diarrhoea and cholera, which are major killers of children. When extreme weather deprives communities of their livelihoods, young children often suffer from undernutrition, which puts them at greater risk for illness, delayed mental development and premature death. ""Children and their communities need our help to recover from the impact of El Nino and to prepare for the further damage it could unleash,"" UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in a press release. World leaders will gather in Paris for the 21st United Nations Climate Conference, also known as COP21, from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. The goal is to reach a universal, binding agreement aimed at limiting global warming by cutting greenhouse emissions. El Ninos are not caused by climate change, but scientists believe they are becoming more intense as a result of climate change. Many of the countries now experiencing El Nino are those that face the gravest threat from climate change. Many of the areas affected also have high poverty levels. The weather phenomenon, among the strongest on record, is likely to cause more floods and droughts, fuel Pacific typhoons and cyclones and affect more areas if it continues strengthening as forecast over the coming months. Some of the countries most affected by El Nino include Somalia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Pacific nations, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, Peru and Ecuador. El Nino is a climate pattern linked to the warming of surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, which can have a profound effect on weather patterns around the world. El Nino events tend to happen every two to seven years. \l"

""The poor and most vulnerable have suffered first and worst,"" Ban at the second meeting convened here as part of the UN High-Level Water and Sanitation Days 2015, a set of coordinated events taking place on Nov. 18-20 at UN Headquarters in New York. ""Issues of water and disaster resilience are so intimately related that it is impossible to think of one without the other,"" Ban said. ""Yet too often we do, by thinking in silos and responding in fragmented ways. It is time to close these conceptual and operational gaps."" The events coincide with the final meeting of the secretary-general's Special Advisory Board on the issue. The Wednesday meeting came just 12 days before the opening of the UN climate change conference, widely known as COP21, in Paris. World leaders are expected to strive to develop a plan to mitigate global warming and its concomitant effects, which scientists say will include more devastating droughts, catastrophic flooding and destructive cyclones. Ban highlighted the vital role that water management and disaster risk reduction play in ensuring food security, increased access to energy, and in tackling the challenges of rapid urbanization. ""Investments in climate resilience and disaster risk reduction can also help combat climate change, save lives and avoid the destruction of vital infrastructure,"" he said. The secretary-general appealed for global commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the framework accord adopted in March at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, in Sendai, Japan, in which water management and disaster risk reduction are fully integrated. ""Member states have put in place a set of goals and targets that encourage cross-sectoral thinking in both the understanding of risks and our approach to managing them,"" he said. ""They encourage whole of society efforts that engage science, civil society and the business community to work in partnership."" ""Let us build on the Sendai Framework of Action and Agenda 2030. Let us make the most of the climate change conference that opens in Paris in just 12 days,"" he said. ""Solutions exist. We have the tools.

No one ever expected these low prices, with assumptions of ""Peak Oil"" constraining supply, and China and India's growth driving demand, most assumed high revenues and continual investment attraction, while government subsidies kept the machine well-oiled.A major factor in the price drop has been the disruptive innovation of fracking which now happens almost in Internet time, and virtually guarantees that oil prices will not rise for a long time coming (unless there are significant international political disruptions which could increase in likelihood with some oil countries losing their main revenue sources). Fracking is the ability to extract gas from shale in previously unreachable locations and quantities, and with relative ease. This means that the large incumbents and oil nations who have relied on high prices have had the rug pulled out from under their feet with a multitude of smaller players now competing with production and supply.Environmental groups do not like the potential dangers and impact of fracking, but there is a big unintended silver lining for renewable energies. Now with low oil prices, even the new, smaller fracking players will not want to enter the market. So where will the money go? To clean energy, because there is no turning back technology, and fracking has now opened the flood gates, creating enough supply that the U.S. can now become an oil/gas exporter.The old school of thought used to be that high oil prices made renewable energy more competitive, but this did not remove the need for clean energy to also compete against over $650bn in global subsidies to the oil industry. Now, contrary to popular belief, with oil at $30/barrel, and the reverse oil shock, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to shift investment into the much needed clean energy.Big oil companies are hemorrhaging at the wells, laying-off large chunks of their staff, and countries are now much less incl"

Commonwealth countries agreed to abide by the target to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The statement said that Commonwealth countries expected the outcome at the Paris summit will stimulate sustainable economic growth, give a clear signal of the need for deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions and support vulnerable states. Meanwhile, developed Commonwealth countries reaffirmed their commitment to play their part in mobilising the 100 billion U.S. dollars every year by 2020 to address the adaptation and mitigation needs of developing countries.

He first cultivated the hybrid grass in 2013 and has led the research ever since. \~ \~Hunan's Changsha County was quick to identify the potential of the grass in its zero-carbon strategy. Over the past two years, Changsha has allocated over 20 hectares for planting and given Lei's team financial support to allow them to optimize the carbon-capture vegetation. \~ \~The grass, similar in appearance to sugarcane or sorghum, regrows rapidly after cutting, and can grow three to five rounds a year. The crop can be ground and processed into standard carbon products like paper, construction materials and fertilizers. The grass is able to withstand high temperatures and drought, and can survive in poor soil. \~ \~Every hectare of the grass can absorb and solidify over 200 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, whereas trees hold 15 tonnes/ha annually, according to the China Quality Certification Center. \~ \~The grass can lower the cost of carbon capture and storage, and reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said Xu Heping from the Ministry of Science. \~ \~Changsha hopes that by expanding the grassland, establishing a carbon exchange system and reducing carbon emissions, the industrial county will achieve zero-carbon growth, according to Yang Yiwen, chief of the county committee of the Communist Party of China. \~ \~Lei said the county must now develop an industrial chain that will make cultivation of the grass profitable, and encourage farmers to plant it. \~ \~The local government also plans to introduce standard carbon products made from the grass into the carbon trading market, Yang said, meaning that besides the exchange of emission quotas, polluting companies can purchase carbon products to offset their emissions. \~ \~There are, however, doubts about the merits of the grass. Wang Guangjun, a professor of ecology and colleague of Lei, told a Hunan newspaper that the speed at which the grass grows could have negative side affects, as invasive species have been shown to unsettle the ecological balance. \~ \~Tan Xiaofeng, a botanist at the university who specializes in woody plants, also voiced reservations. Generally speaking, he said, the carbon sink ability of grass is much weaker than woody plants.

[Photo/Xinhua]The principle of a ""common but differentiated responsibility"" should be highlighted in the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December, a stand that China has insisted on, said a commentary by Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change.""Addressing climate change is in the core interests and benefit of all nations, and also an issue that is closely related to each country\' s global impact, thus the actions and interactions from different countries are intense, Xie wrote in a recent People\' s Daily article.Conflict and divergence still exist on how to realize common yet differentiated responsibilities, such as how to fairly allocate each country\' s share of capital and technological support and reach an agreement that is legally binding globally, wrote Xie.Taking the excuse of a changed global economic order, some developed countries have proposed a new system whereby developing and developed countries shall make joint investments in reducing carbon emissions after 2020, a move that Xie said is aimed at safeguarding their own interests.Xie pointed out the new system has blurred the responsibilities that developed and developing countries should shoulder and the system also fails to take into account the different capabilities of countries to tackle carbon emissions.The ambiguous approach to historical responsibilities and differentiating present capabilities in tackling climate change would damage the existing international solidarity to combat the threat and should be avoided, wrote Xie.Xie also said existing disputes in the practice of emissions reduction affect the agreement.As some countries push for a sweeping and legally binding agreement for all countries to realize strict emissions reductions, other nations are seeking more tolerant and flexible reduction standards in which countries can decide on their own level of contributions without a legally enforceable commitment.Xie argues that developing countries generally believe the agreement should insist on common but differentiated responsibilities, be fair and take into consideration each nation\' s capacity to cope with the demands.Developed countries shoulder greater historical responsibility for climate change and should take the lead in emissions reduction while providing developing countries with capital and technological support.Developing countries also face other challenges, such as poverty reduction, improving living standards and environmental protection.The legitimate right to develop should be safeguarded when developing countries tackle problems arising from the environment and climate, said Xie.Developed countries have so far made limited progress in their commitments to reducing carbon emissions by 2020 and promising $100 billion annually to developing countries after 2020. This will be a huge challenge for the upcoming Paris conference, wrote Xie.

Urban policy decisions before 2020 could determine up to a third of the remaining global ""carbon budget"" that is not ""locked-in"" by past decisions, said the report released by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), a global city alliance focusing on climate change. Scientists have previously calculated that the world can emit a ""carbon budget"" of just 1,000 gigatonne (Gt) C02 to avoid a rise of 2 degrees Celsius in global average temperatures above the pre-industrial levels, and that 80 percent of this budget has been locked-in by investments or policy decisions that have already been made to build infrastructure such as fossil fuel power stations, highways and energy-hungry buildings. The new report focused on the remaining carbon budget of 200 Gt C02 in the next 15 years and found urban infrastructure development could account for 31 percent of that budget. It also showed that investing in modern and efficient infrastructure in the next five years will be four times less expensive than continuing to expand traditional high-carbon infrastructure now, and then having to replace it in the future. ""This report provides hope for the future because it shows that we don't just have to rely on the outcome of the critical Treaty negotiations (in Paris in December), but that mayors and city leaders in office right now have the opportunity to protect a large share of the world's carbon budget,"" C40 chair and mayor of Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro Eduardo Paes said in a statement. As for what measures cities should be taken before 2020, Seth Schultz, C40 director of Research, Measurement & Planning, told Xinhua that reducing emissions from buildings and transport is vital in staying on a climate safe path. Climate action in transport, for instance, ensuring condensed urban form, combined with more efficient vehicles and effective widespread public transport such as buses and bike sharing, could save up to 15 Gt CO2 by 2030, Schultz said. More efficient building codes are also ""a vital way"" for city governments to reduce the emissions of buildings, he said. ""Together, action in cities could avoid locking in 45 Gt CO2 in cities by 2030. This is equivalent of eight times the current annual emissions of the United States,"" Schultz said. ""Without strong action by cities, efforts to stay within the globally agreed carbon budget would be very difficult."" The report was launched at an event honoring international and U.S. mayors, including those from many C40 cities, which was held Thursday at the U.S. State Department. The event served as the culmination of the ""Our Cities, Our Climate"" initiative, a partnership between the U.S. State Department and Bloomberg Philanthropies. \l"

We will feel the implications in Hong Kong just as much as everyone else, if not more. The Third National Climate Change Assessment Report, prepared by 550 experts, reports that the temperature along China's coast has been rising faster than the global average. Rising temperatures will cause more extreme weather, natural disasters, frequent storms, flooding and unprecedented droughts - challenges to economies, cities and communities everywhere. Industry sectors, from agriculture to finance, energy, infrastructure and manufacturing, have already started to work toward a low-carbon future to overcome these challenges. And a rising generation of entrepreneurs, innovators and startups understands the way forward is to design for positive environmental and social impact.Climate change cannot be solved by one country or government alone.It is a systemic challenge that requires creativity, imagination and innovation across the private and government sector and the public at large.An important first step is the adoption of the Paris agreement during the Conference of Parties, COP21, in December.So far, 188 countries have submitted\~to the United Nations\~their plans -- called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) --\~to reduce\~greenhouse gases.This covers about 99 percent of global emissions.Now, countries need to ratify the agreement and commit to their respective INDCs.More needs to be done. The INDCs alone will not get us close enough to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees.Business worldwide has a vital role to play.The We Mean Business coalition invites companies to commit to seven climate initiatives that enable a low-carbon future.Already, 554 companies and investors have committed to taking action.\~Startups, entrepreneurs, pioneers and innovators with the vision to create positive environmental or social impact have an incredible opportunity to be part of addressing climate change.A rising generation of empowered entrepreneurs are collaborating, designing and building solutions that can disrupt entire industries - something that was unthinkable only a few years ago.\~Startup companies often conceptualize some of the greatest ideas but often lack the tools to execute them or realize them to their fullest potential.With a lower barrier to some of the industry's best tools, these innovators can imagine, design and create their ideas at a fraction of the time and cost and so bring innovations to the market for positive environmental and social impact.One example is a young Chinese startup: Pionovision aims to bring solar power to millions of families through its unique solar cloth and thin-film technology.The company started in 2014, and since then has implemented various solar projects, supporting many off-grid communities.Recently it helped a school in a remote area in Hebei province; now students can use lights, water purifiers and computers.Actions like these are starting to build momentum toward a low-carbon future.A study published in the scientific journal Nature shows a negative correlation between rising temperatures and worker productivity - the higher the temperature, the lower the worker productivity.

Once fully operational, the plant, on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, will supply electricity to 1 million households, cut annual coal use by 4.26 million tonnes and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide by 896,000 tonnes and 8,080 tonnes. This is not just an isolated example, China is the world leader in clean energy investment. The numbers speak for themselves: In 2014, the government spent 89 billion U.S. dollars on green energy, accounting for 29 percent of global investment in the sector, and, in the same year, carbon emissions per unit of GDP was 33.8 percent lower than the 2005 level. Regardless of China's measures, however, it will take the commitment, and action, of more than one country to really make a difference. At the Paris Conference of the Parties (COP21), which opened on Monday, many eyes were on China. Of course the usual rhetoric of ""the world's second largest economy and the biggest emitter of emissions"" continued to be thrown about in an attempt to amplify its climate change obligations. However, it is high time that nations begin to acknowledge that China has never hesitated in the pursuit of hitting its targets. Isn't it telling what is less reported? Such as China, the biggest developing country and the world's most populous nation, has to lift another 70.17 million people out of poverty in the next five years.

"COP21","China","COP21_China334","Interview: UNICEF official calls on world leaders to consider children at climate conference","November 25, 2015 Wednesday 3:32 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","""Think of the children in your negotiations"" will be the message sent by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to world leaders who are going to Paris for the upcoming climate conference. Children are vulnerable to climate change here and now, a UNICEF official told Xinhua in a recent interview ahead of the much-anticipated COP21 Climate Change Conference scheduled to be held in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 ""Unless we act now -- The impact of climate change on children,"" a new UNICEF report released here Tuesday, details the types of increased risks climate change poses to children. David Anthony, one of the co-authors of the report, told Xinhua about the report's findings and what they mean for world leaders as they negotiate in Paris. ""Climate change is often talked about as a future event but the kind of climate risks that children face are quite prevalent now,"" Anthony said. ""Over 500 million children live in areas of flood occurrence risk, and we have 160 million in extreme or high risk of drought so these are real risks for children right now,"" he said. By renewing their commitments to attend the climate change conference despite the recent Paris attacks world leaders have shown the importance they place on the meeting. The United Nations and many others hope that the upcoming conference will see countries finally reach an agreement on how they will work together to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. Two degrees Celsius is the generally agreed upper limit of warming above pre-industrial levels needed to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change. However, while world leaders are discussing future possible scenarios, Anthony wants them to know that the world's poorest children are particularly vulnerable to climate change already. ""It's the poorest children who live in the poorest countries, the most difficult parts of these countries, that are going to be experiencing climate change hardest and strongest,"" he said. This is in part, because climate change will exacerbate some of the challenges already affecting the world's most vulnerable people. For example, children are already overrepresented as refugees, and yet climate change is likely to make more people have to leave their homes, the report found. And some of the world's most deadly illnesses -- such as malaria -- are likely to spread further as the climate changes, said Anthony. This will disproportionately affect children under five, who already represent two thirds of global malaria deaths, as noted in the report. The report also notes that the reemergence of malaria in China has been linked to increases in rainfall and temperature. Anthony said that it was important for world leaders to consider children as they negotiate their joint commitments to addressing climate change over the coming weeks. He called on both developed and developing countries to work together. ""Bold action is really required in Paris in a few days time to make the kinds of changes that we will really need,"" he said, ""by both developing countries and developed countries alike."" But he added that while governments must be responsible for looking after the wellbeing of children, everyone has a role to play in preventing climate change. ""Everyone has a role to play to contribute to making sure that their children -- or our children -- have a world in which to live,"" he said. \l"

And worryingly for China\' s current leadership when Beijingers looked towards those same heavens this month they didn\' t see a lot: throughout much of December the capital\' s skies have turned eerily dark as thick blankets of smog descended, leading to school closures and cars being ordered off the road. On Monday the city issued its first ever red alert for air pollution.The timing of this onset of grey miasma could not have been more germane \- it would have been one of the last things President Xi Jinping saw of his country as his plane took off for Paris where he attended global climate change talks (that remain ongoing).It was almost as if the heavens were reminding Xi of the ancient social contract: rule wisely and you will remain in power; fail to meet the needs of your people and you will be unseated.In the past natural disasters were a sign that the emperor, or the \' son of Heaven\' , had lost his mandate. But, of course, the smog that descended on Beijing last week was not a natural disaster, at least not entirely.Weather and geography did play a role in trapping the pollution over Beijing but the high levels of PM2.5 particles \- the smallest and most hazardous type \- were locally generated from car emissions and coal-fired power plants.And that\' s where there is a strong connection between air pollution and China\' s carbon emissions \- the latter being the central issue Xi and other world leaders discussed at COP 21 in Paris.Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels and China \- the world\' s biggest carbon polluter \- relies on it to produce two thirds of its electricity.It\' s no coincidence that the smog returned to Beijing this year when the weather began to get cold and in response power stations fired up to meet demand for heat.This encapsulates China\' s central problem in respect to air pollution and climate change \- how does a government carry on improving people\' s livelihoods, or keeping them warm in the winter, whilst also reducing the longer term threat of global warming?Speaking at the COP 21 opening ceremony on November 30 \- when PM2.5 hourly levels in Beijing reached 40 times the World Health Organisation\' s recommended limit \- \~Xi admitted the past three decades of rapid economic growth had  taken its toll on the [Chinese] environment \~but he stressed that China was now taking the issue seriously. China is making vigorous ecological endeavours to promote green and low-carbon growth, he said.\~ We have the confidence and resolve to fulfill our commitments, he added. His tone and indeed his presence marked a change from the Chinese attitude at the last United Nations climate change talks in Copenhagen in 2009. On that occasion China sent Premier Wen Jiabao to negotiate. However, during key meetings he vacated the room leaving Xie Zhenhua, special envoy on climate change, to remonstrate with Western leaders.The jist of his argument was that developed countries are largely responsible for global warming and international emission caps were another tool to stop China\' s economic rise.The argument was not altogether unreasonable but Xie \- who is still China\' s main negotiator on climate change \- became known as the man who shook his finger at President Obama and China was widely blamed for having sunk the talks.This time China comes to the table with more confidence and a greater motive to participate and drive change. Just before the talks started the Ministry of Science and Technology put out a report saying China is being affected more than other countries by rising temperatures and sea levels. It said that soil erosion and erratic rainfall will lead to crop failure and a loss of food security. It also warned that the country\' s eastern seaboard \- its economic powerhouse \- would be threatened by rising waters.Yet aside from all this there are domestic political reasons for why the Chinese government may be keen to get an agreement in Paris.As The Economist pointed out last week: if 195 nations at COP 21 come together and commit to action that will cap global warming it will help China\' s top leaders push through much needed economic reforms \- namely, shutting wasteful and polluting steel plants and coal pits so the economy can transition to a more service-based growth.Just as with joining the World Trade Organisation or the renminbi being included in the International Monetary Fund\' s special drawing rights basket, a deal in Paris would strengthen the hand of those pushing for reform because even hardl"

Representatives from foreign and local universities, NGOs and think tanks as well as government representatives from Brazil and France discussed the challenges of transforming the current fossil-fuel based economy into a low-carbon and greener one. Brazil and France presented their actions taken so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage low-carbon activities. Brazil has made some progress in reducing carbon emissions over the past few years by sharply cutting back deforestation. However, experts suggest that the country needs to do more such as investing in clean energy. The conference was organized by Brazilian think tank Centro Brasil no Clima (CBC), whose executive director, Alfredo Sirkis, is a former congressman and a longtime leading environmental advocate in the country. Sirkis' CBC, along with France Strategie, an office of the French government, aim to present a new strategy at the UN's Climate Summit to be held this December in Paris: establish carbon reduction emissions as a convertible financial value to develop mechanisms to finance a smoother transition to a low-carbon economy. Positive pricing of carbon emission reduction in the form of financial bonds is among the measures proposed. Sirkis said conferences like Rio Climate Challenge help consolidate the proposal, adding that there was also progress at the recent Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. He said the parties had acknowledged the social and economic value of mitigation actions. ""This opens a giant field for us to work in the next years.

""Now we must design the details of the path to the safe, prosperous, climate neutral future to which we all aspire,"" she said. When officials leave Bonn in May 26, they are expected to have in their mind clearer pictures of various issues, including regular reviews and ""ratchet up"" of countries' climate actions and transparency of developed countries' financial support to developing countries. Researches showed that even if all current climate action plans of countries were fully implemented, the world is on a path towards a temperature rising of about 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Figueres said she is confident that the pace of negotiations will be faster than in past years as countries now understand the threat of climate change and opportunities of transforming their economies. A proof is the record number of countries which have already signed and ratified the Paris Agreement. Currently, 177 nations have signed the pact, 16 among them have completed their domestic ratification procedures. However, analysts warned that old quarrels between the developed and developing countries might re-emerge despite an overall trend of collaboration. In a press conference later on Monday, the European Union's chief negotiator Elina Bardram reiterated that the EU will not revise its targets of reducing carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and at least 40 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, targets which some developing countries and environment activists said were too low as the bloc had already reduced its emissions by 19 percent by 2013. ""The EU's 2030 climate and energy framework is a very very ambitious policy,"" she argued. Financial support to developing countries is another hot topic of the negotiations. ""For our endeavors to be achieved, enhanced and adequate financial and technology support as well as capacity building must be provided to allow for effective action both pre-2020 and beyond,"" said ""G77+China"" in a joint statement. Salaheddine Mezouar, Morocco's Foreign Minister and incoming President of the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech told negotiators that he expected the annual climate summit in November to be an occasion when a road map for concrete and predictable provision of the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar would be prepared.

The latest bolt from the blue for the Delhiites was farmers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana burning their paddy crops and other organic waste, which adds to the toxicity of Delhi's air.Just a week before Diwali (scheduled for November 11), Delhi's air quality was judged many times more toxic and hazardous than haze veiling Southeast Asian countries. Credible news reports pegged the Indian capital's air pollution levels at 27 times the safe limit on the morning of November 4.Besides the haze emanating from Punjab and Haryana farmers burning their paddy crops, there is another more severe threat which is growing by the day, but continues to be ignored. This threat is from the almost 9 million vehicles that run in the Indian capital on a daily basis, majorly contributing to the choking Delhi air.However, the Indian government is increasingly becoming sensitive to the poor air quality of its cities. The Modi government is taking long-term measures to reverse this trend. A big step that the Modi government has taken and is going to announce at the Paris climate change conference beginning on November 30 is an ambitious plan for New Delhi to use alternative and clean sources of energy like solar power on a massive scale. At the third India Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in late October, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about his plan to invite around 110 nations to join an international solar alliance to be spearheaded by India and launched at the Paris Climate Conference, known as COP21, on November 30. The proposed alliance is to be named the International Agency for Solar Policy and Application and is aimed at a host of African nations and others located between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn to act as a platform for countries to share technologies as opposed to relying on costly transfers from the EU and US.India has already come up with Charanka Solar Park, the largest site within the Gujarat Solar Park, which is being built on a 2,000-hectare plot of land near Charanka village in Patan district, northern Gujarat.Rajasthan is one of the states of India leading in the field of solar energy. The district of Jodhpur has 42 projects totaling 293 megawatts (MW), followed by Jaisalmer and Bikaner. Indian cities like Nashik (Maharashtra), Indore (Madhya Pradesh) and Surat (Gujarat) have formulated city-level climate action plans.The Indian government is going to use solar energy in railways in a major way and provide subsidies for putting solar panels on the roofs of around 500 trains to generate electricity. This is in addition to the plan to set up 500 MW capacity solar panels on the rooftops of railway stationsBesides, India has given the green light to generating electricity from offshore windmills. India is already among the world's top producers of electricity from windmills on land, with a capacity of more than 23,000 MW. As green bond volumes increase and are expected to double globally from last year's $37 billion, India's YES Bank and Export-Import Bank have started to issue green bonds.In light of the above, it is clear that India has finally woken up to the challenge of improving the air quality of its cities, though this initiative should have been launched years ago.

The report highlights that the situation is poised to change when the national emission trading system is introduced in China in 2017.The KPMG Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting 2015 - Currents of Change analyses the quality of carbon reporting among the world's 250 largest companies by revenue (G250) - including 39 in China and Hong Kong. The ninth edition of the survey finds that Chinese companies are lagging behind in terms of carbon reporting initiatives. The report was released prior to the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris, where global agreement on reducing carbon emissions is expected.Of the G250 companies surveyed, four out of five claim they report on carbon emissions and identify carbon/climate change as a concern, though just over half of Chinese respondents said the same. The survey finds that on average, Chinese firms score 10 out of 100 in reporting quality compared to a global average of 51; they are also the least likely to set carbon reduction targets (3 percent) among the G250 (53 percent). In comparison, the vast majority of companies in Germany (94 percent) and the UK (83 percent) have already set such goals.Maria Cheng, Partner and Head of Business Reporting and Sustainability, KPMG China, says: 'While China is only in the early stages of carbon reporting compared to developed countries, the situation is poised to improve as China will introduce an emission trading system in 2017. Carbon reporting will become a higher priority because companies are facing ever-increasing expectations to provide information on carbon emissions and the action they are taking to reduce them, as evidenced by China's recent release of its first national accounting and reporting standards on greenhouse gas emissions.'As a developing country and the world's largest carbon emitter, China is committed to limiting its carbon emissions, which will peak latest by 2030, and China has targeted cutting 60-65 percent of its carbon intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) in 2030 compared to 2005. Moreover, 20 percent of energy will come from non-fossil fuel sources within the next 15 years. China also recently issued its first national standards for accounting and reporting greenhouse gas emissions in 10 key industries, including power generation, steel, chemical engineering and cement.Cheng continues: 'With all these developments, it is important that the board reviews corporate strategy to position the company to grow, and at the same time reduce its carbon emissions.'Additionally, the survey analyses corporate responsibility (CR) reporting by the 100 largest companies in 45 countries - a total of 4,500 companies across 15 sectors. Seventy eight percent of the top 100 Chinese companies published CR reports, increasing from 75 percent in 2013 and 59 percent in 2011. The global average stands at 73 percent in 2015, up slightly from 71 percent in 2013.In terms of CR reporting quality, the G250 companies in Asia Pacific scored 52 out of a possible 100, up slightly from 50 in 2013, overtaking their counterparts in the Americas (50) and catching up with organizations in European countries (68). China respondents among the G250 scored an average of 42.The survey also highlights that more companies in Asia Pacific now clearly identify their stakeholders in their reporting, as well as explain how they engage with those stakeholders and what action they take in response to stakeholder views.Cheng concludes: 'Companies should no longer be asking whether or not they should report on CR. Instead, they should embrace the value CR reporting brings to companies and view it as an opportunity to distinguish themselves from others.'\l"

Nearly 70 percent of foreign respondents agreed that China is already a global power, 4.7 percentage points higher than in 2014, according to a survey by the Global Times Global Poll Center about China's image and its global influence this year. The survey also shows some 72 percent of foreign respondents believe China has the economic strength of a global power, far more than those who believe in China's military power and political power - both around 30 percent. The survey was conducted among 20,811 respondents from 20 countries across six continents. This included Chinese respondents and those from the US, Russia, Japan, the UK, Australia, France, Brazil and South Africa, from October 13 to November 25. China has seen greater and more substantial achievements in 2015, such as the progress of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said Hu Yishan, a senior researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and a former political secretary to the Malaysian prime minister.This progress has contributed a lot to the growth of the world economy and probably a wider recognition of China as a great power, Hu noted.However, there is a huge gap between Chinese people and foreigners in seeing China as a global power - only 27.9 percent of Chinese respondents said yes, the survey shows. Limited perceptionThe image of China as perceived by foreigners is limited, Zhu Jiejin, an associate professor at the Center for BRICS Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times, adding that many people naturally regard China as a great power with media reports labeling the country as the ""second-biggest economy in the world"" and ""biggest trade partner of over 120 countries.""""Chinese people have a better perspective of the country's problems since they live there,"" Zhu said. He added that a more precise identification of China is a ""developing great power,"" a power with wider participation in global affairs such as the Paris COP21 climate change summit and the G20 summit, and also a country facing poverty and imbalanced and unsustainable development. It's also noteworthy that China is gaining more attention for its economic as well as military power. And that means more responsibilities for China to shoulder, Hu said. The most significant change to China's image was ""confident,"" chosen by 26 percent of foreign respondents, followed by ""collaborative"" and ""tough.""A series of diplomatic moves such as President Xi Jinping's visit to the US and many European countries, together with achievements such as the inclusion of the yuan to the IMF's Special Drawing Rights, all show China's image as ""confident,"" Hu said. Some 73 percent of Japanese respondents regard the country's diplomatic and political ties with China as ""bad,"" followed by Vietnamese respondents at 42 percent. But in general, some 60 percent of all foreign respondents regard their countries' ties with China as ""good"" or ""very good."" It is understandable that people from those two countries are worried about the rise of China, with an eye on the territorial disputes and competitive relations, Pang Zhongying, dean of the School of Global Studies at the Guangzhou-based Sun Yat-Sen University, told the Global Times. The top three impressions of Chinese people from foreign respondents are that they are thrifty, family-focused, and polite. Pang said that Chinese who could travel or study abroad are normally those with a good education and a higher salary, and the majority of whom are very polite.\l"

Unlike in many Western countries where recycling is long established, in Morocco there is little legal framework for waste sorting.Morocco only recycles about eight percent of its municipal waste, but has targeted to increase the amount to 20 percent by 2020, according to a report presented at the European Union last year.  Informal waste processing is generally done by poor social groups with a low level of education as a daily means of survival, said Mustapha Azaaitraoui, a researcher specialised in environmental issues.Set up in 2011 with support from the World Bank, the Attawafoq cooperative at the Oum Azza industrial landfill south of Rabat is a first attempt at changing that.It employs about 150 people  mainly ex-pickers  to sort trash for recycling on-site instead of on the streets.Among them is Yassin Mazout, 31, a history graduate who heads the cooperativeafter becoming a trash picker to pay for his studies. We are all equal, we all have the same monthly salary of 2,500 dirhams (US$260), he said.  Before, at the old dumpsite, the strong would crush the weak. After working outside for years, Mazout and his colleagues now work under a roof manually sorting through half of the average 2,000 tons of solid waste that arrive each day. We\' re much better off, agreed Najat, who before joining Attawafoq spent 18 of her 51 years as an informal trash picker. We have social security and our earnings help us support our families. This year for the first time the cooperative made a profit that will be divided up between members and used to increase its capital.Mazout wants trash pickers to finally receive the  respect they deserve as  they play an important role in our lives  both environmentally and economically . The workers are very well organized, said Gerard Prenant, director of the Pizzorno Environnement group that operates and has invested 650,000 euros (US$737,000) in the landfill. They\' re very professional in sorting and we\' re delighted to have them workingat our site, he said.At the landfill outside the capital, Attawafoq\' s workers are giving back value to waste. The cooperative provides an important environmental service at zero cost to the community, Mazout said.Recycling not only reduces waste in landfills, but also helps to lower greenhousegas emissions by saving energy from producing or importing products like cardboard and plastic.Mazout says he hopes the project will inspire others around a country that still counts 220 unauthorized dumpsites.Morocco aims to close all these informal dumping grounds by 2020, environment ministry official Lubna al-Abed said, and has already funded 16 waste sorting centers like Attawafoq in partnership with municipalities.\l"

Xie Zhenhua revealed this during the two-day China-U.S. Climate Leaders Summit that ends on Wednesday. Officials from China and the United States -- the world's top two sources of greenhouse gas -- are expected to discuss strategies for and practices in fighting climate change in both countries. Multiple Chinese and U.S. cities signed the Climate Leaders Declaration and nine other working agreements, such as the California-China Urban Climate Collaborative (CCUCC) and the Memorandum of Understanding between the cities of Shenzhen and Los Angeles. Under the deals, about 10 cities and provinces in China promise to reach their peak level of greenhouse gas emissions earlier than 2030 with Beijing and Guangzhou agreeing to reach their greenhouse emissions targets by 2020, or 10 years earlier than the national schedule. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama issued China-U.S. Joint Announcement on Climate Change last November, said Xie. ""In that announcement, the goals we specified will be materialized through local governments' actions and enterprises' actions, therefore today we are holding this summit to provide an opportunity for local leaders to exchange their experience and learn from each other,"" Xie said. He noted that this summit shows both China and the United States are taking concrete actions to implement the joint announcement before Xi visits the United States later this month. The summit also shows China, the world's biggest developing country, and the United States, the world's biggest developed country, can cooperate with each other in concrete actions to address climate change and achieve win-win results to be better prepared for the Paris Climate Change Conference (COP21) scheduled to take place by the end of this year, he said. ""China aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030, its non-fossil energy will account for 20 percent of its primary energy consumption, and China will increase another 4.5 billion cubic meters of forest stock,"" Xie said. China's whole carbon emissions will peak by around 2030, and ""it shows China's utmost efforts in tackling the climate change challenge,"" Xie said. ""For China, we are suffering a lot from climate change,"" he said, adding that climate change caused more than 2,000 casualties and cost over 200 billion yuan (31.4 billion dollars) in each of the past 10 years. ""We don't take climate change as a burden; instead we take it as a good opportunity for us to transform our growth pattern, and an opportunity for economic restructuring, industrial restructuring and restructuring of our energy mix,"" Xie said at a press conference after the opening ceremony. ""There is a very good momentum to push forward green and low carbon development in China,"" he told Xinhua, adding that China's new energy industry employs around 39 million people, and the number will top 69 million in 2030. As the first platform for mayors and governors of both countries, as well as entrepreneurs to exchange their practices and ideas on climate change, Xie hopes the summit will help promote low-carbon and green development in both countries. ""We have agreed that Beijing will host the second summit next year and we believe that this cooperation will get even better in the future,"" he said. \l"
"COP21","China","COP21_China360","Australia has already met 2020 target on lower greenhouse emissions: official","November 25, 2015 Wednesday 12:32 AM EST","Xinhua General News Service","Australian Environment Minister Greg Hunt has claimed the nation has already achieved its target of lowering greenhouse emissions by at least 5 percent by 2020. ""Critics have claimed time and time again that we would not achieve our 2020 target,"" Hunt told the National Press Club (NPC) in Canberra on Wednesday. ""I can advise formally that the critics are wrong."" Wednesday's announcement came days out from the beginning of the 2015 United Nations (UN) Climate Conference in Paris, which Hunt will personally attend alongside Australian Prime Minister (PM) Malcolm Turnbull. ""My deepest hope and belief is that the world will achieve an agreement on climate change in Paris,"" Hunt said during his speech. Two years ago, the Australia government vowed, as part of the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol, to decrease its emissions in the region of five to 25 percent by 2020, based on the country's greenhouse levels in 2000. ""Australia's projected cumulative abatement task from 2013 to 2020 has fallen every year. The latest update shows that we will meet and exceed our 2020 emissions reduction target,"" the environment Minister said in a statement on Wednesday. The ""tracking"" report stated Australia is 28 million tonnes of greenhouse abatement (reduction) ahead of the amount required to reach its 2020 target. However, the independent Climate Change Authority (CCA), an Australian advisory organization to the government, reported in October that the 5 percent figure was ""not a credible option"". The CCA suggested the Federal government would need to hit 15 to 25 percent in order for Australia to play its part in reaching 's two-degree maximum for global warming. A new deal to map out Australia's post-2020 emissions target is expected to be finalized before the end of the year, Hunt said. \l"

An official in the EU Delegation to the African Union Cristina Vicente Ruiz voiced the support at the fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa conference in Victoria Falls. ""The EU is looking forward to continue working closely with the African partners on climate change in the framework of our Joint Strategy to define, defend and implement our common interests,"" Ruiz said. She stressed that climate change played a pivotal role in Africa-EU relations as shown by the bloc's substantial financial support to Africa's efforts to combat climate change. The EU was already a major provider of climate finance where in 2013 it provided 12 billion U.S. dollars in climate finance with almost half of all pledges to the Green Climate Fund coming from EU member states, Ruiz said. In addition, at least 20 percent of the EU budget in the 2014-2020 period would be spent on climate related projects and polices in the EU and externally, with approximately 14 billion Euros from this budget going to be spent in developing countries. ""For the EU, funding for climate action will be crucial too as many countries struggle to raise the required financing and will need help for the global effort to succeed,"" Ruiz said. She said a stronger Africa-EU partnership was more imperative as the world headed to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 21) in Paris this December to ensure the adoption of an agreement that is satisfactory for all parties. Africa and the EU had various areas where they were in agreement in relation to their expectations from the Paris summit and the areas of convergence included the need for the agreement to balance adaptation and mitigation and the need for a legally binding, ambitious and fair new agreement. \l"

He said Hong Kong's total emissions will peak around 2020, when a shake-up in how the city gets its electric power is slated for completion and a cluster of coal-fired plants are retired to make way for relatively cleaner gas-fired ones - roughly a decade earlier than the mainland's pledge to peak emissions around 2030. By ""around 2020"", Hong Kong will be on track to reduce its carbon intensity - emissions per unit of GDP - by 50 to 60 per cent and energy intensity by up to 40 per cent. By that year, it will have already met its 2010 target of reducing total emissions by 19 to 33 per cent from 2005 levels, he said. ""The road forward is clear but we won't see immediate reductions daily or even annually. It's not necessary,"" Wong said. ""We are nearing peak emissions. It will happen when the coal-fired power plants are retired and when we are using cleaner fuel for electricity generation."" He was quick to list a basket of measures under his energy-saving blueprint that would help achieve the intensity targets, including cutting energy use in government buildings further and tightening the buildings energy code. ""By 2025, this [tightened code] will help Hong Kong save 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and 3.5 million tonnes of carbon,"" he said. But the latest government data showed that the city's greenhouse-gas emissions have been rising since 2000, amounting to some 43 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2012. More than two-thirds of it still comes from electricity generation. The first coal-fired plant to have been built since the 1980s will be retired only in 2017 and the rest are scheduled to be completely retired by the early 2030s. Hanging in the balance will also be negotiations with the city's two power companies on the electricity-supply regulatory framework after 2018. Wong will brief the legislature's development panel on the latest results of the public consultation on the future electricity market today and will discuss market readiness and future changes to the regulatory regime with the two suppliers before January. Greenpeace had calculated that under a ""business as usual"" approach"", only 31 per cent of emissions could be cut in the next two decades. It called on the government to stop nuclear imports when the contract with the Daya Bay nuclear plant comes to an end in 2034 and to boost renewables in the fuel mix. Greenpeace senior campaigner Frances Yeung Hoi-shan said the government needed more aggressive schemes to cut emissions given the city's high per capita annual generation. Cheung Chi-wah, WWF Hong Kong's senior head for climate, said the government urgently needed a climate plan that would go beyond 2020. Wong said the government would keep an ""open attitude"" on the nuclear question post-2034, but any post-2020 climate and energy policy would need further discussion. ""Our current targets only go up to 2020. As to how we can set longer-term goals, we will have to come back to Hong Kong [from Paris] and discuss this with the community on how we can undertake this process.""

The paper was written by researchers from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy. They say in the paper that a crucial climate change conference in Paris later this year is ""highly unlikely"" to agree on emissions reductions targets that limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, they argue: ""Success in Paris will depend largely on whether the new agreement contains elements that create pressures to scale-up ambition in the years following the Paris COP (Conference of Parties)."" COP 21) will take place in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. All eyes will be on the negotiations expected to result in a legally binding and universal global climate agreement. The paper calls for an agreement made in Paris to mandate countries to evaluate their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at regular time periods. It suggests that countries could upscale their ambition every five years, as new low-carbon technologies become available and the costs of existing technologies continue to fall. The paper also proposes several major targets that countries should focus on to avoid dangerous climate change. These include achieving net zero emissions in the second half of this century, decarbonizing electricity production by 2050 at the latest and phasing out coal entirely. The intended nationally determined contributions that countries have so far submitted ahead of Paris should be seen as ""initial contributions"" at the start of a process of raising ambition over time towards the ultimate goal of net zero emissions, according to the paper. \l"

According to the Rome based UN food body, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed here earlier by Patrick Ignatius Gomes, Secretary General of the ACP, and FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva, which is in bid to support the 79 ACP members work ""towards achieving the global Sustainable Development Goals"" to be agreed later this year. In the agreement, the ACP Group and FAO pledged to ""strengthen their cooperation in support of actions contributing to better address the continuing food insecurity and malnutrition, hunger, natural resource management and climate change challenges in the ACP Group Member States.""

"COP21","China","COP21_China366","Common Goal, Concerted Efforts","December 24, 2015 Thursday","Beijing Review","Throngs of people were overwhelmed by tears and cheers on December 12 as French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, president of the Paris climate change conference, struck a green gavel. It signaled the conclusion of a marathon 13-day negotiation between delegates representing nearly 200 different countries and regions, who had gathered in Paris. The representatives at the 2015 United Nations made a deal that will go down in history as a rare moment of worldwide cooperation in the face of a monumental challenge. But as fellow negotiators hugged each other in celebration, grave concerns lurked in the corners of their minds--this was just the beginning of a war against climate change that is expected to last for generations.The unprecedented victory was a result of the 195 nations that acted in unison to commit to carrying out a legally binding climate deal. They carried the hopes of people around the world--the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions to protect against the catastrophic consequences of a warming atmosphere. In the past 23 years since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) came into being, little progress had been made on this front, even if you count the Kyoto Protocol and Bali Roadmap as being effective. Especially considering the failed 2009 Copenhagen conference, at which countries railed against each other with bitter animosity and developed countries refused to hold up their previously agreed-upon obligations.The world has come a long way from the days when it seemed like countries would not be able to settle their near-sighted disputes, as reflected by the tone and language of the leaders involved in the accord. ""We have entered a new era of global cooperation on one of the most complex issues ever to confront humanity. For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and join in common cause to take common climate action,"" said UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who acclaimed the Paris agreement as a resounding success for multilateralism.""At the Paris climate change conference, we adopted an equitable and reasonable, comprehensive and balanced, ambitious, durable and effective, and legally binding agreement,"" claimed Xie Zhenhua proudly, as China's special representative on climate change affairs. He continued that the deal will send the world a ""strong, robust and positive [message] to achieve green, low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable development.""Xie's view was echoed by Nicolas Stern, Chair of the London-based Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, who took the conclusion of the climate change conference as a historical moment and believed that the Paris agreement will create enormous opportunities as countries begin to accelerate along the path toward low-carbon economic growth.Taking up the reigns Lo Sze Ping, CEO of World Wildlife Fund China, noted that China was playing a very constructive and critical role in pushing forward the conclusion of the Paris deal. ""Many key solutions such as proposals bridging consent for the final text are actually a result of China's joint cooperation with many of the other key negotiation parties,"" said Lo.China is taking the initiative on issues such as climate change by reaching out to different countries. ""This time, China appeared with more confidence and openness in dealing with climate issues, and has taken up an increasingly important role of coordinating developed and developing countries and promoting mutual trust and consensus among different groups,"" said Yang Fuqiang, a senior adviser on climate, energy and environment for the Natural Resources Defense Council's China Program.Although the ""wheel of climate action turns slowly,"" said Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, ""it has turned in Paris."" Stretching that metaphor, one hopes that the wheel will continue to turn forward, not backward.Echoing similar thoughts, Zou Ji, Deputy Director General of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, has suggested that the bottom-up-oriented Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) system has contributed greatly to the success of the Paris conference.""As the second legally binding document under the UNFCCC, the Paris agreement varies from the Kyoto Protocol which adopted a top-down forcible emission reduction mechanism and couldn't win approval from some developed countries,"" said Zou, noting that the United States' refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Canada's withdrawal and Japan's reluctance to join the second commitment period are testimony to the failure of the top-down method.By implementing the Paris agreement, China will take up the opportunity to reduce pollution and extreme weather events, promote industrial development and create more jobs. More importantly, the agreement has sent a policy signal which will exert more influence on investors and consumers and propel China's green and low-carbon transformation, according to Zou.Wu Daohong, President of Beijing Shenwu Environment and Energy Technology Corp., said that the market potential for energy conservation and emission reduction is huge. ""When enterprises have found a way to enhance efficiency, they tend to use advanced technologies to lower costs by saving more energy,"" said Wu.A map to success ""We have [achieved] solid results on all key points,"" said Ban, who noted that the agreement is ambitious, flexible, credible and durable.The Paris agreement is comprised of 29 items, encompassing targets in finance and technology, capacity building, transparency, mitigation and adaptation, loss and damage, global stocktaking and so on, and is expected to be signed into action in April 2016. If just 55 countries which produce at least 55 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions ratify the agreement, it will enter into force.That is to say, the threshold for the agreement to take effect has been lowered from that of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. ""The agreement will come into force if 55 countries agree to sign it, implying a stronger will to perform real deeds,"" said Li Junfeng, Director General of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.The agreement requires countries to work together to limit the increase of the global average temperature to well below 2-degree-Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to just 1.5 degrees Celsius. To this end, countries agreed to cut emissions drastically to realize net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century.Taking into consideration the conditions faced by some small island countries, the concept of a 1.5-degree-Celsius limit was included into the agreement, indicating a willingness to ramp up efforts to tackle climate change, said Li.""Countries will need to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions sometime in the second half of the century. For the 2 degrees Celsius goal, that's net-zero between 2080 and 2090, and between 2060 and 2070 for 1.5 degrees Celsius, said Jennifer Morgan, Global Climate Director of the World Resources Institute.However, all of the INDCs currently submitted by countries would result in an average global temperature increase of around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, falling short of the 2-degree-Celsius goal, according to a report released by the International Energy Agency.To bridge the gap, countries have agreed to assess their implementation strategies and take stock of their efforts' results every five years, encompassing mitigation and adaptation, financial support and so on. The assessments will start from 2023. After that, countries will have to reinforce their actions every five years.Beyond that, the agreement also urges developed countries to scale up their level of financial support. It suggests the creation of a concrete roadmap to achieve the goal of jointly providing $100 billion annually in funding by 2020 for mitigation, adaptation and new technological support development.""Without formulating a pragmatic roadmap, pledges of financial support made by developed countries will become a pie in the sky. Future negotiations will be based on the roadmap,"" said Kevin Watkins, Executive Director of the Overseas Development Institute.""More financial support is needed to ensure poor countries are not left paying the price of a climate crisis that was not of their making,"" Watkins added.In terms of a historical responsibility, it makes sense that ""developed countries should fulfill their promises to assist developing countries in terms of finance, technology and capacity building, laying a solid foundation of mutual trust for future negotiations,"" said Xie.Implementing initiatives ""China had achieved a lot, bilaterally, before the conference was convened, such as making joint announcements with the United States, France and India. Domestically, it proactively promotes ecological awareness, and sets a good example for other countries to follow,"" said Zou. He stressed that China has been striving to safeguard the interests of developing countries by sticking to the principles of equality, common but differentiated responsibilities and each country's respective capabilities.Yet even the deal was sealed off, new challenges reared their heads. The Paris agreement and the supporting decisions are an unparalleled diplomatic triumph. Yet it is crucial to distinguish between diplomacy and implementation, said Jeffrey Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute of Columbia University, pointing out that the urgent, long overdue challenge of implementation is not a job for diplomats but for business leaders, engineers, financial managers and politicians.As far as China is concerned, the agreement must now be integrated into the nation's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) and be transformed into domestic strategies and schemes. Ongoing efforts need to be made to honor the agreement in terms of policies, mechanisms, technologies and finance. Also, the nation should work with the international community to hammer out the details in promoting transparency and assessment, intensify the research and development of low-carbon technologies, further restructure the economic system and develop some new standards, according to Zou.""This is not a moment for triumph, given the lives that have been lost already as a result of climate impacts and the lives that are on the precipice as temperatures rise. This is a time for urgent action,"" said Naidoo.The effects of climate change are starting to be seen, felt and heard by people around the world. People in Pacific Ocean islands have already started fleeing to other countries as a result of debilitating floods; the U.S. State of California has been confronted by droughts that shrivel up crops and dries up water reserves; and Beijing recently succumbed to red-alert levels of smog that have forced young children to stay indoors.The Paris agreement may be a step in the right direction, but was just one battle in a long war with a distant end in sight. For the sake of our future generations, citizens of the world must work both individually and together to protect our environment and mitigate the risks of climate change.\l"

The newly-elected Polish president made the remarks in an exclusive interview to Xinhua at his Palace, ahead of the fourth leaders' meeting of China and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, to be held in east China's Suzhou city from Nov. 24 to 25. Duda called the proposed economic link between Asia and Europe an ingenious idea connecting two parts of the world, and said Poland was situated in ""a very strategic place"" for the Belt and Road initiative. The Polish president said of China: ""Today, we can say it is a world power in terms of economy; a dynamically developing country,"" he said. ""It is also a country which is open; open to economic cooperation, growth, and what is especially interesting, open to growing together with their partners,"" Duda added, saying China is a promising partner for Poland, hence why he attaches great importance to his upcoming visit to the country. Regarding possible areas of mutual cooperation, Duda listed transport, infrastructure, mining and hi-tech industries. He also stressed the role of Polish agricultural products could play in trade: ""Polish fruit, yoghurt, and meat conquer Western Europe markets. They are already valued in France and Germany. I am certain that in the nearest future, the Chinese would also inquire about these specific Polish products,"" the President said. For Duda, who previously worked as a lecturer at the University in Krakow, intellectual exchange between Polish and Chinese universities could provide fertile ground for greater cooperation between the two countries, as both had great traditions with regard to knowledge and innovation. He also recalled that the famous Polish composer Chopin, known as Xiaobang in Chinese, was yet another example of how the two countries shared cultural similarities that extended beyond language barriers. After the Central and Eastern European China summit in Suzhou, President Duda is to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, something Duda said was a very important part in establishing and intensifying mutual cooperation. The president then turned to the approaching climate conference COP21 to be held in Paris in December. He said reducing greenhouse gas emissions needed to be encouraged, because it was important for everyone. To that end, Duda noted that Poland had already achieved great success, as the country had managed to reduce CO2 emissions by 30 percent in the last dozens of years. However, the Polish position on the impending Paris conference was much more complex and difficult insofar as the country's industry was mainly based on coal, which makes up 90 percent of Europe's coal deposits, he said. ""Due to that fact,"" Duda said, ""the requirement to completely turn away from coal, decarbonization in its broadest sense, is de facto contrary to Polish strategic interests."" But the president said he was not opposed to increasing investment in new, environmentally sustainable technologies, ""which limit emissions, which are pro-environment, but simultaneously make better use of the fuel, the energy resource we have, which is coal."" To conclude, Duda shifted to the recent terrorists attacks in Paris and the issue of threats to security, saying it was important to act unanimously to put an end to the conflict in Syria and reduce causes of migration flow. \l"

[Photo/Xinhua]As we undergo the fourth industrial revolution, companies are uniquely positioned to partner with governments to address some of the world's greatest challenges. Urbanization continues to spread globally, with 70 percent of the world's population expected to live in cities by 2030. This trend brings with it the urgent need for more efficient use of energy, cleaner energy generation and effective energy storage. While the public-sector must lead, it should work closely with the private-sector to rapidly implement best policies, programs and projects that will improve urban efficiency and sustainability.Buildings are responsible for up to one-third of greenhouse gas emissions globally. The most cost-effective time to reduce energy consumption in buildings is before construction where integrated designs and off-the-shelf building technologies can yield up to a 50 percent reduction in energy use and positive returns on investments. For existing buildings, energy efficiency retrofits using these same principles can deliver 15 to 40 percent savings that pay for themselves over time through energy cost savings.Best practices for improving building energy efficiency in cities include: adopting and enforcing building codes and appliance standards, setting reduction targets and adopting sustainable construction and leasing policies, establishing retrofit programs for public and private-sector buildings, introducing certification, benchmarking and transparency programs, accepting innovative financial models and programs and coordinating efforts with local utilities. While the results are promising, very few cities globally have implemented a comprehensive set of these elements.While buildings represent a great opportunity to improve demand-side urban efficiency, district energy systems are seeing a resurgence of interest in urban sustainability on the supply-side. Modern district energy systems provide centralized heating and cooling to urban areas with efficiency gains of up to 80 to 90 percent on conventional solutions.Paris initially developed a district heating system in 1927 to reduce air pollution from burning coal. Today, renewable energy provides over 50 percent of co-generated heat to the equivalent of 500,000 households. Paris also developed Europe's first and largest district cooling system using water from River Seine while improving energy efficiency by 35 percent.In Dubai, air conditioning represents 70 percent of electricity consumption. The city is developing the world's largest district cooling network which will cut this electricity use in half while also reducing its consumption of fresh water through the use of treated sewage effluent. In China, the city of Anshan is integrating isolated boilers into their district heating network and capturing waste heat resulting in a 1.2 million ton reduction in annual coal use.Driven by aggressive State of California goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, Stanford University has developed and implemented an innovative strategy to reduce building energy use. The new energy system provides 90 percent of campus heating needs from heat recovery chillers and reduces water consumption by 15 percent. The design includes chilled and hot water storage systems managed by sophisticated predictive control algorithms that forecast weather conditions, campus energy requirements and energy costs 10 days in advance.Increasing urban efficiency must be a priority for leaders at all levels as we collectively strive to promote the quality of life for city residents and address the great challenges of global climate change, energy security and economic development. A number of global partnerships are helping build capability and capacity through increased collaboration between the public and private sectors. With a record numbers of cities, businesses and institutions making ambitious commitments at the Paris talks, now is the time to leverage the experience, resources and solutions of the private-sector combined with the leadership of local governments to accelerate action toward urban efficiency and sustainability.The author is chairman, president and CEO of Johnson Controls.

But disagreements over the South China Sea issue and the deploymentof a missile system on the Korean Peninsula still shadow Sino-US ties, they said.Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his US counterpart Barack Obama on Thursday. The two sides agreed to step upcooperation in nuclear security beyond the Nuclear Security Summit. They also agreed to do more on cyber security, andcontinue to work on a bilateral investment treaty, Zheng Zeguang, China's vice foreign minister, told a news briefing.Xi stressed the two countries' developing relations, including ""effective coordination and cooperation"" on climatechange, the Iran nuclear issue, peacekeeping, development and healthcare.Trade, mutual investments and personnel exchanges between the two countries have reached record highs, Xi said.The two countries on Thursday released a joint statement on nuclear security, declaring their commitment to ""workingtogether to foster a peaceful and stable international environment by reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism andstriving for a more inclusive, coordinated, sustainable and robust global nuclear security architecture.""China and the US will enhance cooperation to better control nuclear materials, fight nuclear smuggling and traininternational personnel in nuclear security, the statement said.The two countries also released a joint presidential statement on climate change on Thursday, vowing to sign the ParisAgreement on April 22, months after the historic pact on climate change was adopted last December during the 21stsession of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) in France.Disputes remainZheng said talks between Xi and Obama were ""constructive,"" but the two sides remained far apart over the South ChinaSea and US missile plans for South Korea.Zheng said Xi told Obama that China was ""firmly opposed"" to US plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense,or THAAD, missile defense system in South Korea after North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January and a rocket launchin space in February, Reuters reported.""Such deployment will undermine China's security interests and will affect the region's strategic balance,"" Zheng said.Xi stressed that China insists on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and that all sides should fully and strictly complywith the UN Security Council's resolution on North Korea, and avoid speeches or actions that can intensify tensions. Healso warned against ""any moves that could harm other countries' security interests or regional strategic balance,""according to the Xinhua News Agency.Ni Feng, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said he hadexpected that the North Korea issue may be an area China and the US could reach some agreement, as the two countrieshave worked together on the latest UN sanctions against North Korea.""However, there is no sign that the two sides have gotten closer in reaching any agreement, such as delaying thedeployment of the THAAD system,"" Ni told the Global Times on Friday.The US has been discussing the possible deployment of THAAD in South Korea since last month.US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC thatnegotiations on THAAD are necessary to counter North Korean threats, Yonhap reported.South China SeaOn the South China Sea territorial disputes, Xi also criticized ""acts that harm China's sovereignty and security underthe guise of freedom of navigation,"" and urged the US to keep its word that it will not take sides on the territorialdisputes in the area.Shi Yinhong, director of the Center for American Studies at the Renmin University of China, said the leaders' meeting ata low point in Sino-US ties certainly sent positive signals and will prevent the relations from worsening.However, the prospect of a rapid recovery in the two countries' relations is unlikely because of their entangledinterests, Shi told the Global Times.""Whether the two countries have achieved a subtle understanding and can gradually ease their tensions on the SouthChina Sea issue remain to be tested in the following months after Xi and Obama's meeting,"" Shi said.

"COP21","China","COP21_China375","Commentary: Climate talks deliver breakthrough as historic deal adopted","December 12, 2015 Saturday 7:02 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","After years of tough negotiations, a long-anticipated legally binding agreement on the global fight against climate change was finally adopted Saturday in Paris with no objection. The historic agreement that seeks to rein in climate change and ease its impacts was reached at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) by the 196 Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ambitious deal, a result of strong aspiration and persistent efforts of all parties involved, marked a milestone step towards the common goal that would safeguard sustainable development for mankind. The road leading to the historically significant document is fraught with barriers and challenges, and a breakthrough along the way has been realized only when parties jointly pledged unremitting endeavors towards a common goal, bearing the bigger picture in mind and accommodating concerns of others. During the talks, China maintained close communication and worked closely with other parties concerned, playing a positive and constructive role in achieving success of the conference. In the process of negotiations, China repeatedly urged all parties concerned to show flexibility, narrow differences and build consensus for a final deal. Expounding on China's efforts in countering climate change, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Friday the country is confident and determined to meet its promises of cutting its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of the GDP by 60-65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030. During a telephone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the two sides to strengthen coordination and work together with all parties to ensure that the Paris climate conference would reach an agreement as scheduled, which is in the interest of the international community. Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Giovanni La Via said in an interview with Xinhua that China played a key role of a responsible partner during the climate conference negotiations in Paris. Commending China's efforts in proposing the ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), he said China would pave the path for others in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) over the next 10 years, ""thanks to its economic model and investment in green technologies."" With great resolution and tangible actions, China has been emerging as a staunch supporter, active contributor and constructive player over the years in the global climate campaign, providing wisdom and inspiration to the conclusion of the global climate agreement. In September, the Chinese government announced the establishment of an independent South-South cooperation fund of 20 billion yuan (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) to help the developing countries affected by global warming. At the opening ceremony of the Paris climate summit, Xi said China would adopt new policy measures to improve the industrial mix, build a low-carbon system, develop green building and low-carbon transportation and establish a nationwide carbon-emission trading market. While showing China's resolve to address the challenge, Xi's speech also displayed the wisdom of reaching an agreement with the ""win-win"" mentality. The president's proposal of rejecting the narrow-minded ""zero sum game"" mentality and creating a future of win-win cooperation with each country making contribution to the best of its ability also led to the eventual adoption of the historic agreement. The unanimous adoption of the deal is just one significant step in the right direction, whether or not the aim of holding global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels could be achieved lies in the implementation of the agreement. It is imperative now for all parties involved to lose no time in working out the plenty of details of the agreement and displaying the utmost sincerity by translating commitments into tangible actions. \l"
"COP21","China","COP21_China376","Radical change","October 30, 2015 Friday","Global Times (China)","Over the years, doubts against climate change have incrementally resulted in more public awareness of global environmental concerns as well as vigorous debates about how to save our planet.The 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21) is one such platform that has hosted dialogues about climate change. Prior to attending this year's summit, Professor Gilles Boeuf, an internationally renowned expert on oceans and biodiversity with the Universit\'e9 Pierre et Marie Curie in France, gave a passionate presentation in Shanghai recently.As mankind exerts even more increasing influence on the ecosystem, Boeuf believes that the ensuing repercussion of industrialization and technology is, inevitably, the extinction of our species. ""Has Earth's sixth mass extinction already arrived?"" Professor Boeuf asked the audience at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, perhaps not rhetorically.Biodiversity, he said, is not a human-centered concept, but we humans are part of biodiversity. Its economical value is enormous, accounting for 40 percent of revenue from all economical systems; approximately 50 percent of the active molecules used in pharmacology are extracted or synthesized from natural components; biomimicry and bioinspiration take inspiration from nature and solve human engineering problems, which has considerably changed human lives for the better.However, the professor warned, security risks and hot spots caused by climate change are threatening biodiversity in the form of degradation of freshwater resources, an increase in storms and flood catastrophes and a decrease in food production and migration.Following his lecture in Shanghai, the Global Times sat down with Professor Boeuf, a knight of the French National Order of Merit and the national adviser on biodiversity for the French government, to discuss the issues of global warming and biodiversity and how we as residents of the world can act to reduce this tragic phenomenon.GT: What can we do to preserve biodiversity?Boeuf: If we want to continue to live on this planet, we need to respect ecology. We cannot live without biodiversity. We have to change our behaviors to maintain it. I think the solution is to participate much more than we do now. For example, don't waste water, stop overfishing, stop deforestation and stop pollution. The only thing that is impossible to change is climate change. It is too late! We should have begun earlier.GT: Why is the Paris Climate Conference so important, given that the Copenhagen conference of 2009 was considered a total failure? What has changed in the past six years? Do you think Paris will be a turning point in the fight against global warming? Boeuf: In Copenhagen, we were less sure that human activity was causing climate change. Today we have absolutely no doubt. The mentality is also changing in politicians. In Paris, we will receive 196 countries - every country on the planet. These countries say that, yes, we want to change. In Copenhagen, nobody was talking about biodiversity or oceans. A lot of ecosystem changes are occurring in oceans today. I'm positive some deal will be reached in December.GT: We already know what the biggest emitters have committed to. The EU will cut its emissions by 40 percent, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. The US will cut its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. China will agree that its emissions will peak by 2030. Do you think these efforts are enough to avoid the threshold beyond which global warming becomes catastrophic and irreversible?Boeuf: From the moment they decided to reduce their emissions, it was a good thing. If we want to continue mitigating climate change, though, we have to use less and less petroleum and coal. We also must help underdeveloped countries. We promised them, 10 years ago, $100 billion; they are still waiting for that money, to help them change their energy consumption modes, from coal into wind, solar energy to bio technologies. We have to change radically - and quickly!Global TimesProfessor Gilles Boeuf, who was in Shanghai for a lecture on climate change and biodiversity. Photo: GT\l"

[Photo/Agencies]After two weeks, huge amounts of political rhetoric, and much activity behind closed doors at the Paris climate change conference, we have a treaty. While there will be celebrations among activists, the Paris Treaty will do very little to rein in temperature reductions.The Paris Treaty promises to keep temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius. However, the actual promises made here will do almost nothing to achieve that.The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimates that if every country makes every single promised Paris Treaty carbon cut between 2016 and 2030 to the fullest extent possible and there is no carbon leakage, CO2 emissions will be cut by 56 billion gross tons by 2030. The math is simple: in an implausibly optimistic best-case scenario, Paris leaves 99 percent of the problem in place.To say that the Paris Treaty will get us to 2 C is cynical posturing at best. It relies on wishful thinking. It's like going on a diet to slim down, but declaring victory after the first salad. Paris will be extraordinarily costly. It is likely this is the most expensive treaty in the history of the world.Using the best individual and collectively peer-reviewed economic models, the total cost of the Paris Treaty\u-243 through slower GDP growth from higher energy costs\u-243 will reach $1 trillion to $2 trillion every year from 2030.We owe the world much more\u-243 both in terms of tackling climate change better, and in spending resources smarter.The best thing to come out of Paris was the announcement of the Bill Gates-led green energy innovation fund together with private individuals and governments, including those of Australia, the United States, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. This is an excellent initiative. I have argued for greater spending on research and development for a decade. Even more funding is needed, and the Gates-led fund is what is really going to make a difference to the climate.Until there is a breakthrough that makes green energy competitive on its own merits, massive carbon cuts are extremely unlikely to happen. Claims that carbon cuts will be free or even generate economic growth don't stack up given today's technology. Every economic model shows real costs. If not, we wouldn't need the Paris Treaty: every nation would stampede to voluntarily cut CO2 and get rich.The agreement to spend $100 billion on climate aid is a poor way to help the developing world. Their citizens clearly say, this is their lowest policy priority and climate aid provided by handing out solar panels has meager benefits compared with the many better, cheaper ways to help, like investing in immunization, girls' education and family planning. While billions of people lack food, healthcare, water and education, distributing solar panels is simply immoral.The Gates innovation push is great news and the only way we can start tackling the 99 percent of the climate problem not addressed by Paris. After Paris, I will be advocating for an even greater investment in green energy research and development. Funding in the region of $100 billion annually is what is needed.The author is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and visiting professor at Copenhagen Business School.

Our statement has injected positive energy to the multilateral process of addressing climate change,"" Xi told a press briefing after the talks. \~ \~China has made multiple climate pledges. These include a decision to launch a national carbon cap-and-trade system in 2017 to help contain emissions, establishing a 20-billion-yuan (3.1-billion-U.S.-dollar) fund to help other developing countries combat and adapt to climate change, and cutting carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030. \~ \~""The French president's China trip is part of his climate change diplomacy which aims to regain Europe's leading role in addressing climate change after the unprosperous Copenhagen conference,"" said Cui Hongjian, a specialist in China-Europe relations at the China Institute of International Studies. \~ \~During their talks, Hollande told Xi he is visiting China hoping to further the all-round strategic partnership with China. \~ \~The two countries share similar views on many global affairs, and maintain political trust and dialogue, he said. \~ \~Xi proposed both countries boost major cooperation projects in nuclear power and aeroplane manufacturing, increase cultural exchanges and jointly promote the building of new international relations. \~ \~The Chinese president welcomed France to participate in the Belt and Road initiative. \~ \~The two presidents witnessed the signing of 17 cooperation documents later on Monday, ranging from trade, finance, energy to environmental protection and cultural exchange.\~ \~ \~Hollande's visit came days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to China and Xi's Britain trip from Oct. 19-23. \~ \~""The intensive China-Europe interactions show how important the Chinese market is to Europe in terms of trade and economy,"" said Chen Xin, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \~ \~While stepping up trade ties with China, European leaders hope to explore China's development blueprint amid the country's economic slowdown, Chen said. \~ \~China also needs Europe's support in fields such as the RMB's inclusion in the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights basket, he added. \~ \~Hollande will also meet with other top Chinese leaders before wrapping up his two-day China trip on Tuesday. \~\l"

The Paris Agreement runs to 32 pages with 29 articles, including objective, mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. On the basis of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, the Paris Agreement aims to hold the global average temperature rise to below 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and strives to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries, the parties agreed to work to define a clear roadmap on ratcheting up climate finance to 100 billion U.S. dollars by 2020 while also setting a new goal before 2025 on the provision of finance from the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar floor. ""We have seen unparalleled announcements of financial support for both mitigation and adaptation from a multitude of sources both before and during the COP. Under the Paris Agreement, the provision of finance from multiple sources will clearly be taken to a new level, which is of critical importance to the most vulnerable,"" said UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres. Unlike the top-down approach of the Kyoto Protocol, which is a compulsory order to developed countries to cut emissions, the new Paris Agreement, the second legally binding document under the UNFCCC, adopts a bottom-up approach. More than 180 countries, which contribute to 95 percent of the total world carbon emissions, have submitted their own intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). Under the Paris Agreement, every country should participate in the global actions to tackle climate change issues with their own INDCs. From the year 2023, all parties are required to assess their progress in implementing their INDCs. This will allow each nation to reinforce international cooperation as a means to ensure the long-term goal of addressing climate change are met. China's Special Representative on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua called on developed countries to abide by their promises to provide finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building to developing countries. Xie stressed that China, as a responsible developing country, would take international obligations commensurate with its own national condition, development stage and actual capacity. ""China is willing to work together with all parties, in accordance with the principles of the UNFCCC, toward implementing the Paris Agreement and establishing a global climate governance system for win-win cooperation,"" Xie affirmed. At the opening ceremony of the Paris climate summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would adopt new policy measures to improve the industrial mix, build a low-carbon system, develop green building and low-carbon transportation, and establish a nationwide carbon-emission trading market. While showing China's resolve to address the challenge, Xi's speech also displayed the wisdom of reaching an agreement with the ""win-win"" mentality. During a phone conversation with his French counterpart Francois Hollande on Monday, President Xi Jinping said China and France should work with all parties to effectively carry out the newly-adopted, historic climate accord. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the adoption of the agreement: ""What was once unthinkable is now unstoppable,"" saying it demonstrated solidarity. ""For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience, and join in a common cause to take climate action,"" Ban said. ""You have concluded not just any agreement. It is an ambitious, universal and legally-binding agreement,"" Hollande told the ministers and negotiators from the 196 parties of the UNFCCC. ""We had been waiting for this agreement a long time, for 40 years,"" Hollande said. There is no doubt that the Paris conference was a success. Not only was an historic agreement on climate change adopted, but it shows global interests and national interests are bound together, and the climate change issue requires global cooperation. \l"

They ruined my life, the father of two said.He and his wife had invested a million euros (US$1.1 million dollars) in 2007 in a solar energy farm in the northeastern region of Castile and Leon.They borrowed 800,000 euros from a bank with Puebla\' s parents acting as the loan guarantors.Solar investors like Puebla were lured by a law passed under the Socialist government in power in 2007. It guaranteed producers a so-called solar tariff of as much as 44 cents per kilowatt-hour for their electricity for 25 years.At that rate the couple thought they could easily make their monthly loan repayments of 8,400 euros.But the government did not keep its promise. Faced with a ballooning budget deficit, in 2011 it cut the subsidies that were intended to stimulate the growth of the renewable energy.The conservative Popular Party that swept to power at the end of 2011 made further cuts to the state aid. Everything that existed disappeared from one day to the other, said Puebla.He now relies on help from his sister and three brothers to pay his loan.Low energySolar power farms have seen their revenues drop 15-50 percent due to the change in government policy, said Jose Donoso, the head of Spain\' s solar lobby group UNEF.The solar power sector has shed 35,000 jobs since 2008 and now employs just 5,000 people, he added.The government U-turn has been especially hard on the roughly 62,000 private investors like Puebla and it essentially stopped the solar power sector from expanding.Spain added just 22 megawatts of photovoltaics capacity last year, compared with 2,270 megawatts in Britain.Wind power has also stalled. The sector has lost half of its jobs in eight years and no new wind power capacity was added in 2015. The change in regulations since 2008 was negative for the entire industry, said Carlos Garcia, a renewable energy specialist at the IE Business School in Madrid.He points the finger at  pressure from traditional energy producers that rely on coal, gas, oil and nuclear power to  stop the development of renewables.  2015 marks the lowest point in the development of renewables in the past 20 years in Spain, said Spanish Wind Energy Association policy director Heikki Willstedt. Spain must make up for lost time and fulfil its goals for 2020, she added.Willstedt recalled that Spain is committed to meeting 20 percent of its energy needs through renewables by 2020, compared to the current 15 percent.The government which emerges following the general election on December 20 must change Spain\' s renewable energy policies, added Garcia.Spain\' s ruling conservative Popular Party has presented proposals to restart the wind power sector but has not yet outl"

No other two countries coordinate their policies more closely than France and Germany in particular within the European Union.France and Germany are convinced that the world has to gradually engage on the path of deep decarbonization.In December, Paris will host the COP21 Conference, which will define the international framework of action to reconcile everyone's aspiration to prosperity with the natural limits of our planet. Our goal is to build a Paris Alliance for Climate enabling us to limit the planet's average temperature rise to less than 2\'baC above pre-industrial levels.So far 149 countries, among them China, have presented their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). These contributions represent more than 87 percent of world GES emissions.

However, it is clear that to win the battle against climate disruption, we all will have to gradually increase our level of ambition.France and Germany are key players in the quest for solutions to several of the world's most dangerous crises.The situation in Ukraine has brought confrontation with Russia and the very real risk of falling back into patterns of the Cold War. Germany and France are driving the discussions with Ukraine and Russia in the so-called Normandy format. We welcome China's support to find a political solution.The disastrous civil war in Syria and the terrorist onslaught especially by ISIS on Syria and Iraq are a challenge to humankind as a whole. The advance of terrorism in the Middle East with its ensuing instability makes itself felt in Europe and Asia. We share common concerns regarding the deteriorating situation in Syria. With a view to finding a political solution and to addressing the huge humanitarian crisis and its root causes we both encourage China to play an active and positive part.China supports a strong and prosperous European Union, its first trading partner in the world. France and Germany acted in close coordination to find an acceptable outcome to the Greek crisis and to restore confidence in the Euro. For both our countries, the European unification process and the Euro are non-reversible.Looking at the Chinese economy, we are confident that China continues to have enormous potential for growth, which will be unlocked in the coming years if China commits itself vigorously to further opening up and market-oriented reforms, including in the State sector. In this perspective, France and Germany fully support the negotiations towards an ambitious and truly comprehensive Sino-European bilateral agreement on investment.China's success will depend crucially on technological upgrading. Germany and France combined probably are China's most important international partners in its modernization drive. Roughly 200 billion euros ($220 billion) in trade with China in 2014 marked a new record, almost four times as much as China's trade with any other EU country. We are leaders in sectors which are crucial to China's ""Made in China 2025"". Germany has its ""industry 4.0."" and France its ""industry of the future"", covering a wide range of key areas from next generation of transportation to the internet of things. And we do not only trade but build up manufacturing, research and development within China. Airbus for example has moved faster than any competitor to move manufacturing and development to China.A growing number of Chinese are studying French or German and visit our countries, and vice versa. Almost 20,000 young French and German students are studying in China, holding the two top spots amongst EU nationals. This interest of the coming generation underl"
"COP21","China","COP21_China382","China urged to bridge climate divide in Paris China urged to help close climate rift in Paris; As international talks go into final week, Beijing should help ov....","December 7, 2015 Monday","South China Morning Post","As foreign and environmental ministers head into the final stretch to agree on a global climate deal in Paris, some activist groups are urging China to play a more constructive role, saying Beijing could be a game changer in the second, final week of talks. Negotiators adopted a 48-page text on Saturday after the first week of discussions, which ended with clashes over whether more affluent developing countries should give financial aid to less developed ones, and whether to set a lower threshold for a temperature rise, as some island nations have proposed. At the talks, known as COP21, more than 190 nations are tasked with adopting a framework to limit carbon emissions to ensure global temperatures do not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, by 2100. Anything higher is expected to trigger extreme storms and flooding, longer heatwaves, and faster melting of glaciers and the polar ice caps - raising sea levels and plunging millions into poverty. In the coming days, ministers and negotiators are expected to engage in intense talks to eliminate the 939 differences remaining in the text. ""There is still hope for an ambitious deal to be reached, but there is also risk that countries will race to the bottom, which the French presidency has to prevent,"" said Li Shuo, Greenpeace China's climate and energy campaigner.China's chief negotiator, Su Wei, said the text ""is only a basis for negotiation, there are several disagreements that we need to talk to each other about"".In the first week, countries were divided on a number of issues such as whether wealthy developing countries should become potential donors to the Green Climate Fund, supplementing developed nations' obligatory input of financing for more vulnerable countries. Some developing countries are fine with the proposal. Vietnam, for example, announced on Saturday it would contribute US$1 million. Negotiators from India, however, argued such an arrangement would blur the existing separation between developing and developed countries enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. China has won abundant praise since announcing its goal to have carbon emissions peak by 2030. It has also offered to contribute US$3.1 billion to help other developing nations. But Beijing still has the potential ""to block any issues"", according to Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute. ""China could be a real game changer in the upcoming talks. During the first week, China has aligned itself with Saudi Arabia on some issues,"" Morgan said. ""We really hope that China could join the 'high ambition' coalition, and support the vulnerable island countries and least developed African countries.""Saudi Arabia was seen as the biggest blocker in the first week, rejecting calls by small island nations that the rise should be limited to 1.5 degrees. China - the world's biggest carbon emitter - and the United States prefer a target below 2 degrees, which would allow some room for future growth in carbon emissions. Beijing is also reluctant to put such wording as ""decarbonisation"" or ""zero emissions"" into the article on countries' long-term goals for tackling climate change.Saudi Arabia has also been accused of blocking the idea that the commitments countries have put on the table - covering emission cuts between 2020 and 2030 - should be reviewed before then and may be raised. Observers say China does not support reviewing national contributions ahead of 2020, as any increases and the resulting effects on its five-year plan would unsettle government officials. China might also be uncomfortable about procedures to verify its domestic actions in the interests of transparency. We really hope that China could join the 'high ambition' coalition Jennifer Morgan, World Resources Institute\l"

Fran\'e7ois Hollande, President of the RepublicLe Bourget, 30 November 2015Secretary-General of the United Nations, cher Ban Ki-moon,Heads of state and government,Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,Ladies and gentlemen ministers,Global warming/terrorismToday is a historic day. France is hosting 150 heads of state and government, and thousands of delegates from every continent. Never before has a conference received so many authorities from so many countries. And never \- truly never \- have the stakes of an international meeting been so high. For the future of the planet, and the future of life, are at stake.And yet, two weeks ago, here in Paris, a group of fanatics brought death to the streets. I would now like to express the gratitude of the French people for all the gestures of support, all the messages, and all the signs of friendship that we have received since 13 November.These tragic events are terrible, but at the same time they bring us obligations. They mean we have to focus on what is essential. Your presence gives immense hope that we have no right to dash, for the eyes of peoples and billions of human beings are on us.For me, there is no dichotomy between the fight against terrorism and the fight against global warming. They are two great global challenges that we need to address, because we must leave our children more than just a world freed from terror. We owe them a planet protected from disasters, a viable planet.Climate justice/global stabilityThe year we have just experienced beat all records: record temperatures, record CO concentrations, and record numbers of extreme climate events: droughts, floods, cyclones, melting ice, rising sea levels and ocean acidification. The victims of these phenomena are counted in millions and the material damage in billions. No country and no region is safe from the effects of climate disruption.How could we accept that the poorest countries, those that emit the fewest greenhouse gases, those that are the most vulnerable, should once again be worst affected?It is in the name of climate justice that I speak to you today. It is in the name of climate justice that we must take action. We need to take note of the seriousness of the threat to the world's equilibrium. Global warming heralds conflicts just as clouds herald a storm. It causes migration which throws more refugees out onto the roads than warfare itself. Governments may no longer be able to satisfy the vital needs of their citizens with the risks of famine, rural exodus and conflicts to access a good that is increasingly scarce: water.Achievements to dateYes, what is at stake at this Climate Conference is peace. Yet hopes have been raised with the preparation of COP21. In September this year, the international community adopted a comprehensive agenda through the Sustainable Development Goals, which were endorsed during the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on that.A hundred and ninety states \- almost all the world's countries \- have drawn up action plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate disruption. And all global society's stakeholders \- local government, businesses, investors and citizens of all the great world regions \- have also committed to the climate.This increased awareness and this mobilization are bolstered by the lightning progress made in clean and renewable energy sources, which open up the prospect of a carbon-free economy. So to ensure a successful conference, France has given its all, and mobilized its whole government \- starting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development, Laurent Fabius, who will preside over this conference.Conditions for success at COP21I have visited the regions most affected by climate change myself, and come back with the same conviction that we need to ensure sustainable, fair development without compromising our planet's limited resources. That is the equation we need to solve together during this conference.I wanted the heads of state and government of the whole world to be mobilized from the outset of our work, to give this conference momentum and ambition equal to what is at stake. For an agreement needs to be reached in Paris on 12 December. Under what conditions can we consider that it is a good agreement, that it is a great agreement, and that it is an agreement that genuinely corresponds to the expectations of the world's peoples, and in the long term? There are three conditions for us to be able to say that the Paris Climate Conference is or is not a success.Limiting global warmingThe first is that we need to define and mark out a credible path that will enable us to contain global warming below 2\'b0C or even 1.5\'b0C, if possible. For us to be sure that we are on that path, we need to provide for a regular assessment of our progress with regard to the conclusions of scientists and, thus, establish a ""ratcheting-up"" mechanism equal to our commitments, with meetings every five years.FairnessThe second condition is that we bring a mutually-supportive response to the climate challenge. No government should be able to shirk its commitments, even if a differentiation mechanism may take into account national circumstances and levels of development. No territory should be left alone to face climate change, particularly the most vulnerable countries.I have in mind those islands that could, in a short time, quite simply disappear. Here, I want to be their spokesperson, because the planet's very biodiversity \- and diversity \- are at stake. We need to draw conclusions from this: the agreement must be universal, differentiated and binding. The developed countries need to shoulder their historic responsibility, as they are the ones that have emitted the most greenhouse gases over the years.The emerging countries need to speed up their energy transition, and the developing countries need to be supported in their adaptation to climate impacts. This is why financing needs to be provided to facilitate technology transfers. In Copenhagen, we set the target of $100 billion. Today, it is not a target that we need to set, it is resources that we need to identify, with guarantees on their origin and their accessibility.Mobilization of societiesLastly, the third condition for an agreement in Paris is that all our societies, in their great plurality and diversity, need to be mobilized. All local leaders, investors, economic and social stakeholders, citizens and even great consciences and religions, all those who contribute to shaping the global public opinion, have to understand that things have changed. That is the key to addressing the climate challenge.Today, I would like to pay tribute to the pioneers of the ecological cause, to all the precursors who, not so long ago, had to face incredulity and disdain for their warnings and proposals. In a few years, mindsets have changed profoundly. Businesses and financial stakeholders, who yesterday were reluctant, are now prepared to commit and change their behaviour.Do they still need to be sent the necessary signals? That is the challenge of the gradual introduction of carbon pricing, so that greenhouse gas emissions have a cost that corresponds to the damage inflicted upon the planet, and investment decisions are gradually changed so that all technologies can be universally accessible.Heads of state and government, I am going to be frank: to resolve the climate crisis, goodwill and statements of intent are not enough. We are coming to a breaking point. Paris must be the starting point of a profound shift. We can no longer consider nature as a mere bottomless reservoir of resources there for our sole and full benefit.This transformation is both a moral obligation and a global opportunity, for it opens up possibilities for development with renewable energies, clean transport, waste recycling, agro-ecology, preservation of biodiversity, and universal access to all global public goods.Summit challengesThus, when electricity is made accessible to all, particularly in Africa, more than just light will be provided. Knowledge, education and development will be brought. On this first day of the conference, we have a wall to climb. This wall is built of our selfishness, our apprehensions and our resignation. This wall is built of indifference, carelessness and powerlessness. It is not insurmountable. Everything depends on us.Heads of state and government, the hopes of all mankind rest upon your shoulders. I, myself, see in my own role how we need to combine the imperative of urgency \- and everything it brings with it, including tragic events \- and long-term choices. Of course, that balance is not easy to find, far from it. But once again, we have no choice.Our greatest challenge is to move on from a globalization based on competition to a model based on cooperation, where protection will be more viable than destruction. We need to think of our planet as a single space, establishing a pact of fairness between the North and South and a partnership between mankind and nature.That is why we are gathered here, as world leaders. That is why the Paris Climate Conference is an exceptional event. In just a few days, we will decide for several decades. The greatest danger is not that our target is too difficult and that we miss it. The greatest danger is that it is too easy, and that we hit it.So we need to set the bar as high as possible so that we can, at the very least, come close to this ambition, for here, in Paris, it is the planet's very future we are deciding on. Thank you.\l"

On a personal level, seeing the famous Irish traditional band The Chieftains perform in Shanghai 32 years after their first visit to China was incredibly inspiring and a very proud moment for all in the Irish community here. Last October Shanghai hosted the all Asian Gaelic Games, which featured the Irish sports of Gaelic football and hurling. We will showcase Irish culture, including music and dance, during our Irish Week or Feile Shanghai in March around our National Day of March 17. We'll have a multitude of indoor and outdoor events but the biggest cluster will center on our Family Day. We also will celebrate the life and works of Samuel Beckett and James Joyce. We will be working closely with schools and universities on a variety of Irish themes.The quality of life is already high in Shanghai. However, as a pedestrian I'd love to see greater traffic controls at pedestrian crossings and on the pavements, particularly concerning electric bikes, to allow pedestrians to move freely and safely through this great city.Stefano Beltrame the Consul General of ItalyFor Italy, 2015 has been the year of the Milan Expo. Delegations of Shanghai leaders visited Milan during Shanghai Week last June and on other occasions, such as World Cities Day. Shanghai hosted the last Expo in 2010 and it shared its experience with Milan. These two cities have had a twinning agreement since 1979, the oldest for Shanghai.In 2016 we want to insist on the post-Expo cooperation which means that technology, fashion and food will be our main focus. We are preparing with the Jing£n district the launch of a Sino-Italian platform for the promotion of fashion, because Nanjing Road is twinned with Via Montenapoleone.In February we will promote a conference that, during the year of the celebrations of the 500 years of the ghetto of Venice, will present the history of the first (Venice) and last (Shanghai) ghetto. Finally 2016 marks the 10th anniversary of the double degree agreements between, on the one hand, Luiss, Bocconi and Fudan University and, on the other hand, Politecnico and Tongji University. Shanghai is a very well organized and safe city. Certainly air pollution is quite a concern, especially if you have kids.Eduardo E. Martire the Consul General of ArgentinaKhaled Youssef the Consul General of EgyptFrom December 2014 to December 2015 Sino-Egyptian relations have witnessed a record-breaking year on all fronts including the political and economic fields. The two Egyptian presidential visits to China enabled the signing of 30 agreements of cooperation in various fields, including a strategic partnership agreement, and a government-to-government framework agreement that paved the way for unprecedented economic cooperation. As a result, plans are now under way for an official visit by President Xi Jinping to Egypt in January 2016.Our bilateral trade has already exceeded $11 billion and we are expecting it to steadily increase. Our investment relations have been booming since the active Chinese participation in the Egyptian Economic Conference in Sharm El Sheik.We are currently in the process of signing a friendly cooperation memorandum between the Shanghai Museum and the Egyptian Museum.Looking ahead at 2016, Egypt and China will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations by holding a series of cultural events. Moreover, plans are underway for signing a new sistership agreement between Shanghai and Cairo.Luc Decker the Consul General of Luxembourg2015 was special to my country as we held the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union for the second half of the year. In Shanghai, I chaired the meetings with the 24 consuls general of EU member states present here and represented the EU on some occasions. Regarding the Luxembourg-Shanghai relations specifically, the grand opening of the EU headquarters of the Shanghai-based Bank of Communications in May in Luxembourg was certainly the highlight.The Year of the Monkey will be a year under the sign of business for Shanghai-Luxembourg relations. Indeed, HRH the Crown Prince of the Grand-Duchy and our Vice Prime Minister will lead a large business delegation to Shanghai in April and our Minister of Finance will lead a delegation from the financial sector to Shanghai in November.But Luxembourg should not be a bridge between China and Europe only for business - the China Table Tennis College is setting up its European presence in Luxembourg and CTTC-Europe should be officially set-up in 2016.I hope that the efforts of the Shanghai Municipality and surrounding provincial governments to tackle air pollution will continue.Arturo Puente Ortega the Consul General of MexicoPeter Rothen the Consul General of GermanyI will remember 2015 for a number of reasons. Let me start at the end of 2015: the COP21 conference in Paris. Its historic outcome of the COP21 conference in Paris makes 2015 the year when the entire international community has accepted the need to limit global warming and it has undertaken to act jointly. For us in Shanghai, a major event in 2015 was the World Congress for German Language and Literature Studies, which took place in August and during which more than 1,200 scholars from all over the world assembled at Tongji University. My highlight was, of course, Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent visit to China, together with Premier Li Keqiang in Hefei in Anhui Province.During that visit, Germany and China decided inter alia that 2016 is going to be the Sino-German Year of Youth and Student Exchange, stressing the high density of cooperation in this field which shall be further deepened. In the same spirit of continuing the very close German-Chinese cooperation in many areas, the new year will start right away in mid-January with a high-ranking visitor: the Federal Minister for Education and Research, Johanna Wanka, will come to Shanghai and visit Shanghai Jiao Tong and Tongji universities.Jan Wahlberg the Consul General of Finland2015 was an important year for Finland and China. We celebrated the 65th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, culminating in China being the main theme of the Helsinki Festival last summer. Over 800 performers from China participated. Here in Shanghai we commemorated the 150 years of the birth of the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius with concerts and events. We also organized the third edition of the Nordic Design and Innovation Week. The Speaker of the Finnish Parliament visited China and participated in the first Sino-Nordic Young Champions Forum in Yiwu. The Minister of the Economy inaugurated the Finnish elevator company KONE's testing tower - which is the highest in the world - in Kunshan. Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta Region are the biggest conglomeration of Finnish companies - about 200 - outside of Europe. We have lots of events in the pipel"
"COP21","China","COP21_China386","Milestone year for China's diplomacy","January 4, 2016 Monday","China Daily","China's active participation on the world stage is the key to fulfilling the world's increasing demand for quality public goods.Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech for the opening day of the World Climate Change Conference 2015 () at Le Bourget, near Paris, France, November 30, 2015.[Photo/Xinhua]China's major diplomatic events in 2015, which started with the first ministerial meeting of the Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in January and ended with the China-Africa Cooperation Forum in December, were milestones in its efforts to shoulder more international responsibilities as the world's second-largest economy and largest developing country.With greater focus on strategic planning and efforts to bridge the gap between developed and developing economies, China helped reach a historical deal at the UN climate change conference in Paris in December. The Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was officially launched on December 25, 2015, six months after the article of agreement was signed by 57 founding members, was China's major attempt to reform global financial governance.Confronted with the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which 12 countries recently agreed to, as well as Washington's increasingly aggressive interventions in the South China Sea issue, Beijing has responded calmly but firmly, without losing its ground and relinquishing its legitimate interests.To pursue the Chinese Dream, China aims to create a global community with shared destiny. In this context, its attempts last year to reform international relations bore some results. As President Xi Jinping said during his September visit to the US and at the UN Headquarters in New York, China is more than willing to help inject win-win cooperation into the ""new model of major-power relationship"" with the United States and international relations.Proactive leadership diplomacy was another highlight of China's strategic role in international relations. The establishment of the AIIB, for example, would not have been so successful without the participation of major European economies like the United Kingdom, which top Chinese leaders visited several times over the past year to convince their counterparts of its mutually beneficial nature.Xi dedicated almost one-third of his time to the country's diplomatic events last year, including 42 days on foreign visits. Premier Li Keqiang, too, has been tactically efficient in seeking transnational cooperation in the fields of nuclear power and telecommunications, bringing home a host of key business deals, and tapping into overseas markets.Beijing's efforts, of course, have borne fruits in many areas. With its diplomatic network expanding, Beijing has established comprehensive strategic partnerships with 67 countries and five international organizations, and a Global Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century with the UK, which many say could be the beginning of a ""golden era"" of bilateral relations.The embedded demonstrative effects are also evident in the Belt and Road Initiative, which at least 60 countries and international organizations have supported. Moreover, China has inked a memorandum of cooperation on production capacity with more than 20 economies, injecting fresh momentum into its neighborhood diplomacy.The international community has come to value China's global contributions to poverty alleviation, world economy and UN peacekeeping missions, along with its philosophy of development.Since the 2008 global financial crisis China's average contribution to global economic growth has been 30 percent or more, almost twice as much as the US'. And China's pragmatic participation in the Development Centre of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in July and the annual G20 summit in Turkey in November helped promote its social governance and diplomatic ideas worldwide.China's active participation on the world stage is the key to fulfilling the world's increasing demand for quality public goods, which also explains the success of the AIIB and the Belt and Road Initiative, namely the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. In particular, that Europe now plays a bigger part in China's foreign policy - as its newly acquired membership of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development indicates - is a source of hope for the country's future success in diplomacy.The author is a professor of international relations, Renmin University of China.

"COP21","China","COP21_China388","Climate justice important part of Sino-Indian agenda in Paris conference","November 11, 2015 Wednesday","Global Times (China)","Illustration: Liu Rui/GTAll countries have now submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions on carbon emission cuts to the UN. The run-up since then to the Paris Climate Change Conference, known as COP21, starting November 30, has already triggered hyperactive parleys and the exchange of consensus-building ideas and initiatives across world capitals. The Big Four of China, the US, India and the EU especially needs fine-tuning.Given that the entire blame for failure of the high-profile COP15 at Copenhagen was dumped by the West on China and India which had shown, for the first time, the audacity to withstand conventional G7 top-down approach, the imagined gulf between ""Chindia"" and the G7 had since widened as none of the subsequent summits produced any post-Kyoto Protocol mechanism. China and India have also taken substantive steps to shed their traditional preoccupation with per capita and cumulative emissions. Both have increasingly projected themselves as responsible stakeholders willing to partner with advanced nations in addressing the climate change crisis. Together they have achieved a consensus on common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) which has become the basis for ongoing deliberations.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has now sought to expand the CBDR norm further and introduced the new language of ""climate justice"" which is presented as the cardinal principle of ""differentiated"" responsibility. Climate justice arguments focus not just on mitigation alone. It imagines transforming life-styles and societal interventions to create opportunities for everybody, creating conditions where the least developed countries can also hope to develop. Proponents of climate justice like Teresa Thorp, Henry Shue, Patrick Bond, Brian Tokar, and Ian Angus have been warning that the time for smooth, gradual transition has passed. Without immediate decarbonization of economies, requiring not just state but societal action, livable futures are simply not conceivable. They find the current approach very limited and rather simplistic. The contention of the US and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that ""climate first, justice later"" is the only effective strategy misses the point that mitigation and adaptation strategies can not be separated.Notion of ""equity"" in climate justice shows how differences in per capita carbon emissions of India and the US, respectively standing at 1.7 and 17 tons per year, cannot be viewed simply in terms of their being the second and third largest carbon emitting economies. Even with three decades of unprecedented manufacturing-driven development, China's per capita carbon emissions have barely reached that of the EU countries. Nevertheless, China has offered to adopt the cap-and-trade system from 2017 which mandates that companies exceeding the prescribed limit on emissions buy carbon credits from firms whose emissions are lower than the prescribed limit. China and India have also been focused on carbon balance through reforestation, innovation and consumption efficiency.While both China and India have expressed deeper commitments to emission cuts, both have also been pressing the need to link emission cuts by developing nations to the promised free and easy access to global finance capita, transfer of technologies and expertise outreach, which has not found favor with G7 business lobbies. China's track record of having already achieved at about 30 percent cuts in its emissions compared to its 2005 levels brings it enormous moral authority to lead its partnership with India and other G7 nations. Together they can push for new and nuanced formulations to achieve an outcome at Paris that involves pragmatic and sustainable commitments by all.China and India have been working to promote joint strategies. During Modi's visit to Beijing in May this year, the two signed an unprecedented joint statement on climate change proposing a joint front of a kind. Recalling their 2009 Agreement on Cooperation on Addressing Climate Change and the 2010 MoU for Cooperation on Green Technologies, their joint statement had underl"

It is for this reason that a forest restoration program under way near Kumasi, Ghana's second largest commercial city, some 270 km north of the capital, assumes crucial importance to provide vital environmental services. During the COP 21 in Paris, France, an ambitious initiative christened the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative was launched to restore 100 million hectares of forests across Africa by 2030. This initiative builds on the new Sustainable Development Agenda, particularly SDG 15, and supports the New York Declaration on Forests, which aims to end natural forest loss globally by 2030, and to restore 350 million hectares of the world's deforested and degraded lands over the period. In Ghana each day never passes without more forests being cleared, driven by multiple activities, from agriculture, infrastructure development to the growing demand for wood and forest products, often made worse by illegal logging. Xinhua reporters visited the teak plantation forestry by FORM GHANA, a forest management and services company in Ghana. Here, the plantation is bringing back new forests on a vast expanse of land, both for domestic and international consumption. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan during the recent Forest for the Futures conference in Accra, urged an integrated approach for the restoration of forests. According to him, forest protection has to go hand-in-hand with forest restoration and reforestation in Africa which has the largest restoration opportunity of any continent in the world - an area nearly the size of Australia. Paul Hol, founder of FORM International, said the cost of deforestation for the world was enormous and so must be reversed through conscious efforts by the whole world. He told Xinhua that forests and new forests and replanting degraded lands in Africa was fundamental for Climate Change mitigation, adding that it was the biggest and most cost-effective impact to mitigate climate change. FORM Ghana has 20,000 hectares-land allocated in Ghana, with 10,000 already cultivated with mostly teak trees and other local varieties. The company is harvesting its first batch of wood products from the plantation which started in 2001. Hol said there was a tremendous need in Ghana and in Africa for fuel woods for timber, adding that 80 percent of the deforestation in Africa was mainly because people needed fuel woods. ""And what we try to do here is bringing back new forests which can provide the energy, the fuel, the timber for the local market; for the export market; and in that way we grow new forests."" \l"

""I am going to take this opportunity to speak loudly that leaders on national level must take the responsibility to reach a global climate agreement,"" the Copenhagen mayor told Xinhua in an exclusive interview ahead of his trip to Paris on Dec. 3 for the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, or COP21. Copenhagen is considered one of the most livable cities in the world.

Jensen recalled that when he was young, Copenhagen was heated with petrol in winter. Now energy-efficient district heating systems are widely used in Copenhagen as well as across Denmark. Copenhagen launched its carbon neutrality scheme in 2009, aiming to become the world's first complete carbon neutral city by 2025.

We have allowed it to gather strength for much too long. It is already spreading terror across the world, especially among the poor who have contributed the least or nothing to its strength.Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech for the opening day of the World Climate Change Conference 2015 () at Le Bourget, near Paris, France, November 30, 2015.[Photo/Xinhua]Paris started the year on a tragic note. The terrorist attack on the office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan 7 killed 12 people and injured 11. Ten months later, Paris suffered the worst terrorist attack Europe has seen since the 2004 Madrid bombings; the coordinated attacks on Nov 13 claimed at least 129 innocent lives and left more than 350 injured.Less than three weeks after the deadly attacks, Paris hosted what many see as a breakthrough UN climate change conference. Many want Paris to end the year on a positive note. If it does, that would be a fitting reply, in true French tradition, to the menace that is terrorism. After all, French President Francois Hollande paid homage to the Nov 13 victims on Friday saying that instead of being cowed by acts of terrorists, France would ""sing even more ... They (the terrorists) cultivate death, but we have love for life"".The love for life, however, requires some sacrifices, the sacrifice of wealth and power, and most of all of greed. World leaders know full well what needs to be done to save our planet. They know natural disasters are wreaking havoc across the world, and we humans are mostly responsible for them. They know that this year could be the warmest in recorded history.The UN weather body, in fact, declared last month that the global temperature this year is set to rise 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or halfway toward the targeted UN ceiling of 2 C. If this indeed is the case, voluntary carbon-reducing pledges submitted by countries, even if totally adhered to, will raise global temperatures by 2.75 C to 3.5 C, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres has said.Despite this, world leaders know that if they take action now they could still save the planet from doom. Even climate skeptics accept that greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced, although some of them suggest the use of advanced technology to do so, instead of reducing the use of fossil fuel and restricting economic growth to the optimum, as opposed to the maximum.But the world's obsession with growth will not allow that. The global consensus (excluding the opinions of some climate skeptics who seem to be advocates of big business) is that we have to restrict the rise of global temperatures below 2 C, or else our planet could spiral out of control. That goal already seems beyond reach thanks to the world's greed for profit.And it is this greed that in more ways than one has fuelled terrorism. If religious terrorists have misread the sermons of prophets to become desperate to secure their afterlife by trying to force their way of life on others, the wealthy and the powerful are obsessed with securing their future by making more money and shaping the world according to their beliefs. Both are harmful for the planet.Sunday was the biggest climate action day in history, marked by processions and protests across the world, including in Paris. The more than 130 heads of state and government who have gathered in Paris know the difference between the demands of an overwhelming majority of the global population and the minority that includes the rich, climate skeptics and terrorists. The world leaders have gathered in Paris with the promise of fighting climate change, as well as to express solidarity with France in the fight against terrorism. But they also know terrorism has become the biggest immediate threat to humankind because its root causes were not addressed in time.Climate change is no different from terrorism. We have allowed it to gather strength for much too long. It is already spreading terror across the world, especially among the poor who have contributed the least or nothing to its strength. In every way, climate change is more devastating than the Islamic State group for humankind. Whether or not Paris will see the world rise as one against climate change, as it has against the IS group, will depend on the world leaders.The author is a senior editor with China Daily.

[Photo/Agencies]The latest cyclical warming of Pacific Ocean waters, first observed centuries ago and formally tracked since 1950, began earlier this year and has already been felt across Asia, Africa and Latin America.Weather experts predict this El Nino will continue into the spring of 2016 and could wreak havoc, because climate change is likely to exacerbate the intensity of storms and flooding in some places and of severe drought and water shortages in others. El Nino's impacts are global, with heavy rain and severe flooding expected in South America and scorching weather and drought conditions likely in the Horn of Africa region.The risk is especially great for East Asia-Pacific countries that are highly vulnerable to altered weather patterns because of climate change. This year will likely be the hottest ever recorded, increasing the El Nino effect caused by weakened trade winds that fail to push warmer Pacific Ocean waters to the west.We know what the potential effects might be. In 1997 and 1998, the strongest El Nino on record led to the deaths of 23,000 people from natural disasters, increased poverty rates by 15 percent in some countries and cost governments up to $45 billion owing to severe storms, droughts and other effects.Such a global challenge calls for a global response - with coordinated efforts by governments, international institutions such as the World Bank, relief agencies and communities - to minimize the death and destruction from natural catastrophes while building more resilient societies.The good news is that we have learned from the past how to better predict, prepare and respond. We now know that disaster risk management and early warning systems can provide forecasts and data that reduce death tolls and economic losses from severe weather.These achievements show that building resilient and adaptable societies is the most effective strategy to meet challenges such as El Nino. But instead of limiting our approach to the specific challenge of El Nino, we should continue to support investments in sustainable growth and building resilience to the changing climate.In its recent East Asia-Pacific Economic Update, the World Bank Group warned that failing to anticipate El Nino's impacts could have serious economic development repercussions for the region. Food shortages, wildfires and depleted water resources are likely in some areas, and torrential rains in other areas can cause flooding and human migration.An El Nino typically leads to higher demand for polluting energy sources like coal and crude oil, because hydropower generation decl"

"COP21","China","COP21_China396","Roundup: More than 600,000 people have died due to weather-related disasters over two decades","November 23, 2015 Monday 6:47 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","A new UN-backed report found that in the past 20 years, more than 600,000 people have died as a result of weather-related disasters, and 90 percent of major disasters have been caused by nearly 6,500 recorded floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other weather-related events. The five countries hit by the highest number of disasters are the United States, China, India, the Philippines and Indonesia, said the report issued by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). The report found that since the first UN climate change conference (COP1), which was held in 1995, more than 606,000 people have died as a result of weather-related disasters, with an additional 4.1 billion people having been injured, left homeless or in need of emergency assistance. The report was released just weeks before the second UN climate conference (COP2) is to be convened in Paris. During this period, 90 percent of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 recorded floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other weather-related events, the report said. ""Weather and climate are major drivers of disaster risk and this report demonstrates that the world is paying a high price in lives lost,"" said Margareta Wahlstrom, head of UNISDR, in a press release. ""Economic losses are a major development challenge for many least developed countries battling climate change and poverty."" The report and analysis, compiled by UNISDR and the Belgian-based Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), highlighted data gaps, noting that economic losses from weather-related disasters are much higher than the recorded figure of 1.891 trillion U.S. dollars, which accounts for 71 percent of all losses attributed to natural hazards over the 20-year period. Only 35 percent of records included information about economic losses. UNISDR estimated that the true figure on disaster losses -- including earthquakes and tsunamis -- is between 250 billion U.S. dollars and 300 billion U.S. dollars annually. ""In the long term, an agreement in Paris at COP21 on reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be a significant contribution to reducing damage and loss from disasters which are partly driven by a warming globe and rising sea levels,"" Wahlstrom said. ""For now, there is a need to reduce existing levels of risk and avoid creating new risk by ensuring that public and private investments are risk-informed and do not increase the exposure of people and economic assets to natural hazards on flood plains, vulnerable low-lying coastl"

[Photo/Xinhua]The year 2015 was the warmest on record globally. In Asia, we saw the strongest El Nino ever recorded, which was linked to drought in Southeast Asia, wildfires in Indonesia and an unusually active cyclone season in the Pacific. We also saw the first ever ""red alert"" for smog in Beijing, driven in part by the burning of fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change.But we also saw real progress in tackling climate change with the historic agreement in Paris by 196 countries, including China, to try to limit the rise in global temperature to less than 2 degrees C. While talking about the impacts of climate change, however, we often overlook the world's middle-class population, which has swelled to 1 billion and is concentrated in rapidly growing, densely populated cities, mostly located in coastal areas of emerging markets where manufacturing and trade have flourished.The Paris agreement comes at a critical time for them: UBS's analysis of data for more than 200 cities around the world found that the middle class is highly exposed to weather hazards and underinsured.

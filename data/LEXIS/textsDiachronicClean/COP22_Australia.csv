Community advocate David Johnston submitted a request to the environment directorate on December 15, but it was answered only on Monday, well outside the 30 days prescribed in legislation. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's office has confirmed it's investigating the delay. The documents provided to Mr Johnston show the November trip to the United Nations climate change conference in Marrakesh cost ACT taxpayers $16,159 including the expense for senior public servant Stephen Bygrave. The minister signed a memorandum of understanding with other sub-national governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He told The Canberra Times he was proud to represent the ACT at the international event, which followed the Paris Agreement. ""The conference was a great opportunity to drive investment in Canberra by building our profile as a renewable energy economy,"" he said. ""My attendance at COP22 offered invaluable insights and international contacts that will continue to benefit the ACT. I travelled economy class on all flights during the trip, and the entire cost of my trip totalled less than $8000. At COP22 , the ACT was acknowledged by delegates, jurisdictions and country representatives for its leadership on climate action and was congratulated on its target of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2020. As a small jurisdiction we are punching far above our weight. ""However, it is important that the ACT ensures that other countries are also addressing climate change with the urgency required, so we must work with other world leaders and have representation on the international stage."" Mr Johnston said the minister should direct his efforts closer to home. ""The ACT government needs to focus on the delivery of services for all including the disabled rather than expensive travel and big noting itself on the world stage,"" he said. ""Mr Rattenbuy needs to explain what value ACT ratepayers received from the trip."" Mr Johnston said the minister's directorate resisted his FOI request and failed to acknowledge it in the 14-day required timeframe. ""The ACT government needs to lift its game in processing FOI requests,"" he said. ""There is a need for Mr Rattenbury as the responsible minister to ensure good administration and that his agency takes its FOI responsibilities seriously, with all requests being processed in a timely, efficient and effective manner in accordance with the legislation."" Shadow environment minister Elizabeth Lee said the right of a citizen to make an FOI request was ""a fundamental aspect of open government"". ""If we have directorates and ministers being lax in their duty to respond to FOI requests, it puts at risk our right to a transparent and accountable government. \"

Mr Frydenberg copped criticism this week for raising the coal mine issue at United Nations climate change conference COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco. It followed leaked emails from John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton's election campaign, revealing the US-based Sandler Foundation had funded environmental group the Sunrise Foundation's action against the Adani mine. Mr Frydenberg said it was important he raised concerns because there was a lack of transparency around the inter-national funds supporting groups fighting Adani. ""I'm very concerned about the vexatious litigation that sees groups -appeal against important development projects, not for the purpose of strengthening the environmental conditions attached, but simply to delay, obstruct and prevent the development from ever taking place,"" he said. ""This is costing Australian jobs, particularly in regional areas and deterring significant domestic and international investment."" He said he spoke to US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist, for about an hour at a one-on-one meeting where he raised the issue among a range of subjects. Mr Frydenberg (pictured) said he stressed to Dr Moniz that Australia had an ""effective and rigorous"" approval process and placed a large number of strict conditions on the Queensland mine's approval.The leaked Podesta emails sparked renewed debate on the charitable status of green groups that engage in political activism, or whether groups could be for-ced to reveal how the donations are spent. \"

The sound of splashing water fills the room. This is flood devastation. Moments earlier, thousands of green dots had whirled across Africa. These were people escaping famine, drought and civil war. In the Middle East, red dots piled on top of each other. These represented internally displaced people. This is Exit, a major art installation that feels like the 360-degree dashboard of a space ship that is constantly updated on the troubled state of the planet. It looks like science fiction. But this is not fiction. ""Some of the problems facing our world are so big they are hard to take in,"" UNSW Galleries director Felicity Fenner says. ""We feel helpless and disengage when we just read the facts. Exit makes the data visual in an elegant way. It's immersive and almost overwhelming. It feels like you are at the centre of the earth."" Commissioned by the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art, Exit is based on the ideas of philosopher and urbanist Paul Virillo and realised by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, a New York-based studio of artists and architects. The viewer is surrounded by a panoramic video projection of six animated maps. A spinning globe appears to ""print"" maps of the world, current statistics and trajectories based on geo-coded data harvested from more than 100 sources, including UNESCO and the World Bank. ""We want people to move from one story to the next and to easily understand this important data,"" says Thomas Delamarre, curator at Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art. ""It is not just pure documentation; it is visual art."" Created in 2008, the data in Exit was updated in October 2015 for the Paris-based United Nations climate change conference . The fresh information shocked many delegates. When Exit was built in 2008, it was estimated 8000 asylum seekers had drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in the 10 years prior. In the seven years since, that figure is now estimated at 30,000 people. There are now 20 million refugees and 38 million internally displaced people - the highest number of people on the move since the end of World War II, according to the United Nations. Fenner believes art has a big part to play in raising issues of global importance. ""People don't remember what they hear, but they do remember what they see,"" she says. ""We live in such a volatile, politically charged era in terms of migration and climate change, and people who don't believe the science. I think art has a really important role.

The pair were the only Australians to have an event selected as part of the COP15 official cultural calendar. Now the Great Barrier Reef is in more danger than ever due to the recent mass coral bleaching event, destroying more than 1000km of reef as a result of climate change. It is timely then, that Ms Houston and Ms Richter's film AQUA is again screened. AQUA was the brainchild of Ms Houston and was produced by Ms Richter with their production company Wish Bone Films, on the Far South Coast. Fusing the Emmy award-winning underwater cinematography of David Hannan with the percussive beats of one of Europe's biggest dance acts ' Safri Duo ' it tells the history of the Great Barrier Reef, without words. AQUA aimed to inspire government leaders to reduce carbon emissions, activate community support, and build better conservation practices on the reef. It was sponsored by Pyramid Power, the Australian Embassy in Copenhagen, the University of Copenhagen and many other local businesses and community members. It also screened at Parliament House Canberra, Screen Australia studios Sydney, and locally to schools and the community in the Bega Valley. In Copenhagen, the film screened with Safri Duo playing live to the film. According to the two Bega Valley women, it was quite an experience. On Sunday, May 15, AQUA will screen as part of the Monthly Community Doco program at The Butter Factory in Cobargo.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia10","Cities and consumers are done with grids","March 21, 2017 Tuesday","Australian Financial Review","Traditional energy grids are on the way out as cities and consumers use new technology to reshape our networks, Arup's Mike Straughton says. The hunger for energy first put King Island, in Australia's Bass Strait, on European maps. It was discovered in 1799 by sailors hunting seals for fur and their oil, which was a top fuel for lighting back then. Just like its discovery more than two centuries ago, humanity's thirst for energy is putting King Island on the map again. The community is on the way to becoming one of the first 100 per cent renewable communities in the nation and is at the forefront of Australia's energy revolution. Hydro Tasmania set up an $18.25 million off-power plant combining solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage technology back in 2012 with the aim of providing up to 65 per cent of the island's energy needs to cut the annual cost of running expensive diesel generators by $4.5 million. Mike Straughton, principal at global engineering consultant Arup, sees the King Island project as a possible future path for energy on the mainland - decentralised grids, powered by a mix of renewables, servicing smaller geographical areas. Straughton says our current national power grids solely using large centralised power stations can't cope with demand any more and are on the way out. ""Essentially the power grid is like a water system - if you have too much water going in there's a problem and if there's too much suck on the pipe, there's a problem, too,"" he says. He says consumers are fed-up with high power bills and the ongoing political deadlock and inaction over energy policy at the state and federal levels. Straughton says we can use new technology and renewables now to redesign our grids to conserve energy and cut costs into the future Rapid advances in batteries and battery-like technologies, he says, are already available to store unused energy during off-peak periods and pump it back into grids during the peaks. He says large-scale batteries will soon be cost-effective to roll out on a larger scale, and in the meantime solutions like pumped hydroelectric schemes can help us store energy. Pumped hydro-electric schemes can use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water uphill into a reservoir. When consumer demand picks up again in the afternoon peak the reservoir's sluice gates open to release that water back over turbines to generate hydropower. So solar energy produced in the off-peak period is not lost, but stored like it is in a battery. Straughton says there's also a growing number of people using electric cars, which are effectively mobile batteries that could be used to store energy. He says electric cars could return power unused while driving back to your home during peak demand periods. Homes could then recharge your electric car during off-peak times overnight when power is cheaper and demand lower. Smart electricity meters in our homes will also be able to read what's going on with demand in the wider grid and potentially turn off electrical appliances during demand surges. Rising power costs are driving consumers towards individual renewables energy like solar panels as well, he says, which further drives down costs. Straughton says many households are also becoming ""prosumers"", consumers who also produce power, which they can sell back to the grid. He says prosumers will be able to sell their excess power to other consumers, via apps, during demand peaks. ""We could be selling excess power to our neighbours in just a few years' time,"" he says. The end-game of all this change is that national and state government involvement in energy is now much less important, he says. Increasingly, cities and towns have the power to forge ahead by themselves and set the direction of their own energy policy and redesign their systems. Straughton says aside from the financial benefits, technology and collaboration can potentially solve a very serious global problem - climate change. The historic 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris agreed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C by 2050. He says that realistically, cities and smaller communities are now the only entities that can really lead the way, but they have until 2020 to work out how they're going to do it. ""We know cities and individuals really want to do the right thing,"" he says. ""We only really have three years left to put plans into action if we want to limit the temperature rises."" \"

Byron Shire Council will be holding a community open day at the Integrated Water Management Reserve, or Byron Wetlands, on March 25. The Byron Wetlands, situated behind the Cavanbah Centre off Ewingsdale road, are a combination of both artificially created and naturally occurring wetland habitats that support a diversity of native fauna, including threatened species of birds, mammals and amphibians. The wetlands are part of the wastewater management strategy for Byron Bay's Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Treated effluent that is not recycled via the Byron Bay Urban Recycled Water Scheme is directed through a series of constructed wetland cells to provide additional effluent polishing prior to release to the Belongil Estuary. ""The Byron Wetlands utilise, through evapotranspiration and seepage, approximately 1ML (mega litre) of the effluent treated at the Byron Bay STP. This prevents an extra 1ML per day from being discharged through the Belongil catchment and estuary, eventually reaching the ocean,"" said Byron Bay Council's Manger of Utilities, Peter Rees. Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction was the theme for World Wetlands Day 2017, on February 2. Wetlands act as a natural sponge, absorbing and storing excess rainfall and reducing flooding. During the dry season they slowly release stored water, delay the onset of droughts and reduce water shortages. According to UN-Water, 90% of all natural hazards are water-related, yet scientists estimate that at least 64% of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1900. Senior Director of Strategic Marine Initiatives for Conservation International, Emily Pidgeon, discussed the importance of wetlands at COP22 - the Marrakech Climate Conference - last year.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia16","Byron's World Wetland Day","February 2, 2017","Byron Shire News (New South Wales)","TODAY, February 2, is World Wetlands Day which aims to raise global awareness of the value of wetlands for humanity and the planet. It also marks the date of the adoption of the Ramsar Convention of Wetlands in 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar. The Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. Every three years, representatives of the contracting countries meet as the Conference of the Contracting Parties or COP. The Senior Director of Strategic Marine Initiatives for Conservation International, Emily Pidgeon, discussed the importance of wetlands at COP22 - the Marrakech Climate Conference - last year. Ms Pidgeon referred to ""~blue carbon', which is the carbon stored by coastal and ocean ecosystems: ""Almost every coastal country or island country has a blue carbon eco system associated with it,"" she said. ""A typical seagrass mangrove or tidal marsh area can pull ten times the carbon out of the atmosphere or out of the ocean than a comparable area of dry land forest. ""Under the right conditions, if the eco systems are kept in a good pristine condition, that carbon is stored there for centuries and millennium. ""When we lose these eco systems, when they're degraded or converted, all that carbon that I just talked about is available to be released into the atmosphere or the ocean around it."" Not only do these eco systems sequester carbon, they also function to reduce the risk of disaster. Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction is the theme for World Wetlands Day, 2017. According to UN-Water, 90% of all natural hazards are water-related, yet scientists estimate that at least 64% of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1900. In Byron Bay, the Integrated Water Management Reserve (Byron Wetlands) are a combination of both artificially created and naturally occurring wetland habitat that supports a diversity of native fauna, including threatened species of birds, mammals and amphibians. The wetlands are part of the wastewater management strategy for Byron Bay's Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Treated effluent that is not recycled via the Byron Bay Urban Recycled Water Scheme is directed through a series of constructed wetland cells to provide additional effluent polishing prior to release to the Belongil Estuary. ""The Byron Wetlands utilise, through evapotranspiration and seepage, approximately 1ML (mega litre) of the effluent treated at the Byron Bay STP. This means 1ML per day does not get discharged through the Belongil catchment and Estuary, eventually reaching the ocean,"" said Byron Bay Council's Manger of Utilities, Peter Reed. INTERESTED?

Agreement was reached following a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, and a separate meeting with the UK Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry Nick Hurd, at the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakesh. Having input from both the UK and US into the Finkel Review will help ensure Australia is provided with the most up to date international insights into energy security issues. By working together we can share best practice solutions to ensure Australia is a global leader in maintaining energy security while transitioning to a lower emissions future. Energy security is non-negotiable and is our foremost energy policy priority. Input from the US and UK builds on the assistance the International Energy Agency will provide to the Finkel Review.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia18","Sea level rise projections for Sutherland Shire based on 'best information available'","June 3, 2016","St. George & Sutherland Shire Leader","Sutherland Shire Council has adopted a sea level rise projection based on 'best information available' and from the agreement reached by the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The council is required by the State Government to adopt a sea level rise policy and has decided to adopt the recommendation of the Paris conference to limit global temperature rise to less than two degrees. This equates to an RCP of 6. RCP, or Representative Concentration Pathways, is the measure of carbon particles in the air. Accordingly, the council has adopted the sea level rise projections associated with RCP 6 to be used in its future sea level rise projections. The council's modelling affects around 4300 homes along the Georges River, particularly around Gwawley Bay and Woolooware. There are four possible levels that council can adopt - RCP 2.6 with equates to low emissions, an RCP of 4.5 or intermediate emissions, RCP of 6 which also equates to intermediate emissions, and RCP 8.5 high emissions. With RCP 8.5, it is projected that the sea level rise in 2050 would be 26cm and would accelerate to 98cm in 2100. Based on RCP 6, the sea level rise would be 23cm by 2050, and in 2100 it would accelerate to 72cm. The council in the past was leaning towards using RCP 8.5, based on CSIRO modelling. But a few councillors were uncomfortable with adopting an RCP of 8.5 'The modelling includes a number of factors such as future fuel use, population level and the amount of land cleared,'' Councillor Tom Croucher said. ''Then there is the assumption that the number of carbon particles in the air will affect the temperature. ''The next assumption is that it will cause sea level rise and that increased carbon particles will transfer to an increase in temperature of four degrees by the end of the century. ''If we go to the worst case scenario of 8.5, we would see a sea level rise of 98cm by the end of the century. 'What this means for any big infrastructure in the shire you have got to put your building 98cm higher.'' ''Following the Paris Conference in 2015 we started working on carbon particles equivalent of RPC 6. ''The very moment the rest of the world starts going to RCP 6 the council can argue that it can base its projections on RCP6 which equals 72cm. 'The argument I put to the council is that these figures are being constantly revised. ''We thought in the interests of protecting the residents from unnecessary costs in building and in minimise their insurance costs we should adopt RCP 6. 'It could mean a difference of thousands of dollars in insurance premiums and a massive impost on infrastructure. 'We felt that adopting RPC 6 was being responsible in that it was supported by the latest science. 'The difference between 6 and 8.5 up to 2050 is only 3cm. ''Even up to 2060 it is only 7cm. After 2060 it accelerates.'' Eurobodalla Shire and Shoalhaven councils have adopted sea level rise scenarios of RCP 6. Gosford has adopted RCP 8.5. The majority of other NSW councils have adopted projections for sea level rise using the benchmarks of the State Government from 2009 - 40cm by 2050 and 90cm by 2100. These benchmarks have since by dropped by the State Government and councils have been encouraged to adopt their own benchmarks based on the best possible information. A report by council staff recommended that Sutherland Shire Council adopt the higher level scenario of RCP8.5 RCP8.5 represents the scenario that most accurately reflects actual emissions growth observed in the last eight years, a council report said. But Cr Croucher moved to adopt RPC 6. 'I think we are making a very responsible decision. We can change our position as the science becomes better.'' Although a global agreement of 187 nations on the reduction of of greenhouse gas emission was negotiated at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, all government representatives are yet to sign the agreement. Government representatives are currently meeting in Germany to discuss the next stop leading towards the signing of an agreement. The new draft sea level rise policy will be on public exhibition from June 22 until July 21. \"

The new biodiversity laws are set to replace the state's Native Vegetation Act, originally created to protect forest and land from extensive clearing, however, climate scientist Professor Will Steffen said this is yet another blow to climate change progress with the likely increase in clearing in NSW making it even harder for Australia to meet its Paris commitments. ""There are only bad climate outcomes from relaxing land-clearing regulations &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; the NSW Government needs to understand the impact an increase in land clearing will have on our emissions,"" Professor Steffen said. ""Existing forests and dense woody vegetation are important in mitigating climate change by storing carbon away from the atmosphere. ""Converting these existing ecosystems to much less carbon-dense systems can have significant consequences for our emissions levels and weaken even further Australia's already woefully inadequate efforts to tackle climate change."" Climate Councillor Professor Steffen said land clearing and disturbances such as bushfires and insect attacks can shift large amounts of carbon from the land back to the atmosphere. ""If significant areas of dense bushland are cleared, we will see significant emissions increases as a result. If the cleared land is converted to agriculture, then regrowth, which removes carbon from the atmosphere, will be prevented,"" he said. ""Although rapidly transitioning our energy systems away from fossil fuels is absolutely critical to tackle climate change, protecting carbon-dense land systems from clearing is also important. ""No government who claims to support action on climate change can, in good faith, relax land-clearing laws."" The move comes as Federal Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg attend the COP22 summit in Morocco, outlining Australia's plans and progress since ratifying the Paris Agreement last week. \"

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia21","Star editor: When digital subscriptions don't work","July 29, 2016","The NPA Bulletin","Toronto Star editor and Future Forum speaker Michael Cooke talks about the paper's ambitious tablet app that was launched last year after it ditched its digital subscription model. Toronto Star's dance with digital subscriptions only lasted about 18 months. After initially receiving a positive response to the launch of its metered model in August 2013, subscriptions soon plateaued and the Ontario masthead decided it would be better off unlocking its website. Toronto Star ended its paid digital offering in April 2015. Out of that experience rose Star Touch, an edition-based free tablet app that aims to redefine the newspaper experience online. The app topped 200,000 downloads in January after it was launched in September last year. There are practically no white spaces. Readers scroll through articles sitting atop striking photography and accompanied by videos, galleries, explainers and interactives. Readers can also email a reporter or view their twitter feed by tapping their byline. The ads are also interactive. Michael Cooke, editor of Toronto Star, likes to describe Star Touch as doing for newspapers what theatrical entertainment company Cirque du Soleil did for the traditional circus with its tired animals and corny clowns. ""The core of the circus is still there. You still have the clowns, you still have the acrobats but the difference is between night and day,"" Mr Cooke says. Star Touch is based on the La Presse+ app. La Presse, a French-language Quebec paper, has staked its future on the app having ended its print editions, with the exception of the converted Saturday paper, at the end of 2015. While the DNA of the apps is the same, the two papers and their strategy is very different. TorontoStar remained committed to its daily print editions as it embarked on the tablet journey. The paper has a much larger revenue base from its print subscriptions than La Presse did when it collapsed its daily editions. Mr Cooke will be discussing the journey to Star Touch, and the different experiences of Toronto Star and La Presse in a presentation at this year's Forum Future, an industry conference hosted by NewsMediaWorks. However Mr Cooke has certainly left his mark on the paper's newsroom since taking up editorship in 2009. Toronto Star editor Michael Cooke ""We've become more focused on the core of what we do which is to affect change in the community for the better,"" he says. ""If you're not getting action, you might as well not bother."" This has seen The Star place a much greater emphasis on investigative journalism - an emphasis that has diffused investigations out of a single team and into the broader newsroom. And the paper isn't shy about broadcasting its victories and hammering home to readers its enduring influence; The Star's front pages are often graced with the phrases ""STAR GETS ACTION"", ""STAR INVESTIGATION"" and ""STAR EXCLUSIVE"". ""We try to do journalism that falls into one of those three categories,"" Mr Cooke says. ""And a wonderful day for this newsroom is when we get that trifecta on the front page."" FRONT PAGES The Star is also experimenting with alternate ways of paying reporters such as by securing funding from foundations. Last year it partnered with environmental charity Tides Canada to produce a series of articles for the lead-up and aftermath of the United Nations Climate Change conference held in Paris last December. Mr Cooke is well-aware of the great challenges facing the industry, but believes no one can know for sure know what the future holds. ""We're all with good will, a good heart, a lot hope, a lot of intelligence and a lot of energy trying to basically save our industry,"" he says. There are some businesses, he says, like The Washington Post, the UK's Financial Times and online-only plays like Vox carrying ""beacons"" for the industry. ""They're not so focused on the Wall Street bottom line. They're focused on building an audience, serving their readers and then making money and the ones that do make tonnes of it. You look at Politico in Washington. That was something that The Washington Post could've owned. They chose not to. Now it's one of their biggest rivals."" ""There's a reason that Blockbuster didn't invent Netflix Sometimes you need to be outside the building to get at that stuff."" As for his advice for other editors: ""However old you are, try to think a decade younger, maybe two decades younger and look out three years ahead.""

Just a few short days after the celebrations on the November 4 entry into force of the hard-fought Paris accord, much of the talk in the European Union's capital was around the possibility that surprise election victor Donald Trump could put the brakes on global efforts to tackle climate change. Not that the official pronouncements let on anything much was amiss. The statement tweeted by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker emphasised the importance of close co-operation between the EU and US to ""make a difference when dealing with unprecedented challenges such as ... climate change"". Juncker invited the US President-elect to visit Europe for an EU-US summit ""at your earliest convenience"" to ""chart the course"" for the next four years. ""The world can count on the EU to continue to lead on climate and drive the clean energy transition,"" tweeted climate action and energy commissioner Miguel Canete reassuringly, adding ""we need all our partners on board"". But the sobering fact remains that Trump has dismissed the science of climate change as some sort of Chinese hoax. His 100-day action plan for climate and energy includes scrapping Obama's Climate Action Plan, stopping payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs as well as ""cancelling"" the Paris deal. Trump is said to have lined up US shale boom pioneer Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, for the post of Secretary of Energy. Another global warming sceptic, Myron Ebell, is seen likely to be tasked with the restructuring of the Environmental Protection Agency. In all, a Trump presidency could mean 3.4 billion tonnes more US carbon emissions than a Clinton one over a period of eight years, consultancy Lux Research has calculated. After two terms, Trump's policies, which include ""saving"" the coal industry, lifting regulations on gas extraction and opening up drilling in the Arctic, would leave emissions 16 per cent higher than Clinton's, it found. Still, speaking privately, one high-ranking EU official wasn't panicking on Wednesday, pointing out that some of Trump's statements were made in the heat of the campaigning debate. ""We have to see how the dust settles,"" the official said. ""We have to see how the President-elect is going to put his staff together and what kind of emphasis is going to be given. He made many promises and many statements on many different things and they are not always as clear and as detailed in their policy content, so I would be cautious. ""We have been co-operating fairly well in the past so I would assume that will continue in the future."" Another official took a similar line. ""So many things were said in the 18-month campaign, we have to see what is actually going to be implemented,"" the official said, pointing to the example of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' backtracking on austerity reforms. Wishful thinking? Maybe. Certainly reports from the ground on Wednesday at the COP22 climate summit in Marrakech were sprinkled with speculation of a potential US exit from the Paris deal, even if that technically can only happen four years down the track under the framework of the agreement. The US's - and China's - backing of the accord gave the deal important international momentum and credibility in the first place, and the fear is that a move to exit could do harmful damage. ""If the US commitment wanes, other countries may also lose interest,"" oil and gas consultancy FGE summed it up, forecasting that the US's moves on climate were likely ""to slow or reverse"", with implications for renewable energy, coal and gas. \"

Further talks with other countries that could eventually become part of the system are scheduled for this week at the COP22 climate summit in Marrakesh. Among them is New Zealand, said Jos Delbeke, director-general for climate action at the Commission. He said meetings last month with officials in China had shown him a will by Beijing to potentially link with the EU system. Such a move, although only likely in the longer term, would be ""a significant first step"" toward an international trading system, putting a global price on carbon, said Mr Delbeke, who is one of the architects of the EU's emissions trading system. ""Even if prices are moderate, that would be a hugely important signal for the world if that would take shape,"" he said in an interview in Brussels. His comments come as China positions itself to become a global leader on climate change after the US election of sceptic Donald Trump as president last week. During the campaign Mr Trump vowed to ""cancel"" the Paris climate change accord reached last year. He has also promised in his first 100 days in office to lift restrictions on the extraction of oil, gas and ""clean coal"", while cancelling ""billions in payments to UN climate change programs"". Mr Delbeke said he had never backed the idea that a ""top down"" international carbon trading system established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change would work. Rather, because setting up an ETS is a political decision that needs to be carried out in accordance with domestic politics and legal structures, a ""bottom-up"" approach was better. Such an approach has been applied in China, where seven pilot carbon trading systems are set to be developed into a nationwide system next year, resulting in a carbon market that by 2020 will be double the size of Europe's. ""I'm a strong defender of this bottom-up approach and I think we are getting somewhere in doing that,"" he said. Mr Delbeke said he expected to have further talks with New Zealand about a potential linkage with the EU ETS system, while similar discussions have been held with South Korea and Canada. ""One day we hope to talk again to Australia,"" he said, noting talks had been dropped after Australia abandoned its carbon pricing mechanism. However, the recent ratification of the Paris climate accord could put the topic back on the agenda. ""We worked very hard with Australia at a certain point in time because there was an Australian ETS in the making and then it was not pursued any longer,"" Mr Delbeke said. ""[But] in the context of the implementation of the Paris agreement, there may be a good context to revive the debate with the Australian authorities."" The EU's ETS has suffered an oversupply of emissions credits in recent years, which has kept prices too low to be of much influence on the energy mix. Mr Delbeke, however, said he still believed a market-based ETS was the best way of reducing emissions. He said that while Europe's prices had been ""relatively low"" compared with expectations, in other schemes around the world the price was converging at about $US10 a tonne. Measures are being considered to address the surplus of permits in the EU, which arose from the decline in energy demand as a result of the global financial crisis, he said. ""We would like to have higher prices because it would facilitate the take-up of renewable energy, for example, or encourage energy efficiency improvements, so we are considering a more proactive way of dealing with the surplus that is currently in the market,"" Mr Delbeke said. \"

Tony Wood of think-tank The Grattan Institute said as it is now, Australia would struggle to meet its own emissions reduction levels promised in Paris last year. Australia committed to reduce CO2 emissions to 26-28 per cent of the levels they were at in 2005. Mr Wood described the climate change discourse in Australia as toxic, and that many people in government did not even believe anything should be done to tackle it. He also said the public and government discourse had evolved into a renewables versus fossil fuels debate, when what it should be about was emissions reduction and employing whatever methods suitable to reduce then. ""We need to assess what are the most efficient, low cost ways to achieve emissions reduction,"" he said. ""And if a large percentage of renewable energy sources is the right answer, fabulous. Mr Wood suggested some other ways of reducing emissions could include modifications or retrofitting to HYPERLINK /news/2016-04-18/carbon-capture-update-dr-linda-stalker-csiro/7328808 fossil fuel power stations and carbon capture and storage (CCS) . ""There are things that can be done to existing power stations, if they had the right price signals to reduce emissions they would. ""And there are more things that can be done with gas-fired power stations, even though gas prices have been higher than they've been for a long time. ""It could be that technologies associated with carbon capture and storage become more viable if we only thought about emissions and not just reducing emissions. ""And at some point, we need to have a sensible conversation about nuclear energy. ""Renewables will certainly be a part of the new energy mix, but there's other things we can do and I think it's wrong, both federally and at a state level to specifically support renewables when reducing emissions is the name of the game. World first CCS project launched at a steel project in Abu Dhabi This focus on renewable energy has been raised often before, most notably by renewable expert Professor Richard Heinberg who also believes the current focus on renewable energy is skewed towards electricity generation and not on actual energy output. Professor Heinberg, Fellow In Residence at the Post Carbon Institute in California, USA, said electricity is only 20 per cent of global energy requirements. HYPERLINK /news/2016-06-24/renewable-energy-technology-breakthroughs-needed-says-heinberg/7512840 The other 80 per cent is used directly in industrial and civil processes and technology breakthroughs are needed in order to replace the massive global infrastructure that supports them. This supports a world first this week when a steel company in Dubai opened the first carbon capture and storage (CCS) operation associated with a steel plant. The Al Reyadah project in Abu Dhabi is being hailed as a critical milestone in making industrial CCS a commercial reality. The project is a joint venture between Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Masdar, the clean technology and renewable energy arm of the Abu Dhabi Government. It will capture CO2 from Emirates Steel manufacturing, transfer it to the Al Reyadah plant for compression and dehydration, and is transported through a buried pipeline to ADNOC's NEB and Bab oilfields for enhanced oil recovery. The Australian headquartered Global CCS Institute hailed the project as a success after four years of development. ""CCS is the only technology capable of achieving deep cuts in emissions from necessary industrial production processes such as iron and steel, cement, fertilisers, and natural gas processing so the opening of Al Reyadah is a major achievement in reducing emissions for this industry,"" said the institute's CEO Brad Page. ""The project is another step towards meeting national as well as global climate targets, and further demonstrates CCS as a proven technology which can reduce CO2 emissions at the lowest possible cost. ""This is a key project in the Institute's portfolio of large-scale CCS projects in operation or under construction which, by the end of 2017, is expected to have operational CO2 capture capacity of approximately 40 million tonnes each year."" The Al Reyadah project is expected to capture and store 800,000 tonnes of annual CO2 emissions and is the first iron and steel project of its kind in the world. \"

FULL TEXT Week one of the Marrakech climate negotiations was a roller coaster of emotions as shock and grief at the Trump ascendancy was met with gritty resolve and some strong national responses, including from Australia. As ministers and heads of state arrive this week, including our Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg, that resolve will need to be built on. Strong political signals as well as substantive progress and clear timelines in detailing the Paris climate agreement's rule book will be important. And, as the Trump presidency approaches, that will need to be followed up with continued development of credible policy, aligned with the objectives of the Paris agreement, for net zero emissions and greater climate resilience. Australia surprised and delighted many with its ratification of the Paris climate agreement just two days after the US election. Backed by a bipartisan parliamentary committee's support, and a clear statement from leading ministers that the agreement and its objectives were in our national interest, there was little choice but to press on. Nonetheless, recent weeks of political point scoring in the aftermath of the South Australian blackouts and the announcement of the March closure of Hazelwood power station meant this was no sure thing. Ratification evoked both relief and respect. But ratification of an international agreement is one thing, credible policy to deliver on it is another. Australia's policy suite just happened to be destined for the spotlight this weekend. On Saturday, delegates gathered in the Casablanca Plenary Hall to ask questions of Australia and some other developed countries whose turn it was under a ""multi-lateral assessment"" forum. [ HYPERLINK http://www.crikey.com.au/https://www.crikey.com.au/2016/11/08/unfccc-morocco-climate-conference-kicks-off/ Even rain can't stop the parade on day one of Morocco climate conference ] This is part of the architecture for developed nations, and is as much information-sharing and education as it is testing of resolve. Rules are under discussion for a similar process for all nations under the Paris agreement of all 190 nations. On the day, Australia received more questions than any other country. With a focus on 2020 goals under the Kyoto Protocol however, this was unlikely to provide a ""gotcha"" moment for the paucity of policy for longer-term goals. That proved to be the case, but there were some interesting insights nonetheless. Australia has continued to maintain its confidence that it will meet and beat its 2020 target. The Paris agreement was accompanied by a decision, backed by Australia and others, that countries would seek to lift pre-2020 ambition. So it was no surprise that China asked if Australia might ""enhance"" its target. Australia responded that the 2020 target was ""not a ceiling on our ambition"" but declined to formalise this in any way. The $2.55 billion Emissions Reduction Fund was highlighted as the ""centrepiece"" of the government's 2020 policy package. There was no reference to the fact that this is more than two-thirds committed and likely to be run down next year. With no clarity from the government as to any further funding, and nothing extra promised during the 2016 election campaign, our diplomats could not answer questions from the US regarding the future of this ""centrepiece"". The government's 2017 review of climate policies will be the time to build a credible and scalable national policy for 2030 targets and beyond. Critically, this review will consider longer-term post-2030 targets. This was the Abbott's government policy, and Australia reaffirmed last month, in a written response to China, that it would consider longer-term targets as part of that review. The importance of longer-term considerations was underlined when news broke that Germany has agreed to a draft plan to reduce emissions to nearly zero by 2050. The plan has sector targets out to 2030, including a halving of emissions from the energy sector by 2030, and brings greater clarity to a just transition process for coal phase-out. Earlier in the week, the conservative UK government released its plan to phase out coal power by 2025. These are the matters that Australia will need to sort out if it is to display its continued commitment to the Paris agreement and our national interest in its success. Some in government and media have said these sorts of goals are just sops to ""the green vote"", but they go to the credibility of our commitment. While our ministers will need to work with others this week to underline the resilience of the Paris agreement, the bigger tests are coming in the months ahead, as the government undertakes its 2017 review.

FULL TEXT It's morning here in Marrakech and people are working through the implications of the election of President Donald Trump. It will take some time. Regardless, it remains in Australia's national interest to build on climate and clean energy action and push forward with the Paris agreement. The climate risks and clean technology opportunities for Australia have been noted by the bipartisan parliamentary treaties committee. Nothing has changed to affect ministers Julie Bishop and Josh Frydenberg's statement that the Paris agreement is in our national interest. The current forces that are driving transformation in the electricity sector remain unchanged. If anything, the risks have just become greater as the politics become more volatile. Australia and other countries must continue to implement the commitments they made in Paris. This is the only way to protect Australia's long-term interests. The extent of impact on global climate action of a Trump presidency will depend on a number of factors,\~including the resolve of other countries, investors and the state governments within the USA. This does not mean the Paris climate agreement falls. The agreement came into force last Friday and,\~even if the US could withdraw,\~there would still be enough countries with enough of a proportion of global emissions for it to continue. Article 28 of the agreement stipulates, after coming into force,\~no country can withdraw for three years and then must give 12 months' notice. It appears Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress could forge a workaround by withdrawing from the agreement's governing UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. But this is no small step; it is a convention ratified by former\~Republican president,\~George Bush Sr. The essential drivers that led to the Paris agreement remain in place. The agreement is the result of the robust international co-operation to address the climate threat that has changed the global economy in the past decade. Renewables have\~overtaken coal in global electricity capacity. Electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry. Jobs are being created in clean sectors faster than any other. This is the case in the US and every other major economy. Additionally, the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4 underscored the scale of that commitment and the ongoing momentum in the process. [ HYPERLINK http://www.crikey.com.au/https://www.crikey.com.au/2016/11/08/unfccc-morocco-climate-conference-kicks-off/ Even rain can't stop the parade on day one of Morocco climate conference ] At home, Trump has pledged to dismantle and defund clean energy programs and massively curtail,\~if not abolish,\~the Environment Protection Authority. The extent to which he follows through is uncertain. But it is important to recognise that,\~for some time,\~significant leadership has been exercised by states like California,\~and this will continue. Even in conservative strongholds, such as Texas and North Carolina, Republicans are embracing clean energy industries that promise major new investment and job creation. In 2015, the clean energy industry brought $6.96 billion to North Carolina, boasting more than 26,000 full time jobs, 3150 of which were created in 2015 alone. In Texas, the heartland of oil and gas, more than 100,000 people are now working in the renewables sector. It is also important to recognise that investors have now become significantly more sophisticated in their approach to the climate challenge's physical and policy risks. Few would invest in high-emissions. long-lived infrastructure, which would typically have 40-year lifespans. There is no question a Trump presidency could wreak significant damage on domestic and global climate efforts,\~but that\~need not be fatal. Much will depend on the extent to which other countries strengthen their resolve and carry on. Much will depend on the way other countries engage with a Trump administration,\~who will need to recognise that climate diplomacy is now integrated into\~economic and security international relations. Australia has a particular responsibility here. The US-Australian partnership was one of the few, if not the only, partnerships to be unscathed by Trump during the campaign. Australia should engage and counsel against drastic moves. Australia should signal its seriousness by pressing on with the ratification of the Paris agreement and its 2017 review of climate policies and consideration of post-2030 targets. Bishop and Frydenberg have stated that the agreement is in Australia's national interest,\~and the bipartisan Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended ratification just last Monday. In this time of massive uncertainty,\~and with its enduring partnership, Australia needs to step forward in its engagement with a Trump administration on climate and clean energy. But, just as importantly, Australia needs to send clearer signals that the only way to deliver on the commitments made in Paris is to push on with the modernisation and decarbonisation of our energy system and economy.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia33","Even rain can't stop the parade on day one of Morocco climate conference","November 8, 2016 Tuesday 11:38:41 GMT","Crikey","ABSTRACT The Morocco climate talks have kicked off, and the stakes couldn't be higher, writes Climate Institute CEO John Connor. FULL TEXT What I didn't expect on the first morning of the Marrakech, Morocco, climate talks was that it would be cold and wet. But that didn't dampen the festive opening of this the 22nd annual meeting of nations party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The festivities were because it was also the first meeting since last December's Paris agreement, under which, unlike its predecessor the Kyoto Protocol, all countries committed to make contributions to help achieve global net zero emissions, limit global warming to 1.5-2.o degrees, and to build greater climate resilience. Normally staid diplomats were invited to wave LED-lit images of the sun at the centre stage on which luminaries gathered around an inflated planet with a Mr Happy face upon it. Members of a percussion band beat their drums as they danced among the assembled diplomats and politicians from over 190 nations. In adjacent purpose-built massive tents, many countries were setting up not just their offices but also pavilions to showcase their efforts, sell their technologies and attract investors. These are meetings not just of diplomats, but also of leading businesses and investors that come to these gatherings to track progress and lobby politicians. China and the US had high-tech displays. Japan had an electrified track with model very-fast trains and trams coursing past homes with solar roofs and hills bedecked with wind turbines. India bedazzled with a Bollywood-style glitzy presentation. Korea, Thailand, and European and African nations and more had traditional and interactive electronic displays strutting their stuff. It is easy to get cynical at such displays but, as well as the real business interests at stake, it has been a gruelling multi-decadal journey of grinding diplomacy to get to this point. Bitter divisions and recriminations had marked the last effort to get a universal agreement in Copenhagen in 2009. There we saw what international shirt-fronting really looked like as the US and China butted up against each other, and prime minister Kevin Rudd famously described the latter as rat fornicators -- or words to that effect. Since 2009, reassessment of national interests in climate action and pollution reduction, by them and others, led the US and China to form a durable and active diplomatic partnership. Mounting investor and financial regulator unease at growing climate costs and the increasing affordability of cleaner technologies also helped tip the scales in Paris for an outcome that, though not perfect, is worthy of celebration. As the sun broke through in the afternoon, negotiators were getting down to the hard work of creating the more detailed rules and processes that will drive the higher-level commitments made in the Paris agreement. The aim is to develop common rules for transparency and accountability, to be in place by 2018, as some of the machinery to ratchet up action and ambition agreed to in Paris kicks in. This won't be easy. Among other challenges, it will test the willingness of developing countries to allow others to review or assess their efforts. And what of Australia? Our representatives are keeping a more discrete shopfront with an office tucked away at the very back of our hall. But Australia will be in the spotlight on Saturday when recent efforts and promises under the Kyoto Protocol will be tested under processes, for now only limited to developed economies, but which serve a model for all under the Paris agreement. The little ray of sunshine I did get this morning was that the cross-party parliamentary committee considering the Paris agreement had tabled its report recommending Australia join the 100 countries who have ratified to date. This clears the way for Foreign Minister Julie Bishop or Minister for Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg to formally do so when they arrive next week. Australia's ratification would be welcome, but the work of developing credible policies to help achieve the net zero emissions objective lies ahead. Fortunately, the government has long committed to review climate policies and to consider a post-2030 target in 2017. Here's where the sun really needs to shine in, because Australia and other countries will need far greater actions than those promised before Paris if they are to really help achieve the objectives of the agreement they forged in the French capital. The latest independent assessment released on the eve of the Marrakech meeting had the world still heading to a much more dangerous, costly and warmer world than that committed to in Paris. That assessment also found that Australia's current 2030 commitment would result in only Saudi Arabia and Russia being higher in pollution per person. That's a risky position when most other countries are pursuing their, and frankly our, interests in building a more resilient, net zero emissions global economy as soon as possible.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia34","Fighting Global Warming: Legrand Reasserts Its Determination to Reduce Its Energy Footprint","December 1, 2016 Thursday 8:10 AM AEST","MediaNet Press Release Wire","\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~The Group joins the Science Based Targets program \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~and supports the Global Alliance for Energy Productivity \~\~\~\~Within a few days of the entry into force of the Paris agreement, and after the COP 22 conference, Legrand has announced it is joining two major international initiatives aimed at fighting global warming. The Science Based Targets program encourages companies to commit to specific targets for cutting their CO2emissions, while the Global Alliance for Energy Productivity against climate change is an international alliance seeking to enhance energy intensity levels. Joining both of these initiatives reinforces Legrand's track record of committing to limit the environmental impact of its business. (Logo: HYPERLINK http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277386LOGO http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277386LOGO ) \~\~\~\~At the heart of the CSR approach \~\~\~\~Legrand has for long been committed to preserving the environment, one of the cornerstones of the Group's\~\~CSR commitment. This responsible approach has enabled it to reduce its energy footprint by over 7% in two years, between 2013 and 2015, while every year since 2011, Legrand has disclosed its carbon footprint. The Group further intends to begin gradually factoring the price of a tonne of carbon dioxide into its operational decision-making process, especially as regards capital expenditure. And because 40% of energy consumption worldwide is done in buildings[1], Legrand has developed energy efficiency solutions which should enable to avoid 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions from 2014 until 2018[2]. \~\~\~\~Forging ahead \~\~\~\~Now, by joining the Science Based Targets program, which is supported by the WWF, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the Carbon Disclosure Project, Legrand has decided to move another step ahead. To enable global warming to be limited to a maximum of 2 degrees, the program calls on companies worldwide to publicly commit to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. \~\~\~\~Legrand is thus moving from an energy consumption reduction target to a target expressed in terms of CO2 emission avoidance. ""The next step will involve working actively towards this target, which is going to be a key ingredient of our next CSR roadmap"", explains Philippine Declercq, Legrand's CSR VP. \~\~\~\~Joining the Science Based Targets program means Legrand is publicly committing alongside some 200 major global businesses. Meanwhile, its support for the Global Alliance for Energy Productivity and its aim of promoting lower energy intensity across the planet, provides an additional testimony to Legrand's commitment to environmental preservation. \~\~\~\~About Legrand \~\~\~\~ \~ HYPERLINK http://www.legrand.com http://www.legrand.com \~\~\~\~1.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia35","Trumpet call on climate JULIAN CRIBB","November 21, 2016 Monday","Canberra Times (Australia)","The US election result could be a blessing in disguise. Contrary to appearances, Donald Trump might just be the best thing that ever happened to climate action. The presence of a climate denier in the White House and his obtuse, coal-funded minions in key government posts is liable to ignite such fury among sensible people across America and worldwide as to accelerate the demise of coal, oil and gas (""the fossils"") and the adoption of climate-saving policies at every level. Trump might be just the bitter medicine we needed to jerk us out of our complacency about what a 4 or 5-degree world will really be like: approaching uninhabitable. Depending on the rate at which Arctic methane is released, the world has 15-20 years to do away with fossil fuels. After that, a hot world of +4 or +5 degrees becomes almost unavoidable. The US election result has gifted the sedate pace of climate action from Paris COP22 with a fresh urgency as, around the world, people wake up to the brutal fact that if they wait for government action then hell will not freeze over but engulf the planet in a conflagration that will consume their children and grandchildren. Waiting for governments to agree on the necessity of saving civilisation is, in a phrase, a mug's game. Their hearts aren't in it, and there are far too many juicy bribes and sinecures for individual politicians not to mention political parties paid off by the coal lobby to posture and then sit on their hands. If Trump and his ilk are to be stopped from their headlong, selfish pursuit of planetary devastation, it will be by the people of the planet - not the institutions or politicians. Here's how. Go green Not even Trump can defy world market reality. The one thing that can destroy the price and profitability of coal, oil and gas is low-cost renewable energy. As they well know - hence all the campaigns against wind turbines and solar farms. Put solar on your home, support your city or local government in taking your community off grid. Invest in tidal, wave, geothermal and the new energies to balance the power supply. Resources companies have the option to go green themselves - they just don't want to. They will end up with stranded assets and bankrupt, like many US coal majors already are. Divest now Don't put your life savings into anything that might destroy your grandkids. It's not a formula for human survival. Ethical and green investment services are mushrooming. Concerned citizens can compel their bank, super fund, university, local government etc to invest ethically by demanding accountability, including divestment in fossil fuels - and by shifting their accounts. In the Trump years, there will be massive global divestment by hundreds of millions in the source of the greatest hazard facing humanity. Sue the bastards Though they may look like pinpricks for now, there is a rolling wave of lawsuits around the world against their governments for failing in their duty of care, and against the oil and coal majors for risking human lives and destroying the environment. Every lawsuit adds to the sovereign risk of investing in fossil fuels - and scares other, less ethical, investors. Shrewd investment analysts are already advising their clients to bail out of fossils, and there's not a darn thing Trump and his acolytes can do to stop it. Protest Many people still underestimate the power, in a social media age, of peaceful citizens' protests to change minds, values and perceptions within communities and countries. The way the world, especially its indigenous communities, has rallied behind the Sioux nation to oppose the Keystone tar sands pipeline is a case in point. As are the citizens' protests over the Liverpool Plains and Adani. Local protests over just causes reverberate worldwide. There is a global movement building that responds instantly. Trust the youth Following the US election, the electoral map of how 18-24 year olds voted gained currency. Young Americans, at any rate,e are not willing to be pawned to the interests of the fossils. Globally, many of the lawsuits against government or the fossils are led by youngsters, even teenagers - and for similar reasons. This is a demographic that can only grow and, aided by social media, can do so at lightspeed and universally. Change your habits The food industry contributes roughly 30 per cent of climate change drivers, and wastes about 40 per cent of all food. So stop wasting food, and buy it from farmers who care, not from supermarkets who don't. Don't buy your kids plastic toys - you are only funding the petrochemical industry. Likewise look for organic food, clothing and household products, which are produced without petrochemicals (pesticides, dyes, preservatives etc). Again, there's nothing the Trumpists can do to stop you eating and shopping more safely and sustainably - and contributing your dollar signals to a burgeoning global marketplace. Electrify Electric cars are a climate solution only if the electricity they run on is renewable not fossil - but some stunning technologies are just around the corner, including using vehicles themselves as generators of green energy into the local grid. The worldwide spread of high-voltage DC (HVDC) cables over thousands of kilometres is the genesis of an international grid for moving energy efficiently around the planet: one day your home may help run a factory in China. Sunlight in the Sahara will help power Europe, etc. In the face of universal threats like climate change, people often feel powerless to influence the future. This is no longer the case, as these six examples show. You can have quite a big impact simply by choosing where you shop, bank, mortgage your home and save your money. Aligned with hundreds of millions of others, equally concerned, equally empowered, you can change the world. If humanity itself forms a consensus to prevent and mitigate climate change, it will be a political act like none other in history. No nation, corporate, religious order, political party or belief system can stop it, because they will have no power over it. It will unleash the next great phase of global economic growth and development, the new industries, jobs and opportunities that transition us into a sustainable, prosperous world. So, thanks Donald, for supplying the wake-up call. Local protests over just causes reverberate worldwide. \"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia36","Letters","December 6, 2016 Tuesday","The Tablelander (Australia)","HOORAY FOR POOL ON behalf of the Mount Garnet community (both children and adults), I wish to express our sincere thanks to Tablelands Regional Council for approving works which will enable the public to once again use our swimming pool (pictured). We were all delighted to hear the news that the council would invest more than $40,000 to install a token system and gate. Special thanks go to our local councillor Annette Haydon and the Mayor Joe Paronella who have always supported our small town. Thanks to TRC officers, Jason and Sherilee, as well for all their hard work. The Mt Garnet community built its 25m pool in 1983 after seven years of fundraising. The push for a pool started because of the drowning of a local child in a creek. Much of the digging equipment, labour and some funds were provided by Oakbridge, the company that ran Tableland Tin Dredge. It was finally opened to the public in October 1988. For 20 years, the local pool committee ran and financed the pool, but, after the death of long-term manager Gordon Green and with a dwindling town population, it became a struggle to keep it open. In recent years, the council took responsibility, but, because of a lack of qualified volunteers with bronze medallions, the pool had only been available to children during school hours for learn-to-swim classes. It is a great facility for our small town and we appreciate TRC's commitment. PS: Thanks as well to TRC for the great Christmas banners and our first council Christmas tree. HEATHER PAYNE, Mount Garnet TRIBUTE TO SCIENTIST THE centenary year of Aleksandr Prokorov is drawing to a close. He has been celebrated in his birthplace and in Butchers Creek where he began his education. His parents had escaped Tsarist Russia's sentence to Siberia and in 1912 came to Australia settling in ""Little Siberia"" where other Russian families lived. His father became naturalised in 1915 perhaps to avoid detention during World War I, because he was on the wrong side again. In July 1916, Aleksandr was born, the youngest of four and the only boy. Einstein's observation that ""stimulated emission"" could be possible is dated to 1917 a year after Aleksandr was born, and whose future research was to make Einstein's observation a reality. The Prokorov family suffered tragedy in 1921 when Clara, the eldest child, died from pneumonia. Soon after Clara's death the family returned to Russia after 12 years in Australia. All his life, Aleksandr is quoted as saying that his first seven years in Australia shaped his life. His research and inventions with other scientists certainly changed millions of lives. Between the MASER and LASERs all the way to scanners and fibre optics, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1964 and received awards and decorations all his life. The Physics Institute in Moscow is now named for him. He died in 2002 and his desk is exactly as he left it, a tribute to the great scientist. Aleksandr is Queensland's first Nobel Laureate and this year his achievements were celebrated at Butchers Creek school on the centenary. Three lectures were given - one in JCU in Cairns, one at Butcher's Creek School and another in Atherton by scientists from Australia's National University and Questacon in Canberra. An article, ""Queensland's First Nobel Laureate"", on Aleksandr has been circulated to government, universities, and education departments, he has received real recognition for the first time in Australia the land of his birth on the Atherton Tablelands. IRENE SHANKS, Mareeba DOCTORS THANKED I WOULD like to pass on a big thankyou to Dr Chris Earl, Dr Dan Caines and all the team at the Alice Street Medical centre along with the caring staff at the Atherton public hospital. They all provided excellent care for my daughter Amitie recently. Dr Earl and Dr Caines especially showed compassion and concern for her and made sure she had the best medical attention. I really appreciated this as it put both my and my husband's mind at ease. Her health is now great. But we desperately need a new hospital. DOMINIQUE MAIDMENT, Tolga DEVELOPMENT CONCERNS YUNGABURRA residents are concerned about the plan for Preliminary Approval and Development Permit (PA/15/0059E) before Tablelands Regional Council. The plan of the proposed estate can be seen attached fence along Williams Ave and Tinaburra Drive. There are many other residents who may be unaware of the proposed development of 172 housing allotments in this location. With the severe water shortage to the town's water supply drawn from Tinaburra, residents are concerned about the impact an extra 516 residents will have. That number is a conservative one that takes into consideration a minimum of three people per residence. A quick drive past the sewage plant in Yungaburra causes one to worry about how it will service the extra population. In recent years there have been several housing developments here, but none as extensive as this one. Local ratepayers would like council to advise us who will be paying for the upgrade of water supply, and the sewage treatment plant expansion that must surely follow should it go ahead - not to mention increased road maintenance. The closing date for public submissions regarding this development is December 15 and I urge everyone to have a say. LYN THOMPSON, Yungaburra UNHAPPY IN RAVENSHOE SO Mount Garnet pool opens to the public. The recommendation was ""unanimous"" and Tablelands Regional Councillor Haydon wants Ravenshoe residents to take advantage of it. Well, whoopdee-do. It will mean ""only"" a 96km round trip instead of 110km to Atherton, to a pool that is ""solar heated"", open only from 9am-5pm, tokens to be collected, and do we take our ""accredited supervisor"" with us? Does that person save lives or just makes sure you don't put rubbish in the pool? No mention of a bus service, subsidised for kids and pensioners, in other words, no change for Ravenshoe residents and more than 600 kids. Thanks for nothing, TRC, just keep spending our money in Atherton as you have always done. The answer for us is to bring back our old Herberton Shire, but that won't happen so we'll just have to continue on and hope someone will listen and take action. ZOE BROOKS, Ravenshoe The next morning I realised I had left my wallet in the trolley. Hoping for a miracle, I phoned the supermarket at 8am, but no luck. However, the lovely Jess, a supervisor at the supermarket, phoned me back an hour later to advise that an honest stranger had found my wallet in the trolley and handed it in. To that wonderful stranger, I offer my great thanks for doing me a great service and for demonstrating the fabulous character of the people of Atherton. Another special thanks to the staff at the Atherton Supa IGA, you are my heroes. Apart from the joy of getting my wallet back, this act of kindness and honesty meant that I could fly to Sydney for my mother's funeral. So you can see what a special and precious gift you have given me. MICHELLE CREECY, Cairns GREEN ALARMISTS THE cognitive dissonance of climate alarmists like Tom De Ridder (Tablelander, 22/11) coming to terms with the Trump presidency has been immensely satisfying to watch. Greenie heads have been exploding all over the planet - especially at COP22 in Marrakech where alarmists have realised the wheels are falling off their gravy train. The UN has admitted its goal was never to ""solve"" climate change, but to redistribute wealth. Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the UN's IPCC Working Group III, in an interview with Neue Z\'c3\'bcrcher Zeitung on 14/11/2010 said: ""One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy \'e2\€ \£6 One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore."" But Tom thinks CO2 is dangerous, so let's revisit the carbon cycle: CO2 plus H20 plus sunlight allows plants to photosynthesise and form carbohydrates, thus CO2 is plant food and the basis of all life. The first 40ppm of CO2 does most of the infra-red radiative forcing, with further effects decreasing logarithmically; additional CO2 now makes no measurable difference to temperature. PETER CAMPION, Tolga He went past in early morning traffic and took the trouble of turning round and came back to help me. The sequence to the story was ambulance to Atherton Hospital then down to coronary care in Cairns. I am sorry I didn't get his name, but he knows where I live and I would like to chat to him personally and thank him. There will always be a cup of tea if you call in. FRANK HUMPHRIS, Atherton RUDE AND WRONG MY daughter is a marine biologist with a PhD in coral reproduction. After the bleaching, the James Cook University Marine Biology Department took 900 videos of the damage and my daughter was one of the scientists that assessed them. Peter Campion was issuing his pronouncements on the subject before there was any data to assess. Now that the damage has been quantified and follow-up studies done, we know there is every reason to be concerned about the future health of the reef, particularly the northern section. Elsewhere, scientists like my daughter were described as a ""disgrace"" to science for telling the truth. This person was completely wrong in his ""opinions"" about the bleaching event and seems to have contempt for knowledge and data, usually stating probably incorrect assertions as if they were fact. Campion has said the temperature is not going up and ""business as usual"" is all that's called for. Not even the deniers are still claiming this, as the data is there. Then next week, there Campion is again with more rubbish laced with jeers and name-calling. ""Keep repeating the lie until it becomes common knowledge"" - who said that again?MICK CORLEY, Malanda. \"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia37","No Headline In Original","July 27, 2016 Wednesday","The Chronicle (Toowoomba, Queensland)","Climate change THE ""climate change"" debate's become a little too politicised. Former Greenpeace Canada president Patrick Moore and MIT professor of meteorology Richard Lindzen joined a growing number of sceptics of climate change alarm-ism. Their computer models failed to predict a pause in the warming trend from 1998 to 2012. In response to this data, the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) US wrote a paper in Science in 2015, arguing that improvements in surface observational temperature record show the ""apparent"" pause is false. Has this mysterious new data filtered down via other agencies and popular media to become a reference for activists? Perhaps, but why mysterious? In response to NOAA's claims, Congressman Lamar Smith, head of the House of Representative's Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, requested NOAA hand over internal communications relevant to the re-writing of the original conclusions, but NOAA refused, arguing it's in the interest of the scientific process that they do not share such information. Perhaps complying with such a request would be harmful to the integrity of NOAA's scientific process. Also, Georgia Institute of Technology climatologist Judith Curry revealed her suspicion of coordination between the NOAA and politicians eager to take aggressive action against climate change. Is climate science shaping the politics or is politics shaping the climate science? Coincidentally, the NOAA issued a press release denying the pause in global temperature trends just as the United States Environmental Protection Agency was preparing to issue a ""Clean Power Plan"" to reduce carbon emissions. The press release occurred, only a couple of months before the COP 21 ( United Nations Climate Change Conference ) in Paris 2015. Trusting these climate models in spite of failed predictions might be bad enough. What's more concerning is the failure to make transparent the process of justifying the adjusted (and preferred) conclusions. The question is not whether climate change is real or even whether man is contributing to greenhouse gasses; of course we are. We should also be better stewards of the earth. I think most would agree with Geoff Castle's lot, on these points. The questions are: how accurate is the temperature data? How much temperature variation is caused by man compared to natural causes? How will it affect the planet? What would be the most sensible course of action? Al Gore and Pen State climatologists Michael Mann have been caught out exaggerating; let's learn from this. Ask any activist what they thought of an Inconvenient Truth at its release. I'm guessing most weren't too sceptical. We need to look in the right direction for future threats; e.g. collapsing world economies, genetic entropy and yes, we're headed for the post antibiotic era. We have our work cut out as it is. ERROL BRIANT, Toowoomba Long journey WHAT a wonderful feeling today to be able to drive myself to the shops after two long years of dealing with a brain tumour radiation and all the trauma of recovery; some 76 trips to PA hospital, Toowoomba Hospital, Highfields Medical Centre. It's been a long tough battle and today I couldn't wipe the smile of my face. I've come through and can now pick up the pieces of my life; a fantastic feeling. Good health and old age is truly a privilege, denied to so many. I feel totally blessed. MERRYL JAMESON, Mt Lofty \"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia38","Geoengineering - best used early and sparingly, not in response to a crisis","November 4, 2016 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 3:37 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: Well, that was all very good news, but by now you'll be baying for bad news, so here we are. Both the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO have announced that the latest figures on carbon and temperature are worse. And COP22 in Marrakesh is on next week. So what to do? Oliver Morton at The Economist magazine has written a book on the geo-engineering and the options to consider. His book is called The Planet Remade . Now, an awful lot of people get the horrors when you talk about geo-engineering, and you quite boldly walked into that area unblushing. Why? Oliver Morton: Not entirely without some trepidation. But I think for the simple reason that I believe that climate change poses severe possibly catastrophic risks, not certainties but risks that one should take seriously and try to act upon. I also believe that decarbonising the complex and massive fossil fuel economy on which 7 billion people soon to be 10 billion depend, and from which the majority of those people don't yet get anything like the benefits that you and I take for granted is really difficult. I don't think it's impossible and I think indeed it is imperative. I think we have to try and succeed to decarbonise the fossil fuel economy. But we have to also accept that that could well not be enough to avoid the 1.5 or two-degree boundaries that we've now written into international agreements at Paris. And so given that, it seems to me that you need to look at alternatives. Not that you need to embrace them, not that you need to discard what you have at the moment in order to follow these new fads, but that you should ask yourself are there ways to do something technical to the planet that can be made safe, that can be done in a just way and that can be made governable? And if so you should really be exploring those. And so that's the question that I sought to answer in the book. Robyn Williams: Well, just a couple of years ago there were a group of people, not least a gentleman from Trinity College Cambridge, who were going to experiment with water vapour to see whether a different gas would be feasible, and what you'd have is some device up there, a bit like a balloon which would squirt in the first case water vapour. And the experiment was stopped because the public didn't want to have it happen, even with water vapour. So it isn't there a situation where an awful lot of folk are so absolutely against it, it would be difficult to do the very thing that you say, and that's take it experimentally and to consider the possibilities? Oliver Morton: Well, I think you are referring to the SPICE experiment. Hugh Hunt at Trinity who we probably both know, is one of the players in that. It was a complicated decision, to stop the SPICE experiment, taken by the leader of that team Matt Watson, and it had to do with more factors than public acceptance. And in fact the public was not widely questioned. One of the problems was that they didn't feel that they had the right mechanism for gauging the public's view on the matter. There were also other issues to do with intellectual property which got quite complex. I think if you are worried about public acceptance, all you can do is talk about things and talk to people. And the mechanism that I have available for that conversation is a book, and at the moment the good offices of your microphone and transmitters, and talk through the question of if you don't want to see the world warm and if you are doing as much as people seem likely to be doing about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, what more are you willing to countenance and how would you like safeguards and good practices built into that? It's certainly true that a lot of the public feels strongly viscerally against. At the same time, my impression, largely anecdotal but also from people who have done a little bit of work on this, is that if you ask publics in developing countries who, after all, face the brunt of climate change in a way that we in Britain really don't, they have a rather different view. They don't necessarily say rush into this, they say but you mean this is a possibility, that we might have ways to cool the planet? Then we should definitely be looking at that because for a country like Jamaica, say, the peak temperatures during the summer and sea surface temperatures that govern hurricane activity are very important things which carbon dioxide emissions reduction in itself is not going to have any effect on for decades to come. Robyn Williams: Okay, where we are sitting is the Royal Society of London, which itself published the statement that these matters should be considered, it should be in the public arena, and a list of possibilities was given. Of the possible ways of reducing the temperature, which are your favourites? Oliver Morton: There are two different general approaches. One is reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by sucking it out in some way. And the other one is reducing the amount of sunlight coming into the atmosphere. And let's concentrate on that second one, on the reducing sunlight because that's the one that gets the heebie-jeebies going. There are really two preliminarily well studied ways of reducing the warming of the Earth by sunlight. One is to thicken the layer of small particles in the stratosphere, which is always naturally there to some extent thanks to the eruption of volcanoes. There is a layer of sulphate particles in the stratosphere that gets much thicker after a big volcanic eruption. The question of thickening it up a little thicker than it is at the moment, that's one possibility. The other one is to work much closer to the surface of the Earth and to brighten layers of low, flat cloud that sit over quite a large amount of the Earth's oceans. And techniques for doing that could be tested experimentally in the fairly near future. Actually next week I'm going to be at a meeting in Potsdam looking at the near term possibilities for experiments in this. I think you kind of have to look at the aerosols in the stratosphere as being your first port of call because volcanic eruptions do give you some sense of what happens globally. Robyn Williams: Especially in 2016 because that's 200 years, plus a little bit, of that vast eruption that really changed the climate of Europe and got rid of the summer. Oliver Morton: Tambora is absolutely spectacular but I have to say, yes, possibly the largest eruption for about 800 years and very large climatic effects, effects on Indian monsoon, effects on the summer in Europe, effects on the summer in the United States, 1800-and-froze-to-death they called it. There were I believe frosts in every one of the 12 calendar months of 1816 in New England. Also incidentally other rather less expected effects like very significant Arctic warming that you see after a large volcanic eruption like this, and that shows us something about how the climate responds, but you have to bear in mind that the amount of material that you would emit to do some geo-engineering in concert with carbon dioxide emissions would be far, far, far less than Tambora. Tambora was a huge big old shock to the Earth system, whereas what you would be hoping to do here would be sort of like a gentle nudge to the Earth system. Robyn Williams: Okay, other examples? For instance, when you are affecting the clouds, is it true that you have a number of ships at sea that would be squirting something up to the sky? Oliver Morton: Because ships are cheaper than planes, the obvious way to do the clouds, or 'obvious' meaning clever people thought about it and decided this was the easiest way, is to use seawater to create tiny little salt particles that would then drift up into the clouds and would make the clouds a little bit brighter and possibly a little bit longer lived. And that's something that could be tested. Actually making the little tiny droplets from which the salt crystals form is quite hard, but there have been various people, including a group of lovely retired Silicon Valley engineers, some of whom used to work on inkjet printers, who've come up with ways that we can try doing that. And so ways of brightening clouds is one possibility. There are other things. For instance, there's a researcher at Bristol in Britain who is interested in making crops a little bit more reflective. At first blush you think that's a bit crazy because crops need to photosynthesise, but they don't need to photosynthesise as much as they would be forced to under the brighter sunlight. And crops really suffer from the very, very hottest days. So if crops that were a little bit more reflective were a little bit cooler, that might give you a real agricultural benefit. That said, if you want to think of something that will raise your heebie-jeebies factor to the power of heebie-jeebie, then genetically modified crops that reflect sunlight more to geo-engineer the planet is probably about as bad as you can get in most people's imagination if you don't mention the word 'nanotechnology'. Robyn Williams: Except perhaps putting mirrors up in the sky, the little ones floating around, or really big ones. Oliver Morton: Really big ones, very, very difficult because, as you will have noticed, really, really big things don't float in the sky, they tend to fall down, that's why they have to have engines, that's very difficult. Putting things into orbit is very, very expensive. But effectively the particles that we talked about that are already up there because of background volcanic eruptions, those particles are little tiny mirrors. You can redesign the mirrors in various ways so that their optical properties differ. So, for instance, sulphur particles tend to spread light out a lot more than they reflect it back out to space. So sulphur particles tend to slightly whiten the sky. It's not very noticeable. I mean, when there was a large volcanic eruption in the 1990s at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, that whitened the sky but not to an extent that most people who weren't astronomers noticed. It reddened sunsets in a way that was quite spectacular and actually rather aesthetically pleasing I thought. But I don't necessarily want to do this for aesthetic reasons. Pinatubo showed us what sulphur does. You could think about other particles. For instance, some people have done studies on what might be done with diamond, what I like to think of as the large unconventional climate intervention or LUCI, the diamond experiment in the sky. What you would actually in the end choose as an aerosol, that's exactly the sort of question that leads to this overarching concern that the work would be done in a way that's safe, just and governable. You need to talk to people about the effects of these things, you need to talk about ways in which the nations of the world and ideally the peoples of the world could come to decisions about how much if any of this they wanted and in what way they wanted it to be done. And those sort of decisions can't come after all the technological work has been done. You don't want to have scientists go off and work out what the best particles are and then have an up or down vote on it, what you want is to have a continuous conversation whereby people enunciate what they need from these processes and then see what is actually doable and have a dialogue between these two different arts of the possible; the political art of the possible and the technological art of the possible. Robyn Williams: Leaving aside the sheer cost, which obviously is going to be fairly monumental... Well, the direct financial costs are very unclear at the moment. It's not that difficult to lift, say, a million tonnes of particles into the stratosphere every year. That's not particularly expensive for developed countries or even for some developing countries. It's not trivial but if you compare it to the cost, say, of nuclear power stations which are part of how Britain is trying to decarbonise itself, those are really expensive. Robyn Williams: Hinkley Point being written about in your own magazine The Economist , billions and billions and billions of dollars, and very fraught discussions about international stand-offs. Oliver Morton: Absolutely. So it's true that geo-engineering programs, especially a geo-engineering program that was properly mounted which would have to have an awful lot of monitoring and close attention being paid to all the effects, that would not be a trivial undertaking. At the same time, decarbonising the economy, as we know, is an incredibly nontrivial undertaking. We live in a world that has contrived to spend $100 billion on a space station, so these are not amounts of money beyond the dreams of man. Robyn Williams: Fair enough. But when you consider the experiments themselves, presumably you would do it in stages while the discussion is going on. You won't do the whole shebang in one go. But can you do it partially? Oliver Morton: You can do some things partially and some things not, and that's a very, very important question. You can work out, for instance, what effect this is going to have on the ozone layer. You can probably do that with relatively small experiments and that's exactly what you would hope to do. Similarly for questions about what effects you might have on the transport of water into the stratosphere, which is an important climatological factor in and of itself. These sort of processes you can probably study not uncontroversially and not easily but on relatively small scale interactions. To actually see the planet probably get warmer slower would require an operation that you would not necessarily fully understand the outcome of when you started. But to some extent that's life, it's something you don't understand the outcome of when you start. But what you can do is try and make sure that people who are affected by this get a voice, that people have a say, that there is a legitimate discussion. And there are great imperfections in the way that climate policy is put together at the moment, but there is at the same time overall a sense that the world has developed in a piecemeal unsatisfactory and stop-and-go sort of way a way of talking about how it deals with the climate. It's not inconceivable to me that we can't find a way of broadening that conversation to include consideration of some of these issues. Robyn Williams: Carbon capture and storage is one of the elements that you mentioned as the first group of possibilities, geo-engineering. And the last time I checked, which was in fact last week, the prospects seem to be more distant than before because the amount of carbon we're putting in the atmosphere is increasing by billions of tonnes. And the amounts that we are doing in carbon capture and storage is just a matter of a few million. So, many people say it's 30 years off, if that. Oliver Morton: Yes, the history of carbon capture and storage is definitely one that has to give you pause if you are talking about geo-engineering, because to some extent there is this issue within the business that is called moral hazard, that if people think that there's going to be geo-engineering they will do less emissions reduction, that if people think they are going to do geo-engineering, they might reduce emissions less. There is another way of looking at it of course which is that if people think they're going to geo-engineering and they aren't very wild about that, they might reduce emissions more. But carbon capture and storage has to some extent basically been used as a way of giving the carbon industries carte blanche because they say, oh yes, we'll do carbon capture and storage at some point but not yet, we will just be carbon capture and storage ready. And as a result we've been talking about carbon capture and storage...I think the IPCC report on it, which was hardly the first word on the subject, was 10 years ago, and we've still seen very, very little of it. So there's an awful lot of...like St Augustine said, make me chaste Lord, but not yet. That tends to be the way people see these things, and that's definitely something you need to worry about. If people talk about geo-engineering simply as a way to avoid doing anything else, that's very bad. The slightly uncomfortable corollary about this is that if you want to talk about geo-engineering you want to talk about seriously doing it in the near to medium term. You don't want to say, oh, let's just do lots and lots of research now and then use it only if there's a big disaster. If there's a big disaster, if there's a climate emergency, that's to some extent the worst time to be doing geo-engineering because you know that everything is already at stake, you know that the Earth system is already working in an unpredictable way, this is not the time to hit it with a hammer. What you want to do is stroke it with a feather earlier on or at least nudge it gently with a soft glove. I'm not quite sure why that is the analogy that comes to mind. But the idea is that geo-engineering should be, if used at all, used sparingly and probably used early, and that's a difficult thing to get your head around. People are much more comfortable, certainly scientists are much more comfortable about studying it on the basis that it will then be put behind a glass panel and used only in emergencies. But emergencies are terrible times for experimentation. Robyn Williams: Oliver Morton. He writes for The Economist magazine, and his new book is called The Planet Remade . \"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia39","Cooling the Earth - and a hungry yellow robot","November 4, 2016 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 3:37 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: This is Science Show number 2,094, and we present a killer robot chasing the crown-of-thorns, two teachers who inspire both kids and the Prime Minister, and geo-engineering; can we treat the planet? We've told you about the yellow robot before, the one that dives on the Great Barrier Reef, recognises crown-of-thorns starfish and poisons them. But now the research from the Queensland University of Technology has won the $750,000 Google Impact Challenge and can go to stage two. Well done team! Here are doctors Feras Dayoub and Matthew Dunbabin, smiling all over. Matthew Dunbabin: The trials have been fantastic, they have actually exceeded our dreams. We are now able to demonstrate the three key aspects. One is to be able to navigate complex reef, the second is to actually be able to identify crown-of-thorns starfish. And finally the last stage is to actually inject them with the bile salts, which is needed for control. Robyn Williams: And come back so it doesn't get lost. Matthew Dunbabin: And come back so it doesn't get lost, absolutely. And now we are looking at the next generation to see how we can make it even better. Robyn Williams: Now, I just talked to your colleague about how when it goes down it's got to be able to see the crown-of-thorns, identify it and nothing else, eliminate everything else. How do you manage that? Feras Dayoub: We went through our process where we trained it to detect the particular look of this creature, the starfish. And by training we can build a statistical model which compares what it sees to what it has, and when the matching is above a certain threshold it's declares this is a crown-of-thorns starfish. And it gets better as you provide more examples as you go. Robyn Williams: And were you tracking it underwater, looking to make sure it didn't zap something else? The system is detection and tracking. If we are sure frame after frame it is the crown-of-thorns that we are looking at, we declare now we are 100%... Robyn Williams: So you are seeing what it's seeing? Feras Dayoub: In the early stages, but now we are in the later stages where it's autonomous. There is no communication with the robot underwater. So the idea is to let this robot go by itself, the algorithm is detecting, injecting and taking position. We are confident that it's going to do what it's supposed to do. Robyn Williams: You didn't see it sneaking up on anything else? Feras Dayoub: In the early stages of the project, yes, the algorithm was doing a little bit of mistakes, but as we went through the weeks, the performance gets better and better. Well, congratulations. And so now you are working on an updated model. How is that going to be different? Matthew Dunbabin: Yes, through all these field trials we've identified a couple of unique opportunities for this type of technology beyond crown-of-thorns. It can include marine survey for coral bleaching, water quality, all sorts of things. So what we are now doing is working with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation to build what we are calling RangerBot. It's a smaller version, it's more portable so that citizen scientists or marine ecologists or even authorities that manage our reef, they can use this type of technology to collect data at unprecedented scales essentially. We're hoping to see lots of these rolled out across not just the Great Barrier Reef but reefs around the world. Robyn Williams: When you say lots, how many? Matthew Dunbabin: We are looking at hundreds to possibly thousands. In the longer term I think that's what is needed to help manage the globe's reefs. Robyn Williams: So that means you will have enough possibly to solve the problem of the crown-of-thorns starfish, even on a reef the size of Italy? That's always a hard decision, we have not developed COTSbot to actually work by itself, we actually designed it to work with humans, to be there to assist what they do best. They can go to certain locations, we can then do a preliminary sweep with these vehicles, get the bulk of them, and the divers would then just pick off whatever needs to be done for the control and verification. Robyn Williams: So what sort of impact would they have on the population on such a scale? Can't say. Until we really get these numbers out there we don't know. We know where they are where we are doing the control measures but there are new reefs that we don't visit all the time, they could be out there. Having a surveillance tool, we can start to then really quantify what the problem is, the numbers that we need to be able to do, and then also control them. Robyn Williams: And when you are making numbers like that, hundreds, are they affordable? That's our goal. And the reason why we are going to make this affordable is we've gone away from traditional sensors which are all acoustic based to computer vision. That's something that we are good at, we've proven that with COTSbot, but we are now looking at the next phase where the whole system is just based on computer vision. Doing that we can significantly reduce the cost of vehicles. Robyn Williams: And when you say COTSbot, crown-of-thorns starfish, that's one of your acronyms, is it? COTSbot, crown-of-thorns starfish bot. Robyn Williams: Tell me, you've been working on robotic vision as well, apart from these submersibles, just ordinary robots that wander around and do things. Feras Dayoub: Yes, I specialise in computer vision mapping, localisation and navigation. The whole idea is to use, for example, stereo vision for obstacle detection or for 3-D mapping of an environment. I'm interested in deployment of such robots in challenging and changing environments. If you have a surface robot in your house, you unpack this robot and then you make it learn the surroundings, your living room. But in the evening you change the arrangement of your furniture, the current robots need to manually relearn the configuration of this space. So the question here is how this robot can adapt over time using computer vision to map, localise, navigate and just notice change. Robyn Williams: Well, that's brilliant, but of course underwater you can have unpredictable things, strange shapes, strange creatures, and your robot then has to learn in a very sophisticated way. Feras Dayoub: Yes, so the idea is not to stop learning. After each mission the robot is recording everything it sees, and then we can review, go back off-line and review everything that happened while the robot was on the mission, because every detection, every decision the robot makes, it has confidence associated to it. So learning never stops, you are always improving the system. Robyn Williams: Well, I never imagined I would be talking about robots under the ocean free ranging like that. But you mentioned before about the citizen science people, what would they do, hire the thing, buy the thing? How would thousands of people...because you're talking about citizen science on a big scale, how would that operate? Matthew Dunbabin: Citizen science is becoming really prevalent in Australia and it's doing some great work. As you allude to, how do you get this equipment to them? We are looking at building with these...like what drones have done, aerial drones for the general population. That's our goal for underwater. So if we can build these at a price point and a functionality within them to achieve even just a surveillance tool, we have fishermen going out to reefs all the time, they don't have to do injection, they can just be mapping. And that type of information, that review of the reef is very important to understand how it's changing over time and I think that's where the power is going to come in. So if we can build an underwater drone and put it in the hands of these people, I'm sure we will see some fantastic results come out. Robyn Williams: I can't wait. But when it comes to a population of crown-of-thorns they are very, very big and sometimes you get them on a huge scale. If you have seen during one of your trials something like a packed area of crown-of-thorns, does your robot get rid of them? Matthew Dunbabin: No, it depends on how many are visible. Crown-of-thorns are very cryptic animals, so we have trained this system on hundreds of thousands of images of all different orientations of the starfish. And there are some of them that we just cannot reach. Not only are we looking at making sure we don't inject anything that's not a starfish, we are also looking at self-preservation of the robot. We don't want to get tangled up in coral, we don't want to get lost. So we can't say that we are going to get 100% clean-up, but at least get the bulk of the visible ones is our goal. Robyn Williams: And the crucial question, will the new model still be yellow? Matthew Dunbabin: Absolutely the new model will be yellow. It's about the only thing you can see on the reef. We've actually tried different colours, particularly if they are silver or these nice funky modern colours, you just will not see them in the water, that's why fish are so well camouflaged. Robyn Williams: A brilliant achievement, and not just the colour. A $750,000 Google prize just won by the Queensland University of Technology scientists Feras Dayoub and Matthew Dunbabin. Huge implications. Now some more of those Prime Minister's Science Prizes, this time the teachers. Gary Tilley is from Seaforth Public School in Sydney, and listens to The Science Show and has a museum. How do you deal with these primary kids, teaching them science, what's the secret? Gary Tilley: Look, all children in my experience are innately curious and wanting to know about science, they are very enthusiastic, and they just haven't had the chance to do it a lot from what I can see. We've changed that so at my school we have got a specialist science teacher, which is me, and for the last 15 years we have been doing science. They have grown up with scientists all around them, they've grown up in literally a Natural History Museum at the school. We've been associated with all sorts of scientists, science institutions and these children just love science, the parents do, and the whole community has been behind us. Robyn Williams: So why is it a problem in other schools? Gary Tilley: Well, it shouldn't be. You've just got to have someone who is passionate about science like I am. We've had passionate principals, other passionate teachers, and that exudes out of the kids when they know that you are loving this sort of thing, they love the science anyway. Robyn Williams: One of the problems that some teachers have told me, especially with primary, is that it's as if you have to know all the answers yourself. 'Teacher, teacher, what's that?' And in some cases people who are wiser as teachers and more experienced say we find out together, we don't have to know all the answers. Gary Tilley: Look, sometimes you do need to have an answer to put forward, but mostly I throw it back to the children; well, let's find it together, or you go and find it, or let's get mum and dad involved. And that invariably leads to much better collaborative learning anyway. Robyn Williams: You mentioned natural history though. Do they make their own museums, is that what you are implying? Gary Tilley: Yes, we started off...I thought the two things kids love are dinosaurs and space, so we started making a space gallery, so we ended up having some murals painted. A very talented teacher called Tarni Williams came to our school and she was the first one who I could convince to help me, she did, and we converted the whole school to a space gallery at one end, then we started on the dinosaur gallery at the other end. We now have a Cretaceous marine reptile stairwell where the kids walk through huge murals of these ancient reptiles with fossils of them glued to the wall and the kids can actually touch these things. Robyn Williams: I see. And what about the harder things, apart from dinosaurs, sharks and stars and Star Wars , when you are dealing with chemistry or maths? Gary Tilley: No , I can tell you that. We have got some very good chemistry people, we've got some great support from Macquarie University in particular where I've been seconded for the last few years working with them as well as at the school. So we've got access to all sorts of scientists who come out and help us. But yes, the maths has gone through the roof. It's funny, but we start to do our own data collection, and the kids who are struggling with maths are suddenly doing fantastic graphing skills, interpretation, they are doing their own investigations and making it look good and work. Robyn Williams: And if any teachers are listening to think that's too good to be true, what would you say to them? Gary Tilley: Well, the Department of Education thought it was too good to be true when our basic skills test some years ago went through the roof. So after two investigations they decided and put it onto paper that Seaforth school's science program is what made the kids learning go through the roof in literacy and numeracy. Get into it, they should all be doing this. Robyn Williams: Congratulations, thank you. Gary Tilley: Thank you Robyn. Robyn Williams: Gary Tilley, winner of the Prime Minister's Primary Teaching Prize, Seaforth school, Sydney. And equally inspiring, the winner of the Secondary Teaching Prize, Suzie Urbaniak from Kent Street Senior High School in Perth. Here she is at Parliament House in Canberra. What is the secret of your success at secondary school? Suzie Urbaniak: In the classroom making young scientists so that they are doing science, they are actually observing, measuring, collecting their own data, interpreting their data, evaluating, asking why and creating a story and then re-hypothesising to further develop it. Not worksheets, not textbooks, taking them out in the field, actually seeing our Earth through the rock. Every rock tells a story. And the physics, the geology, the chemistry and the biology, it explains how Earth has evolved and it provides questions for how we should manage the Earth in the future. Robyn Williams: Do you know all that? Suzie Urbaniak: Yep. Robyn Williams: How? Suzie Urbaniak: I'm a lifelong learner. I'm passionate about rocks and I'm passionate about our Earth and what our Earth provides for us. It's just so exciting to actually conduct a true scientific experiment like I did when I was a geologist trying to find gold, and then creating these ideals and hypotheses and then actually trialling it and getting it and then going, wow, it was such a buzz. Robyn Williams: And they can see that buzz and that's why they're inspired. Suzie Urbaniak: Yes, you can see the light go on when they produce their own data and have the freedom to actually have their own topics and develop their own investigations. There's no chocolate cake recipe science in my classroom. They are encouraged and put on a pathway to learn how to think and learn to be different. Robyn Williams: So what is the problem in other schools where this is not being achieved and the results that people have in the newspapers every time we blink that high school kids aren't hacking it with science? Suzie Urbaniak: Oh my goodness Robyn, I could get myself in trouble here! I believe there is too much onus on the exams. Science isn't about content, science is about the skill of being a scientist. Robyn Williams: Thinking. Suzie Urbaniak: And thinking, yes. And I have found anyway that once the students have the confidence to do the investigations and the enquiries or write the field trip report, they then filter and are intrinsically motivated to know all those concepts and all those dot points. There is way too much emphasis on the exams and way too much emphasis put on how the answer should be written, whether that's a mark or not a mark. Robyn Williams: Like filling in a form. Suzie Urbaniak: Yes, so there's no textbooks or worksheets in my classroom. Robyn Williams: And how do the young people respond? Suzie Urbaniak: It's different, the style of learning, but it's through encouragement and then just perseverance and chipping away at it. And after a year, sometimes after six months they get the idea, the understanding of how to do it. And what's even more fascinating is that they are bringing in their maths, they are using all the technology available to them, they are coding, engineering, and they are using whatever mediums they can to communicate their understanding through whatever arts medium they prefer to do. Robyn Williams: And the parents don't say hang on, you're doing unorthodox things? Suzie Urbaniak: Actually to the contrary, I'm actually thanked for engaging their kids in learning, and thanked for also supporting their students as they transition into tertiary pathways, and then I still have contact with them when they are at work, so they then coming... Robyn Williams: You mean after school? Suzie Urbaniak: Yes. Robyn Williams: You mean when they've left? Suzie Urbaniak: Yes. One of my first two GOs, they are both 26 or 27 now, she was a girl that was totally disengaged in science and I said, come on, come with me in year 12, and she went on, went through university, she is now a resource geologist at FMG and she comes back and does stuff. My first male geologist is in fact Aboriginal, and he is the same, and he has travelled the world and he's working for Rio I think now. He and I are working with a consortium in the community to help engage Aboriginal youth more in science called ISAG, Indigenous Student Action Group, and we are going to try and get it all through Kent Street to continue, because Aboriginal science is another passion of mine, not only for Aboriginal students but for non-Aboriginal students to actually see how their forbearers were great engineers. Robyn Williams: And are you going to tell the Prime Minister this? Suzie Urbaniak: Yes. Robyn Williams: Have you met him before? Suzie Urbaniak: No. Robyn Williams: Give him heaps! Suzie Urbaniak: I will. Robyn Williams: Thank you very much. Suzie Urbaniak: Thank you. Robyn Williams: And she did. Suzie Urbaniak at Parliament House in Canberra. And the Prime Minister was impressed. She won his Secondary Teachers Prize from Kent Street Senior High School in Perth. The Science Show on RN. Well, that was all very good news, but by now you'll be baying for bad news, so here we are. Both the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO have announced that the latest figures on carbon and temperature are worse. And COP22 in Marrakesh is on next week. So what to do? Oliver Morton at The Economist magazine has written a book on the geo-engineering and the options to consider. His book is called The Planet Remade . Now, an awful lot of people get the horrors when you talk about geo-engineering, and you quite boldly walked into that area unblushing. Why? Oliver Morton: Not entirely without some trepidation. But I think for the simple reason that I believe that climate change poses severe possibly catastrophic risks, not certainties but risks that one should take seriously and try to act upon. I also believe that decarbonising the complex and massive fossil fuel economy on which 7 billion people soon to be 10 billion depend, and from which the majority of those people don't yet get anything like the benefits that you and I take for granted is really difficult. I don't think it's impossible and I think indeed it is imperative. I think we have to try and succeed to decarbonise the fossil fuel economy. But we have to also accept that that could well not be enough to avoid the 1.5 or two-degree boundaries that we've now written into international agreements at Paris. And so given that, it seems to me that you need to look at alternatives. Not that you need to embrace them, not that you need to discard what you have at the moment in order to follow these new fads, but that you should ask yourself are there ways to do something technical to the planet that can be made safe, that can be done in a just way and that can be made governable? And if so you should really be exploring those. And so that's the question that I sought to answer in the book. Robyn Williams: Well, just a couple of years ago there were a group of people, not least a gentleman from Trinity College Cambridge, who were going to experiment with water vapour to see whether a different gas would be feasible, and what you'd have is some device up there, a bit like a balloon which would squirt in the first case water vapour. And the experiment was stopped because the public didn't want to have it happen, even with water vapour. So it isn't there a situation where an awful lot of folk are so absolutely against it, it would be difficult to do the very thing that you say, and that's take it experimentally and to consider the possibilities? Oliver Morton: Well, I think you are referring to the SPICE experiment. Hugh Hunt at Trinity who we probably both know, is one of the players in that. It was a complicated decision, to stop the SPICE experiment, taken by the leader of that team Matt Watson, and it had to do with more factors than public acceptance. And in fact the public was not widely questioned. One of the problems was that they didn't feel that they had the right mechanism for gauging the public's view on the matter. There were also other issues to do with intellectual property which got quite complex. I think if you are worried about public acceptance, all you can do is talk about things and talk to people. And the mechanism that I have available for that conversation is a book, and at the moment the good offices of your microphone and transmitters, and talk through the question of if you don't want to see the world warm and if you are doing as much as people seem likely to be doing about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, what more are you willing to countenance and how would you like safeguards and good practices built into that? It's certainly true that a lot of the public feels strongly viscerally against. At the same time, my impression, largely anecdotal but also from people who have done a little bit of work on this, is that if you ask publics in developing countries who, after all, face the brunt of climate change in a way that we in Britain really don't, they have a rather different view. They don't necessarily say rush into this, they say but you mean this is a possibility, that we might have ways to cool the planet? Then we should definitely be looking at that because for a country like Jamaica, say, the peak temperatures during the summer and sea surface temperatures that govern hurricane activity are very important things which carbon dioxide emissions reduction in itself is not going to have any effect on for decades to come. Robyn Williams: Okay, where we are sitting is the Royal Society of London, which itself published the statement that these matters should be considered, it should be in the public arena, and a list of possibilities was given. Of the possible ways of reducing the temperature, which are your favourites? Oliver Morton: There are two different general approaches. One is reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by sucking it out in some way. And the other one is reducing the amount of sunlight coming into the atmosphere. And let's concentrate on that second one, on the reducing sunlight because that's the one that gets the heebie-jeebies going. There are really two preliminarily well studied ways of reducing the warming of the Earth by sunlight. One is to thicken the layer of small particles in the stratosphere, which is always naturally there to some extent thanks to the eruption of volcanoes. There is a layer of sulphate particles in the stratosphere that gets much thicker after a big volcanic eruption. The question of thickening it up a little thicker than it is at the moment, that's one possibility. The other one is to work much closer to the surface of the Earth and to brighten layers of low, flat cloud that sit over quite a large amount of the Earth's oceans. And techniques for doing that could be tested experimentally in the fairly near future. Actually next week I'm going to be at a meeting in Potsdam looking at the near term possibilities for experiments in this. I think you kind of have to look at the aerosols in the stratosphere as being your first port of call because volcanic eruptions do give you some sense of what happens globally. Robyn Williams: Especially in 2016 because that's 200 years, plus a little bit, of that vast eruption that really changed the climate of Europe and got rid of the summer. Oliver Morton: Tambora is absolutely spectacular but I have to say, yes, possibly the largest eruption for about 800 years and very large climatic effects, effects on Indian monsoon, effects on the summer in Europe, effects on the summer in the United States, 1800-and-froze-to-death they called it. There were I believe frosts in every one of the 12 calendar months of 1816 in New England. Also incidentally other rather less expected effects like very significant Arctic warming that you see after a large volcanic eruption like this, and that shows us something about how the climate responds, but you have to bear in mind that the amount of material that you would emit to do some geo-engineering in concert with carbon dioxide emissions would be far, far, far less than Tambora. Tambora was a huge big old shock to the Earth system, whereas what you would be hoping to do here would be sort of like a gentle nudge to the Earth system. Robyn Williams: Okay, other examples? For instance, when you are affecting the clouds, is it true that you have a number of ships at sea that would be squirting something up to the sky? Oliver Morton: Because ships are cheaper than planes, the obvious way to do the clouds, or 'obvious' meaning clever people thought about it and decided this was the easiest way, is to use seawater to create tiny little salt particles that would then drift up into the clouds and would make the clouds a little bit brighter and possibly a little bit longer lived. And that's something that could be tested. Actually making the little tiny droplets from which the salt crystals form is quite hard, but there have been various people, including a group of lovely retired Silicon Valley engineers, some of whom used to work on inkjet printers, who've come up with ways that we can try doing that. And so ways of brightening clouds is one possibility. There are other things. For instance, there's a researcher at Bristol in Britain who is interested in making crops a little bit more reflective. At first blush you think that's a bit crazy because crops need to photosynthesise, but they don't need to photosynthesise as much as they would be forced to under the brighter sunlight. And crops really suffer from the very, very hottest days. So if crops that were a little bit more reflective were a little bit cooler, that might give you a real agricultural benefit. That said, if you want to think of something that will raise your heebie-jeebies factor to the power of heebie-jeebie, then genetically modified crops that reflect sunlight more to geo-engineer the planet is probably about as bad as you can get in most people's imagination if you don't mention the word 'nanotechnology'. Robyn Williams: Except perhaps putting mirrors up in the sky, the little ones floating around, or really big ones. Oliver Morton: Really big ones, very, very difficult because, as you will have noticed, really, really big things don't float in the sky, they tend to fall down, that's why they have to have engines, that's very difficult. Putting things into orbit is very, very expensive. But effectively the particles that we talked about that are already up there because of background volcanic eruptions, those particles are little tiny mirrors. You can redesign the mirrors in various ways so that their optical properties differ. So, for instance, sulphur particles tend to spread light out a lot more than they reflect it back out to space. So sulphur particles tend to slightly whiten the sky. It's not very noticeable. I mean, when there was a large volcanic eruption in the 1990s at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, that whitened the sky but not to an extent that most people who weren't astronomers noticed. It reddened sunsets in a way that was quite spectacular and actually rather aesthetically pleasing I thought. But I don't necessarily want to do this for aesthetic reasons. Pinatubo showed us what sulphur does. You could think about other particles. For instance, some people have done studies on what might be done with diamond, what I like to think of as the large unconventional climate intervention or LUCI, the diamond experiment in the sky. What you would actually in the end choose as an aerosol, that's exactly the sort of question that leads to this overarching concern that the work would be done in a way that's safe, just and governable. You need to talk to people about the effects of these things, you need to talk about ways in which the nations of the world and ideally the peoples of the world could come to decisions about how much if any of this they wanted and in what way they wanted it to be done. And those sort of decisions can't come after all the technological work has been done. You don't want to have scientists go off and work out what the best particles are and then have an up or down vote on it, what you want is to have a continuous conversation whereby people enunciate what they need from these processes and then see what is actually doable and have a dialogue between these two different arts of the possible; the political art of the possible and the technological art of the possible. Robyn Williams: Leaving aside the sheer cost, which obviously is going to be fairly monumental... Well, the direct financial costs are very unclear at the moment. It's not that difficult to lift, say, a million tonnes of particles into the stratosphere every year. That's not particularly expensive for developed countries or even for some developing countries. It's not trivial but if you compare it to the cost, say, of nuclear power stations which are part of how Britain is trying to decarbonise itself, those are really expensive. Robyn Williams: Hinkley Point being written about in your own magazine The Economist , billions and billions and billions of dollars, and very fraught discussions about international stand-offs. Oliver Morton: Absolutely. So it's true that geo-engineering programs, especially a geo-engineering program that was properly mounted which would have to have an awful lot of monitoring and close attention being paid to all the effects, that would not be a trivial undertaking. At the same time, decarbonising the economy, as we know, is an incredibly nontrivial undertaking. We live in a world that has contrived to spend $100 billion on a space station, so these are not amounts of money beyond the dreams of man. Robyn Williams: Fair enough. But when you consider the experiments themselves, presumably you would do it in stages while the discussion is going on. You won't do the whole shebang in one go. But can you do it partially? Oliver Morton: You can do some things partially and some things not, and that's a very, very important question. You can work out, for instance, what effect this is going to have on the ozone layer. You can probably do that with relatively small experiments and that's exactly what you would hope to do. Similarly for questions about what effects you might have on the transport of water into the stratosphere, which is an important climatological factor in and of itself. These sort of processes you can probably study not uncontroversially and not easily but on relatively small scale interactions. To actually see the planet probably get warmer slower would require an operation that you would not necessarily fully understand the outcome of when you started. But to some extent that's life, it's something you don't understand the outcome of when you start. But what you can do is try and make sure that people who are affected by this get a voice, that people have a say, that there is a legitimate discussion. And there are great imperfections in the way that climate policy is put together at the moment, but there is at the same time overall a sense that the world has developed in a piecemeal unsatisfactory and stop-and-go sort of way a way of talking about how it deals with the climate. It's not inconceivable to me that we can't find a way of broadening that conversation to include consideration of some of these issues. Robyn Williams: Carbon capture and storage is one of the elements that you mentioned as the first group of possibilities, geo-engineering. And the last time I checked, which was in fact last week, the prospects seem to be more distant than before because the amount of carbon we're putting in the atmosphere is increasing by billions of tonnes. And the amounts that we are doing in carbon capture and storage is just a matter of a few million. So, many people say it's 30 years off, if that. Oliver Morton: Yes, the history of carbon capture and storage is definitely one that has to give you pause if you are talking about geo-engineering, because to some extent there is this issue within the business that is called moral hazard, that if people think that there's going to be geo-engineering they will do less emissions reduction, that if people think they are going to do geo-engineering, they might reduce emissions less. There is another way of looking at it of course which is that if people think they're going to geo-engineering and they aren't very wild about that, they might reduce emissions more. But carbon capture and storage has to some extent basically been used as a way of giving the carbon industries carte blanche because they say, oh yes, we'll do carbon capture and storage at some point but not yet, we will just be carbon capture and storage ready. And as a result we've been talking about carbon capture and storage...I think the IPCC report on it, which was hardly the first word on the subject, was 10 years ago, and we've still seen very, very little of it. So there's an awful lot of...like St Augustine said, make me chaste Lord, but not yet. That tends to be the way people see these things, and that's definitely something you need to worry about. If people talk about geo-engineering simply as a way to avoid doing anything else, that's very bad. The slightly uncomfortable corollary about this is that if you want to talk about geo-engineering you want to talk about seriously doing it in the near to medium term. You don't want to say, oh, let's just do lots and lots of research now and then use it only if there's a big disaster. If there's a big disaster, if there's a climate emergency, that's to some extent the worst time to be doing geo-engineering because you know that everything is already at stake, you know that the Earth system is already working in an unpredictable way, this is not the time to hit it with a hammer. What you want to do is stroke it with a feather earlier on or at least nudge it gently with a soft glove. I'm not quite sure why that is the analogy that comes to mind. But the idea is that geo-engineering should be, if used at all, used sparingly and probably used early, and that's a difficult thing to get your head around. People are much more comfortable, certainly scientists are much more comfortable about studying it on the basis that it will then be put behind a glass panel and used only in emergencies. But emergencies are terrible times for experimentation. Robyn Williams: Oliver Morton. He writes for The Economist magazine, and his new book is called The Planet Remade . The Science Show on RN. And so more physics and back to good news. Good news about bubbles and coffee and tea cups. Storm in a Teacup Helen Czerski: It's not about playing down science. Physics has had an amazing few years for being seen as quantum physics, all the little tiny weird stuff, or cosmology, great big stuff out in the universe you can't see. And actually most of physics is in the middle and no one is talking about it and it winds me up, so I wrote a book about it. And the point about it is that because it's what we call classical physics, so it obeys rules that are slightly less weird than some of the stuff out to the edges, but it's really cool and it's still here and it's important because it affects us. And the wonderful thing about physics, the best thing about physics I think is that the same patterns apply in lots of places. Fundamentally physicists are really lazy but they don't want anyone to know about it. Instead of learning piles and piles of facts, what we do is establish principles, and then the same principle applies in lots and lots of different places. So yes, there is lots of physics laws making the universe go around and doing all that big stuff and all the very tiny stuff, but those same laws are running our everyday world. And something that you see when you spill coffee and you watch what happens to the coffee stain, those principles don't just explain something trivial like a coffee stain, they also explain how insulin tests work, for example, they explain other important things in the world that people need to know about. And it's the same principle, it's brilliant, you only have to learn it once. Robyn Williams: Make that connection then-coffee stains and insulin-how? Helen Czerski: I don't drink coffee but I buy it in order to spill it, which will make me a terrible person in the eyes of lots of coffee enthusiasts. But when you spill coffee you get shapes, sort of blobs, and that's all right, and the important thing is its filled-in, it's effectively coloured in. But if you leave it for a little while...untidy people have a perfect excuse here...and you let it just sit, as it dries out, when you come back a few hours later you'll find that the coffee, instead of direct evidence, what you now have is like a line, like a line around a body, you've got an outline and there's no coffee in the middle. So all the coffee that was inside has somehow moved to the edges. And if you are really bored you can get a time-lapse camera and watch this happening. I have done it, I've drawn teddy bears with it. But there is an important principle here which is that the world of the medium-small operates in a slightly different way. And surface tension and viscosity are really important. So that means the skin, the place where the coffee touches the air is really important. And as coffee dries, because of surface tension and viscosity, coffee evaporates more from the edges than from the middle. And so what's in the middle gets dragged out towards the edges and it takes the coffee with it, and what's left over is this sort of outline. And the reason that matters is that those forces, what surface tension and viscosity do, also can be used in tiny little devices to test blood, for example. And so if you mop up blood with something and that something could be a very clever device, it will suck things up using surface tension and viscosity and you can manipulate them. And so something which is really useful in the modern world has its basis in the same physics as coffee doing something very weird that we see almost every day. Robyn Williams: Sounds beautiful. What about the connection between bubbles, which you know an awful lot about, in the ocean, and the storm in a teacup? Helen Czerski: Bubbles are underappreciated, that's the most important thing to say. I am a bubble physicist but I didn't write a book about bubble physics. The book is called Storm in a Teacup because when you drip milk or cream into tea or coffee and you swirl it, you see these swirls in the top of the coffee cup. And when you look up in the sky and you see swirls in the atmosphere, the rules that cause those two things are similar. So something that you see when you drink something applies to something in the atmosphere. And obviously the scale is a bit different but the fundamental rules that make it all work are the same thing. And so that's why the book is called Storm in a Teacup , it's because things in the everyday world, the mundane things, the things you see around your kitchen also apply to the big world outside. Robyn Williams: But not bubbles in this case? Helen Czerski: There aren't very many bubbles in the book. There are snails that blow bubbles, and there are bubbles on raisins, because if you are bored at parties...I genuinely have done this...or if you are with boring people, it works then too, fish raisins out of the bar snacks, if it's that kind of party, or the deserts or something, and put them in a fizzy drink. The English call it lemonade but it's never had a lemon anywhere near it, but basically fizzy water will do. And what happens is the raisins sink and because they are more dense than the water they grow bubbles and they have basically grown themselves a lifejacket so they float up to the surface and turn themselves over until they've got rid of their bubbles and they sink back down. And this sort of ballet goes on for quite a long time as the bubbles help the gas come out of solution, deliver it to the surface and drop back down. And the reason that is important, apart from it just being cool and good...so basically at a party if you do that, one of two things will happen. You will scare all the boring people away or you will shut them up. And the interesting people will come to you because it works for everybody. But that sort of buoyancy system is what controls...one of the things that controls how the oceans move. So our oceans are an engine that surrounds our planet, they drive lots of what we see in everyday life, and that simple principle of more dense things sinking and less dense things rising drives the oceans. And you can demonstrate it with raisins and lemonade. Robyn Williams: Isn't that delightful! What made you choose certain subjects and not others? There's a lot of history and culture in this. So there are things that happened to me and my friends. In fact I genuinely did build a trebuchet to throw rubber boots once, and I genuinely did do the raisins and lemonade thing in front of my family at a party, those things have happened to me. And then there's bits of history and culture. For example, Hawaiian kings and queens surfed, and surfing was very important to their culture. So I talk about the physics of that a little bit. And I picked things because they were varied and interesting, and most of them have had some connection with. So I paddle outrigger canoes, for example, which your audience will be more familiar with than anyone listening in Britain. We look at the waves and we pay a lot of attention to the ocean's surface, and there's a culture that goes with that, so I've already part of that culture a little bit. And some of it was just fun things I found out along the way. The point was they had to demonstrate the principle. And there's so many things to choose from. You take a principle, like the idea that the world of the middling-small, like a coffee stain, has rules that it tends to obey, and they are slightly different from the rules where we are, where gravity dominates everything, and you just look out into the world and you start to see it everywhere. And the best thing about this book so far has been people have read it and they say, oh, is that why this happens, is that why this happens, and that's the sort of click because it means they've seen the pattern and now they've seen it they will see it in other places. That's the important idea, is that people are already familiar with these things, they just haven't laid the pattern on top. Robyn Williams: One of the things that really excited me about this is that not only is it interesting to know about everyday life and what surrounds you and you can see physics in virtually everything, when you turn the lights on, the minute you put your bum on the sofa and recognise gravity, but people were really struck tremendously by gravitational waves, by Higgs bosons and all those various things. Obviously space landings and suchlike. But the detail of what is being found, I think the public is grossly underestimated in this sense, and what I can see happening is what you're writing about will lead to a greater understanding, even these bigger bits. I think that's your ambition, is it not? Helen Czerski: That's right, and gravitational waves are still waves. In fact I was very glad because after the discovery I had to go back and take out a couple of sentences which said they hadn't been discovered yet. But the physical principle of how a wave moves, it's the same, it's a wave. The other thing I think scientists don't talk enough about is the perspective that knowing this stuff gives you. It is functional and it is really cool, but there is a change in perspective on the world because you start to see these things and you become less helpless and I think at the moment often science education leaves people feeling helpless because it seems like there's complicated stuff over there and I don't understand it and my toaster is broken and I don't know what to do about it. But just knowing a little bit about those patterns means that you don't feel helpless, you can look out into the world and you go, okay, I don't know why that's happened but I do know that gravity works like this and surface tension works like this. So the last chapter of the book is about the perspective on the world that you have when you know just a little bit of science. It's a wonderful thing to have. I take it for granted and I've only just realised how much I take it granted. And so I hope that that last chapter gives people confidence that it's not just a pile of facts, that you can look out, and the wonderful thing is that these patterns are everywhere, and now you know how the world works. Robyn Williams: A final question, how do you balance what you do, which is straight physics in the University College London, with being on telly? In fact several of your series have been out in Australia, one not least about the super senses of animals which we in fact talked about on The Science Show before. And slightly a long time after our interview, the series was on I think last year. The balance between the kinds of things you have to do on television and the sort of discipline you need when you go and work in physics in the lab? Helen Czerski: There is actually a lot of discipline involved in both, and both are all about precision. That's not obvious on the TV stuff often because what I'm being precise about is first of all being myself, which is sort of slightly bonkers and interested in things, and just poking stuff, not animals with sharp teeth but other things. There's a lot of precision in choosing what to say and how to say it. And I care about communication, I care about words, because the English language is so rich and you can convey points in such a variety of ways and there's a real beauty in doing that precision and how you use language and how you pick the bits to communicate. So most of my job as a TV presenter isn't actually standing in front of the camera saying the words, it's the thinking beforehand about exactly what is the point, and really understanding everything that is going on and being able to say this is the hierarchy of what you need to know, and this is the context, so pulling out the massive landscape, the bit that says this is the thing that will set up the picture. And it's all about clear thinking, and it's the same in science, it's all about clear thinking, it's about being able to look at a landscape of lots of complicated things and say this is the bit that's going to take us somewhere else. So there is actually the same precision and discipline involved in both, it's just one of them involves being a communicator more and the other one involves patience with experiments a bit more, but it's the same game. Robyn Williams: Thank you very much and congratulations. Helen Czerski: Thank you. Robyn Williams: Dr Helen Czerski. Her book Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life And so to our PhD for this week. She's got one, but was a star at Falling Walls in Canberra. Ellen Moon from Southern Cross University in Lismore. Heavy metal contamination of soil and water is responsible for one in every 35 deaths worldwide. That's 1.5 million people per year or the same number that die from AIDS related illnesses. The majority of those people live in the developing world where pipe leaching, urban run-off and poor industrial practice lead to water contaminated with heavy metals like lead and cadmium. Current water treatment technologies are expensive and they are beyond the reach of poor or isolated communities. We need a cheap and sustainable solution that communities can produce and use themselves to remove heavy metals from water before they drink it or use it for agriculture. We believe that solution is bioabsorption, using biological materials that have a natural capacity to remove heavy metals from water thanks to their surface properties. Current research into bioabsorption tends to focus on a single material with a single metal and comparing them to see which works best. This trial and error approach is inefficient and time-consuming and may focus on the bioabsorbents that aren't available to particular communities. Our approach is different. We combine techniques from the fields of plant science, geochemistry, and chemical engineering to gain a molecular level understanding of how locally available bioabsorbents actually work. Take, for example, the loofah gourd. It grows really well in Nigeria, and when you try it you are left with a fibrous structure that has an enormous surface area. Because of this we've identified it as a potential bioabsorbent candidate for use in rural Nigeria. But how do we go about making it as efficient as possible? The first step is to characterise the chemistry of the surface. We need to know which functional groups are present on the surface and in what concentrations. We also need to understand the chemistry of the water. What species do our metals of interest occur in? Next we need to understand the relationship between those metal species and the water and the chemistry of the surface, so which groups bind which metals and under which conditions. Finally we put all of this information into a model and use it to predict the best conditions for maximum metal removal from water without the need for any further lab experiments. This is an intelligent, efficient optimisation of the system. So our molecular level approach to bioabsorption has the potential to revolutionise water treatment for poor or isolated communities. We provide them with a method to manage their own water treatment using the kind of materials that they can grow themselves. So by breaking the wall of sustainable water treatment we have the potential to save 1.5 million lives per year. Thank you. Question: Thank you very much for that. A lot of these guys don't have reticulated water, in Nigeria and places. Can you see a way whereby the water sources they do have can be suitably treated? They are very diffuse quite often. Ellen Moon: The way we are thinking about this technology at the moment is that you would need to collect your water in a tank or have it in some form of pipe to be able to apply this technology, so that's a really good point and that's something that we should definitely go away and think about, how we might apply it in that sort of situation as well. Question: How much water do you think one of those loofahs can treat? Ellen Moon: Well, there's two ways of looking at it. You can potentially see it as a reusable resource because it doesn't take very difficult chemistry. Once you take the metals up onto the loofah, it's then quite easy to treat it to remove those metals back off and recycle it essentially, so you are not always reliant on growing more and more plants. So that's one way of maximising its use. But we can also think of it from the perspective of once you've got that metal then that's a potential resource for these communities as well, so they may wish to either sell on the loofah gourds that are loaded with metals to mining companies, for example, who might wish to reprocess them. So yes, it kind of depends on whether you are thinking about it as a recyclable tool or as a single use kind of thing. Robyn Williams: I may be far too old but I seem to remember at your university there was a scheme using red mud. In other words, the material left over from mining itself, and the water was taking up the metals. Is that still going? Ellen Moon: I believe there is still research into those areas. We had a talk earlier that was looking at how you might apply industrial waste to water treatment. And those are absolutely fantastic, particularly in the developed world, I think there is a desperate need for that kind of thing. But in the developing world, we've really got to look for things that communities can produce and use themselves, and that's where I think these plant materials, these bioabsorbent materials are really crucial. Robyn Williams: Ellen Moon at Falling Walls in Canberra. And in Berlin on the 9th the international final of Falling Walls. We'll keep you posted. And finally pigs and pineapples, a topic we've neglected so far in The Science Show . I'm with Rob Pike of La Trobe. Now, there are some things in research that don't seem very likely, and the idea of giving pineapples to pigs, what made you think of that? Robert Pike: I would love to be able to say that it was me who thought of it, but in actual fact it's an old story whose time has come round again. So it's actually not the fruit, I just want to make sure that everybody understands it's not the fruit, it's actually an extract of the stems. And it was actually thought up by Tracey\'c2 Mynott who is\'c2 Chief Scientific Officer at Anatara Lifesciences in Brisbane. And she found out doing her PhD at La Trobe 30 years ago that this prevented diarrhoea in piglets. Then people weren't very interested because they were using antibiotics. Robyn Williams: Why do piglets get diarrhoea? Robert Pike: So when they transfer from the milk from their mum they then start eating solid food, it's not necessarily the nicest food, let's just say, so they get sick. The first few times that they eat solid food, a fair proportion, up to 50% of them, get pretty sick. Robyn Williams: Legend has it that pigs can eat anything. Robert Pike: Yes, once they get used to it. So I think at the beginning it takes them a little time to actually get into that sort of space where they can. Up to 50% of them get severe diarrhoea and die, without intervention. Robyn Williams: Die of water loss or what? Robert Pike: Yes, pretty much. The main effect of diarrhoea, the main reason a living being dies is because of water loss. But we are actually trying to start working on the purified molecules. Robyn Williams: So you are adapting it and looking at the serious science behind it. Robert Pike: Yes. Robyn Williams: How far have you got so far? Robert Pike: We think we know what the main ingredient is that actually does all of the good work, as it were. And basically we've got the molecular structure of that, so we know what it looks like, and we've then been trying to work out what...so it's actually not known what it does to the human or pig cells to actually have this effect. So we are actually trying to really work out exactly what molecule on the surface of our cells it actually targets in order to have the effect that it has. Robyn Williams: Or it might have an effect on the microflora perhaps? Robert Pike: We think that's unlikely. This is why this actually links to antibiotic resistance, is because it's a new way of thinking about getting antibacterials out onto the market where we don't target the actual bacteria because that causes the antibiotic resistance, especially if you target growth of the bacteria. You know, they send little missiles out at our cells, so we are either targeting the missiles or we are trying to put shields up around our cells so we don't get hit by the missiles, if that's a reasonable analogy to make. Those are the things that we are looking at, and by not targeting the bacteria we think we may have a lesser chance of gendering the antibiotic resistance that is obviously a massive problem right now. Robyn Williams: It certainly is, yes. And the amazing thing is more and more figures are coming out that, especially in America, the antibiotics given to stock and chickens and suchlike are not really doing anything very much at all. There is an increase in growth but it doesn't sustain. So it's a gigantic waste of millions and millions of dollars and millions and millions of tonnes of antibiotics. Robert Pike: And causing huge public health problems at the same time. There has been quite a few fantastic articles, and this is one of the reasons why I think La Trobe is quite a special environment to do this work is because we've not only got my institute, which is obviously looking at the molecular side, we've got AgriBio, which is doing research in that. And so we have a chance to maybe do something in both the human and the animal populations at the same time, and thereby a lot of people say that's the only way that we are going to have a massive effect on this whole problem, rather than just going, oh, we are going to solve it in humans, and just leave these stock animals, as you quite rightly say, in the same sort of production mode as we always have. Robyn Williams: Is Australia's record as bad then as America's? Robert Pike: I believe it's pretty bad, but I think we follow many of the same practices. Robyn Williams: So if your research goes well, what do you hope might be achieved? Robert Pike: Well, I think basically production of molecules which ameliorate the disease, and in particular what we are really looking at is switching off the mechanisms that bacteria take advantage of in order to infect us. So often they are eliciting a response from us which feeds them. So if we can stop that effect so that we are no longer feeding them, they will just tend to go away. So what we'd hope is that we could get molecules that are effective for different diseases, and there will be probably one for every bacterial inspired disease, solve the problem without causing resistance to antibacterials. Robyn Williams: Yes, and leading the good bacteria that we want. Robert Pike: That's another very important point. It's really turning out that our microbiome is so important to our health. When you put antibiotics in that just kill absolutely everything, you're not only having that potentially engendering antibiotic resistance but probably affecting our own health. And the effects are quite startling. Even our psychology, our moods and all sorts of things are apparently affected at least somewhat by our microbiome. Robyn Williams: It's quite amazing, isn't it, what has come out, yes. Robert Pike: It is absolutely amazing. Robyn Williams: Health Report saying, look, I didn't believe this at first but the evidence is overwhelming. Robert Pike: Robyn Williams: They do, 10 times more. Robert Pike: Yes. Robyn Williams: Dr Rob Pike is the director of the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science. And production for The Science Show today by David Fisher and Tim Jenkins. Next week, diamonds in the sky.

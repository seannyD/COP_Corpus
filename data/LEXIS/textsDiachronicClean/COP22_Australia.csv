I travelled economy class on all flights during the trip, and the entire cost of my trip totalled less than $8000. At COP22, the ACT was acknowledged by delegates, jurisdictions and country representatives for its leadership on climate action and was congratulated on its target of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2020. As a small jurisdiction we are punching far above our weight.""However, it is important that the ACT ensures that other countries are also addressing climate change with the urgency required, so we must work with other world leaders and have representation on the international stage.""Mr Johnston said the minister should direct his efforts closer to home. ""The ACT government needs to focus on the delivery of services for all including the disabled rather than expensive travel and big noting itself on the world stage,"" he said.""Mr Rattenbuy needs to explain what value ACT ratepayers received from the trip.""Mr Johnston said the minister's directorate resisted his FOI request and failed to acknowledge it in the 14-day required timeframe.""The ACT government needs to lift its game in processing FOI requests,"" he said.""There is a need for Mr Rattenbury as the responsible minister to ensure good administration and that his agency takes its FOI responsibilities seriously, with all requests being processed in a timely, efficient and effective manner in accordance with the legislation.""Shadow environment minister Elizabeth Lee said the right of a citizen to make an FOI request was ""a fundamental aspect of open government"".""If we have directorates and ministers being lax in their duty to respond to FOI requests, it puts at risk our right to a transparent and accountable government.\l"

""This is costing Australian jobs, particularly in regional areas and deterring significant domestic and international investment."" He said he spoke to US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist, for about an hour at a one-on-one meeting where he raised the issue among a range of subjects.Mr Frydenberg (pictured) said he stressed to Dr Moniz that Australia had an ""effective and rigorous"" approval process and placed a large number of strict conditions on the Queensland mine's approval.The leaked Podesta emails sparked renewed debate on the charitable status of green groups that engage in political activism, or whether groups could be for-ced to reveal how the donations are spent.\l"

The pair were the only Australians to have an event selected as part of the COP15 official cultural calendar.Now the Great Barrier Reef is in more danger than ever due to the recent mass coral bleaching event, destroying more than 1000km of reef as a result of climate change.It is timely then, that Ms Houston and Ms Richter's film AQUA is again screened. AQUA was the brainchild of Ms Houston and was produced by Ms Richter with their production company Wish Bone Films, on the Far South Coast. Fusing the Emmy award-winning underwater cinematography of David Hannan with the percussive beats of one of Europe's biggest dance acts ' Safri Duo ' it tells the history of the Great Barrier Reef, without words. AQUA aimed to inspire government leaders to reduce carbon emissions, activate community support, and build better conservation practices on the reef. It was sponsored by Pyramid Power, the Australian Embassy in Copenhagen, the University of Copenhagen and many other local businesses and community members.It also screened at Parliament House Canberra, Screen Australia studios Sydney, and locally to schools and the community in the Bega Valley. In Copenhagen, the film screened with Safri Duo playing live to the film. According to the two Bega Valley women, it was quite an experience.On Sunday, May 15, AQUA will screen as part of the Monthly Community Doco program at The Butter Factory in Cobargo.From 3.30pm, Toni Houston and Bettina Richter will present AQUA, as well as a mini documentary made about their trip to Copenhagen.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia10","Cities and consumers are done with grids","March 21, 2017 Tuesday","Australian Financial Review","Traditional energy grids are on the way out as cities and consumers use new technology to reshape our networks, Arup's Mike Straughton says.The hunger for energy first put King Island, in Australia's Bass Strait, on European maps.It was discovered in 1799 by sailors hunting seals for fur and their oil, which was a top fuel for lighting back then.Just like its discovery more than two centuries ago, humanity's thirst for energy is putting King Island on the map again.The community is on the way to becoming one of the first 100 per cent renewable communities in the nation and is at the forefront of Australia's energy revolution.Hydro Tasmania set up an $18.25 million off-power plant combining solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage technology back in 2012 with the aim of providing up to 65 per cent of the island's energy needs to cut the annual cost of running expensive diesel generators by $4.5 million.Mike Straughton, principal at global engineering consultant Arup, sees the King Island project as a possible future path for energy on the mainland - decentralised grids, powered by a mix of renewables, servicing smaller geographical areas.Straughton says our current national power grids solely using large centralised power stations can't cope with demand any more and are on the way out.""Essentially the power grid is like a water system - if you have too much water going in there's a problem and if there's too much suck on the pipe, there's a problem, too,"" he says.He says consumers are fed-up with high power bills and the ongoing political deadlock and inaction over energy policy at the state and federal levels.Straughton says we can use new technology and renewables now to redesign our grids to conserve energy and cut costs into the futureRapid advances in batteries and battery-like technologies, he says, are already available to store unused energy during off-peak periods and pump it back into grids during the peaks.He says large-scale batteries will soon be cost-effective to roll out on a larger scale, and in the meantime solutions like pumped hydroelectric schemes can help us store energy.Pumped hydro-electric schemes can use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water uphill into a reservoir.When consumer demand picks up again in the afternoon peak the reservoir's sluice gates open to release that water back over turbines to generate hydropower.So solar energy produced in the off-peak period is not lost, but stored like it is in a battery.Straughton says there's also a growing number of people using electric cars, which are effectively mobile batteries that could be used to store energy.He says electric cars could return power unused while driving back to your home during peak demand periods.Homes could then recharge your electric car during off-peak times overnight when power is cheaper and demand lower.Smart electricity meters in our homes will also be able to read what's going on with demand in the wider grid and potentially turn off electrical appliances during demand surges.Rising power costs are driving consumers towards individual renewables energy like solar panels as well, he says, which further drives down costs.Straughton says many households are also becoming ""prosumers"", consumers who also produce power, which they can sell back to the grid.He says prosumers will be able to sell their excess power to other consumers, via apps, during demand peaks. ""We could be selling excess power to our neighbours in just a few years' time,"" he says.The end-game of all this change is that national and state government involvement in energy is now much less important, he says.Increasingly, cities and towns have the power to forge ahead by themselves and set the direction of their own energy policy and redesign their systems.Straughton says aside from the financial benefits, technology and collaboration can potentially solve a very serious global problem - climate change.The historic 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris agreed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C by 2050.He says that realistically, cities and smaller communities are now the only entities that can really lead the way, but they have until 2020 to work out how they're going to do it.""We know cities and individuals really want to do the right thing,"" he says.""We only really have three years left to put plans into action if we want to limit the temperature rises.""\l"

After 2060 it accelerates.''Eurobodalla Shire and Shoalhaven councils have adopted sea level rise scenarios of RCP 6.Gosford has adopted RCP 8.5.The majority of other NSW councils have adopted projections for sea level rise using the benchmarks of the State Government from 2009 - 40cm by 2050 and 90cm by 2100.These benchmarks have since by dropped by the State Government and councils have been encouraged to adopt their own benchmarks based on the best possible information.A report by council staff recommended that Sutherland Shire Council adopt the higher level scenario of RCP8.5RCP8.5 represents the scenario that most accurately reflects actual emissions growth observed in the last eight years, a council report said.But Cr Croucher moved to adopt RPC 6.'I think we are making a very responsible decision. We can change our position as the science becomes better.''

Among them is New Zealand, said Jos Delbeke, director-general for climate action at the Commission.He said meetings last month with officials in China had shown him a will by Beijing to potentially link with the EU system.Such a move, although only likely in the longer term, would be ""a significant first step"" toward an international trading system, putting a global price on carbon, said Mr Delbeke, who is one of the architects of the EU's emissions trading system.""Even if prices are moderate, that would be a hugely important signal for the world if that would take shape,"" he said in an interview in Brussels.His comments come as China positions itself to become a global leader on climate change after the US election of sceptic Donald Trump as president last week. During the campaign Mr Trump vowed to ""cancel"" the Paris climate change accord reached last year.He has also promised in his first 100 days in office to lift restrictions on the extraction of oil, gas and ""clean coal"", while cancelling ""billions in payments to UN climate change programs"".Mr Delbeke said he had never backed the idea that a ""top down"" international carbon trading system established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change would work.Rather, because setting up an ETS is a political decision that needs to be carried out in accordance with domestic politics and legal structures, a ""bottom-up"" approach was better.Such an approach has been applied in China, where seven pilot carbon trading systems are set to be developed into a nationwide system next year, resulting in a carbon market that by 2020 will be double the size of Europe's.""I'm a strong defender of this bottom-up approach and I think we are getting somewhere in doing that,"" he said.Mr Delbeke said he expected to have further talks with New Zealand about a potential linkage with the EU ETS system, while similar discussions have been held with South Korea and Canada.""One day we hope to talk again to Australia,"" he said, noting talks had been dropped after Australia abandoned its carbon pricing mechanism. However, the recent ratification of the Paris climate accord could put the topic back on the agenda.""We worked very hard with Australia at a certain point in time because there was an Australian ETS in the making and then it was not pursued any longer,"" Mr Delbeke said.""[But] in the context of the implementation of the Paris agreement, there may be a good context to revive the debate with the Australian authorities.""The EU's ETS has suffered an oversupply of emissions credits in recent years, which has kept prices too low to be of much influence on the energy mix. Mr Delbeke, however, said he still believed a market-based ETS was the best way of reducing emissions.He said that while Europe's prices had been ""relatively low"" compared with expectations, in other schemes around the world the price was converging at about $US10 a tonne.Measures are being considered to address the surplus of permits in the EU, which arose from the decl"

""Nothing, except that people are favourably disposed towards you. You're not being elected. You haven't got the power to become prime minister. The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't!""It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium."" A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter.""Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No."" Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator.As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger.Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being apart from astronauts, and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning.What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered.Attenborough observes that: ""I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off until they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf."" By contrast, he continues, ""I'm fantastically lucky.""I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things."" Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history program, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations. That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world.""Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'. ""But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of puffer fish and peacock spiders prove.""There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out."" The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain.""Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied, quite beyond our comprehension.""But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did.""That is something natural history TV programs can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it."" He adds that ""these programs have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution'?"" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year.""It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do.""I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand.""\l"

The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't!""It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium."" A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter. ""It's a national scandal."" They say you should never meet your heroes, but I'm delighted to have met this one. In person, Attenborough is exactly the way you'd hope he would be: charismatic, compelling and charming.Eruptions of jollity such as the one above punctuate our hour together. At one point, he reflects on the fact that both he and the Queen are 90 this year. ""Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No."" Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator.As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger.Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being - apart from astronauts - and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning.What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered.Attenborough observes that: ""I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where, after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off until they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf."" By contrast, he continues, ""I'm fantastically lucky. I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things."" Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history program, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations.That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world. ""Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'.""But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. ""Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of pufferfish and peacock spiders prove. There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out."" The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain.""Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied - quite beyond our comprehension.""But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did.""That is something natural history TV programs can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it."" He adds that, ""These programs have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution'?"" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year.""It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do.""I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand."" Attenborough has long since passed the age when most of us would be reaching for the pipe and slippers. However, as he prepares to make more documentaries, including Planet Earth 2, he shudders at the very word 'retirement'.""You never tire of the natural world. Putting your feet up is all very well..."" casting me one last smile, Attenborough concludes: ""but it's very boring, isn't it?""\l"

It will take some time. Regardless, it remains in Australia's national interest to build on climate and clean energy action and push forward with the Paris agreement. The climate risks and clean technology opportunities for Australia have been noted by the bipartisan parliamentary treaties committee. Nothing has changed to affect ministers Julie Bishop and Josh Frydenberg's statement that the Paris agreement is in our national interest. The current forces that are driving transformation in the electricity sector remain unchanged. If anything, the risks have just become greater as the politics become more volatile. Australia and other countries must continue to implement the commitments they made in Paris. This is the only way to protect Australia's long-term interests. The extent of impact on global climate action of a Trump presidency will depend on a number of factors,\~including the resolve of other countries, investors and the state governments within the USA. This does not mean the Paris climate agreement falls. The agreement came into force last Friday and,\~even if the US could withdraw,\~there would still be enough countries with enough of a proportion of global emissions for it to continue. Article 28 of the agreement stipulates, after coming into force,\~no country can withdraw for three years and then must give 12 months' notice. It appears Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress could forge a workaround by withdrawing from the agreement's governing UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. But this is no small step; it is a convention ratified by former\~Republican president,\~George Bush Sr. The essential drivers that led to the Paris agreement remain in place. The agreement is the result of the robust international co-operation to address the climate threat that has changed the global economy in the past decade. Renewables have\~overtaken coal in global electricity capacity. Electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry. Jobs are being created in clean sectors faster than any other. This is the case in the US and every other major economy. Additionally, the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4 underscored the scale of that commitment and the ongoing momentum in the process. [ HYPERLINK http://www.crikey.com.au/https://www.crikey.com.au/2016/11/08/unfccc-morocco-climate-conference-kicks-off/Even rain can't stop the parade on day one of Morocco climate conference] At home, Trump has pledged to dismantle and defund clean energy programs and massively curtail,\~if not abolish,\~the Environment Protection Authority. The extent to which he follows through is uncertain. But it is important to recognise that,\~for some time,\~significant leadership has been exercised by states like California,\~and this will continue. Even in conservative strongholds, such as Texas and North Carolina, Republicans are embracing clean energy industries that promise major new investment and job creation. In 2015, the clean energy industry brought $6.96 billion to North Carolina, boasting more than 26,000 full time jobs, 3150 of which were created in 2015 alone. In Texas, the heartland of oil and gas, more than 100,000 people are now working in the renewables sector. It is also important to recognise that investors have now become significantly more sophisticated in their approach to the climate challenge's physical and policy risks. Few would invest in high-emissions. long-lived infrastructure, which would typically have 40-year lifespans. There is no question a Trump presidency could wreak significant damage on domestic and global climate efforts,\~but that\~need not be fatal. Much will depend on the extent to which other countries strengthen their resolve and carry on. Much will depend on the way other countries engage with a Trump administration,\~who will need to recognise that climate diplomacy is now integrated into\~economic and security international relations. Australia has a particular responsibility here. The US-Australian partnership was one of the few, if not the only, partnerships to be unscathed by Trump during the campaign. Australia should engage and counsel against drastic moves. Australia should signal its seriousness by pressing on with the ratification of the Paris agreement and its 2017 review of climate policies and consideration of post-2030 targets. Bishop and Frydenberg have stated that the agreement is in Australia's national interest,\~and the bipartisan Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended ratification just last Monday. In this time of massive uncertainty,\~and with its enduring partnership, Australia needs to step forward in its engagement with a Trump administration on climate and clean energy. But, just as importantly, Australia needs to send clearer signals that the only way to deliver on the commitments made in Paris is to push on with the modernisation and decarbonisation of our energy system and economy.

"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia33","Even rain can't stop the parade on day one of Morocco climate conference","November 8, 2016 Tuesday 11:38:41 GMT","Crikey","ABSTRACTThe Morocco climate talks have kicked off, and the stakes couldn't be higher, writes Climate Institute CEO John Connor.FULL TEXTWhat I didn't expect on the first morning of the Marrakech, Morocco, climate talks was that it would be cold and wet. But that didn't dampen the festive opening of this the 22nd annual meeting of nations party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The festivities were because it was also the first meeting since last December's Paris agreement, under which, unlike its predecessor the Kyoto Protocol, all countries committed to make contributions to help achieve global net zero emissions, limit global warming to 1.5-2.o degrees, and to build greater climate resilience. Normally staid diplomats were invited to wave LED-lit images of the sun at the centre stage on which luminaries gathered around an inflated planet with a Mr Happy face upon it. Members of a percussion band beat their drums as they danced among the assembled diplomats and politicians from over 190 nations. In adjacent purpose-built massive tents, many countries were setting up not just their offices but also pavilions to showcase their efforts, sell their technologies and attract investors. These are meetings not just of diplomats, but also of leading businesses and investors that come to these gatherings to track progress and lobby politicians. China and the US had high-tech displays. Japan had an electrified track with model very-fast trains and trams coursing past homes with solar roofs and hills bedecked with wind turbines. India bedazzled with a Bollywood-style glitzy presentation. Korea, Thailand, and European and African nations and more had traditional and interactive electronic displays strutting their stuff. It is easy to get cynical at such displays but, as well as the real business interests at stake, it has been a gruelling multi-decadal journey of grinding diplomacy to get to this point. Bitter divisions and recriminations had marked the last effort to get a universal agreement in Copenhagen in 2009. There we saw what international shirt-fronting really looked like as the US and China butted up against each other, and prime minister Kevin Rudd famously described the latter as rat fornicators -- or words to that effect. Since 2009, reassessment of national interests in climate action and pollution reduction, by them and others, led the US and China to form a durable and active diplomatic partnership. Mounting investor and financial regulator unease at growing climate costs and the increasing affordability of cleaner technologies also helped tip the scales in Paris for an outcome that, though not perfect, is worthy of celebration. As the sun broke through in the afternoon, negotiators were getting down to the hard work of creating the more detailed rules and processes that will drive the higher-level commitments made in the Paris agreement. The aim is to develop common rules for transparency and accountability, to be in place by 2018, as some of the machinery to ratchet up action and ambition agreed to in Paris kicks in. This won't be easy. Among other challenges, it will test the willingness of developing countries to allow others to review or assess their efforts. And what of Australia? Our representatives are keeping a more discrete shopfront with an office tucked away at the very back of our hall. But Australia will be in the spotlight on Saturday when recent efforts and promises under the Kyoto Protocol will be tested under processes, for now only limited to developed economies, but which serve a model for all under the Paris agreement. The little ray of sunshine I did get this morning was that the cross-party parliamentary committee considering the Paris agreement had tabled its report recommending Australia join the 100 countries who have ratified to date. This clears the way for Foreign Minister Julie Bishop or Minister for Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg to formally do so when they arrive next week. Australia's ratification would be welcome, but the work of developing credible policies to help achieve the net zero emissions objective lies ahead. Fortunately, the government has long committed to review climate policies and to consider a post-2030 target in 2017. Here's where the sun really needs to shine in, because Australia and other countries will need far greater actions than those promised before Paris if they are to really help achieve the objectives of the agreement they forged in the French capital. The latest independent assessment released on the eve of the Marrakech meeting had the world still heading to a much more dangerous, costly and warmer world than that committed to in Paris. That assessment also found that Australia's current 2030 commitment would result in only Saudi Arabia and Russia being higher in pollution per person. That's a risky position when most other countries are pursuing their, and frankly our, interests in building a more resilient, net zero emissions global economy as soon as possible.

The Science BasedTargets program encourages companies to commit to specific targets for cuttingtheir CO2emissions, while the Global Alliance for Energy Productivity againstclimate change is an international alliance seeking to enhance energy intensitylevels. Joining both of these initiatives reinforces Legrand's track record ofcommitting to limit the environmental impact of its business.(Logo: HYPERLINK http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277386LOGOhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277386LOGO )\~\~\~\~At the heart of the CSR approach\~\~\~\~Legrand has for long been committed to preserving the environment, one ofthe cornerstones of the Group's\~\~CSR commitment. This responsible approach hasenabled it to reduce its energy footprint by over 7% in two years, between 2013and 2015, while every year since 2011, Legrand has disclosed its carbonfootprint. The Group further intends to begin gradually factoring the price ofa tonne of carbon dioxide into its operational decision-making process,especially as regards capital expenditure.

After that, a hot world of +4 or +5 degrees becomes almost unavoidable.The US election result has gifted the sedate pace of climate action from Paris COP22 with a fresh urgency as, around the world, people wake up to the brutal fact that if they wait for government action then hell will not freeze over but engulf the planet in a conflagration that will consume their children and grandchildren.Waiting for governments to agree on the necessity of saving civilisation is, in a phrase, a mug's game. Their hearts aren't in it, and there are far too many juicy bribes and sinecures for individual politicians not to mention political parties paid off by the coal lobby to posture and then sit on their hands.If Trump and his ilk are to be stopped from their headlong, selfish pursuit of planetary devastation, it will be by the people of the planet - not the institutions or politicians. Here's how.Go greenNot even Trump can defy world market reality. The one thing that can destroy the price and profitability of coal, oil and gas is low-cost renewable energy. As they well know - hence all the campaigns against wind turbines and solar farms. Put solar on your home, support your city or local government in taking your community off grid. Invest in tidal, wave, geothermal and the new energies to balance the power supply. Resources companies have the option to go green themselves - they just don't want to. They will end up with stranded assets and bankrupt, like many US coal majors already are.Divest nowDon't put your life savings into anything that might destroy your grandkids. It's not a formula for human survival. Ethical and green investment services are mushrooming. Concerned citizens can compel their bank, super fund, university, local government etc to invest ethically by demanding accountability, including divestment in fossil fuels - and by shifting their accounts. In the Trump years, there will be massive global divestment by hundreds of millions in the source of the greatest hazard facing humanity.Sue the bastardsThough they may look like pinpricks for now, there is a rolling wave of lawsuits around the world against their governments for failing in their duty of care, and against the oil and coal majors for risking human lives and destroying the environment. Every lawsuit adds to the sovereign risk of investing in fossil fuels - and scares other, less ethical, investors. Shrewd investment analysts are already advising their clients to bail out of fossils, and there's not a darn thing Trump and his acolytes can do to stop it.ProtestMany people still underestimate the power, in a social media age, of peaceful citizens' protests to change minds, values and perceptions within communities and countries.

The Mt Garnet community built its 25m pool in 1983 after seven years of fundraising. The push for a pool started because of the drowning of a local child in a creek.Much of the digging equipment, labour and some funds were provided by Oakbridge, the company that ran Tableland Tin Dredge.It was finally opened to the public in October 1988.For 20 years, the local pool committee ran and financed the pool, but, after the death of long-term manager Gordon Green and with a dwindling town population, it became a struggle to keep it open.In recent years, the council took responsibility, but, because of a lack of qualified volunteers with bronze medallions, the pool had only been available to children during school hours for learn-to-swim classes.It is a great facility for our small town and we appreciate TRC's commitment. PS: Thanks as well to TRC for the great Christmas banners and our first council Christmas tree.HEATHER PAYNE, Mount GarnetTRIBUTE TO SCIENTIST THE centenary year of Aleksandr Prokorov is drawing to a close. He has been celebrated in his birthplace and in Butchers Creek where he began his education. His parents had escaped Tsarist Russia's sentence to Siberia and in 1912 came to Australia settling in ""Little Siberia"" where other Russian families lived.His father became naturalised in 1915 perhaps to avoid detention during World War I, because he was on the wrong side again.In July 1916, Aleksandr was born, the youngest of four and the only boy. Einstein's observation that ""stimulated emission"" could be possible is dated to 1917 a year after Aleksandr was born, and whose future research was to make Einstein's observation a reality.The Prokorov family suffered tragedy in 1921 when Clara, the eldest child, died from pneumonia. Soon after Clara's death the family returned to Russia after 12 years in Australia.All his life, Aleksandr is quoted as saying that his first seven years in Australia shaped his life.His research and inventions with other scientists certainly changed millions of lives.Between the MASER and LASERs all the way to scanners and fibre optics, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1964 and received awards and decorations all his life.The Physics Institute in Moscow is now named for him. He died in 2002 and his desk is exactly as he left it, a tribute to the great scientist.Aleksandr is Queensland's first Nobel Laureate and this year his achievements were celebrated at Butchers Creek school on the centenary.Three lectures were given - one in JCU in Cairns, one at Butcher's Creek School and another in Atherton by scientists from Australia's National University and Questacon in Canberra.An article, ""Queensland's First Nobel Laureate"", on Aleksandr has been circulated to government, universities, and education departments, he has received real recognition for the first time in Australia the land of his birth on the Atherton Tablelands.IRENE SHANKS, MareebaDOCTORS THANKED I WOULD like to pass on a big thankyou to Dr Chris Earl, Dr Dan Caines and all the team at the Alice Street Medical centre along with the caring staff at the Atherton public hospital. They all provided excellent care for my daughter Amitie recently.Dr Earl and Dr Caines especially showed compassion and concern for her and made sure she had the best medical attention.I really appreciated this as it put both my and my husband's mind at ease. Her health is now great. But we desperately need a new hospital. DOMINIQUE MAIDMENT, TolgaDEVELOPMENT CONCERNS YUNGABURRA residents are concerned about the plan for Preliminary Approval and Development Permit (PA/15/0059E) before Tablelands Regional Council.The plan of the proposed estate can be seen attached fence along Williams Ave and Tinaburra Drive.There are many other residents who may be unaware of the proposed development of 172 housing allotments in this location.With the severe water shortage to the town's water supply drawn from Tinaburra, residents are concerned about the impact an extra 516 residents will have. That number is a conservative one that takes into consideration a minimum of three people per residence.A quick drive past the sewage plant in Yungaburra causes one to worry about how it will service the extra population.In recent years there have been several housing developments here, but none as extensive as this one.Local ratepayers would like council to advise us who will be paying for the upgrade of water supply, and the sewage treatment plant expansion that must surely follow should it go ahead - not to mention increased road maintenance.The closing date for public submissions regarding this development is December 15 and I urge everyone to have a say.LYN THOMPSON, YungaburraUNHAPPY IN RAVENSHOE SO Mount Garnet pool opens to the public. The recommendation was ""unanimous"" and Tablelands Regional Councillor Haydon wants Ravenshoe residents to take advantage of it.Well, whoopdee-do.It will mean ""only"" a 96km round trip instead of 110km to Atherton, to a pool that is ""solar heated"", open only from 9am-5pm, tokens to be collected, and do we take our ""accredited supervisor"" with us?Does that person save lives or just makes sure you don't put rubbish in the pool?No mention of a bus service, subsidised for kids and pensioners, in other words, no change for Ravenshoe residents and more than 600 kids.Thanks for nothing, TRC, just keep spending our money in Atherton as you have always done.The answer for us is to bring back our old Herberton Shire, but that won't happen so we'll just have to continue on and hope someone will listen and take action.ZOE BROOKS, RavenshoeThe next morning I realised I had left my wallet in the trolley. Hoping for a miracle, I phoned the supermarket at 8am, but no luck. However, the lovely Jess, a supervisor at the supermarket, phoned me back an hour later to advise that an honest stranger had found my wallet in the trolley and handed it in.To that wonderful stranger, I offer my great thanks for doing me a great service and for demonstrating the fabulous character of the people of Atherton.Another special thanks to the staff at the Atherton Supa IGA, you are my heroes. Apart from the joy of getting my wallet back, this act of kindness and honesty meant that I could fly to Sydney for my mother's funeral.So you can see what a special and precious gift you have given me. MICHELLE CREECY, CairnsGREEN ALARMISTS THE cognitive dissonance of climate alarmists like Tom De Ridder (Tablelander, 22/11) coming to terms with the Trump presidency has been immensely satisfying to watch.Greenie heads have been exploding all over the planet - especially at COP22 in Marrakech where alarmists have realised the wheels are falling off their gravy train.The UN has admitted its goal was never to ""solve"" climate change, but to redistribute wealth.Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the UN's IPCC Working Group III, in an interview with Neue Z\'c3\'bcrcher Zeitung on 14/11/2010 said: ""One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy \'e2\€ \£6 One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore."" But Tom thinks CO2 is dangerous, so let's revisit the carbon cycle: CO2 plus H20 plus sunlight allows plants to photosynthesise and form carbohydrates, thus CO2 is plant food and the basis of all life.The first 40ppm of CO2 does most of the infra-red radiative forcing, with further effects decreasing logarithmically; additional CO2 now makes no measurable difference to temperature.PETER CAMPION, TolgaHe went past in early morning traffic and took the trouble of turning round and came back to help me.The sequence to the story was ambulance to Atherton Hospital then down to coronary care in Cairns.I am sorry I didn't get his name, but he knows where I live and I would like to chat to him personally and thank him.There will always be a cup of tea if you call in.FRANK HUMPHRIS, AthertonRUDE AND WRONG MY daughter is a marine biologist with a PhD in coral reproduction. After the bleaching, the James Cook University Marine Biology Department took 900 videos of the damage and my daughter was one of the scientists that assessed them.Peter Campion was issuing his pronouncements on the subject before there was any data to assess.Now that the damage has been quantified and follow-up studies done, we know there is every reason to be concerned about the future health of the reef, particularly the northern section.Elsewhere, scientists like my daughter were described as a ""disgrace"" to science for telling the truth.This person was completely wrong in his ""opinions"" about the bleaching event and seems to have contempt for knowledge and data, usually stating probably incorrect assertions as if they were fact.Campion has said the temperature is not going up and ""business as usual"" is all that's called for. Not even the deniers are still claiming this, as the data is there.Then next week, there Campion is again with more rubbish laced with jeers and name-calling. ""Keep repeating the lie until it becomes common knowledge"" - who said that again?MICK CORLEY, Malanda.\l"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia37","No Headline In Original","July 27, 2016 Wednesday","The Chronicle (Toowoomba, Queensland)","Climate changeTHE ""climate change"" debate's become a little too politicised. Former Greenpeace Canada president Patrick Moore and MIT professor of meteorology Richard Lindzen joined a growing number of sceptics of climate change alarm-ism.Their computer models failed to predict a pause in the warming trend from 1998 to 2012. In response to this data, the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) US wrote a paper in Science in 2015, arguing that improvements in surface observational temperature record show the ""apparent"" pause is false.Has this mysterious new data filtered down via other agencies and popular media to become a reference for activists?Perhaps, but why mysterious? In response to NOAA's claims, Congressman Lamar Smith, head of the House of Representative's Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, requested NOAA hand over internal communications relevant to the re-writing of the original conclusions, but NOAA refused, arguing it's in the interest of the scientific process that they do not share such information. Perhaps complying with such a request would be harmful to the integrity of NOAA's scientific process.Also, Georgia Institute of Technology climatologist Judith Curry revealed her suspicion of coordination between the NOAA and politicians eager to take aggressive action against climate change. Is climate science shaping the politics or is politics shaping the climate science?Coincidentally, the NOAA issued a press release denying the pause in global temperature trends just as the United States Environmental Protection Agency was preparing to issue a ""Clean Power Plan"" to reduce carbon emissions. The press release occurred, only a couple of months before the COP 21 (United Nations ) in Paris 2015.Trusting these climate models in spite of failed predictions might be bad enough. What's more concerning is the failure to make transparent the process of justifying the adjusted (and preferred) conclusions.The question is not whether climate change is real or even whether man is contributing to greenhouse gasses; of course we are. We should also be better stewards of the earth. I think most would agree with Geoff Castle's lot, on these points.The questions are: how accurate is the temperature data? How much temperature variation is caused by man compared to natural causes? How will it affect the planet? What would be the most sensible course of action?Al Gore and Pen State climatologists Michael Mann have been caught out exaggerating; let's learn from this. Ask any activist what they thought of an Inconvenient Truth at its release. I'm guessing most weren't too sceptical.We need to look in the right direction for future threats; e.g. collapsing world economies, genetic entropy and yes, we're headed for the post antibiotic era. We have our work cut out as it is. ERROL BRIANT, ToowoombaLong journeyWHAT a wonderful feeling today to be able to drive myself to the shops after two long years of dealing with a brain tumour radiation and all the trauma of recovery; some 76 trips to PA hospital, Toowoomba Hospital, Highfields Medical Centre.It's been a long tough battle and today I couldn't wipe the smile of my face. I've come through and can now pick up the pieces of my life; a fantastic feeling. Good health and old age is truly a privilege, denied to so many. I feel totally blessed.MERRYL JAMESON, Mt Lofty\l"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia38","Geoengineering - best used early and sparingly, not in response to a crisis","November 4, 2016 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 3:37 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: Well, that was all very good news, but by now you'll be baying for bad news, so here we are. Both the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO have announced that the latest figures on carbon and temperature are worse. And COP22 in Marrakesh is on next week. So what to do? Oliver Morton at The Economist magazine has written a book on the geo-engineering and the options to consider. His book is called The Planet Remade.Now, an awful lot of people get the horrors when you talk about geo-engineering, and you quite boldly walked into that area unblushing. Why?Oliver Morton: Not entirely without some trepidation. But I think for the simple reason that I believe that climate change poses severe possibly catastrophic risks, not certainties but risks that one should take seriously and try to act upon. I also believe that decarbonising the complex and massive fossil fuel economy on which 7 billion people soon to be 10 billion depend, and from which the majority of those people don't yet get anything like the benefits that you and I take for granted is really difficult. I don't think it's impossible and I think indeed it is imperative. I think we have to try and succeed to decarbonise the fossil fuel economy. But we have to also accept that that could well not be enough to avoid the 1.5 or two-degree boundaries that we've now written into international agreements at Paris.And so given that, it seems to me that you need to look at alternatives. Not that you need to embrace them, not that you need to discard what you have at the moment in order to follow these new fads, but that you should ask yourself are there ways to do something technical to the planet that can be made safe, that can be done in a just way and that can be made governable? And if so you should really be exploring those. And so that's the question that I sought to answer in the book.Robyn Williams: Well, just a couple of years ago there were a group of people, not least a gentleman from Trinity College Cambridge, who were going to experiment with water vapour to see whether a different gas would be feasible, and what you'd have is some device up there, a bit like a balloon which would squirt in the first case water vapour. And the experiment was stopped because the public didn't want to have it happen, even with water vapour. So it isn't there a situation where an awful lot of folk are so absolutely against it, it would be difficult to do the very thing that you say, and that's take it experimentally and to consider the possibilities?Oliver Morton: Well, I think you are referring to the SPICE experiment. Hugh Hunt at Trinity who we probably both know, is one of the players in that. It was a complicated decision, to stop the SPICE experiment, taken by the leader of that team Matt Watson, and it had to do with more factors than public acceptance. And in fact the public was not widely questioned. One of the problems was that they didn't feel that they had the right mechanism for gauging the public's view on the matter. There were also other issues to do with intellectual property which got quite complex.I think if you are worried about public acceptance, all you can do is talk about things and talk to people. And the mechanism that I have available for that conversation is a book, and at the moment the good offices of your microphone and transmitters, and talk through the question of if you don't want to see the world warm and if you are doing as much as people seem likely to be doing about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, what more are you willing to countenance and how would you like safeguards and good practices built into that?It's certainly true that a lot of the public feels strongly viscerally against. At the same time, my impression, largely anecdotal but also from people who have done a little bit of work on this, is that if you ask publics in developing countries who, after all, face the brunt of climate change in a way that we in Britain really don't, they have a rather different view. They don't necessarily say rush into this, they say but you mean this is a possibility, that we might have ways to cool the planet? Then we should definitely be looking at that because for a country like Jamaica, say, the peak temperatures during the summer and sea surface temperatures that govern hurricane activity are very important things which carbon dioxide emissions reduction in itself is not going to have any effect on for decades to come.Robyn Williams: Okay, where we are sitting is the Royal Society of London, which itself published the statement that these matters should be considered, it should be in the public arena, and a list of possibilities was given. Of the possible ways of reducing the temperature, which are your favourites?Oliver Morton: There are two different general approaches. One is reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by sucking it out in some way. And the other one is reducing the amount of sunlight coming into the atmosphere. And let's concentrate on that second one, on the reducing sunlight because that's the one that gets the heebie-jeebies going.There are really two preliminarily well studied ways of reducing the warming of the Earth by sunlight. One is to thicken the layer of small particles in the stratosphere, which is always naturally there to some extent thanks to the eruption of volcanoes. There is a layer of sulphate particles in the stratosphere that gets much thicker after a big volcanic eruption. The question of thickening it up a little thicker than it is at the moment, that's one possibility. The other one is to work much closer to the surface of the Earth and to brighten layers of low, flat cloud that sit over quite a large amount of the Earth's oceans. And techniques for doing that could be tested experimentally in the fairly near future. Actually next week I'm going to be at a meeting in Potsdam looking at the near term possibilities for experiments in this. I think you kind of have to look at the aerosols in the stratosphere as being your first port of call because volcanic eruptions do give you some sense of what happens globally.Robyn Williams: Especially in 2016 because that's 200 years, plus a little bit, of that vast eruption that really changed the climate of Europe and got rid of the summer.Oliver Morton: Tambora is absolutely spectacular but I have to say, yes, possibly the largest eruption for about 800 years and very large climatic effects, effects on Indian monsoon, effects on the summer in Europe, effects on the summer in the United States, 1800-and-froze-to-death they called it. There were I believe frosts in every one of the 12 calendar months of 1816 in New England.Also incidentally other rather less expected effects like very significant Arctic warming that you see after a large volcanic eruption like this, and that shows us something about how the climate responds, but you have to bear in mind that the amount of material that you would emit to do some geo-engineering in concert with carbon dioxide emissions would be far, far, far less than Tambora. Tambora was a huge big old shock to the Earth system, whereas what you would be hoping to do here would be sort of like a gentle nudge to the Earth system.Robyn Williams: Okay, other examples? For instance, when you are affecting the clouds, is it true that you have a number of ships at sea that would be squirting something up to the sky?Oliver Morton: Because ships are cheaper than planes, the obvious way to do the clouds, or 'obvious' meaning clever people thought about it and decided this was the easiest way, is to use seawater to create tiny little salt particles that would then drift up into the clouds and would make the clouds a little bit brighter and possibly a little bit longer lived. And that's something that could be tested. Actually making the little tiny droplets from which the salt crystals form is quite hard, but there have been various people, including a group of lovely retired Silicon Valley engineers, some of whom used to work on inkjet printers, who've come up with ways that we can try doing that.And so ways of brightening clouds is one possibility. There are other things. For instance, there's a researcher at Bristol in Britain who is interested in making crops a little bit more reflective. At first blush you think that's a bit crazy because crops need to photosynthesise, but they don't need to photosynthesise as much as they would be forced to under the brighter sunlight. And crops really suffer from the very, very hottest days. So if crops that were a little bit more reflective were a little bit cooler, that might give you a real agricultural benefit. That said, if you want to think of something that will raise your heebie-jeebies factor to the power of heebie-jeebie, then genetically modified crops that reflect sunlight more to geo-engineer the planet is probably about as bad as you can get in most people's imagination if you don't mention the word 'nanotechnology'.Robyn Williams: Except perhaps putting mirrors up in the sky, the little ones floating around, or really big ones.Oliver Morton: Really big ones, very, very difficult because, as you will have noticed, really, really big things don't float in the sky, they tend to fall down, that's why they have to have engines, that's very difficult. Putting things into orbit is very, very expensive. But effectively the particles that we talked about that are already up there because of background volcanic eruptions, those particles are little tiny mirrors. You can redesign the mirrors in various ways so that their optical properties differ. So, for instance, sulphur particles tend to spread light out a lot more than they reflect it back out to space. So sulphur particles tend to slightly whiten the sky. It's not very noticeable. I mean, when there was a large volcanic eruption in the 1990s at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, that whitened the sky but not to an extent that most people who weren't astronomers noticed. It reddened sunsets in a way that was quite spectacular and actually rather aesthetically pleasing I thought. But I don't necessarily want to do this for aesthetic reasons. Pinatubo showed us what sulphur does.You could think about other particles. For instance, some people have done studies on what might be done with diamond, what I like to think of as the large unconventional climate intervention or LUCI, the diamond experiment in the sky. What you would actually in the end choose as an aerosol, that's exactly the sort of question that leads to this overarching concern that the work would be done in a way that's safe, just and governable. You need to talk to people about the effects of these things, you need to talk about ways in which the nations of the world and ideally the peoples of the world could come to decisions about how much if any of this they wanted and in what way they wanted it to be done. And those sort of decisions can't come after all the technological work has been done. You don't want to have scientists go off and work out what the best particles are and then have an up or down vote on it, what you want is to have a continuous conversation whereby people enunciate what they need from these processes and then see what is actually doable and have a dialogue between these two different arts of the possible; the political art of the possible and the technological art of the possible.Robyn Williams: Leaving aside the sheer cost, which obviously is going to be fairly monumental... Well, the direct financial costs are very unclear at the moment. It's not that difficult to lift, say, a million tonnes of particles into the stratosphere every year. That's not particularly expensive for developed countries or even for some developing countries. It's not trivial but if you compare it to the cost, say, of nuclear power stations which are part of how Britain is trying to decarbonise itself, those are really expensive.Robyn Williams: Hinkley Point being written about in your own magazine The Economist, billions and billions and billions of dollars, and very fraught discussions about international stand-offs.Oliver Morton: Absolutely. So it's true that geo-engineering programs, especially a geo-engineering program that was properly mounted which would have to have an awful lot of monitoring and close attention being paid to all the effects, that would not be a trivial undertaking. At the same time, decarbonising the economy, as we know, is an incredibly nontrivial undertaking. We live in a world that has contrived to spend $100 billion on a space station, so these are not amounts of money beyond the dreams of man.Robyn Williams: Fair enough. But when you consider the experiments themselves, presumably you would do it in stages while the discussion is going on. You won't do the whole shebang in one go. But can you do it partially?Oliver Morton: You can do some things partially and some things not, and that's a very, very important question. You can work out, for instance, what effect this is going to have on the ozone layer. You can probably do that with relatively small experiments and that's exactly what you would hope to do. Similarly for questions about what effects you might have on the transport of water into the stratosphere, which is an important climatological factor in and of itself. These sort of processes you can probably study not uncontroversially and not easily but on relatively small scale interactions.To actually see the planet probably get warmer slower would require an operation that you would not necessarily fully understand the outcome of when you started. But to some extent that's life, it's something you don't understand the outcome of when you start. But what you can do is try and make sure that people who are affected by this get a voice, that people have a say, that there is a legitimate discussion. And there are great imperfections in the way that climate policy is put together at the moment, but there is at the same time overall a sense that the world has developed in a piecemeal unsatisfactory and stop-and-go sort of way a way of talking about how it deals with the climate. It's not inconceivable to me that we can't find a way of broadening that conversation to include consideration of some of these issues.Robyn Williams: Carbon capture and storage is one of the elements that you mentioned as the first group of possibilities, geo-engineering. And the last time I checked, which was in fact last week, the prospects seem to be more distant than before because the amount of carbon we're putting in the atmosphere is increasing by billions of tonnes. And the amounts that we are doing in carbon capture and storage is just a matter of a few million. So, many people say it's 30 years off, if that.Oliver Morton: Yes, the history of carbon capture and storage is definitely one that has to give you pause if you are talking about geo-engineering, because to some extent there is this issue within the business that is called moral hazard, that if people think that there's going to be geo-engineering they will do less emissions reduction, that if people think they are going to do geo-engineering, they might reduce emissions less.There is another way of looking at it of course which is that if people think they're going to geo-engineering and they aren't very wild about that, they might reduce emissions more. But carbon capture and storage has to some extent basically been used as a way of giving the carbon industries carte blanche because they say, oh yes, we'll do carbon capture and storage at some point but not yet, we will just be carbon capture and storage ready. And as a result we've been talking about carbon capture and storage...I think the IPCC report on it, which was hardly the first word on the subject, was 10 years ago, and we've still seen very, very little of it. So there's an awful lot of...like St Augustine said, make me chaste Lord, but not yet. That tends to be the way people see these things, and that's definitely something you need to worry about. If people talk about geo-engineering simply as a way to avoid doing anything else, that's very bad.The slightly uncomfortable corollary about this is that if you want to talk about geo-engineering you want to talk about seriously doing it in the near to medium term. You don't want to say, oh, let's just do lots and lots of research now and then use it only if there's a big disaster. If there's a big disaster, if there's a climate emergency, that's to some extent the worst time to be doing geo-engineering because you know that everything is already at stake, you know that the Earth system is already working in an unpredictable way, this is not the time to hit it with a hammer. What you want to do is stroke it with a feather earlier on or at least nudge it gently with a soft glove. I'm not quite sure why that is the analogy that comes to mind.But the idea is that geo-engineering should be, if used at all, used sparingly and probably used early, and that's a difficult thing to get your head around. People are much more comfortable, certainly scientists are much more comfortable about studying it on the basis that it will then be put behind a glass panel and used only in emergencies. But emergencies are terrible times for experimentation.Robyn Williams: Oliver Morton. He writes for The Economist magazine, and his new book is called The Planet Remade.\l"
"COP22","Australia","COP22_Australia39","Cooling the Earth - and a hungry yellow robot","November 4, 2016 Friday","ABC Transcripts (Australia) Science Show 3:37 PM AEST","Robyn Williams: This is Science Show number 2,094, and we present a killer robot chasing the crown-of-thorns, two teachers who inspire both kids and the Prime Minister, and geo-engineering; can we treat the planet?We've told you about the yellow robot before, the one that dives on the Great Barrier Reef, recognises crown-of-thorns starfish and poisons them. But now the research from the Queensland University of Technology has won the $750,000 Google Impact Challenge and can go to stage two. Well done team! Here are doctors Feras Dayoub and Matthew Dunbabin, smiling all over.Matthew Dunbabin: The trials have been fantastic, they have actually exceeded our dreams. We are now able to demonstrate the three key aspects. One is to be able to navigate complex reef, the second is to actually be able to identify crown-of-thorns starfish. And finally the last stage is to actually inject them with the bile salts, which is needed for control.Robyn Williams: And come back so it doesn't get lost.Matthew Dunbabin: And come back so it doesn't get lost, absolutely. And now we are looking at the next generation to see how we can make it even better.Robyn Williams: Now, I just talked to your colleague about how when it goes down it's got to be able to see the crown-of-thorns, identify it and nothing else, eliminate everything else. How do you manage that?Feras Dayoub: We went through our process where we trained it to detect the particular look of this creature, the starfish. And by training we can build a statistical model which compares what it sees to what it has, and when the matching is above a certain threshold it's declares this is a crown-of-thorns starfish. And it gets better as you provide more examples as you go.Robyn Williams: And were you tracking it underwater, looking to make sure it didn't zap something else? The system is detection and tracking. If we are sure frame after frame it is the crown-of-thorns that we are looking at, we declare now we are 100%...Robyn Williams: So you are seeing what it's seeing?Feras Dayoub: In the early stages, but now we are in the later stages where it's autonomous. There is no communication with the robot underwater. So the idea is to let this robot go by itself, the algorithm is detecting, injecting and taking position. We are confident that it's going to do what it's supposed to do.Robyn Williams: You didn't see it sneaking up on anything else?Feras Dayoub: In the early stages of the project, yes, the algorithm was doing a little bit of mistakes, but as we went through the weeks, the performance gets better and better. Well, congratulations. And so now you are working on an updated model. How is that going to be different?Matthew Dunbabin: Yes, through all these field trials we've identified a couple of unique opportunities for this type of technology beyond crown-of-thorns. It can include marine survey for coral bleaching, water quality, all sorts of things. So what we are now doing is working with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation to build what we are calling RangerBot. It's a smaller version, it's more portable so that citizen scientists or marine ecologists or even authorities that manage our reef, they can use this type of technology to collect data at unprecedented scales essentially. We're hoping to see lots of these rolled out across not just the Great Barrier Reef but reefs around the world.Robyn Williams: When you say lots, how many?Matthew Dunbabin: We are looking at hundreds to possibly thousands. In the longer term I think that's what is needed to help manage the globe's reefs.Robyn Williams: So that means you will have enough possibly to solve the problem of the crown-of-thorns starfish, even on a reef the size of Italy? That's always a hard decision, we have not developed COTSbot to actually work by itself, we actually designed it to work with humans, to be there to assist what they do best. They can go to certain locations, we can then do a preliminary sweep with these vehicles, get the bulk of them, and the divers would then just pick off whatever needs to be done for the control and verification.Robyn Williams: So what sort of impact would they have on the population on such a scale? Can't say. Until we really get these numbers out there we don't know. We know where they are where we are doing the control measures but there are new reefs that we don't visit all the time, they could be out there. Having a surveillance tool, we can start to then really quantify what the problem is, the numbers that we need to be able to do, and then also control them.Robyn Williams: And when you are making numbers like that, hundreds, are they affordable? That's our goal. And the reason why we are going to make this affordable is we've gone away from traditional sensors which are all acoustic based to computer vision. That's something that we are good at, we've proven that with COTSbot, but we are now looking at the next phase where the whole system is just based on computer vision. Doing that we can significantly reduce the cost of vehicles.Robyn Williams: And when you say COTSbot, crown-of-thorns starfish, that's one of your acronyms, is it? COTSbot, crown-of-thorns starfish bot.Robyn Williams: Tell me, you've been working on robotic vision as well, apart from these submersibles, just ordinary robots that wander around and do things. Feras Dayoub: Yes, I specialise in computer vision mapping, localisation and navigation. The whole idea is to use, for example, stereo vision for obstacle detection or for 3-D mapping of an environment. I'm interested in deployment of such robots in challenging and changing environments. If you have a surface robot in your house, you unpack this robot and then you make it learn the surroundings, your living room. But in the evening you change the arrangement of your furniture, the current robots need to manually relearn the configuration of this space. So the question here is how this robot can adapt over time using computer vision to map, localise, navigate and just notice change.Robyn Williams: Well, that's brilliant, but of course underwater you can have unpredictable things, strange shapes, strange creatures, and your robot then has to learn in a very sophisticated way.Feras Dayoub: Yes, so the idea is not to stop learning. After each mission the robot is recording everything it sees, and then we can review, go back off-l"

The commitment of resources from the developed world into the $100-billion annual fund to help developing countries address climate action is not being met.\~Developed countries argue that China is now the number one emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. It exceeds the emissions of the US and developed countries combined. They argue China needs to do more to tackle its rapidly expanding economy that is the leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.\~On its part, China points a finger back at the US and the developed world for being hypocritical. Their economies have benefited immensely from HYPERLINK fossil fuels like coal and crude oil. However, these developed countries do not want China to benefit from the same by constraining its economy through greenhouse-gas emission restrictions.\~Africa and the rest of the developed world are left frustrated between the bickering of major powers. Unfortunately, it is the continent of Africa that suffers the most from the greenhouse gas emissions of the developed world.\~\~Another reason for the frustrations of African representatives to COP26 is the lack of ambition from the most egregious of polluters in addressing the climate crisis. The science on climate change clearly illustrates a major environmental catastrophe in the future, but political elites in developed countries are lacklustre, at best, in grasping the urgency of the climate crisis.\~Climate change is an existential threat. However, in major developed-country cities like New York, Rome, London, Paris, Berlin, Los Angeles, and Tokyo, the weakened economies of these countries, coupled with the political lobbying of the fossil fuel companies, makes drastic action to tame the climate crisis unattainable.\~Ironically, at COP26, fossil fuel companies were overrepresented at the conference, a clear indication that they had come prepared to lobby to safeguard their interests with major government leaders.\~\~Thirdly, the question of fossil-fuel subsidies crippled any meaningful agreement on climate change that would have teeth. The US and other major industrial countries\~ provide huge subsidies on fossil fuels to lower consumer prices in their nations, to compensate oil companies for exploration expenses and as a byproduct of the lobbying process in the US congress. These subsidies have the result of making renewable resource development and uptake more expensive and less attractive to energy utilities and the private sector more generally.\~In addition, these subsidies skew the market in favor of fossil fuel companies, which already rake in multibillion dollar profits in oil extraction. The wording on the Glasgow Climate Pact was toothless as far as aggressively dealing with subsidies to oil companies. It called for a removal of inefficient subsidies rather than what was needed: the removal of all subsidies on fossil fuels.\~In addition to this, the ambiguous iteration attached to ""inefficient"" subsidies, further frustrated African delegates at . Continued subsidies for fossil fuel companies perpetuate the trajectory of a global economy heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Consequently, this results in more global warming. Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of the pain from global warming falls on African nations.\~\~What needs to be done to resolve the issues from COP26 for African nations at COP27? Establishing a mechanism of funding for the $100-billion to support developing countries (many of which are in Africa) would tackle the worst effects of climate change.\~In addition, there is a need to align government policy in the developed world, with the majority of public opinion that is concerned about the climate crisis and wants something done immediately.\~Lastly, developed countries should gradually remove subsidies to fossil-fuel companies, encouraging these companies to invest in green technology. This technology will not only enable these fossil-fuel companies to protect the environment, but also enable them to make a profit. These technologies can then support renewable-energy development in the developing world. COP27 need not be the talk shop into which COP26 degenerated.\~The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/opinion/2021-11-25-cop26-was-more-talk-than-action/COP26 was more talk than action HYPERLINK https://mg.co.zaThe Mail & Guardian\l"

Looking back and on closer reflection, we see that aside from the strengthened grassroots movement that emerged from the event, this gathering was destined to be the same as its predecessors. Klaasen said it was no surprise that with the largest delegation at the Glasgow Conference coming from the fossil fuel industry, most affected areas and people, youth and other marginalised communities were undermined and their voices suppressed.African Climate Alliance (ACA), another youth-led climate justice organisation, had their youth ambassadors representing them at , one of these being Dorothy Mwale, who said COP26 was a wonderful experience, but felt there was not a lot of youth inclusivity. In the side events we were able to communicate and talk to decision-makers, but that\' s not where the decision lies. Youth still need a position, a seat at the table, said Mwale.ACA team and youth activist network said looking back at COP26, they were not overly surprised by the way things turned out, and that it was an overall disappointment. What could have been an opportunity to listen to marginalised voices and take definitive actions, was ultimately a parade of false promises and \' goals\' that are not sufficient to combat the climate crisis. While some progress was made, the conference was primarily dominated by green-washing and inaction, said the group.Klaasen said the conference had again proved it was not sincere about including the voices that should be leading the conversation, yet continued to push the narrative that it was inclusive and valued their input.This opinion was echoed in a protest last week by the Climate Justice Charter Movement (CJCM) against lack of the implementation of the Climate Justice Charter, supported by 260 organisations, to address continued use of oil, gas and coal to power South Africa. CJCM activist Vishwas Satgar said a young person would face seven to eight climate extremes in their lifetime, and therefore it was no surprise that youth were at the forefront of the struggle towards climate justice.\l"

The key technical work included setting up carbon markets, an enhanced transparency framework and agreeing on common time-frames for the nationally determined contributions of parties to the Paris Agreement. These overarching objectives have been met, said Creecy.Responding to various climate justice protests that were held across the country during COP26 by youth and indigenous communities to have their voices heard on a global scale, Creecy said they ensured two youth representatives of the climate commission were accredited delegates at the conference because they understood the extent of the issue for young people.Creecy also said a platform was set up to address both the just transition and alignment of financial flows, consistent with a pathway towards a low greenhouse gas emission future and climate resilient development.While this was taking place, the country\' s heavy reliance on the coal industry came to light again with a landmark constitutional litigation, #CancelCoal court case, launched by youth-based African Climate Alliance (ACA), the Vukani Environmental Justice Movement in Action (VEM) and groundWork (gW), represented by the Centre for Environmental Rights (CER), against the Minister of Energy and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) at the North Gauteng High Court, demanding the abandonment of plans to build 1 500MW of new coal-fired power.

For that to happen, the phase-out of coal must be accelerated, deforestation must be curtailed and investment in green energy must rise significantly. Leaders from the Global South are correctly demanding action on the climate emergency, noting that those who were not responsible for creating the problem were bearing the brunt of its effects.The COP summit is the supreme body of the convention, which was an environmental treaty agreed to by 154 nations at the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. The first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995 decided that previous agreements to stabilise emissions were not robust enough.This led to what is probably the most famous international agreement on climate change emissions  the Kyoto Protocol  at COP3 in Japan in 1997. The first period of the Kyoto Protocol ran until 2012, when they were amended at a COP meeting in Doha, Qatar.This extended Kyoto until 2020, but also set in motion the process for a new agreement. The main reason that COP has failed is that its principal strategy cannot work  because it is based on economics rooted in the logic of capitalism. The solutions offered by the capitalist ruling class to environmental issues involve some form of emissions trading schemes or carbon offsetting.Climate change, together with nuclear war, is one of the two issues which can overturn the present basis of human civilisation. should therefore be an arena for strictly objective international scientific discussion and international cooperation. The current programmes supported by governments fail because they are based on a capitalist system of continuous growth which is not environmentally sustainable.The COP talks themselves are actually sponsored by industry, often the fossil fuel industry. Ultimately, the talks fail to create solutions to the climate crisis because governments have to move to replace fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources as soon as possible, and they have too much invested in fossil fuels to do this. COP26 is also dominated by wealthier countries and corporations which are not invested in decreasing pollution or stop exploiting the planet\' s resources.The root cause of capitalism\' s ongoing environmental damage is because it is a system based on endless growth. Capitalists have to constantly expand in order to avoid going under because they are locked into competition with one another.Developed countries are promoting a new global recolonisation process, which could be called the new carbon colonialism. They are attempting to impose the rules of the game, their own rules of the game, to continue to fuel the new green capitalistic system and to force these rules of the game upon the developing countries.Dr Mahlatsi is an SACP Free State PEC Member writing in his personal capacity\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa11","COP26 pact on trading carbon emissions fatally flawed","December 21, 2021 Tuesday","Cape Argus (South Africa)/Argus Weekend (South Africa)","One surprise from COP26 \- the latest UN climate change conference in Glasgow \- was an agreement between world leaders on a new set of rules for regulating carbon markets. This would allow countries to trade the right to emit greenhouse gases.Carbon trading is part of how countries intend to meet their obligations for reducing emissions under the Paris Agreement. Unfortunately, the manner in which countries agreed these rules may hobble the agreement in its goal of averting catastrophic warming.Carbon markets were central to the design of the Paris Agreement\' s predecessor, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which created three different mechanisms for trading carbon. Developing countries had become accustomed to attracting investment via one called the  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allowed industrialised countries to invest in projects to reduce emissions in developing countries and count them against their own targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Many industrialised countries wanted to retain this sort of flexibility in how they met their own treaty obligations.As a result, most governments were keen to keep carbon markets as part of the Paris Agreement. In Paris in 2015, the bare bones of mechanisms similar to those in the Kyoto Protocol were agreed, but without the details needed to put them into practice.Why then did it take six years to agree on the rules which would govern these markets? This was more than the four years it took countries to do the same in the Kyoto Protocol and, in effect, they were recreating the same mechanisms. The problems in reaching an agreement this time were three-fold, and they weren\' t satisfactorily resolved in Glasgow.Various states, and many environmental campaign groups, suspect that carbon markets weaken the overall effort to reduce emissions. As climate change has accelerated over the past decade these concerns have become more acute. Why trade emissions if everyone is trying to get them to zero? There is considerable evidence that carbon offset projects \- such as wind farms, which emissions trading can fund \- have failed to deliver a reduction in overall emissions. A 2017 study led by the EU Commission found that 85% of projects funded by the CDM hadn\' t reduced emissions.There are also fundamental design issues in the Paris Agreement that make setting up carbon markets under it much more difficult. The Kyoto Protocol expressed the obligations of industrialised states to reduce their emissions as targets. These could be translated into a fixed number of emissions allowances that provided carbon markets with a clear set of accounting rules and indicators of market demand.No such set of rules exists in the Paris Agreement. Instead, all states submit their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \- national plans for reducing emissions. They may or may not have an emissions target and they vary in how they account for emissions or which sources of emissions they include in their plans. How can a market function if there is no clear way of measuring what is being traded? And how should a country trading with another adjust its own NDC to avoid double-counting, when the design of each country\' s NDC varies so much?And what should countries do with all the credits created in the Kyoto Protocol\' s system? Should they just be rolled over to be used in the new markets? Should they be simply abandoned? Or is there some way of allowing them in but controlling their use? A lot of CDM credits in particular remain and they could flood the new markets and undermine the integrity of the NDCs.In the first week of COP26, it looked like these issues would continue to dog the negotiations. In week two, these issues were either fudged or hastily agreed. The carbon traders were happy, as were the managers of the COP26 process \- the UN secretariat and the UK government. We can now see the cost of failing to grapple with these thorny issues.Countries are supposed to set new NDCs regularly. At the same time, countries will be negotiating individual emission trades. The possibility for a country to game its NDC \- making it appear more ambitious than it really is by counting already agreed trades within them \- is impossible to avoid. It\' s hard to see how this doesn\' t fundamentally weaken the ambition of countries when updating their NDCs.Paterson is a professor of international politics at the University of Manchester.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa14","COP26 Discussions Must Prioritize Agriculture","November 03, 2021","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Local, national and world leaders, and committed climate change activists are in Glasgow for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) to share the progress they've made since the COP21 in Paris six years ago and to discuss what comes next. One of the issues that must be on the table at COP26 is the worrying impact of climate change on agriculture in Africa.Agriculture accounts for over 25 percent of Africa's GDP while employing over 70 percent of people that live in rural communities. When agriculture is impacted, women, who work in the agricultural sector suffer the consequences. The entire agriculture value chain is threatened by climate change. According to a recent World Bank Report, unless urgent actions are taken, climate change could force millions of Africans to migrate to new areas.At the production level, climate change is impacting agriculture via drought and flooding events. In 2020, flooding in East Africa impacted over six million people. In 2021, flooding has affected 669,000 people in West and Central Africa, over 700,000 people in Sudan and South Sudan and over 100,000 people in Nigeria.At the foundation of climate-resilient agriculture is the need for smallholder farmers to have access to dependable and year round sources of water to support agriculture. At the moment African agriculture is dependent on rain-fed agriculture and because of climate change rains are no longer dependableIt is also having an impact through invasive and transboundary plant-eating insect pests such as the fall armyworm and the desert locust. Invasive insect pests cost the African continent U.S. $1 billion every year. Impacted the most are vulnerable groups that include African small holder farmers, women and girls, children, disabled and elderly people.Without a climate-resilient agricultural sector, even the most ambitious climate initiatives will bear minimal returns. It is imperative for countries participating in the COP26 meeting to finance agriculture initiatives.Looking at many developed countries, it is evident that it is possible to build climate resilient agriculture. This is particularly possible when several interlinked short-term and long-term strategies are put in place. At the foundation of climate-resilient agriculture is the need for smallholder farmers to have access to dependable and year round sources of water to support agriculture. At the moment African agriculture is dependent on rain-fed agriculture and because of climate change rains are no longer dependable.Complementing access to water for agriculture are other important tools including access to most recent and improved agricultural technologies and resources. From improved and climate-smart seeds to drought, flooding, insects and plant disease-tolerant crops varieties to recent knowledge of agricultural practices and access to markets and financial help.Important is the need for African countries to strengthen their early warning systems. These can only be achieved through strengthening African countries abilities to tap on big data and use it as a tool to stay ahead of all the climate linked disasters. Accompanying early warning systems is the need to lay out comprehensive climate adaptation initiatives.At the center of all actions and strategies is the need to put the people on the ground and African countries at the center of climate action. As a founder to a startup, Oyeska Greens that is working with farmers at the Kenyan Coast I have seen firsthand the value of putting farmers at the forefront. Putting them at the forefront ensures that the strategies and initiatives that are laid out are relevant and meeting the current challenges that small holder farmers and other vulnerable groups are facing as it relates to climate change. Without including the very people whom we are serving, we risk unsustainable and irrelevant solutions.Climate change is the most urgent crisis of our times. While talk and meetings such as COP26 are important, in the end it is the initiatives and actual projects being implemented in African countries, particularly in the agricultural sector that will help move the needle and address the escalating climate change crisis.All countries must work together and take action in the fight against climate change to avert many crises that are projected to happen if we fail to act. Lives of vulnerable citizens including women, elderly and people with disabilities are at stake.

This finance is for the transition project itself that was announced between several developed countries and our President Cyril Ramaphosa at the beginning of COP26. But let me clarify, this is an offer from the developed countries, it is not a deal.'IFP MP Elphas Buthelezi had asked what the plans were for the climate change financing that was recently announced in Glascow during climate change negotiations.Gordhan said one of the issues at that were quite sharply debated was who would finance the transition to lower carbon energy.He said in South Africa's case, 41% of the country's emissions actually come from electricity production and therefore, on the one hand, 'we have got to prepare for the transitioning of Eskom and other such equipment or facilities that we have at a national level to a more climate friendly and decarbonised state'.He said South Africa put forward three projects for consideration for those who would be interested in financing the transition, which in the main, has to be the developed countries, through or with multilateral financial and other institutions.'And those three projects were the Eskom just energy transition project, secondly the green hydrogen project and thirdly, transitioning SA's automobile industry to the production of electric vehicles,' he said.He said negotiations will now take place at a technical level to appreciate whether these offers will be compatible with SA's financial requirements and capabilities.'The Eskom debt issue as we know has been very much with us. But let me emphasise that this financing has nothing to do with Eskom debt.'Secondly, the Eskom debt was accumulated because a decision was made by previous governments to finance the development of Medupi and Kusile through the tariff applications to Nersa and not by any equity injections. Thirdly, there are various proposals that we will consider together with the National Treasury and other stakeholders how the Eskom debt should be dealt with and clearly, among the role-players that have to take part in this process will be government itself, the PIC...'What we will have soon is a pro-forma balance sheet of a new Eskom with a different distribution of debt with the acceptance and buy in of the lenders that have lent money to Eskom.' - SAnews.gov.za\l"

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa18","A seat at the table for Sustainable Finance at COP26?","October 2021","BusinessBrief","Securing global net zero by 2050, keeping 1.5 degrees within reach, and adapting to protect communities and natural habitats are the primary goals of the COP26 summit. Countries have been tasked with delivering ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets as well as working together to restore ecosystems, build defences and make infrastructure more resilient to climate change. COP26 seeks to overcome this obstacle by mobilising finance as a key goal of the summit. It is recognised that in order to achieve the primary goals, developed countries need to deliver on the promises of raising $100 billion in climate finance per year whilst working hand-in-hand with international finance institutions to unleash the private and public sector finance onto the path of achieving global net zero.With the prospect of Sustainable Finance having a meaningful seat around the table at COP26, it is important to avoid conflating the definition of Sustainable Finance. In short, Sustainable Finance is the development of a financial system that is sustainable across economic, social, and environmental platforms. Sustainable Finance is focused on the longer-term investment decisions in the financial sector which encompasses material ESG (Environmental Social Governance) criteria into the decision processes, policies, frameworks, and practice. It requires buy-in from the financial sector to inter alia evaluate portfolio and transaction-level environmental and social risk exposures as well as to maximise opportunities and mitigate risk, in the pursuit of contributing to the delivery of the sustainable development goals.A financial market specifically catering for the shift to the realisation of social and environmental impacts whilst facilitating financial return has emerged out of the growth of the social economy globally. Notwithstanding the challenging landscape on which it finds itself, Sustainable Finance provides emerging markets with the necessary space for innovative financing to develop.Whilst the necessary space for the development of innovative finance is a key point of departure, a fruitful engagement on the mobilisation of finance at COP26 will be vital in providing emerging markets with the necessary assistance and funding. Emerging markets are currently facing the burden of having to tackle climate change and reaching global net zero. However, they lack the necessary financial capacity. There is an over dependence on the use of cheap fossil fuels for internal and export use - a dependence that is simply not sustainable.The emergence of Sustainable Finance has been greatly assisted by the rapid growth of the green bond market. Green bonds are bond issues where the proceeds arising therefrom are ring-fenced and exclusively applied to either finance or refinance existing projects with a focus on progressing environmentally sustainable activities. The growth of the green bond market assists investors in aligning their financial objectives to achieve ESG targets. The growth of green bonds has certainly encouraged private companies, as well as the public sector, to internally assess the manner in which they access and raise their capital. What is encouraging is that green financing is expected to be a key topic at this year's COP26. The hopeful result being an acceleration of green and sustainable financing.Another key aspect linked to achieving Sustainable Finance is climate-related disclosures. With ESG initiatives being a key component of Sustainable Finance, climate-related disclosure seeks to promote informed decisions at the hands of stakeholders in the financial sector to better understand the exposures to climate-related risks. Climate-related disclosures are tipped to be a key discussion point at this year's COP26. is the 26th edition of the United Nations climate change conference and whilst the negotiations at this year's conference have the primary focus of the race to net zero emissions by 2050, it has been recognised that Sustainable Finance will hold a key seat at the COP26 summit table this year. Sustainable Finance will play a major role as we work together towards unleashing the trillions in private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero. \l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa19","Dark agenda of COP26 meeting","November 8, 2021 Monday","The Mercury (South Africa)","AS expected, the mainstream media has spared no effort in amplifying the doomsday rhetoric of the UN COP26 meeting in Glasgow, as exemplified by Boris Johnson\' s warning that the future of the environment is on the cusp of disaster (The Mercury, November 2).But what is not reported is how the contrived fanfare about climate change is an integral part of the World Economic Forum\' s agenda known as the  Great Re-Set .Climate change is a natural process as old as history itself. Droughts, floods, heatwaves and hurricanes have occurred throughout recorded history.There were two warming periods in the past 2 000 years which were unrelated to carbon emissions \- the Roman warming period which ended around 300AD and the medieval one which ended around 1400.In 1920, global climate-related disasters killed 500 000. Despite the greatly increased population of our time, such human losses are exponentially no greater. Cold-related deaths are actually 40 times more common in North America. Recent scientific studies show increased ice levels in the polar regions.New York University Professor of Engineering, Steven Koonin, who was under-secretary of energy in Obama\' s administration, rejects global warming alarmism, pointing out that temperature fluctuations are no different than they were 60 years ago. Greenpeace founder Patrick Moore is adamant that there is  zero evidence that the world is in the midst of a  climate emergency .What the promoters of the de-carbonised Green new deal do not state are the dark consequences of their agenda. By cancelling fossil fuels, life as we know it would revert to the pre-Industrial Revolution period. Aircraft would no longer take to the skies. Roads would no longer be made of bitumen. Many petroleum-derived products would be unobtainable.When the so-called world leaders like Biden, Johnson, Macron, Merkel, Prince Charles and the pope falsely claim that  human beings pose an existential threat to the environment what they fail to admit is that their goal is to depopulate the planet. By throwing billions into dependence on the state, the oligarchs of the Great Re-Set, otherwise known as the new world order, intend to subject the masses to an Orwellian serfdom.Those who scoff at this should look at the extent to which basic freedoms are being denied or curtailed by politicians \- not by science \- with regard to the contrived Covid-19 pandemic from which 99% of the infected have recovered and now the coercion to be vaccinated.It should be obvious that the contrived climate alarmism and the coercion to promote the untested vaccines are two sides of the same depopulation coin. Gabi Marais (The Mercury, November 4) is quite right: the Glasgow COP26 meeting has nothing to do with saving the world but everything to do with promoting what George Orwell described in his novel titled 1984.\l"

The idea is that the countries support South Africa to phase out of coal faster and to go earlier and faster into developing renewables. We\' re still working on that, Von der Leyen told a news conference, adding that the US, the UK, Germany and France were also involved.The initiative is to be launched at the COP26 climate summit from today until November 12 in Glasgow, Scotland.Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel, and phasing it out quickly is seen as crucial if the world is to meet the Paris Agreement\' s target to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C and avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.The aim of the Glasgow summit is to secure enough new commitments and deals from countries and polluting industries to cut emissions fast enough to keep the 1.5\'b0 Celsius target within reach. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has called on all rich countries to stop burning coal by 2030, and for poorer countries to do so by 2040.EU sources said the partnership would focus on a  just transition in South Africa, by providing support to the regions and workers in coal industries that would be affected by a phaseout.Coal-fuelled plants supplied nearly 90% of South Africa\' s electricity last year.Von der Leyen also said 60 countries have now joined a pledge led by the EU and US to cut methane emissions.The pledge, which will also be launched at the COP26 summit, would see countries commit to slash their joint methane emissions by 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels.Nigeria, Japan and Pakistan are among the countries that have signed up.Methane is the second-biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide. The gas has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2, but it breaks down in the atmosphere faster, meaning deep cuts in methane emissions could have a rapid impact on slowing global warming.\l"

The funds allocated would assist Eskom with the Just Energy Transition Partnership [to support South Africa\' s decarbonisation efforts]. The loan will also allow us to introduce electric vehicles and the hydrogen economy in the country, De Ruyter said.He refuted claims that Minister of Environmental Affairs Barbara Creecy and Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe were opposed to the loan deal.Clearing the apparent misconception following a question from one of the journalists who were part of the briefing, De Ruyter said Creecy and Mantashe were only opposed to the proposal by about 30 countries at the COP26 which wanted to force countries such as South Africa and others to stop coal projects. Minister Mantashe and Creecy did not align themselves with the move to stop coal projects. So their objections had nothing to do with the loan agreement, Ruyter emphasised.Yesterday, the power utility also announced that it had served legal notices to some of the big municipalities and key industries which allegedly contravened instructions to implement load shedding.

At just 25, Grace is co-founder of the global Loss and Damage Youth Coalition. She also leads The Green Protector, which focuses on Rwanda\' s sustainable development and environmental education, and acts as a community think-tank.An environmental engineer by training, Grace says women in sub-Saharan Africa are heroes who live every day with the growing challenges of the climate crisis.Grace has represented Rwanda at three UN climate change summits. She has also helped establish two youth climate networks \- one international and one at home \- which put young people at the centre of high-level talks about the world\' s future.While running between meetings at COP26, Grace explains why women and young girls are making their voices heard and demanding change.What\' s your experience been at COP26? Do you think enough is being done? Will the results be positive?There\' s this understanding that some leaders, especially from the global North, are trying to clean up for the media because now more than ever, everyone is aware that climate inaction is doing an injustice, especially in the global South.But when you\' re looking technically at the negotiations, there\' s no such thing as significant progress. For example, one of the facts that I can give is (valuing the cost of climate change impacts which have caused) loss and damage; it\' s one of the biggest injustices we are facing. Loss and damage is what happens when it\' s too late to mitigate or adapt to climate change.You\' re a member of the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, and you also created another organisation, The Green Protector.Yes, I am a co-founder and co-director at Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, which we started in summer last year. We are a coalition of youth worldwide where we have one single demand, which is to achieve climate justice. The only way to achieve climate justice is for global leaders to address loss and damage. We do this by pressuring global leaders by giving out, for example, open letters. We have sent a couple to the EU, the COP26 presidency, and the US. We also do training because we want to ensure that youth worldwide have information about what\' s loss and damage and, most importantly, how everyone can take action, regardless of where you\' re located or the background you have in education. Climate change is happening to all of us, and it has no borders, and the only way we are going to come out safe is if we work together.Working together in a non-tokenistic manner is something that the youth understand. But when you\' re looking at global diplomacy, there\' s still some work to be done.How is climate change impacting young people? And how do you see it affecting your futures?I was exposed to climate change impacts when I was younger, but I didn\' t know about climate change. I just have that memory of waking up in the middle of the night to save my life. My mom was the one who woke me up because intensive rainfall and wind destroyed my house ceiling. When I finished high school, I saw on the news that in this particular area in my country, people were forced to move because erosion and flooding were hitting their site. So, I went to study environmental engineering. COP26) because we want to return home and say to our community:  Now you can rest assured we have come to a solution. But whenever I\' m in the room, you can hear the frustration because developed countries, small island countries have been making their demands clear for ages.What role do women play in the solutions for climate change, particularly in Sub-Saharan African communities?There have been some fantastic voices here at COP26, especially young women from Africa.First of all, they are heroes because they manage to live in areas where we still go to fetch water at a very long distance or fetch wood. But we don\' t give up because women do have that sense of nature (needing) protection.I\' m blessed to be coming from Rwanda, a country where women\' s voices are much more highlighted and empowered. But, in some countries, there are no women to influence decisions, which means that most solutions are not gender-responsive. We are using our voice to demand change. And when a woman speaks, another woman listens. If I enter a room, I need to talk so that a fellow female in the room will feel encouraged to speak up.And that highlights the importance of having role models for girls and young women.Yes, yes. Because we grew up thinking that the men in the room are the ones to make a decision. I had to realise that women (have) equal power because I was in this mindset of knowing that (being a) woman equals keeping your mouth shut and doing as you\' re told. So, I believe that now Africa is rising because women are speaking up, taking space, and creating hope. Because when I see my colleague (Elizabeth Wathuti) from Kenya speaking up, or Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, when I see those women speaking up, it\' s a sense of hope.This piece was produced by SciDev.Net\' s sub-Saharan Africa English desk and can be found on HYPERLINK https://www.scidev.net/global/role-models/qa-young-people-know-how-to-work-together/https://www.scidev.net/global/role-models/qa-young-people-know-how-to-work-together/\l"

Countries need to mitigate and adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change on their citizens' lives, and they need funding to do it.Developed economies have promised to raise at least $100bn (about R1.48-trillion) every year in climate finance to support developing countries.We therefore expect to see increasing flows from countries to support the ""just transition"", which means moving to a more sustainable economy in a way that's fair to everyone - including people working in industries affected by decarbonisation.Competition is intense for these financial flows and the window is closing for countries to attract them. Not having access could hamper countries' ability to transition. This will have far-reaching economic implications, through carbon border taxes for exports, which would jeopardise trading prospects - taxed exports will be competing against those from other countries that don't have a tax drag.As the world's 13th-highest carbon emitter, and the highest emitter in Africa, SA will come under the spotlight. But the attention is also an opportunity to present the country as a leader in the transition to a greener economy.It is essential that the South African delegation presents a unified and considered position at COP26There have been encouraging signs with the establishment of the Presidential Climate Commission. And think-tanks such as the National Business Initiative have assisted with a science- and data-driven approach to highlight viable transition pathways for our major industries. This, however, needs to be backed by a cohesive, overarching narrative, with the government and business working towards the same goal, and concrete policy action communicated in a co-ordinated manner at COP26.Fortunately, moving to a greener economy is no longer seen as a trade-off between development and transition - it is fundamental to economic development in the future.If this is implemented in a coherent and consultative manner, new-job creation and economic growth should be the outcome - which means the goals of the government and the private sector are in alignment.Environment minister Barbara Creecy recently told a ministerial meeting on key issues ahead of the COP26Creecy said the focus should be put on enhancing health benefits and food and water security, and on adapting infrastructure to cope with climate impacts, particularly in Africa, small island developing states and least developed countries.Ahead of COP26To do this, every financial decision from now on needs to take climate into account. This includes all private investment decisions, but also all spending decisions that countries and international financial institutions are making as they roll out stimulus packages.Companies also need to be transparent about the risks and opportunities that climate change and the shift to a net zero economy pose to their business. Central banks and regulators need to make sure that our financial systems can withstand the impacts of climate change and support the transition to net zero.Banks, insurers, investors and other financial firms need to commit to ensuring their investments and lending are aligned with net zero.Under the Paris Accord, countries agreed to establish a global goal on adaptation to enhance nations' adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.But the accord stopped short of setting out what the goal should look like and how progress should be assessed.Measurable targets will likely be addressed by COP26.We need to be ready.Formby is RMB CEOSA will need financial aid to cope with the impacts of climate change, including flooding and drought.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa27","After COP26, business leaders are warming up to sustainable practices","December 2, 2021 Thursday","Mail & Guardian","What is next on the global climate agenda? This year's UN climate change conference ( HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop26/COP26) in Glasgow certainly did not fail, but nor was it much of a success. Although world leaders entered into some promising new agreements on targets, global greenhouse gas emissions, so far, are not being reduced at the pace we need. And while some countries' climate pledges have been strengthened, the lack of concrete measures for achieving them is a real worry. We still see a yawning policy gap.Climate science clearly shows that future prosperity and equity lies in only one direction: towards a nature-positive, zero-carbon global economy. Between this year's extreme weather events and the razor-sharp, science-based messages in the intergovernmental panel on climate change's HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/sixth assessment reportMany policymakers continue to drag their feet, voicing concerns that climate action will burden businesses. But many top business leaders are increasingly putting their companies on a more sustainability-minded course. The vast majority of them have accepted the findings of climate science and moved beyond the phase of denial and hesitation. This broader trend was clear to see in Glasgow, where senior executives from many of the world's largest companies were in attendance.In the run-up to COP26, we HYPERLINK https://www.futurist.berlin/ceo-studyinterviewed business leaders from more than 20 top German companies (including BASF, Daimler, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Telekom, Lufthansa, and Siemens), and examined their respective sustainability strategies. Among our main findings were that nine of 10 German chief executives consider HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/sustainability/sustainability to be at least as important as digitalisation over the next five years.This represents a striking change - and it is not just cheap words. On average, the companies participating in the study aim to achieve climate neutrality by as early as 2035, not only on their factory premises but across their global value chains. German corporate leaders are under no illusions that this will be easy; most recognise that their actions have yet to catch up to their attitudes. Nonetheless, sustainability has clearly moved to the top of the chief executive agenda, supplanting Covid-19 as the number one topic.Our survey suggests that a new narrative has emerged in German business. Companies now consider a robust sustainability strategy necessary for maintaining their ""licence to operate"". More are beginning to realise that there are business opportunities in sustainability. And more chief executive officers are taking personal responsibility, establishing new corporate governance mechanisms and incorporating sustainability targets into executive board compensation.In the context of the broader climate challenge, Germany makes a particularly interesting case study. With its highly industrialised economy, Germany wants to become a pioneer in decarbonisation without losing its international competitiveness. From the average German chief executive's perspective, progress is being held back not by a lack of green technologies or support from key stakeholders, but by high upfront costs. For 60% of those surveyed, sustainability and profitability remain at odds. Still, many existing sustainability projects are already paying off, and costs will continue to fall as the opportunities for increasing sales of sustainable products increase.Three kinds of actionTransforming companies' modes of operation requires three kinds of action. First, they urgently need to reduce their negative footprinton the planet and society, by stopping their overuse and destruction of natural resources. Second, they need to increase their positive handprint through system-wide, purpose-oriented (rather than solely profit-driven) business strategies to build resilience and contribute to the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/sustainable-development-goals/Sustainable Development GoalsAnd, third, they need to create a heartprint, winning the support of all stakeholders. Here, we can all have an effect, by changing our behaviour as consumers, supporting bold policies as voters, creating new knowledge as scientists, and setting meaningful incentives and frameworks as policymakers.The German companies we surveyed offer good examples for sustainable corporate action. Some of them use ""green digital twins"" in product development to quantify a product's climate effects even before a prototype is built. Others report on their ""product carbon footprint"" to provide suppliers and customers with transparency about emissions and enable informed choices between alternatives. Many businesses co-operate across sectors to operate and finance sustainable projects. And several large German companies are training employees to become ""sustainability ambassadors"", who will show others how to pursue similar strategies.Such models need to spread quickly, because the transition to a safer, healthier, sustainable world is not proceeding smoothly. The global economy is still shaped by misaligned incentives that make it profitable to pollute, destroy, and destabilise the climate and biosphere. We urgently need climate science-aligned policies that provide a new framework for business. COP26 did not deliver this - and it probably never could. Additional formats will be needed, starting with the 2022 G7 summit in Germany. The EU could sign on to the US-China declaration in Glasgow, even forming a science-based ""climate G3"".But we also need more companies to take it upon themselves to adopt science-based targets. This applies not only to cutting carbon-dioxide emissions but also to conserving other limited resources, especially water, biodiversity, food and soil.The challenges ahead are immense, but so are the opportunities. We are currently in a phase of acceleration, having only just realised the urgency of the issue. The HYPERLINK carbon budget for remaining aligned with 1.5\'b0C of warming will last (at current emissions rates) until the end of this decade  at most. We must start reducing emissions now, across all sectors and at all levels.As our study shows, business leaders are aligning behind the science and showing a willingness to transform their operations. The question now is whether policymakers will provide the necessary framework to ensure a safe future for everyone. - Project SyndicateThe post HYPERLINK After COP26 , business leaders are warming up to sustainable practices appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.zaThe Mail & Guardian\l"

During Cop21 in Paris, 196 countries signed treaties \- the Paris Agreement \- pledging to work towards keeping global warming under the 1.5\'b0C threshold set by climate scientists worldwide. The COP26 summit aims to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.In July, Al Jazeera reported that thousands of scientists have repeated calls for urgent action to tackle the climate emergency, warning that several tipping points are now imminent.Human activity is the main cause of climate change, which results from burning fossil fuels and converting land from forests to agriculture. Africa is the lowest contributor in carbon emissions, and yet suffers the most.Under the Kyoto Protocol, a UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that industrialises countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases, Africa was recognised for its vulnerability to climate change.However, under the Paris Agreement, Africa lost that recognition. There are nations which are categorised under the Least Developed Countries (LDC). In Africa, out of 54 countries, only 33 are recognised as LDCs.According to Environment, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy, across Africa, research is indicating that countries are already spending between two and nine percent, on average, of their GDP on adaptation measures.Kamal Djemouai, an independent climate change consultant and adviser to the AGN said it\' s not fair to recognise only certain countries in Africa and leave out some on the basis that they are more developed.Djemouai explained that even though Africa had initially signed and agreed to the provisions of the Paris Agreement, it was not too late to have the decision rectified, saying it was a mistake to sign an agreement that does not recognise the entire continent as an LDC. Rectifying it is showing goodwill from all our African countries that we are ready to participate to the betterment of climate change. This is very good at a political level, technical level and negotiations level. Djemouai said the recognition was important because it reflected the reality and fact that Africa was the least contributor in the carbon emissions and was not responsible for the levels of global warming. All African countries, without even talking about the development or economy, must get the same treatment when it comes to climate change because the consequences have no borders and limits. The Department of Environmental Affairs said a South African delegation had held discussions ahead of COP26, to explore opportunities for enhanced co-operation, financing and support for the country\' s  Just Transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society. The delegation said that South Africa, as a developing country, was committed to contributing its fair share towards a global low-emissions, climate-resilient economy and society by mid-century.

The year 2020 reached temperatures that were about 1.02& xB0;C warmer than average. These kinds of extremes, driven by climate change, are being felt intensely across Africa. Greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide and methane - are largely to blame for the changes to the climate. Some of the sun's energy is reflected back to space and is trapped by these gases leading to a warming of the earth. Increased concentrations of these gases in our atmosphere leads to global warming and consequently climate climate. Africa carries the heaviest burden of the associated climate change effects, despite contributing less than 5% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Industrialised countries - namely China, the US, India, Russia and Japan - top the list in the emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Africa is the most vulnerable continent to the effects of climate change due to its low adaptive capacity, as a result of financial and technological limitations, and an over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture. The continent is also witnessing a higher rate of warming than the global average of 0.15& xB0;C per decade between 1951 and 2020. Given the observed global warming, it is projected that the continent will experience an increase in hot extremes and more frequent and intense rainfall extremes. The projected changes in climate are likely to cause devastating impacts across the continent. The current case of food insecurity as a result of drought in East Africa is a case in point. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that sub-Saharan Africa has loses of over $520m in direct economic damages annually as a result of climate change since the beginning of this century. The cost of implementing the continent's response to the challenges posed by climate change is estimated at between $7bn billion and $15bn annually. This is projected to shoot to $35bn per year by 2050. Consider this, by 2050 climate change is projected to cost Africa 4.7% of its GDP while North America will lose 1.1% of its GDP. African countries cannot be ignored, or just listened to. Their needs should shape the agenda. There must be action that immediately addresses the challenges facing the continent. How can the world come to recognise the magnitude of all this? COP26 provides that platform. The COP26 The Paris Agreement, created in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2& xB0;C, preferably to 1.5& xB0;C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Essentially, the agreement brought all countries together in a common effort to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. The agreement provides a framework for financial and technical support to countries who need it. It also obliges developed countries to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts - because they are largely responsible for the losses and costs associated with climate change. The developed nations promised to raise US$100 billion a year to support climate change adaptation and mitigation in vulnerable countries. However, reports show that this pledge has fallen short by at least $20bn since 2018. Unfortunately, there are no clear plans provided by the ""rich"" nations on how this deficit will be met. This is the time to hold them accountable. At COP26, countries will launch an adaptation goal and adopt strategies for achieving such a goal. This presents African countries with the opportunity to shape the agenda, once more. Leaders of African countries should approach the convention with a strong, unified voice, presenting their climate change concerns and needs. The negotiation outcomes at COP26 must succeed in favour of Africa and other developing countries by: Making finance more accessible and faster to African and other developing countries; Developed nations must pledge to boost non-financial efforts in climate change adaptation, such as education; and A re-commitment of climate finance in l"

With climate change at the forefront of current international discussions, and considering South Africa s large carbon footprint, it is important to prioritise local efforts towards more sustainable energy consumption in buildings. This is the view of Barry Bredenkamp, general manager: energy efficiency and corporate communications at Sanedi.

Achieving these targets will require the transformation of our energy system at an unprecedented speed and scale.This will include the decommissioning, the repowering and the repurposing of coal-fired power stations and the roll-out of renewable energy.But our ability to do so will be determined by the extent of support that we receive from developed economies.The Political Declaration that we announced this week with the governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union, represents an important breakthrough in this effort.Through this partnership, an initial amount of $8.5 billion will be mobilised over the next three to five years to support South Africa's just transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient future. This will enable us to implement our ambitious goals and to develop a model for a just transition that we hope can be used elsewhere.We are entering a brave new world bound together by our common destiny as humanity.We owe this to ourselves, to one another and to the future generations.I thank you.Issued by: The PresidencyMore from: The PresidencyMore on: International relations\l"

""Keep coal and Mantashe in the hole"", ""Government stop sell-outs"" and ""COP is a COP-out"" read placards.-The picket formed part of a Global Virtual Protest to coincide with the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (), which started in Glasgow, Scotland, on 31 October and will continue until 12 November. The demonstration was also a joint call to action for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) by the Rural Women s Assembly (RWA), which includes members from Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Madagascar, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.In a statement, RWA criticised the makeup of the COP26 meeting: We foresee a COP26 without representation of women and girls, especially rural women and girls. This is, unfortunately, perpetuating a pattern we have noticed and spoken to in the last few years of the COP meetings and other such international meetings, where decisions about things that impact our lives are made. RWA called for a stop to greenhouse gas emissions, more solar and wind-powered energy, a human rights-based approach to climate change, and sustainable models of food production and distribution.Carmen Louw of RWA said although most of the emissions are caused by larger industrial nations, such as China and the United States, Africa will be among the hardest hit by climate change.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/219665.html :EMBED--> We need those countries responsible for the climate damage to finance the alternatives, but on our terms and not on their terms. In that way, we can become self-sustaining, use our methods, and ensure that our women farmers have decent incomes and livelihoods. If there is no drastic change and there s an increase in temperature, we won t be able to farm with cattle and maize in a few years time. Our membership is reliant on small-scale production just for household food security and survival. Lungisa Huna, also of RWA, said given the severe droughts that have happened in the Southern African region, government cannot wait for a catastrophe to hit before it addresses the climate crises with urgency. For too long our government goes and sits in these air-conditioned conferences leaving the masses outside while they sign bilaterals and agree on COP without any changes that we can see on the ground. We can no longer wait for declarations to be signed, and discussions with no decisions taken. We need decisions to be taken now, not in 2030 or 2050, because we are struggling today, said Huna.President Cyril Ramaphosa announced last Tuesday that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany and the European Union struck a R131bn deal with South Africa to accelerate its transition away from coal towards renewables.Ramaphosa said South Africa submitted a revised nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce domestic carbon emissions to within a target range for emissions of between 420 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and 350 tonnes CO2e by 2030.(A carbon dioxide equivalent is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.)<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/742/221476.html :EMBED--> This revised target is compatible with the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement and represents our country s best effort to confront climate change, which will have a devastating impact on sub-Saharan Africa without large-scale mitigation and adaptation efforts, said Ramaphosa.Partner countries will mobilise an initial $8.5 bn over the next three to five years through a range of instruments, including grants and concessional finance, to support the implementation of the country s revised NDC.Ramaphosa said for the transition to a low carbon and climate-resilient economy to be just, decarbonisation must be implemented in a way that promotes and sustains employment, livelihoods and economic inclusion for historically marginalised communities.He said a joint taskforce will be established to take forward the partnership over the coming months.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

South Africa yet again disgraced itself by aligning itself with the worst offenders.The world\' s biggest CO2 emitters are China at 14.1 billion tons, the US at 5.7 billion, India at 3.4 billion, the EU at 3.3 billion, Indonesia at 1.8 billion, Russia at 1.6 billion and Brazil at 1.5 billion. Iran is the 9th worst emitter.Greta Thunberg summed the COP26 up as a  failure and as a  global north greenwash festival .In the September meeting of the UN General Assembly President Xi made some widely lauded promises to begin China\' s road to net-zero.However, the subsequent energy crisis which struck China shortly thereafter and which worsened in October, resulted in the carbon pledges being thrown out of the window, as the People\' s Republic of China has doubled down on coal.Even though coal is the dirtiest source of global carbon emissions, in which China is the chief culprit, (48% of world emissions) China has called for an acceleration in the construction of new plants domestically, and even considered reversing its pledge to stop building and financing new plants outside China.China, like South Africa and Brazil, is relying on its  developing nation status to entitle it to more leeway in the implementation of attaining  carbon neutral emissions even by 2050.When about 100 heads of state attended, South Africa belatedly sent its environment minister, Barbara Creecy, who seemed to second guess the terms of the R131 billion in funding offered by the EU, the UK and the US to move away from coal.For the 12th worst carbon polluter, it is unconscionable for South Africa to duck and dive and shirk its climate responsibility commitments.For professors Mzukisi Qobo and Busani Ngcaweni of the Wits School of Governance to argue that  African countries (including South Africa) should maintain an energy mix rather than follow the lead of Europe and that African countries should not radically decommission their coal and other energy resources, because that will pose a threat to energy security in view of the criticality of the climate crisis is simply immoral. To argue that as a  developing country South Africa still needs time to catch up is a load of hogwash and convoluted.South Africa has a long history of industrialisation from the 1880s and has contributed excessively to the climate problem and to global warming and now needs to come to the table using the latest green technologies that are available to meet the net-zero commitments that the planet requires.Another faulty conclusion they reach is that following the Independent Power Producer Programme of 2011, green technology offers no job creation.The only reason this programme failed is because the government micromanaged it and set excessively onerous conditions, making it unappetising for investors.Even in its new iteration where licences have been issued to independent power producers for 100MW, government red-tape is stymieing its implementation.According to Thomas Garner, chairperson of the South African Independent Power Producers,  there is no policy consistency, the messaging is mixed, the industry doesn\' t know what direction we want to take in South Africa .We have a cabinet minister, Gwede Mantashe, still mired in obsolete thinking married to carbon to drive our power production.The time for excuses and exemptions is long past. The US and other compliant nations should recognise that any regime that has no sense of obligation to the world it is polluting should be isolated and boycotted.The urgency of the situation as expressed by Thunberg is that we need to achieve immediate, unprecedented, annual cuts and that  small steps in the right direction simply equals losing the battle against climate change.Instead of finding excuses justifying a  just transition, or begging for funds, we need to grasp the opportunities that new technologies offer to find solutions to leapfrog us into a net-zero emitter.\l"

At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, they pledged to mobilise $100-billion a year by 2020 to support vulnerable developing countries in tackling climate change and its impacts. This commitment was reaffirmed at COP21 in Paris in 2015.But the money never arrived.""The promise has not materialised, and even if it were to materialise, the $100-billion per year would still be grossly inadequate,"" says a statement adopted by African delegates in Cape Verde.That's why the AGN will be demanding that COP26 delivers on this promise. In fact, the negotiators are going even further, arguing that at least 50% of all available climate funds should go towards climate change adaptation in Africa.Home to 17% of the global population, Africa contributes less than 4% of global emissions. Already Africa is experiencing warming of 1.8\'b0C, according to the HYPERLINK https://public.wmo.int/enWorld Meteorological OrganisationThis is costing the continent between 3% and 9% of annual GDP as countries are forced to pay for adaptation measures themselves, the AGN's research has shown.The funding gapThere are other barriers that prevent African countries from accessing the funds necessary to finance adaptation measures.

It was more akin to a Cold War and a post-colonial mindset.Such are the small margins in COP speak. Never will the use of the right or wrong words impact the daily lives of millions in the world as they are translated into weaker climate action policies or used as a smokescreen for self-defeating inaction.It brought the genteel Alok Sharma, president of COP26, to tears, stressing that he was  deeply sorry for how events had unfolded.Messrs Biden, Xi Jinping, Putin, Modi and Morrison \- not exactly candidates for next year\' s Nobel Peace Prize \- need to examine their conscience for their criminal abdication of responsibility in tackling the defining threat of our age.That today\' s youth are cynical and apathetic about mainstream politics, especially those pertaining to climate action, is no surprise.It is they, their offspring and grandchildren who will have to deal with the future consequences of inaction and vacillation of today\' s leaders.Who can blame them for being strident and dismissive of their current leaders? Some of their demands may be contrary to the institutional and corporate vagaries of the status quo, whose drivers are essentially the politics of elections, wealth creation, pursuit of unfettered profit and legacy.Climate mitigation has largely been a policy of aspirations rather than any meaningful transformative actions across the societal and sectoral spectrum. Respected climate activists and NGOs are even more scathing. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the gatekeeper of the COP process, admits that post-COP26:  We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe it is time to go into emergency mode \- or our chance of reaching net zero (emissions) will itself be zero. The truth is that climate action is not yet a major vote winner, otherwise democracies all over would have thriving Green Parties in power.Even the Covid-19 pandemic has conspired by giving governments convenient cover in resource allocation priorities.Spare a thought for those whose future existence is threatened by global warming and rising sea levels \- small island states such as the Maldives, Marshall Islands and Antigua and Barbuda.  We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5\'baC and 2\'baC is a death sentence for us, laments Shauna Aminath, Maldives environment minister.The COP exercises have made some progress. But the world cannot afford a step-by-step approach dragged out to suit the narrow politics and economics of major historical and contemporary polluters. For India\' s Climate Minister, Bhupender Yadav, to ask how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they  still have to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication is as offensive and ill-informed as it is politically motivated.The minister should put that question to millions of his hapless compatriots who suffer from the devastation of perennial floods, droughts, air pollution and the like.How telling that Delhi residents this week are under a self-imposed  house arrest because of the poor air quality as a result of crop stubble burning in northern India by farmers.Like viruses, climate change is not a zero-sum game! If we follow the science, the latest IPCC Report on Climate Change 2021 could not be clearer:  It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. To twist a quip by an ex-US president:  It is the lack of consensus and urgency, stupid. The moral ambiguity and deficiencies of the COP process could not be better put than by John Kerry, a US special climate envoy. He is obfuscated by the policy ambiguities of his boss, President Biden, and the institutional scepticism and pushback by the US Congress and Senate, partly beholden to the powerful fossil fuel and coal lobbies.Kerry notes that some $2.5 trillion went into subsidising oil, gas and coal over the past six years. This at a time when rich nations failed to meet the $100 billion goal of annual finance for poorer nations struggling to adapt to the climate crisis. That\' s the definition of insanity. We\' re feeding the very problem we\' re here to try to cure. It doesn\' t make sense. Another insanity is the much-heralded  agreement between Biden and Xi Jinping last week to co-operate on climate action. A day later, the very same President Biden signed legislation that stops companies judged to be a security threat from receiving new telecoms equipment licences.It means equipment from Huawei, ZTE and three other Chinese companies cannot be used in US telecoms networks. This will not amuse the Chinese strongman.As for the future, the baton for COP27 is passed on to Egypt, one of Africa\' s largest polluters.Under the Glasgow pact countries have agreed to meet in 2022 to pledge further carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the elusive 1.5\'baC goal.

South Africa\' s expectations from COP26 are high. It is our expectation that as we are playing our part in the global climate change effort and have raised the level of our ambition, other nations should so the same. We will also affirm our position that developed countries have a responsibility to assist developing countries to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. He said nations of the world urgently needed to slow down the rate of global warming and tackle the effects of climate change. While the discussions taking place on the other side of the world may seem far removed from the issues that matter to voters in our local government elections, the reality is that the agreements reached at the global climate summit affect the daily lives of all our people. They affect many of the issues that featured prominently in the election: electricity, water, jobs and housing, among others. The extreme weather events that we are experiencing as a result of climate change affect the health, lives and livelihoods of people in every country, including our own. While we are undertaking national efforts to achieve greenhouse gas emissions targets, it is equally important that we combat climate change through local actions. At local government level, we need to integrate climate change considerations into service delivery planning. This needs to be in areas such as the design of human settlements, in energy management though solar water heating for low-income households, and in the use of renewable energy in municipal water and wastewater infrastructure. He added that recent amendments to electricity regulations that allow municipalities to buy and generate their own power were expected to lead to a greater uptake of renewable energy technologies over time.Ramaphosa said air pollution remained a major concern for a number of vulnerable communities, particularly those in close proximity to areas of industrial activity.  We have improved air quality management over the years, putting norms and standards in place to regulate, manage and control air quality. He said environmental conservation and climate action have the potential for new business development and to support job creation on a large scale, including through public employment programmes. Under the first phase of the Presidential Employment Stimulus, we supported thousands of beneficiaries in environmental management, sustainable land management and ecosystems conservation programmes. Communities that are safer, healthier and climate change resilient are key to our collective future. Even as actions are taken at a national level and decisions made on the global stage, adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change is our shared responsibility. | Mercury Correspondent\l"

That was the first time I paid attention to the event and I thought the acronym was related to the Danish capital, where it was held.That the Copenhagen COP ended in acrimony is ironic because the Danes are masters at finding consensus. They haven't had a majority government since 1909. Coalitions get the job done.The Danes have also since 2009 done more than any other nation to move towards the goals that are routinely spouted at COPs but rarely acted on. The world could learn from Denmark.Since the energy crisis of the early 1970s Denmark has transformed its energy sector. GDP has grown more than 100% since 1980 but energy consumption is unchanged. The country earns billions of euros in green exports.In 2020, 80% of the country's power came from renewables, but it has not been immune to recent energy shocks because calm weather has idled wind power and droughts in Norway have cut hydropower output. But the trajectory is clear. Denmark is showing the way.Francis Fukuyama wrote that the goal for liberal democracies should be to get to Denmark. His focus was on the rule of law, accountability and the state's efficiency. I've been visiting and watching Denmark since 1976 and I've learnt some surprising things about this country of fewer than 6-million people.Think of an economic sector and there's a Danish giant: audio, Bang & Olufsen; beer, Carlsberg; chemicals, Haldor Tops\'f8e; engineering, Ramboll; industrial equipment, Danfoss; logistics, DSV; pumps, Grundfos; shipping, Maersk; toys, Lego. The Bjarke Ingels Group is the world's trendiest architectural firm.What used to be the state oil company, \'d8rsted, is now the world's biggest offshore wind power company. No wind turbine manufacturer is bigger than Vestas.And this is a country that some US politicians sneeringly call & socialist& In fact, Denmark has a sophisticated social support network. High taxes finance a comprehensive system and the social compact means successful businesses don't have to worry about causing a social catastrophe if they lay someone off.Some aspects of Denmark are truly astonishing for South Africans. Like the group who heard an industry leader proclaim: & As Danes, we love to pay tax.& Denmark has a tax minister, and a climate change minister.So how did Denmark get to Denmark? I'm persuaded by the theory that choices made during the Reformation have something to do with it. The theory goes that Calvinism (as pursued in the US) encouraged a kind of capitalism where the role of the state was rejected, whereas in Lutheranism the role of the state (or crown) was seen as benign. One of the taxes paid by Danes to this day is kirkeskat (church tax).Workers' rights, co-operatives and a national education movement were the other building blocks of the modern social democratic state.I have always found it odd that such an egalitarian, democratic country should be so staunchly royalist, but there are many things about Danes that defy easy generalisation. They fly the national flag everywhere but are the opposite of nasty nationalists. They are hip and modern yet they sing folk songs at the drop of a hat. The Confederation of Danish Industry supports tougher environmental legislation.Danish design is the epitome of simplicity but a Danish open sandwich is more elaborate than a wedding cake. That Danes love liquorice just defies belief.The politicians and activists who left Copenhagen's COP15 in December 2009 were depressed. The architects who visit the city next year for the world congress of the International Union of Architects will find a city well on the way to reaching its targets of being among the world's most liveable cities while at the same time being carbon neutral and adaptable to climate change.Denmark is trying to get to an ever better Denmark.State of the art: The Mountain Dwellings, designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group State of GreenGreen living: A bicycle bridge in Copenhagen.

It will usher in major changes affecting our lives and those of future generations.-Such developments will impact non-profits (NPOs) and social justice organisations by introducing both new opportunities and new risks. NPOs should inform themselves and plan accordingly. Here are five key factors NGOs need to consider and plan for in the context of climate change: 1. Risk mitigationBoards of non-profits need to provide oversight and accountability in relation to how climate change is built into their organisation s strategy and thinking. Assessing risk is about identifying which assets of the organisation may be exposed to risk; the particular risks to which those assets may be exposed; and the possible impacts of such exposure.An organisation may be functioning smoothly at present but as Covid-19 has shown us, circumstances can change and an NPO could find itself in a precarious situation. It is vital for management and the Board to be attentive to both internal and external environments, and areas of risk, and to take precautions. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/222189.html :EMBED-->2. Responsible investingIt is time-consuming for NPOs to review where they place their investments. Collectively, where non-profits invest their money makes a difference in the world. Identify responsible investment strategies and practices that fit your organisational culture and are congruent with ethical investing in the space in which your NPO operates.Consider withdrawing investments from areas where there is incompatibility. The Inyathelo Board, advised by its Finance Sub-Committee and financial investors, resolved in December 2020 to divest from fossil fuel, alcohol and tobacco holdings. These securities were sold during the 2021 financial year.3. Educate stakeholdersThere is a need to inform and educate staff, managers and Board members on the impact of climate change. Empowering your people will equip them to make informed decisions and take purposeful action concerning the organisation and its programmes.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/222149.html :EMBED-->4. Ensure internal sustainabilityDonors who support non-profits in the climate education and advocacy sector wish to fund NPOs that are well-governed, financially robust and have a high success rate in meeting targets on time. In short, NPOs need to be sustainable themselves if they are to make a meaningful impact over the long term.Inyathelo teaches an integrated approach, known as Advancement, to position an organisation to attract funding support. The ten elements of Advancement are leadership, governance, strategy and planning, financial management, fundraising, human capacity, relationship building, monitoring and evaluation, voice and visibility. 5. Prepare for COP27Africa hosts the 27th climate summit next year at Sharm El Sheikh on the Red Sea in Egypt. This leaves only 12 months for NPOs to plan and prepare on how to contribute and make an impact.Our planet is in crisis and NPOs need to both adapt internally, and step up and play a part as catalysts for change. Risk assessment, responsible investing, education, sustainability and strategic planning will position them to contribute in a meaningful way.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

And for African countries and poor developing countries, the implications and the cost of adaptation and building resilience is enormous,"" Creecy said.""We want to make sure that of the finance that's available, half of it must be for adaptation, and half for mitigation.""Because in developing countries, for many of them, the major problem they face is an adaptation problem rather than a mitigation problem.""Developed nations have not honoured a $100bn commitment to fund an energy transition in emerging economies. But this is in any case inadequate.Creecy said Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) research suggests developing countries will need $3-trillion to $4-trillion to finance adaptation and mitigation. ""But we are not seeing the developed countries coming to the party with regard to the finance,"" she said.""We need to start with a floor of $100bn. We need to start to move that floor to $750bn a year by 2030.""The problem is not just lack of finance. There is no secure financial stream reaching developing countries for adaptation. SA also wants to address article six of the Paris Agreement, which it believes should be leveraged to ensure a share of proceeds from carbon trading is used to finance adaptation.""We don't think that it's possible to rely on voluntary contributions to deal with adaptation. We need a secure and predictable means of financing and we think it could be achieved under Article 6.2,"" said Creecy.Also to be addressed are technical issues regarding differing formats, transparency and time frames. ""It's very important that we're all using the same accounting system, so that we are able to compare apples with apples,"" Creecy said.The question of mitigation is likely to colour discussion heavily as nations face pressure to significantly reduce their carbon emissions targets. SA will deliver on this front as it recently committed to a far more drastic emissions cut under its cabinet-approved ""nationally determined contribution"". In terms of execution, Creecy said what can be achieved beyond the minimum commitment depends on the financial support for SA.While some have been left wondering how SA's new emissions targets - as well asa possible accelerated decommissioning of coal plants - gels with the government's energy policy and continued commitment to coal power, Creecy said the policy implications and required actions would be tackled as several ministerial work streams have been set up to address aspects of the revised nationally determined contribution.While pro-coal comments from mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe have sent mixed messages to the public, Creecy said Mantashe's concerns revolve on energy security, valid concerns as there are many instances of developed countries that rushed into decommissioning now experience ""energy complexities"".She also said that it is important to ask questions about how SA would be supported if it takes a decision to abandon its vast coal wealth.The revised nationally determined contribution is a cabinet decision, which binds ""all cabinet members and all departments"", Creecy said.steynl@businesslive.co.za\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa47","COP26 on climate: Top priorities for Africa","July 26, 2021 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","United States President Joe Biden on 22 and 23 April this year hosted the Leaders Summit on Climate. According to the White House, the summit aimed to ""galvanise efforts by the major economies to tackle the climate crisis"". Leaders of 40 countries, including five from Africa, participated in the virtual event.-The event was an important milestone, ahead of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP26), which will take place in Glasgow this November. The five African leaders who participated in the Leaders Summit emphasised the indispensable role the continent must play in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They were presidents F\'e9lix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon; Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya; Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa.At COP26, the African Group of Negotiators will echo the African leaders. We will speak with one strong, clear and single voice in Glasgow. We will maintain that COP26 will succeed only if Africa is at the heart of the negotiations. In fact, under the UNFCCC, putting Africa at the heart of the global climate agenda is a binding obligation.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/700/217297.htmlhttps://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/700/217297.html :EMBED-->Extraordinary attention neededAfrica s situation deserves extraordinary attention: the continent contributes just 4% of global total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the lowest of any region, yet its socioeconomic development is threatened by the climate crisis. In other words, Africa contributes the least emissions but suffers the brunt of the consequences.For example, in addition to the effects of the climate crisis such as food insecurity, population displacement and water scarcity, more than half of African countries are likely to experience climate-related conflicts. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the annual adaptation costs in developing countries, currently estimated at $70bn, will rise to $300bn by 2030 and $500bn by 2050. At the same time, African governments currently spend between 2-9% of their GDPs to fund adaptation programmes.-Unique needsAt COP26 in Glasgow, countries will launch an adaptation goal and adopt a strategy for achieving such a goal. Glasgow, therefore, presents an opportunity to recognise and address the unique needs and circumstances of Africa. There are several ways to do this, including the following:First, the developed countries must avoid shifting their climate responsibilities, particularly regarding their cumulative GHG emissions, to developing countries. Also, the developed economies should lead with clear targets for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Second, based on the commitments and obligations under Article 4 of the UNFCCC, developed countries must mobilise and provide adequate climate finance resources and transfer environmentally sound technologies to African countries. Third, the Covid-19 crisis must not derail the climate finance agenda. A massively scaled-up and more progressive multilateral response is required to address the climate crisis, and finance is at the heart of it. At COP26, countries must agree on a finance architecture, including an agreement on the continuation of long-term climate finance (LTF) under the UNFCCC. This should be in addition to the launch of a new finance goal under the Paris Climate Agreement.Fourth, developed countries must pledge to meet their pre-2020 climate finance gap of $100bn. The $100bn per year should be the floor, not the ceiling, and continuing efforts must be made to determine and meet the needs and priorities of developing countries.Meeting in the UK in June, the G7 nations rightly renewed the pledge they made in 2009 to contribute $100bn annually to help poor countries cut emissions. Since 2009, however, scientific research shows that more needs to be done in mitigation and adaptation.Fifth, at COP26, negotiators must recognise that the conditional parts of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) represent the most ambitious contributions to the Paris Agreement on climate change, and these require climate finance resources that should be accessible through bilateral and multilateral channels. Lastly, Africa needs additional support for its initiatives, including the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) and the African Adaptation Initiative (AAI). The continent needs grants, not just loans that exacerbate its debt burden. Rising debt and the Covid-19 pandemic have weakened poor countries capacity to tackle the climate crisis.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/216278.html :EMBED-->Our prioritiesIn sum, Africa s priorities for include adaptation, climate finance, a market mechanism (Article 6), ambitious NDCs, a transparency mechanism, meeting pre-2020 mitigation commitments and recognising Africa's unique needs and circumstances. Market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement should help raise ambition on mitigation actions, support sustainable and green development in African countries and provide finance for adaptation. Unfortunately, the transparency mechanism of the Paris Agreement was without an outcome at COP25. It needs to advance at COP26. The transparency mechanism should capture progress and achievements in both action and support; it should be a tool to enhance climate action and ambition while supporting developing countries to build and maintain national transparency systems to meet the reporting requirements enunciated in the Paris Agreement.Crucially, there should be an increase in international support for Africa s adaptation and mitigation programmes and initiatives. Current reductions in official development assistance by developed countries will weaken the capacity of poor countries to fight the climate crisis.'Close to a climate emergency'We are close to a climate emergency; therefore, the same attention and resources directed at Covid-19 should be deployed to tackle the threat of climate change. Just like the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change has no border. For Africa, the pandemic presents a unique opportunity for a green recovery. The African Group used the occasion of the virtual UN Climate Change subsidiary bodies sessions (SBs), which took place from 31 May to 17 June 2021, to synergise their positions on a range of issues. Additional SBs in or before Glasgow may be necessary to enable prioritisation of the agenda items on adaptation, technology transfer, among others.It will be the turn of Africa to host the COP27. It will take place in November 2022 in Egypt. The success of COP26 will provide Africa the necessary fillip as it prepares for the subsequent COP. Africa is eager to partner with the developed countries to ensure an ambitious outcome at COP26. We cannot afford to fail.Article republished courtesy of Africa Renewal.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

Meanwhile, everybody boasts about what they will do to cool down our planet, but there is a disjuncture between talk and action. Even Queen Elizabeth II of the host country, the United Kingdom, has grumbled publicly that not enough action is taking place on climate change.In the Southern Africa region, the SADC's member countries are clear that the developed countries must stump up the money to help them deliver their promises to reduce carbon emissions and carry out a raft of measures to combat global warming. All the SADC countries are signatories to the Paris Agreement.The region has joined the cry of other African countries that the continent suffers most from climate change but hardly contributes to the causes of the phenomenon - emitting less than 4% of the world's greenhouse gasses.According to research undertaken on behalf of the UN, climate change adaptation needs for Africa were estimated to be $715 billion ($0.715 trillion) between 2020 and 2030.In southern Africa, each country has its own Nationally Developed Contribution plan for dealing with climate change, including costs. Of course, funding will be needed to achieve these goals. Developing countries have pledged a $100bn annual target to help the developing world tackle climate change. All the Southern African countries will need a slice of this funding. The Green Climate Fund was established under the Cancun Agreements in 2010 as a dedicated financing vehicle for developing countries.In the lead up to COP26, the fund is under scrutiny. Tanguy Gahouma, chair of the African Group of Negotiators at COP26, has said: ""African countries want a new system to track funding from wealthy nations that are failing to meet the $100bn annual target.""The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates this funding stood at $79.6bn in 2019. OECD data reveals that from 2016-19 Africa only got 26 percent of the funding.Gahouma said a more detailed shared system was needed that would keep tabs on each country's contribution and where it went on the ground.""They say they achieved maybe 70 percent of the target, but we cannot see that,"" Gahouma said.""We need to have a clear road map how they will put on the table the $100bn per year, how we can track (it),"" he said. ""We don't have time to lose, and Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions of the world.""Denmark's development coordination minister Flemming M\'f8ller Mortensen has warned that only a quarter of international climate finance for developing countries goes to adaptation.COP26 may turn into a squabble over money and perhaps an attack on developed countries as they are blamed for creating the problems of climate change in the first place by using fossil fuels for the last two centuries. G20 countries account for almost 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Again, it is all about the money. Many developed countries do not want to change; their economies (and their rich elites) are wedded to fossil fuels. There are also problems with paying for adaptation. Will the rich countries fund the developing countries to green themselves up?Professor Bruce Hewitson, the SARCHI Research Chair in Climate Change Climate System Analysis Group, Dept Environmental & Geographical Sciences at the University of Cape Town, told IPS: ""The well-cited meme that Africa is the continent most vulnerable to climate change impacts is true, as is the common response that Africa needs external aid to implement adaptation and development pathways compatible to climate mitigation. However, such messages hide a myriad of political realities about the difference between what is ideal and what is likely.""Hewitson argues that what emerges from COP26 is an exercise in hope and belief.""It's a tightrope walk trying to balance competing demands and self-interests. At the end of the day, Africa will need to pragmatically deal with a compromised outcome and face the climate challenges as best possible under limited resources,"" he says.If Africa goes to COP26 with a begging bowl attitude, it could face the risk of dancing to the strings of the powerful and rich nations.""Climate change impacts Africa in a multiplicity of ways, but at the root is when the local climate change exceeds the viability threshold of our infrastructural and ecological systems. Hence, arguably the largest challenge to responding to climate change is to expand and enable the regional capacity of the science and decision-makers to responsibly steer our actions in an informed and cohesive way; Africa needs to lead the design of Africa's solutions,"" says Hewitson.While he argues that some of the best innovation is happening in Africa, it requires resources, and the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased international funding.""Each community has unique needs and unique challenges, needing unique local solutions that are context-sensitive and context-relevant, and this will inevitably include the pain of some socio-economic and political compromise.""The southern African region's climate woes chime with the problems faced by a legion of developing countries. We have Mauritius's threatened Indian Ocean islands, Seychelles, Madagascar, Comoros and those offshore of Tanzania and Mozambique, plus many thousands of miles of coastl"

The decisions they take now will determine whether the promises and pledges made in Paris in 2015 are kept or broken.And at least four countries- China, Australia, Russia and India - have yet to make new pledges to cut their emissions. Australia, however, came up with an eleventh-hour announcement this week.The impending hazards also threaten animal and plant species, coral reefs, ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica, and projects a sea-level rise that threatens the very existence of the world's small island developing states (SIDS) which can be wiped off the face of the earth.Will COP26Addressing a press conference October 26, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres predicted a ""catastrophic global temperature"".""Less than one week before COP26 in Glasgow, we are still on track for climate catastrophe even with the last announcements that were made. ""The 2021 Emissions Gap Report shows that with the present Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other firm commitments of countries around the world, ""we are indeed on track for a catastrophic global temperature rise of around 2.7 degrees Celsius.Now, even if the announcements of the last few days will materialize, ""we would still be on track to clearly more than 2 degrees Celsius. These announcements are essentially about 2050 so it is not clear how they will materialize but even if these recent announcements would materialize, we would still be clearly above 2 degrees Celsius.""As the title of this year's report puts it: ""The heat is on."" And as the contents of the report show -- the leadership we need is off. Far off, he said.""We know that humanity's future depends on keeping global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030. And we also know that, so far, parties to the Paris Agreement are utterly failing to keep this target within reach.""And the report also shows that countries are squandering a massive opportunity to invest COVID-19 fiscal and recovery resources in sustainable, cost-saving, planet-saving ways.So far, the report estimates that only about 20 per cent of recovery investments will support the green economy.As world leaders prepare for COP26, this report is another thundering wake-up call. How many more do we need? Guterres askedJuan Pablo Osornio, Senior Portfolio Manager, Global Climate Politics, at Greenpeace International, told IPS: ""The science is very clear, we need urgent, dramatic and constant emission reductions if we are to stay with the 1.5 oC limit.""When governments come to Glasgow, he said, they will feel the pressure to act.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa50","COP26 - Avoiding Carbon Tunnel Vision: Action On Climate Change Needs an Inter-Connected Response","November 10, 2021","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","With the UN climate change conference - - continuing this week in Glasgow, it's obvious that there is consensus among a majority of world leaders and key stakeholders that much more needs to be done, if the ambition of keeping global warming to a 1.5-degree increase is to have any chance of being met. Yet talk, as they say, is cheap. Or, in the words of Greta: too much ""blah, blah, blah"" and not enough action.Responding to the global climate crisis demands a global response, with public commitments backed up by resources and collaboration. We cannot have countries or organizations working in silos.And we cannot de-couple climate considerations from the broader sustainability agenda, as exemplified by the Sustainable Development Goals - and SDG 13 (climate action), in particular.Widening perspectives to understand all impactsIf we achieve net-zero emissions yet overlook human rights, or fail to safeguard biodiversity, what will this mean for the wellbeing of people and planet?At Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), we provide the global common language for organizations to communicate their impacts. The GRI Standards broadly address a company's impacts on the economy, environment and people, in a holistic and comprehensive way.That is why, through GRI's engagements at COP26 we have focused on how sustainability reporting can inform decision-making that achieves faster action on climate change and related sustainability issues.At the heart of this is strengthening and highlighting the synergies between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. It will only be through concerted and connected action on these commitments, informed by evidence and data, that we can seize the opportunities for an inclusive and sustainable future for all.Collaboration between public and private sectorsEncouragingly, the Climate Confidence Barometer, published in September by WBCSD and FREUDS, highlights that 98% of companies surveyed reported confidence that they will meet net-zero targets by 2050. In addition, 55% are confident that the global business community will do so as well.However, the transition does not stop at emissions; as identified in a recent report from the Future of Sustainable Data Alliance, there is a 'ESG data hole' when it comes to biodiversity and nature. KPMG research from December 2020 also found that less than a quarter of large companies at risk from biodiversity loss disclose on the topic.In this context, GRI's plans to launch a new Biodiversity Standard in 2022 are timely and much needed, while October's UN Biodiversity Conference set the stage for work to resume next year to adopt a post-2020 global biodiversity framework.Action that delivers tangible resultsHowever, it is encouraging that well over 100 countries (representing over 85% of the world's forests) have signed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, committing to work collectively to halt and reverse forestry loss and land degradation by 2030, while promoting an inclusive rural transformation.This is a commendable vision - but we need to hold all parties to these commitments.To secure tangible results - from safeguarding the environment to wider progress on the sustainability agenda - the action needs to start today. It cannot become a carte blanche to maintain 'business as usual' until 2030.Regular and comprehensive reporting on sustainability impacts, with accountability from all organizations with an involvement, is essential to measure progress.Effective sustainability reporting offers a unique perspective on the role of the private sector, helping countries to work towards the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. While a multi-faceted approach is needed to reach these goals, we should be no means downplay the significance of reaching net-zero.It is not a matter of either/or - we need to dramatically cut emissions and secure broader sustainable development in the process.It's time for true leadershipThere are strong signs that business is already convinced of the urgency of the situation - and is, in fact, pressing governments to do much more. The We Mean Business Coalition call to action urges the G20 to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C. It has been signed so far by 778 business leaders - representing US$2.7 trillion in annual revenue. Furthermore, one-in-five companies around the world have set net-zero targets.Last week, WBCSD launched a manifesto that calls for a new 'Corporate Determined Contributions' mechanism to measure the private sector's role in the global climate recovery. With a core focus on the imperatives to reduce, remove and report GHG emissions, this reflects a growing and welcome trend of responsible companies pressing for greater influence in support of climate action.As COP26Tina Nybo Jensen is International Policy Manager at Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

In preparation for that, the South African government decided to decrease emission levels and hosted climate envoys from the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU to discuss a possible coal retirement plan. Renewable energy is the future. There is no doubt about that, but how just is the transition for citizens who would have to lose jobs?A new spectre faces developing nations with rich G7 Nations incorporating climate change into its new green capitalism model, that if not checked will erode the prospects for industrialisation in the Developing World. South Africa\' s manufacturing base is already at its lowest point, and job shedding continues unabated with major power cuts the  new norm .Eskom is scrambling to find finance to operate and keep the lights on, let alone transition away from coal to solar and wind. Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, the traditional energy\' s most powerful backer, has rightly described giving up coal as  economic suicide as mining is the bedrock of manufacturing, and therefore, industrialisation and structural transformation. No successful nation has skipped this economic phase. Nevertheless, Western corporations are eager to enter South Africa\' s energy market with new renewable green technologies. Electricity prices soared to record highs in Britain as a period of still weather is curbing wind power, exposing the UK\' s reliance on intermittent renewables. Ironically, their ability to meet peak demand shrinks as coal and nuclear power stations close early. Two coal units at West Burton had to be turned on as the weather system bringing warm temperatures suppressed wind around the UK\' s turbines. While the UK has been moving away from coal power, it is still used in reserve to provide stability to the national grid. Among EU nations, Germany has been the most aggressive in pursuing a renewable energy future. But last month, faced with a coal and natural gas crunch, it woke up to the reality that after investing half a trillion dollars on the plan, it does not have the capacity to bottle up enough weather-dependent power to hold out even for a few fossil-fuel-free hours. In France, nuclear power makes up 78% of the energy generated, and renewables 19%. France and other countries like Sweden and Bulgaria have a high nuclear component in their power grid. Nuclear power is zero-emission. It has no greenhouse gases or air pollutants; it is green indeed. One such proposal is simply to liberalise  environmental goods and services , including public utilities like water and sanitation. Another such proposal is the EU\' s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is projected to have little impact on emissions but will cause disproportionate export decl"

The webinar series explores key topics around awareness of COP26 outcomes and related climate-change issues among South African directors. The webinar was held with the historic agreements reached at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow from 31 October to 13 November in mind an event that had important implications for governments and businesses worldwide. Essentially, new codes, standards and frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the International Financial Accounting Standards (IFRS) Foundation s proposed sustainability standards will fast become important for directors and executives, along with international and national green-tax structures and regulations that are either in effect already or about to be finalised. Environmental outcomes see expansion<!> While the survey conducted by the IoDSA on its members revealed a marked improvement in data received, in relation to that received from the first Trialogue webinar, 48% of respondents still said they had limited to no engagement with COP26 and its outcomes, and only 48% considered South Africa s concessional climate finance deal with the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany to be relevant to their own businesses.Alarmingly, only 21% of respondents considered the JSE s net zero by 2050 commitment to be relevant to their business, and only 28% considered the decision by the G7 and G20 to stop financing foreign new coal projects to actually affect them. Additionally, fewer than 8% of respondents were fully aware of SA s green taxonomy, only 10% were aware of SA s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), 18% were aware of the National Treasury s Sustainable Finance Initiative, and less than 33% knew about COP26 taking place in the first place.These results point to a very limited understanding among survey respondents of the full range of implications of the diplomatic agreements reached at COP26.

SA introduced the first phase of the carbon tax in June 2019 as part of the government's broader climate change mitigation policy. This first phase, which makes provisions for companies to receive 60%-95% tax allowances such as rebates or exemptions, was scheduled to end this year, but the Treasury has now announced that it will be extended by three more years up to the end of 2025. The Treasury said in the 2022 budget review that by extending the first phase of the carbon tax to 2025 the transitional support measures afforded to companies in the first phase to reduce the carbon tax burden, such as significant tax-free allowances and revenue-recycling measures, would also continue over this period. ""The first phase of the carbon tax, with substantial allowances and electricity price neutrality, will be extended to December 2025,"" finance minister Enoch Godongwana said in the budget speech. The carbon tax is only levied on companies and state-owned enterprises emitting more than a certain level of emissions and the decision to extend the first phase of this tax is good news for the biggest emitters, such as Eskom, Sasol and smelters such as ArcelorMittal, that will now have more time to transition their operations to cleaner technologies. But it does place a question mark over the feasibility of meeting SA's ambitious new climate commitments that were made by the government at COP26 in Glasgow last year. To better enable the country to meet emissions targets, the Treasury was widely expected to remove a lot of the flexibility allowed under phase one of the carbon tax from 2023. SA will now be under more pressure in the latter half of the decade if it intends to stick to the targets that have been set. This delayed urgency is reflected in the Treasury's new plans, according to the 2022 budget, to ramp up the carbon tax during the second phase of the carbon tax which will now start in 2026.

The transition will include investments in renewable projects and other innovative technical developments, and in areas such as electric vehicles and green hydrogen.Valli Moosa, deputy chair of the Presidential Climate Commission, which advises the government on how to mitigate climate change, says during the next six months a financial consortium that will include developmental finance institutions from participating countries will work out the details of the deal and how it will be administered.Once all parties have agreed to terms and conditions, funding will likely start being released during the second half of the year.""This is a proper finance facility with a number of components,"" Moosa said.Discussions about the transition started early this year. ""A lot of work has already been done. The process is not at the beginning stages. We are quite advanced - I think the time frames are realistic. We have to put these details to the financing consortium,"" said Moosa.The concessionary elements of the deal will be provided by the governments of the countries that have committed the funding and their state finance institutions, he said.The commission will be ""completely opposed to a programme that is dictated to us by somebody else. The programme must meet our national needs and interests. That's how it is going to be. We will communicate our view to the government, which will be doing the detailed negotiations of the deal.""He described the partnership for a just transition as a game-changer.""SA has a desperate need to reindustrialise and realise higher levels of economic growth, and that won't happen by looking at old technology. It will happen with new technologies, renewable energy efficiency.""SA intends to decommission and repurpose or repower coal-fired power stations, invest in new low-emission generation capacity such as renewables, increase energy efficiency and pursue green industrialisation such as manufacturing using green technology and a shift to the production of electric vehicles.According to a statement issued by the UK High Commissioner, to limit the effects of climate change the international community needs to collectively halve global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, while strongly reducing other greenhouse gas emissions.Moosa said SA's exports ""will face challenges and will become more and more uncompetitive if our exports have much higher carbon content than others"".Even though there are no border adjustments now, ""we will be short-sighted to assume carbon border adjustments are not coming. Already the global customers for our export products are demanding that the carbon content of those products be reduced,"" he said.Funding of new energy efficiency solutions will cater for communities that will be affected by the closure of coal power plants.Simon Nicholas, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said it is important that the initial suggestions about concessional refinancing of Eskom in return for earlier coal power plant closures have since expanded to include funding for new developments in electric vehicles and green hydrogen that can create new jobs with a better long-term outlook than jobs in coal.This agreement provides a framework for a just transition to occur - much will depend on making sure the technology transition really is just for South African communities.Lebogang Mulaisi, labour market policy co-ordinator at Cosatu, said at the Business Day Dialogues webinar that unions would want to be part of the social planning and design of the programmes that will be targeted at communities that rely on coal power stations.""The social and labour plans are going to be of critical and key importance. Issues of jobs will be key and we want to see how well that can be factored into such transitions,"" Mulaisi said.""If we want workers to transition they will need skills, and this needs to be embedded in the design and planning.""Nicholas said that in the longer term a switch from reliance on ageing and badly maintained coal-fired power plants to reliance on smaller, widely distributed wind and solar installations backed up with power storage will produce a much more reliable power supply than SA has at present.He said a switch from reliance on coal-fired power to reliance on ever-cheaper renewables will see the cost of power generation drop.This should result in cheaper power tariffs for South African consumers, including businesses, helping them to thrive and support jobs across the economy.The funding of new energy efficiency solutions will cater for communities that will be affected by the closure of coal power plants.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa59","Academic group slams energy transition plan","March 29, 2022 Tuesday","Daily Dispatch (South Africa)","Several academics have criticised the framework being developed to guide SA's transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy for being unrealistic and ignoring SA's institutional and structural challenges. Analysts from the Academy of Science of SA (ASSAf) are concerned that the just transition framework, being developed by the Presidential Climate Commission, will meet the same fate as the National Development Plan and get stuck in the planning phase. The multi-stakeholder commission was appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to advise on SA's ""just transition"" towards a less carbon-intensive energy sector. ASSAf president Prof Jonathan Jansen, of the University of Stellenbosch, said the language in the draft didn't ""match the reality in which we live"" and paid no heed to the ""rampant disintegration of society"" in SA. He referred to phrases like ""the just transition can create a more jobs-rich, equitable and inclusive economy"", and queried how this would be possible when ""hospitals, schools, post offices and other institutions were falling apart"". The document also lacked reflection on mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe's perceived resistance to moving SA away from coal-fired power, said Jansen. SA, the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter in Africa and the 12th largest globally, committed at COP26 last year to have GHG emissions peak in 2025 at 510-million tonnes and to reduce them to between 350-million tonnes and 420-million tonnes by 2030. According to Thuli Khumalo, COO of the Presidential Climate Commission, the framework was aimed at a scenario in which decommissioning coal-fired power stations starts by 2025, and by 2050 there would be no more energy generated from coal and gas. The ""just transition"" posed a major risk for workers in Mpumalanga where 12 of Eskom's coal-fired power stations, and Sasol's coal-to-liquid refinery were based, said Saliem Fakir, director of the African Climate Foundation.

These were two different worlds. Everyone was committed to saving the planet, but there were highly diverging views about how to do it.The contradictions were all too apparent at the conference, known as COP26. The hired exhibition spaces were hosted by fossil fuel polluting countries and sponsored by large corporations. Corporate spin, also known as greenwash, abounded. There were a few African delegations with their own space and a vanishingly few civil society voices in the main venue.Meanwhile, the discourse was very different in parallel fora. Here the talk was of inequality, climate justice and reparations. The focus was on radical transformations of systems of production and consumption. Many were critical of business-led and market-based solutions to climate change.There was passion, and a real sense of anger about the main conference. Huge suspicion around the corporate takeover of the climate agenda swirled, with much commentary on the double standards of the UK hosts, still proposing a new coal mine and oilfield as part of a so-called  transition .As a researcher working on pastoralism as part of a European Research Council-funded project, I was at the COP, together with a delegation of pastoralists from different parts of the world, all linked to the World Alliance for Mobile Indigenous Pastoralist Peoples. We were definitely on the fringe of the fringe.When I managed to find a few events in the Blue Zone (not an easy task) relating to our research, they were mostly extremely disappointing. There were parallel conversations going on. If climate change is genuinely a shared challenge for all of humanity, dialogue between different viewpoints is vital.Within the main conference, there was much talk about trees and  nature-based solutions , for instance. The mainstream media hailed the agreement on deforestation, but a significant part of this simply replicates the failed programmes of the past. Under such programmes, forest protection in the global south is used as carbon offsets for polluting companies, and the rich, consuming public in the north.The huge ecosystem restoration efforts being proposed potentially cause real problems for pastoralists. This is because large areas of open rangelands are earmarked for tree planting and biodiversity protection through exclusion. These so-called nature-based solutions are frequently new forms of colonialism, opening the gates to  green grabbing , where land and resources are appropriated in the name of environmental conservation.So how do these two worlds intersect? Everyone is keen on nature. No one wants catastrophic climate change, but why are the solutions so divergent? At root, the two camps (and many in between) have different views on the role of capitalism in climate change.For those in the Blue Zone, a long-term shift from reliance on fossil fuels is (largely) accepted. But capitalism in its new green guise, many argue, can save the day through technology investment and market mechanisms \- and notably through the plethora of offsetting schemes that make up the net-zero plans.By contrast, critical civil society and youth voices argue that capitalism is the root cause of the problem, together with its handmaiden colonialism. The only solution, therefore, is to overhaul capitalism and dismantle unequal global power relations. But how, through what alliances?I, of course, had very limited exposure to the simultaneous events. But my sense was that there was little meaningful interchange between different positions. Two worlds talked past each other or \- because of restricted access, problems with visas and the high costs of attending \- never even met.Scoones is a Professorial Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa62","Carbon tax goes up, emitters get more time to clean up","February 28, 2022 Monday","Daily News (South Africa)","Following a decade of consultation and public debates, South Africa introduced a carbon tax in June 2019. Treasury faced strong opposition, especially from energy intensive businesses. But the country\' s ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement in November 2016 signalled the government\' s commitment to responding to climate change and gave impetus to implementing the carbon tax.Burning fossil fuels for electricity production accounts for the largest share of South Africa\' s carbon emissions, followed by transport, and the industrial production of materials such as cement. Coal makes up 75% of the country\' s primary energy supply. It\' s not surprising, then, that South Africa is among the top 15 largest per capita emitters in the world.Numerous modelling exercises were conducted to determine the appropriate carbon tax rate, which started at a base rate of R120 (currently less than $8) a ton carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) emissions. This compares poorly with international standards of $40 to $80 a ton by 2020. And as a result of all the tax-free allowances built into the carbon tax calculation, the effective rate could be as little as R6 ($0.4) per tCO2e emissions.Treasury acknowledged that this rate was low, but wanted to allow large emitters time to transition to cleaner technologies. The rate was increased annually by inflation plus 2% and reached R134 per tCO2e by the end of 2021.The urgency of the climate crisis was overshadowed by the Covid-19 pandemic for a while. Nevertheless, the government displayed a renewed climate focus over the past year.First, a Presidential Climate Commission was created to chart a pathway for a net-zero, climate resilient economy by 2050. Next, the Cabinet approved the National Climate Change Bill for tabling in Parliament.In the run-up to the 26th international climate change conference (COP26) held in Glasgow in November 2021, South Africa raised its targets for greenhouse gas emissions. These are contained in the revised Nationally Determined Contribution submitted under the Paris Climate Agreement.COP26 resulted in a  watershed moment in South Africa\' s energy story. The EU, France, UK, e US and Germany pledged funding of R131 billion to South Africa. This climate financing is meant to help South Africa phase out its use of fossil fuels, especially its heavy reliance on coal, and phase in renewable energy.This month, two important policy spotlights have focused on South Africa\' s carbon tax. First, the Climate Change Bill was formally introduced in Parliament on February 18. It heralds an  effective climate change response and a long-term, just transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy .Second, the National Budget Speech on February 23 provided more clarity on issues that affect carbon taxpayers. Here are the main points:Carbon tax rate increase: The finance minister announced an increase to the carbon tax rate to R144, effective from 1 January 2022. To uphold South Africa\' s COP26 commitments, the rate will increase each year by at least $1 until it reaches $20. From 2026, government intends to escalate the carbon price more rapidly every year to reach at least $30 by 2030, and $120 beyond 2050.Delaying the roll-out of the second phase: The carbon tax is being implemented in three phases, with the second phase originally scheduled to start in January 2023. But the finance minister extended the first phase by three years until December 31, 2025. Until then, taxpayers will continue to enjoy sizeable tax-free allowances which reduce the carbon tax liability. Although the minister did not provide reasons for pushing back the next phase, this might have been done to give taxpayers more time to navigate the complex carbon tax regime.As a result of delaying the second phase, some sectors will remain beyond the reach of the carbon tax for now. These include agriculture, forestry and other land use and waste sectors, as well as Eskom. Eskom had factored in the projected cost of the carbon tax in its proposed 21% increase in electricity prices. It remains to be seen if it will now accordingly reduce the price hike.The Climate Change Bill will make it compulsory for taxpayers to participate in the carbon budget system: This process allocates a greenhouse gas emissions allowance to an emitter for a specific period. The company\' s actual emissions arising from its operations should stay within the budgeted allowance.Emitters that have participated in the voluntary carbon budget system are entitled to an additional 5% tax free allowance. Once carbon budgets become mandatory, this allowance will fall away. Those who exceed their mandatory budgets will pay a tax penalty. The finance minister also announced the following tax changes:The tax incentive for energy efficiency will be extended to December 31, 2025. This tax benefit aims to encourage investment into cleaner technologies which improve energy usage. When the National Treasury introduced the carbon tax in 2019, the intent was to avoid passing on the added cost of the carbon tax to consumers through higher electricity prices and more expensive goods. The Budget speech announcements have ensured that electricity prices will be buffered against the carbon tax until December 31, 2025.Industries or companies whose international competitiveness could be hampered by the carbon tax, especially when it comes to exports (the mining sector, for example), get a trade exposure allowance. It can reduce their liability by up to 10%. The minister has now increased the threshold for this to kick in, making it more difficult for some companies to achieve the maximum allowance.The finance minister warned companies that they would encounter  steep taxes if they failed to put in place plans to reduce their emissions over the coming decade.The Climate Change Bill needs to be enacted soon to put the country back on track to decarbonise on time.This article was first published in HYPERLINK http://www.theconversation.comwww.theconversation.com\l"

The continent is particularly vulnerable to the threat of climate change and is already susceptible to some of its adverse effects.-Across the continent, businesses, industries, societies, and the natural environment are under threat from rising global temperatures caused by extremely high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. In August 2021, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Sixth Assessment Report stating that the rate of surface temperature increase has been more rapid in Africa than the global average, with human-induced climate change being the dominant driver.<!--EMBED:bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/221614.html :EMBED--> Alongside climate change, Africa faces many interrelated challenges: economic disparity, water scarcity, food insecurity, poverty, a lack of local and government policymaking, as well as weak governance and a lack of capital flows and access to climate finance. Climate change exacerbates and complicates these and other challenges.Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions and build resilience to the accelerating impacts of climate change, in Africa and worldwide. PwC s Net Zero Economy Index 2021<!> shows just how fast the world needs to reduce the carbon intensity of our activities - 12.9% a year<!>. Currently, we are achieving less than a fifth of that rate. It is notable that even with the hard lockdowns across the globe, the world has still not achieved the annual required decarbonisation rate to limit global warming to 1.5 C, falling short by more than 10%. Considering Africa s vulnerability to climate change, this is certainly not enough progress.We recognise that action must happen now and that significant steps must be taken by 2030<!>. From COP26, we want to see ambitious commitments that put the world on a 1.5-degree<!> trajectory, with the goal of halving global GHG emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050.To achieve that goal, we need to harness the power of the market. Presently, capital is not flowing at a sufficient scale or speed towards addressing the biggest challenges the world faces in terms of both mitigation and adaptation. Things are changing, but too slowly. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/221435.html :EMBED-->Currently, there is limited progress on climate finance in Africa. In 2009, developed countries committed to deliver $100bn annually in climate finance by 2020 to less developed countries. To date, this commitment has not been delivered fully; sub-Saharan Africa has received just 10% of approved multilateral climate funds since 2003. For instance, much of the funding that South Africa has received is Clean Technology Fund (CTF) supported, including the Eskom renewable energy programme. The government of Kenya has estimated that USD40bn would be needed by 2030 to meet its nationally determined contribution (NDC). To date, Mauritius has received USD81m from the Green Climate Fund. Nigeria has developed a CTF investment plan for an expected $250m to contribute to national strategies for sustainable, low carbon development.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa67","5 ways Africa can prepare for COP27","February 15, 2022 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","Before delegates from around the world gathered in Glasgow, Scotland, in November for the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference, (COP26), the event was being referred to as 'the last best chance' for resolving climate change.If we were to assess the Glasgow Climate Pact as a decisive turning point, then our assessment would be that of failure. However, that does not mean all is lost. Certain doors have been opened, even if we are yet to walk through them. The next COP will be held in Egypt in less than a year. This is the chance we must take. There is global momentum on climate action, even if political action is still lagging.The reality is that expectations were already subdued, even before delegates descended on Glasgow, because on the two main issues - progress on net zero commitments to slow global temperature rise, and the finance to support low carbon development in the developing world - the cards were already dealt by the G20, and key emitters, even before any delegate badges could be collected at the Scottish Exhibition Centre venue on the banks of the River Clyde.Besides all this, some significant milestones were reached. The first commitment to phase down coal and other fossil fuels; the acknowledgement of loss and damage; and the creation of technical steps to address it; doubling of adaptation finance; a commitment to halt deforestation; and the finalisation of the rulebook on Article 6 facilitating carbon trading, all represent long-standing technical issues that have moved forward tentatively.However, these technical advancements do not translate into climate action. Glasgow commitments still leave us on track for warming by 2.4\'b0C. The latest assessment on financing showed an ongoing gap of $20bn per annum to reach the $100bn target for climate finance.And for African countries, over 2\'b0C of warming means a loss of GDP of around 5% per annum by 2030, according to analysis by the African Climate Policy Centre. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/224458.html :EMBED-->Glasgow reconfirmed the difficulty in making headway on finance, and the reality is that the $100bn unfulfilled promise represents only 0.4% of the total global finance mobilised to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic in less than two years.The biggest reason for pessimism after Glasgow is that the record on implementation is low. The Paris Agreement, ultimately, is built around commitments by individual states. Commitments have not been met. Thus, even as commitments in Glasgow fall short, the question is: will even these insufficient commitments be upheld?Pessimism is an important instrument for building realistic intervention. Therefore, despite the gaps of COP26, which are part of the struggle of multilateralism, here are five key considerations that can help us prepare for COP27 aimed at building practical climate resilience interventions for African countries:1. With the right support Africa can deliver a green recoveryAfrica s rise and impressive growth at the turn of the century was built on the back of commodity exports and new global trading opportunities. However, this growth has not built sustainable and resilient value chains, and an urgent revamp is required for Africa to avoid a lost decade. Analysis by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has found a stronger correlation in jobs created and gross value addition in the economy by pursuing investment in green sectors as opposed to investment in fossil-fuel based sectors. Return on investment in case study countries showed up to 420% better returns in gross value addition and up to 250% better returns in job creation from investment in sectors such as renewable energy, climate smart agriculture and nature-based eco-tourism than in fossil fuel-based sectors. In renewable energy, African countries are both critical as opportunities for investment in access - with 24 out of 54 countries having less than half the population reliably connected to electricity - as well as essential actors in the value chain with many of the critical minerals essential for battery technology found on the continent. There will be no global green recovery unless Africa is part of the investment package.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/224173.html :EMBED-->2. Upfront finance is keyAfrican countries need reliable financing options to be able to invest upfront to maximise return on investment. As demonstrated in the global study from Nick Stern in 2020, the multiplier effects are higher the sooner an intervention is put into place. ECA analysis also illustrates that Africa may have lost up to five percentage points in growth due to delayed investment of stimulus in 2020. Channelling investment into areas like renewables and transport infrastructure are further economic multipliers and can lead to a virtuous investment cycle.African countries are overly dependent on external financing - donor driven or from foreign direct investment. The lack of development of local capital markets means that this scenario is likely to continue, although a strategic injection of seed finance in the right sectors can be transformative. On the overall global finance goal, African negotiators called for an annual target of $700bn in Glasgow. The African Development Bank (AfDB) estimates that African countries nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will represent an investment opportunity of over $3tn by 2030. It may be useful to have a goal that is specific to how much finance should be made available as grants and soft loans and more flexible targets (which should not be limited) for private finance goals. This is particularly relevant as the conversation on on-lending of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) gains momentum, as providing the right liquidity to Africa and the rest of the developing world will be key to Covid-19 recovery and resilience to climate change.For Africa, being able to effectively deliver private sector climate finance will be predicated on the right upfront support - whether through blending or partial guarantees. In any case, Africa is currently lagging in terms of access to private sector climate finance, attracting less than 3% of global private sector climate finance. Africa and the Middle East combined also issue less than 1% of the total number of green bonds globally. Further unlocking green and blue bond markets will be an important step for Africa.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/223583.html :EMBED-->3. Africa s energy grid is the key to unlocking growthIn terms of mitigation, Africa is already net positive, being home to 17% of the world s population while being responsible for less than 4% of global emissions.Based on technologies currently available, and on Africa s demography, emissions on the continent are bound to rise. This is why the Paris Agreement recognises that developing countries will take longer to peak emissions than developed countries, who must do their fair share to mitigate climate change. African resilience will be best achieved by adopting renewable energy pathways and developing national and regional value chains around the manufacturing and deployment of such technologies. Crucially, Africa has been affected in recent years by fluctuating fossil fuel prices - both producing countries and net importers. Coherent long-term investment in renewables can stave off these risks and allow more predictable costs of doing business. This is critical both for the industrialisation of the continent and to further unlock the potential of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).A just transition for Africa will also require recognition that some additional base generation will be required for rapidly upscaling investment in renewables. For example, if Africa was to double its electricity generation using only natural gas, that would allow a multiplication of solar and wind investments by 38 times, with only a 1% increase in global emissions.The transition deal concluded by South Africa at COP26 providing financing to help transition away from coal may also provide a framework example replicable in other countries, of how to use external support to re-orientate the energy sector and avoid getting trapped in stranded assets .4. Resilience through adaptation is critical for economic viability Adaptation is chronically under-resourced in the fight against climate change, hence the commitment in Glasgow to double climate adaptation financing. Upfront adaptation investment reduces long-term investment costs. As illustrated in the Global Centre for Adaptation s 2021 State and Trends report, the cost of intervening in adaptation through agriculture is estimated at $15bn per year, which represents less than 10% of the $201bn estimated annual cost of paying for disaster relief and recovery after floods, droughts, and similar environmental disasters.Case studies undertaken by ECA, which feature in the report, show clearly that investing in adaptation-related projects associated with critical sectors such as agriculture can bring fantastic returns on investment in terms of both value addition throughout the economy and job creation.- In South Africa, a return of over 150% can be achieved by rehabilitation and investment in parks, while agroforestry and reforestation initiatives bring returns of over 100%.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a return of up to 450% is possible by investing in irrigation and associated adaptation measures.- In Kenya, a return of over 200% is possible from the use of resilient seeds in agriculture and similar returns are also possible by rehabilitating and investing in natural parks.5. Africa should be rewarded for being net positiveCOP26The peatlands of the Congo Basin alone sequester the equivalent of three years-worth of global emissions. Meanwhile, seagrass meadows and mangroves, which feature on both Africa s Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean coasts, are proven to sequester 2-3 times more carbon than tropical rain forests. The concern is that while Africa has some of the highest remaining forest cover, it also has the fastest rate of deforestation of all continents. Thus, without care and attention, Africa s carbon sinks can become sources of emissions. Crucially, investing in protecting these carbon sinks can also be linked to opportunities to create sustainable livelihoods. Ethiopia s Green Legacy tree planting programme is an interesting example of how environmental rehabilitation, which is aimed at reducing erosion and the impact of flooding, can also be used to generate livelihoods. For instance, planting fruit trees that bring returns for communities, while addressing energy needs, thus reducing the pressure for deforestation for firewood and creating new opportunities for value addition. Gabon is also ambitious in proposing increased value addition for its sustainable timber resources, providing protection for forests while also increasing livelihoods for communities.Assessments done by ECA in partnership with Dalberg have demonstrated potential financial flows of $15-30bn with carbon prices aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement. Several African countries have also spoken after COP26 of the desire to develop an African carbon market, allowing African countries to leverage their natural capital and channel flows into adaptation and resilience.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/222356.html :EMBED-->Limitations of multilateralismIn conclusion, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as COP26, have underl"

Bamboo may be nature's perfect plant. Strong, light and durable, it can be used to create a wide variety of functional and beautiful products, Noordin said on the company\' s website.  It is all natural and easily renewable, and it helps promote an environmentally friendly and healthy lifestyle. Noordin added that every renewable bamboo bicycle on the road reduces the number of vehicles clogging our crowded roadways, which helps improve air quality for everyone.Before taking the leap into launching the business several years ago, Noordin had worked as an electrician, and it was during this time that he did a two-week course on building bicycles at the Entrepreneurship Institute of Technology which sparked the idea.What is special about using bamboo? At the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year, sustainability was at the core with  managing potential impacts on the environment and local community being one of the sustainability governing principles in \' s bid for carbon neutrality.And for Boogaali Bikes, it is a step ahead of the curve in trying to solve one of the environmental problems the world is having as bamboo is a natural renewable resource, and its rapid growth avoids future deforestation.The sustainable product is 100% biodegradable which means it won\' t cause serious harm to the planet and the bicycles will not take a lot of energy to manufacture and produce, such as those made from aluminium, carbon or steel.The bamboo is harvested during the sunny season when the plant is around three years old and is strong enough to be transformed. The bamboo then gets treated with an insecticide due to the bamboo weevils that chew it from the inside. We always monitor with the measuring scale after every two weeks, and then we take the records of how the bamboo is losing weight and how it\' s losing the humidity, Noordin said during an interview with the BBC.Once ready, the bicycles are manufactured on demand as orders are all custom-designed and factor in the weight of the customer.An additional advantage is that the frames are relatively light, weighing between 1.8 and 2.1kg. Once the order has been placed with the exact specifications, a selection takes place on which bamboo tubes will be used, as a person weighing 80kg will require a bigger diameter and bigger hole thickness to accommodate their weight.Boogaali Bikes custom-builds road, adventure, gravel and mountain bike frames that provide a quality of ride with exceptional vibration dampening characteristics. It takes 10 to 15 days to produce a frame, which cost in the range of $200 to $500 (R3 057 to R7 645). Noordin said they tried to produce artistic pieces. While his frames sell well in Uganda and parts of East Africa, his primary market is in Europe and the US. \l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa71","A four-minute guide by a climate scientist","November 6, 2021","Insider Saturday","COP26, which is taking place in Glasgow, is the latest in a series of meetings through which the world\' s governments attempt to deal with climate change.This was set up in 1992 to organise a global response to what most people then called the  greenhouse effect . It\' s COP26 simply because this is the 26th meeting.The location of COP meetings changes each time. The last meeting was in Madrid in 2019. There was no COP last year due to Covid-19. The most important COP so far was the 2015 meeting in Paris, which agreed to  limit global warming to well below 2\'baC, preferably to 1.5\'baC, compared to pre-industrial levels .It\' s possible to set a target like this because scientific research has recognised a close relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide in the global atmosphere and its average temperature.In order to achieve the target of well below 2\'baC, preferably 1.5\'baC, the Paris Agreement committed to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century .The main task for COP26 is to follow through on the commitment and produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that hold 21st-century global warming as close to 1.5\'baC as possible.As you can imagine, getting 197 countries, all with their own circumstances and interests, to agree to such plans isn\' t exactly straightforward: after all, it took 23 years to get to the Paris agreement. Most famously, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement when president, although it returned after Joe Biden\' s election. There is some uncertainty about how successful COP26 will be.The main method for reducing emissions is the Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country: these are individual countries\' climate action plans. For example, the UK\' s most recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.The main problem facing COP26 is that the combined NDCs of all the parties aren\' t enough to meet the 1.5\'baC target of the Paris agreement. If you combine all the plans and promises contained in the NDCs, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.4\'baC by the year 2100 and if you look at emissions now, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.9\'baC by 2100.There is a need for much-improved NDCs, plus effective ways to ensure that countries cut all the emissions they pledged to. One of the most important ways is for wealthy countries to provide financial support to enable less wealthy countries to cut emissions, which was an important part of the Paris Agreement but hasn\' t been fully acted on yet.COP26 matters because the window is quickly closing on the Paris Agreement\' s 1.5\'baC target: if emissions don\' t fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon would have been added to the atmosphere to keep the temperature from rising higher. Emissions need to be halved by 2030 to have about a 50:50 chance of keeping to 1.5\'baC. The longer the world delays before cutting emissions, either the harsher the cuts will need to be to meet the target, or the target will be missed altogether.The Paris Agreement matters because a 1.5\'baC world is safer than a 2\'baC world. For example, the proportion of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every five years is almost three times higher at 2\'baC compared to 1.5\'baC. The reduction in maize harvests in the tropical regions is more than twice as great at 2\'baC and coral reefs would be largely eliminated.If COP26COP26 as part of the long-term project to keep Earth as safe and habitable as possible for all its people, and the more successful it is, the easier that will be.This article first appeared on theconversation.comLoad-Date:\~November 6, 2021\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa72","President Cyril Ramaphosa: CAHOSCC Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change","South African Official News"," ","Good Morning,It is my pleasure to address this meeting of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change.The COVID-19 pandemic has set back back multilateral processes, including around climate change.It is imperative that we do not lose momentum, and that climate change is not relegated to the periphery of the global development agenda.Africa is experiencing the worst impacts of phenomena associated with global warming such as droughts, floods and cyclones. Climate change impacts are costing African economies between 3 and 5 per cent of their GDP's. Despite not being responsible for causing climate change, it is Africans who are bearing both the brunt and the cost.It is with pride that we can say that Africa spoke with one voice at COP26 in Glasgow late last year.A number of key outcomes and successes were achieved.The conclusion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme which will provide a basis for Parties to implement fully the Paris Agreement, in the context of a Just Transition and Sustainable Development, and leaving no one left behind.The complex Glasgow Climate Pact strives to strike the right balance by accommodating the differing national circumstances and capacities amongst the nearly two hundred Parties. The aim is that all are enabled and empowered to contribute their fair share as well as to enhance their climate ambition.Glasgow further sends a clear signal that the world will be safer under the 1.5 degree temperature rise scenario, compared to 2 degrees or more.Developed economy countries have agreed to support the implementation of Just Transitions that promote sustainable development, poverty eradication, and the creation of decent work and quality jobs.Much more work needs to be done for Africa and the world to keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.It is still of concern that the necessary financial flows to enable developing economy countries in particular to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change remain vastly inadequate.Africa's Special Needs and Circumstances need to be recognized globally because of our natural resource based economies, and owing to high levels of poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment.Such a decision will unlock the necessary financial flows to our continent as we embark on Just Transitions towards a low-carbon future.As we prepare for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP27 taking place in the Arab Republic of Egypt in November, Africa must once more speak with one voice, expressing their unwavering support for the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, and for the primacy of multilateralism.COP26 recognizes our right to develop our own development pathways towards shared global objectives, based on our national circumstances and the guiding principles of the UNFCCC. Foremost amongst them is equity, and the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities.We must promote and defend this, as well as the right of all African and other developing countries to support in the form of finance, technology and capacity building.A one-size-fits-all approach to complex issues such as a transition from fossil fuels that disregards the realties on the ground in Africa will simply not work, and is neither just nor equitable.To achieve the expected results for Africa at COP27, it is imperative that we develop a strong and well-coordinated Common African Position, and that we formulate a set of robust key messages that encapsulate Africa's aspirations.Most importantly, we must continue to work together in the spirit of unity and solidarity.I wish to take this opportunity to highlight some of the achievements mentioned in this report, namelyThe finalization of the African Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan 2022-2032 that will be launched during this meeting.

Equally important is to start the process for determining a new and more ambitious post 2025 finance mobilisation goal from developed countries for developing countries from a floor of US$ 100 billion per year,' Creecy said at briefing in Pretoria on Friday.The Minister acknowledged that talks regarding financing will not be easy, bearing in mind differences in what both developed and developing nations believe is required to finance climate change mitigation plans.The Minister, however, warned that the transition is expected to be a 'just' transition, which takes into account the impact, which the reduction on coal dependency will have on communities and some businesses.Investment in climate changeShe announced that South Africa, together with three other countries, has been selected to take part in the Accelerating Coal Transition Investment Programme, formulated by the Climate Investment Funds (CIF).The CIF has made an indicative amount of between $200 million and $500 million available to the country in grant financing to assist in the transition towards cleaner energy.The actual funding, Creecy said, will be dependent on the kind of investment plan the country can present to the CIF.She revealed that the plan would focus on the State's power utility, Eskom.'Our government is in the process of setting up a high powered Finance Workstream, focusing on our Just Transition, which will develop this investment plan.'We see the decision by the CIF as a small but important first step towards laying the foundation work for the broader financing programme of our Just Transition. The focus of this investment plan [will] be the Eskom energy transition, including repowering and repurposing of retiring coal plants and investment in new low carbon generation capacity,' the Minister said. - SAnews.gov.za\l"

""We know SA is bankable.""The funding for the state-owned power utility adds to an $8.5bn commitment by the US, the UK, Germany, France and the EU at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November to help it reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.Eskom's ability to move away from coal, which it uses to supply more than 80% of the country's power, is vital to meeting the government's ambitions to tackle climate change.Details of the Eskom funding plan are still being finalised, though it will not add to SA's debt, Adesina said.The AfDB pledge is a major boost for President Cyril Ramaphosa, who initiated a drive four years ago to secure R1.2-trillion of new investment by 2024 to bolster economic growth. Before Thursday's gathering, the government said it had secured 152 investment commitments totalling R774bn, with 45 projects at or near completion and 57 under construction.Among pledges announced on Thursday are:A plan by Ford Motor to spend R16.4bn expanding its manufacturing capacity;An R11.8bn investment by African Rainbow Minerals in two new platinum mines;Impala Platinum's intention to spend R50bn on new capital projects over the next five years;Sedibelo Platinum Mines plans to spend R9.4bn on expanding production; Waterfall Management's commitment to invest R18bn in commercial and residential property; andAn undertaking by Telkom to spend R7bn on telecommunications infrastructure.The New Development Bank also committed to providing an additional R21.7bn in financing. The government is making headway with structural reforms to make it easier to do business, including opening up the freight rail system to private investors, addressing power shortages, cutting red tape and selling broadband spectrum to reduce telecom costs, Ramaphosa said in his opening address to the conference.""We meet at a moment when our country, like many others, is facing huge challenges as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, yet it is also a moment of great opportunity and promise,"" he said.

This is concerning. Cities are responsible for over 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet cities can also do a lot to mitigate climate change and help people adapt to its impacts. Cities can use renewable energy sources, promote greener transport, and get industries to cut pollution and adopt cleaner production techniques. Also, they can form or use existing networks and partnerships to strengthen these efforts.Almost 1 billion children \- nearly half the world\' s children \- live in countries that are at extremely high risk of climate change impacts.Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on children\' s rights to health, life, dignity and education. Also, climate change increases the risk of exposure to violence against children. Climate-induced disasters displace people, and limit access to schools, adequate water and nutrition. Unicef has drawn attention to the fact that  the climate crisis is a child rights crisis .Recently, children have taken the lead in global campaigns like School Strike for Climate and Fridays for Future in more than 7 500 cities. Children are calling on politicians to take action.Central governments are often criticised as too distant and detached from everyday realities. Whereas, city governments are closer to, and in a better position to deal with local challenges, needs and priorities. Cities are empowered by national and local laws to govern on issues concerning children and in climate-related areas. Thus, they can plan and deliver what\' s needed to address local climate challenges.In a recent study, I explored how city-level climate law and policy protects children from climate change. The study used Kenya and South Africa as key examples. City governments have constitutional and legislative autonomy and obligations in climate-related functional areas such as water and sanitation. These laws and policies don\' t always specifically mention children, but I argue that cities can do more to protect children from the impacts of climate change.Are children at the centre of climate action?The South African Climate Change Bill empowers municipalities to adopt climate change response plans at the local level. In particular, to co-ordinate climate action in their jurisdiction, including mainstream climate change responses in their development plans.The constitutions of Kenya and South Africa have explicit provisions dedicated to children\' s rights. Although these constitutional children\' s rights do not speak to climate change directly, the spectrum of rights guarantees children protection from the impacts of the climate crisis.Despite these obligations of city authorities over climate action, in reality the challenges of children do not always get attention in plans, budgets and interventions at city level. This is a reality in many other cities in Africa.The gains of child-led climate actionIn 2019, for the first time, children filed a legal complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child about the failure of their governments to take firm climate action. The children noted that they lived in cities such as Cape Town, Lagos (Nigeria) and Tabarka (Tunisia) where the impacts of climate change are on the rise.The communication was considered inadmissible, meaning it could not be heard on the merits. Yet it was ground-breaking in making it clear that children are key actors in climate change action, deserving a seat at the table of decision-making.The acceptance of children as key co-decision makers in climate governance is evident in their participation in global forums such as the 2021 climate conference \- COP26. But, without robust action and engagement of children at local government level, the commitments become empty noise.Considering the trends in urbanisation, child urban population, and the climate crisis, I would urge cities to: Expressly provide for the rights of children in climate action, particularly in law, policy and strategies. Open or expand institutional spaces for children to participate and contribute to climate action at city level. This could include sporting and fun activities, or forums, for children to be engaged on the climate discourse at community level. Invest technical and financial resources to ensure children have access to updated climate change educational material in child-friendly versions, and in languages they understand. Support child-led initiatives and campaigns. This could include capacity building, resource mobilisation, and guidance on climate action. Upscale leadership and co-ordination of action in a child-responsive and child-sensitive approach, including in climate-induced disasters. The best interests of children should be the guiding principle. | \l"

SA's new target - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - is for annual greenhouse emissions to be kept at between 371 and 420 megatons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. This is less than those contained in previous proposals by the department of environmental affairs, which had suggested a target range of between 398Mt and 440Mt. The presidential climate commission recommended the target to reduce emissions be even more ambitious - in the range of 350Mt to 420Mt. The commission, which presented its first report to President Cyril Ramaphosa in July, called for SA to decarbonise faster than the government had proposed to mitigate climate change risk and the prospect of being punished by trading partners, which have warned that they will penalise carbon-intensive economies and products in the future, with dire consequences for exporters such as the automotive sector. More than 60% of vehicles produced in SA are exported, mostly to Europe. The European Commission has proposed a border tax on imports of carbon-intensive steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers and electricity, as it seeks to meet its own targets. The faster path for SA will imply a faster decommissioning of Eskom's coal-fired power stations than previously planned. The power utility, which supplies virtually all of SA's energy, is still heavily reliant on coal to generate electricity. Accelerating the reduction of greenhouse emissions will also depend on large industrial emitters making mitigation efforts, as well as changes in agricultural and land use policies and support from international development finance organisations. The impact of the energy transition on industry, the economy and jobs, particularly in the coal and energy sectors, is deemed manageable by the presidential commission, which believes that job losses can be offset by gains in new sectors. Unions have mostly opposed the acceleration of renewable energy because of its implications for their members employed in fossil fuel sectors. Under the Paris Agreement on climate change signed in 2016, all parties are required to deposit NDCs every five years. SA deposited its first NDC in October 2015. The cabinet also said it had approved the submission of the National Climate Change Bill to parliament. The bill seeks to provide a legal instrument towards the implementation of the National Climate Change Response Policy. Cooling towers at the Kendal power station in Mpumalanga.

Yes, we need climate change mitigation.But for the people who are most marginalized, the impacts of climate change are already severe and worsening, necessitating an expansion of climate resilience interventions too.Women, particularly in climate vulnerable countries in the Global South, are set to bear many of the worst impacts of the climate crisis. More than half of people displaced by climate change are women and girls, and climate shocks reduce women's life expectancies more than men's on average.Poverty is increasing women's climate vulnerability even further. Women are more likely to experience extreme poverty than men, and women in extreme poverty often lack the resources and tools to bounce back from the economic impacts of climate change, facing exclusion from social policies and programs.Climate change will continue to exacerbate these inequalities, driving up to 132 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 due to rising food prices, health shocks, and natural disasters.But these disasters are not ""natural"". Climate change is human-made, and we as an international community can take the steps needed to support preparedness, mitigation, adaptation, and recovery efforts.Countries can prevent the worst impacts of climate change on their most vulnerable populations through increased funding and focus on building climate resilience for those furthest behind in our current system, including women in extreme poverty.But how can we make climate resilience policies and programs more inclusive and effective?In our experience advising on interventions at the intersection of extreme poverty, gender inequality, and climate change at BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Initiative (UPGI), we have identified three key learnings.First, policies and programs must actively seek to identify the most marginalized households to ensure their inclusion. To enable women in extreme poverty to build climate resilience, development actors must first reach them.This population is often excluded from existing social protection programs, with 79 percent of the bottom quintile of earners in low-income countries receiving no social assistance whatsoever.By specifically targeting people (predominantly women) in extreme poverty with a multi-step process tailored to local data, needs, and capacity, climate resilience programs can bring previously unreachable populations into government safety nets.To empower marginalized households to build resilience specifically for climate shocks, interventions should factor in an analysis of which households are most climate vulnerable, combining this with other methods including an analysis of the enabling environment (including existing infrastructure, programs, policies, and social norms).This is just one example of the ways development actors will need to consciously target excluded populations on the basis of both climate and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as climate shocks worsen. Second, interventions must be adapted to local needs. For climate resilience interventions to have an impact on women in extreme poverty, they need to take into account local contexts, markets, and challenges.For example, in drought-prone regions of Kenya, people in extreme poverty are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change as many rely on raising livestock. Their livelihoods are threatened by worsening droughts, especially women and youth.Between 2016 and 2019, the Government of Kenya and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) partnered with BRAC, CARE Kenya, and The BOMA Project on a climate-adaptive Graduation program in Kitui and Samburu provinces to strengthen the resilience of women, youth, and their households to climate shocks.The program encouraged participants to maintain multiple sources of income and to save for economic and climate shocks to minimise their risk of losing livelihoods. As a result, over 80 percent of households had at least two income sources at the end of the intervention.In Kairouan, Tunisia, women in extreme poverty are especially vulnerable to climate risks such as increased frequency and severity of extreme weather, changes in temperature and precipitation, and increased soil erosion.To address these risks, the Tunisian government has partnered with IFAD and BRAC on a Graduation program identifying climate-adaptive, gender-sensitive livelihoods for participants that are designed for the local context and providing training on saving, diversifying incomes, and withstanding climate shocks.By taking into account local climate vulnerabilities and challenges for women in extreme poverty, climate resilience programs can empower them to not only withstand climate shocks, but also build long-term livelihoods and savings which enable them to create a path out of the poverty trap and prevent them from falling back into it.Third, constant learning through evaluation and iteration is crucial to impact. To develop and scale effective approaches which combat climate-induced poverty, the international community needs to increase their support and commit significantly more resources to evidence-based interventions.Development actors and their research partners should also take an iterative approach, evolving programs over time based on findings from internal and external evaluations in parallel. By regularly reevaluating program design and delivery, implementers can not only improve impact at scale, but also become more responsive to changes in the local context.This is particularly crucial for interventions aimed at building climate resilience for marginalized populations, as it enables programs to constantly adapt to climate impacts on programming.At BRAC UPGI, we see every day how worsening climate shocks have the greatest impact on the people who contribute the least to climate change and have the fewest resources to recover from them.This COP26To advance toward the Sustainable Development Goals and uphold obligations to their people, they need to back policies and programs which protect the people who are most marginalized from the worst impacts of the climate crisis and enable them to build resilience to endure future shocks by designing programs that meet their multidimensional needs.Julie Kedroske is Acting Director of Technical Assistance, BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Initiative. Originally founded in 1972 as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee and later known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, BRAC's operations have grown globally and with that growth, the organization is now simply known as BRAC.Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau\l"

Actors often say that their craft is about listening, and C'mon C'mon turns that art up to 11: While tweens and teens hold forth about their dreams, anxieties and anger about everything from their families to impending environmental doom, Phoenix\' s Johnny listens intently, his boom mic keeping a discreet distance, his eyes fixed on subjects who seem to come alive under his attentive gaze.That same energy comes into play days later when Johnny travels to Los Angeles to visit his sister Viv (Gaby Hoffmann) and her 9-year-old son Jesse (Woody Norman). Jesse\' s father has moved to Oakland, California, but is descending into one of his periodic bouts with bipolar disorder; Viv asks Johnny to look after Jesse while she tends to her ex, a sojourn that will eventually turn into an Oz-like journey to New York and New Orleans.Fans of Kenneth Lonergan\' s bittersweet uncle-nephew dramedy You Can Count on Me will recognise some similar thematic DNA in C'mon C'mon,which was written and directed by Mike Mills. And, like that earlier film, this movie is less about the exploits of an adorable moppet and his worldly-wise older relative than the brother-sister relationship that hovers just around the edges. Johnny is entranced by Jesse, a precocious kid who listens to opera and whose wise-child asides would make J.D. Salinger proud. But inevitably, Jesse acts like any impulsive, self-involved, bratty third-grader, at which point Viv must act as a long-distance interpreter, which includes such 21st century concepts as how to do a proper repair after an argument.In other words, Johnny \- who is unhappily single and mostly friendless \- is learning another 21st-century concept: how to  adult . And in a gentle, thoroughly present performance that feels light-years away from the histrionics of Joker and other outings, Phoenix returns to the kind of unforced naturalism and slow-burn intensity that made him great in the first place. Newcomer Norman does an impressive job of handling Jesse\' s hair-trigger emotional swirls, even if Mills has written the character into annoyingly adorable corners.

To go from 80 percent of energy coming from fossil fuels to net-zero emissions by 2050 requires a Herculean effort. It is very, very difficult, but it is not impossible, Birol said.  We have two choices: either we continue to use unabated fossil fuel \- coal, oil and gas \- and leave with climate change much more frequent and extreme weather events, or we change the way we produce and consume energy. At the 26th Congress of Parties (COP26) in November, South Africa secured a R131 billion pledge over the next three to five years to reduce its coal reliance. As South Africa is not participating in this week\' s virtual WEF meeting, thus it proved challenging getting an official response from it.However, energy minister Gwede Mantashe last week said that South Africa\' s approach to energy transition was consistent with the on the phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.  We will continue to pursue an energy mix to ensure security of energy and supply, cognisant of our international commitments to respond to climate change, he said.  We will continue to invest in clean energy technologies toward net zero emissions. Mantashe also slammed countries who could not sign to the elimination of coal and fossil fuels because of issues pertaining to political economies of certain of their constituencies. This is an unfair and unbalanced global environment, where the small and poor nations are permanently encircled. The interests of the rich, powerful, and big nations take precedence, he said. We must insist that industrialised countries, as big polluters, must take greater responsibility. This includes meeting the commitments they repeatedly make to the poor who bear the brunt of their, often irresponsible, actions. \l"

They are cut into strips and, along with the old body boards, are being used to renovate wheelchairs. We made a call-out to customers on Instagram and Facebook and have had a great response, he said, adding that most waste can be recycled or upcycled to prevent it going to landfill sites. He said the global surfing community was very aware of environmental issues and making green choices.This includes many products used by surfers, with some new innovations across the world, such as cultivated algae being used in the manufacture of body boards, as well as board shorts being made from material that uses recycled plastic bottles. Broken surfboards are also often made into trendy furniture.SA Springbok surfer Ntando Msibi described the wheelchair project as  great , also highlighting that waste put out on the street in Durban also helped the unemployed because they sold it for recycling purposes in order to create an income.  Everyone benefits from recycling and upcycling, he said.Bodyboarder Pascal Tostee said he had been brought up in a household where recycling was a way of life.  If I come across a bit of plastic in the water, I\' ll pick it up, he said. The Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment on the project.Meanwhile, a UN Environment Programme assessment, released before COP26 late last year, issued a warning that plastic pollution in oceans and other bodies of water could more than double by 2030. This would have severe consequences on health, economies as well as biodiversity and the climate.The assessment called for an immediate reduction in plastic production and consumption, saying plastic accounted for 85% of all marine litter, with the danger of breakdown products such as microplastics and chemical additives.The assessment also stated that  by 2040, there could be a US$100 billion annual financial risk for businesses if governments require them to cover waste management costs .Another study, by scientists at the University of Leicester in the UK, found that an increase of about 6\'b0C in the temperature of the world\' s oceans could prevent phytoplankton oxygen production by disrupting photosynthesis processes.Phytoplankton produces an estimated two thirds of the oxygen in the atmosphere, with the research team stating that disruption of phytoplankton  would mean oxygen depletion not only in the water, but also in the air.

As suppliers to large enterprises, SMEs that do not reduce their emissions may soon lose contracts on account of their poor green credentials. They also run the risk of not being in control of their power input costs and becoming uncompetitive as a result. This is a catch-22 for SMEs in one of the sunniest countries on Earth.A sustainability start-up based in London called Decarb.Earth is promising to change this situation by aggregating SME decarbonisation projects on a platform to make investments by financiers more attractive. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/706/226838.html :EMBED-->Platform solves a number of problems South African Decarb.Earth founder Marco Funk says the platform solves a number of problems simultaneously. First, issues with stability and the price of power in South Africa are well known. In the last 15 years, the price of electricity from Eskom has shot up by more than 500% in real terms. Solar energy, in the sunshine-rich environment of this country, provides a stable and predictable source of power and the platform significantly reduces both up-front costs and running costs for the SME. Second, aggregating SME renewable energy projects provides diversification and scale for funders, reducing risk and making funding more attractive. Third, everyone in the value chain from the customers of the SMEs to the financiers themselves can then use the verified carbon avoidance and emissions data to highlight the role they are playing in reducing global CO2 emissions. The platform aligns all stakeholder interests, he says.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/513/226231.html :EMBED-->Using blockchain technology for accountabilityDecarb.Earth uses blockchain technology to underpin transparent, accurate and verifiable smart contracts. Using the blockchain, the smart contracts disburse all payments, with both payment status and energy production information recorded and updated in real-time. The more South Africa moves along its just transition to a green energy future, the more organisations will compete for carbon avoidance credentials and this solution offers a completely transparent and fully accountable platform for that. Carbon avoidance Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) can be created to explicitly demonstrate the avoidance of carbon emissions, says Funk. The lack of verifiable emissions data and risk inherent in smaller businesses paying for their own renewable energy installations significantly reduces access to funding. According to SAP research in some regions of the world up to 70% of industrial carbon emissions come from SMEs so it is imperative that the global community including South Africa addresses the issue of making funding more accessible, Funk adds.According to Decarb.Earth s calculations, using CO2 emissions per unit of GDP based on 2019 figures if all SMEs in South Africa switched to solar electricity around 143 mega tonnes of CO2 or the equivalent of 20.8 million petrol-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year can be prevented from entering the atmosphere. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/356/225280.html :EMBED--> That s 30% of South Africa s annual CO2 emissions. The country could exceed 2030 emissions target if all SMEs switched to using solar, says Funk. On average, these projects achieve more than a 15% return per year in a sunny country like South Africa, which is attractive to potential funders if their concerns are dealt with. It also means the SME can reach a position of being supplied with cheaper followed by free energy.After all repayments have been made the average solar installation will continue to be privy to a performance guarantee for another 15 to 20 years. This is a significant boost for the average SME, given the reduced input costs. The solution pays for itself, while also solving the issue of security of supply. It also matches with clients and customers values as South Africa becomes greener, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the business as the competitive environment changes, concludes Funk.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

But coal is a resilient adversary and like all commodities subject to market vagaries. Instead of a retreat from coal, European countries sought refuge in coal and lignite in Q3 2021 as record gas prices hit the continent. Eskom\' s Emalahleni coal mine in Mpumalanga, one of 15 across the country, has contributed to making South Africa the 12th biggest CO\'b2 emitter in the world.The carrot is an initial commitment of $8.5bn (R126bn) pledged by rich western nations in Glasgow last Tuesday, for the next three to five years in a partnership with Pretoria to support a just transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy and society bereft of coal power. The idea is that the countries support South Africa to phase out of coal faster, and to go earlier and faster into developing renewables. I am confident that this partnership could become a template on how to support just transitions around the globe, said Von der Leyen.The rewards for the country are potentially huge \- a future without polluting coal. And a contribution towards Pretoria\' s now revised ambition of initially reducing coal\' s contribution to the energy mix to less than 60% and eventually phasing it out completely, and upscaling wind, solar and other non-polluting power.A future without coal for South Africa (decoalinisation) sounds beguiling, but it is far more complex than it appears.

In January, Storm Ana caused serious damage across Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar.Ramaphosa stated the obvious when he blamed the KwaZulu-Natal floods on climate change.A World Weather Attribution (WWA) Group study, which includes South African scientists, confirmed that climate change is fuelling extreme weather patterns in southern Africa exacerbated by global warming, and that such events are more common now.The region was hit by three cyclones and two tropical storms in six weeks in recent months.Africa is already burdened with scarce resources, competition for FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) flows, and economic woes, including the Covid disruptions, sluggish GDP growth and hence post-pandemic recovery, dangerously high public debt burdens, conflict containment and corruption challenges. The expenditure demands related to climate change will add to this burden.What is disconcerting is that we are seeing the same patterns of inequality in climate action as we have in other metrics of lives, livelihoods and well-being.Many scientists tell us we are beyond wake-up calls, early warning systems and the need for increased surveillance. These have been nauseatingly repetitive over the past few decades. The reality is that the climate action policy commitment of governments and the international agencies beholden to them is based on lip service tempered by political, economic and electoral self-interest, which brings the implementation process of the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into disrepute with ordinary people, the very constituency they are aimed at helping.Consider the metrics of climate inaction. Some $2.5 trillion went into subsidising oil, gas and coal over the past six years and there is little sign of this abating. Rich nations failed to meet their $100 billion goal of annual finance for poorer nations struggling to adapt to the climate crisis \- the shortfall is estimated at half of what was pledged.According to the UN and IMF, the world needs $5 trillion to $7 trillion annually to meet the SDG targets by 2030 \- but there is a persistent financing gap of $2.5 trillion each year.Not surprisingly, it has nurtured the emergence of a  resilience industry, unfortunately underpinned by the same growth-at-any-cost ethos and assumptions which has led the world to these climate, debt and other crises.The IMF\' s latest riposte is the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to be rolled out on May Day aimed at  helping low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries address longer-term challenges, including those related to pandemic preparedness and climate change .These facilities, albeit on concessional terms, will have to be paid back \- a  climate debt trap . Is this yet another IMF step too little, too late, and too slow?Donors, often the biggest polluters, cannot dictate terms. Given that most climate finance is through loans rather than grants, according to Dr Christopher Trisos, of the African Climate and Development Initiative, this means that  countries that have done little to cause the climate crisis are becoming further indebted to adapt to climate change . As the world is confronting consecutive global shocks, we must not lose sight of the critical actions needed today to ensure longer-term resilience and sustainability \- and we can only succeed by working together, exhorted Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF at the announcement of the RSF.That depends on the terms of co-operation. What about  let the polluters pay? According to a study by Professor Jason Hickel of the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology in Barcelona, the US and Europe are responsible for the majority of global ecological damage caused by the overuse of natural resources and underpinned by an economic dogma fixated on GDP growth.The fundamental inequality for continents such as Africa is that while all the forecasts suggest that it will bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change like it has with the pandemic, it has contributed the least to these crises.The continent is one of the least emitters of greenhouse gases, yet those living in Africa will probably be the victims of extreme weather patterns.It puts into context the token R131bn  guilt offering pledged by the EU and UK to Ramaphosa at the COP26 to wean South Africa off coal power.Parker is an economist and writer based in LondonLoad-Date:\~April 25, 2022\l"

Yet it is not unreasonable to see it in the context of the expert panel report on last year's riots in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.Minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele said on Sunday the report highlighted extensive weaknesses in the way the police and intelligence services responded to the unrest. Though Cele, during the state of the nation debate in parliament accused Sitole of involvement in a plot against him with EFF leader Julius Malema, he has stopped commenting on that and who Sitole's successor could be.

If parliament passes legislation SA will introduce new requirements for employment of foreign nationals in key sectors such as agriculture, hospitality and tourism, and construction. The draft comes as the cabinet has signed off on an ANC proposal to reserve some sectors of the economy for South Africans amid rising unemployment and concern about unlawful hiring practices.SA's new minimum wage, set at R23.19 for each ordinary hour worked, takes effect from Tuesday.

While the conference is critical to ensure that global climate change targets are met, South African non-profit company, Indalo Inclusive\~ partnered with the British High Commission South Africa to develop and promote climate-smart, green, and inclusive entrepreneurial innovations with a focus on youth-driven solutions through the South African Youth Climate Innovation awards.\~On Friday 29 October Indalo Inclusive, in partnership with the British High Commission in South Africa and the Mail & Guardian as proud media partner officially launched the South African Youth Climate Change Innovation Awards (SAYCIA), in a ceremony that had support from both the United Nations Development Programme and South Africa's Department of Forestry, Fishery and the Environment (the Department).""These awards ... touch on two imperatives - one is addressing the economic exclusion of youth, and the other of rebuilding the environment with sustainable development,"" said Rest Kanju, Founder and Director of Indalo Inclusive.\~""Indalo""is an isiZulu term that intersects between both ""ecology"" and ""creation"", clearly representing the objective of the Youth Climate Innovation Awards. Working under the theme of #OneStepGreener_SA, the project will invite entrepreneurial participants who innovate in the spaces of energy, water, agriculture, waste, and ecosystem innovation - areas in which South Africa is in desperate need of solutions. Indalo is placing clear emphasis on the pragmatic nature of these awards in helping to find solutions and is doing so in a manner that is not simply top-down, but both implementable and youth-led.""This is not just a talk show. The programme is divided into two components - firstly, it's the awards programme, where we will select and showcase 26 innovators and trailblazers,"" explained Content Development and Partnerships Coordinator for Indalo, Natania Botha. ""The other side of the programme is we are going to host dialogue sessions, because we would like to delve deeper into the challenges that are facing the young people.\~ ... Ultimately our goal is for policy-makers and ecosystem players to become more familiar with the issues raised, and that these hopefully influence both increased technical support and investment focus.The awards focus directly on the critical areas of water, energy, waste, agriculture, and ecosystem restoration - the same challenges that underpin the COP26 discussions currently occurring. Broadly speaking, the ongoing COP26 conference aims to align with the data provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the reduction of climate change. Key objectives include keeping global temperature change within the 1.5-degree range by 2030, ensure and enforce global levels of co-operation, and help make communities and ecosystems better able to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, which is where Indalo fits in.The South African Youth Climate Change Innovation Awards are aimed at meeting eco-inclusive enterprises, engaging with the impacts of climate change alongside facilitating social and economic improvement, in direct appreciation of the fact that climate change and its impacts occur within a local context.As world leaders debate and discuss the way forward, Indalo shifts focus toward the custodians of the future - the youth:\~ These awards will showcase what is available and ensure that they are recognised by investors and technical support partners. Most importantly, ""we hope that the profiling of these enterprises will allow our young people to think beyond their current levels of exposure and thereby creating conditions for even new innovations to be brought forward - since people can only innovate to the level of their exposure. If we are to grow towards a greener and better economy in South Africa, we need more innovations that are climate-smart, greener, and inclusive. Therefore, youth are critical to helping us achieve this.""All I had was an idea to create something that was amazing, effective, and that would impact the lives of us South Africans, my people,"" said Lebogang Leshabane, founder and owner of BG Co, which aims to repurpose wastewater treatment into energy generation. ""Through these programmes, I learnt to convert that idea into something that will be sustainable."" Leshabane was one of the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment ministerial ""Driving Force for Change"" winners, an initiative geared towards supporting the youth to craft and design solutions to solve both environmental and economic challenges.SAYCIA aligns clearly with the Department's overall strategy of promoting youth enterprise, which is attempting to capitalise on future leaders demonstrating both ecological and economical survivability, critical in meeting the ambitious goals set out by COP26. Much of the burden of meeting those goals will depend on the youth and their commitment to climate change, and the Department is bringing a particular focus and energy to ensure that these opportunities exist for youth, women and those living with disabilities, as well as taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the Covid-19 pandemic.""Covid-19 has helped us to see the fault l"

Apart from the challenges this over-reliance on coal posed for the country's progress in reaching emissions targets, carbon-intensive production of goods could also deter other countries from trading with SA in future.The carbon intensity of SA's exports was twice that of China's and 75% more than India's. ""SA's trade partners will make increasing efforts to stop carbon leakage"" as importing countries started moving away from transferring production of certain products, such as agricultural produce, to other countries with laxer emission constraints, Khumalo said.SA, the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter in Africa and the 12th largest globally, committed at COP26According to Khumalo, the just transition framework was aimed at a scenario in which the decommissioning of coal-fired power stations would start by 2025. By 2040, SA would have made a major shift to gas and hydrogen power, and by 2050, there would be no more energy generated from coal and gas.The ""just transition"" posed a major risk for workers in the Mpumalanga highveld, where 12 of Eskom's coal-fired power stations, and Sasol's coal-to-liquid fuels refinery were based, said Saliem Fakir, executive director of the African Climate Foundation.It was not easy, he said, to ""just shut down [coal] plants"" given that they provided direct jobs and indirect livelihoods.This included, according to Prof Jacklyn Cock from Wits, informal traders, who were mostly women who relied on ""coal workers"" to provide a market for them. The type of social transformation that would be needed for SA's energy transition to succeed ""depends on listening to the poor and powerless and addressing their material needs"", she said.Cock, Fakir and other academics urged the commission to work towards a realistic alternative development plan for coal mining areas.The commission recently extended the submission window for written comment on the just transition framework, which was published in February, from the end of March to the end of April.erasmusd@businesslive.co.za\l"

Nature neither mitigates history nor respects political and ideological obfuscation.COP26 is promising more than it can deliver despite the antics of the UN soothsayers, government spin doctors, career doomsters, serial optimists, perennial poseurs, climate deniers and well-meaning activists.The beauty parade of 120 world leaders, led by US President Joe Biden and host British Prime Minister Boris Johnson strutting their rhetoric of aspiration, endless promises, rejection of the consensus and pleas for climate change financing, is as predictable as China, Australia and India sticking to their medium-term coal power and usage policies.The US and EU could not help hailing as  game-changing Monday\' s Global Methane Pledge whereby more than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions by 30% by 2030.It\' s like counting your chickens before they hatch, especially when three of the largest methane emitters \- China, Russia and India \- did not bother to sign up.A more realistic objective is the concerted effort by the UK, EU and the US to  wean South Africa off coal with a $8.5 billion (about R130.5bn) carrot, bereft of any stick given the politics of just transition in energy, tempered by an ideological opposition by a faction within the ruling ANC to any privatisation of power generation let alone expansion of IPPs in the energy mix.Whatever pledges President Cyril Ramaphosa makes abroad at COP26, will he be able to deliver at home, given his party constraints?South African clean energy policy contradictions are a microcosm of the world. As low as 50 cents per kWh, South Africa enjoys some of the lowest renewable energy prices in the world.And yet, South Africa is also one of the top 20 emitters of carbon dioxide.What we won\' t hear at COP26 are the vagaries of politics, ideology, denial, climate profiteering, reluctance to transfer technology, reneging on previous financial commitments, lack of oversight and transparency \- not only on data but also on governance, resource allocation and financial accountability.Can you imagine a second-term president Donald Trump leading the US delegation to Glasgow, with a bevy of cynical corporate and philanthropic fellow travellers who would not shriek at leveraging climate action in pursuit of extra millions or merely to greenwash their guilt?A surfeit of COP speak has evolved, enough to compile a lexicon. A corporate executive lamented that much is simply  BS .Tariq Fancy, the ex-BlackRock CIO, recently warned that more than half of the low carbon ESG funds were exaggerating sustainability claims through  greenwashing and were  marketing gimmicks for which investors were paying higher fees.Glasgow is essentially a Conference of the Polluters. COP26 is supposed to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.EC data for 2019 shows China to be the world\' s largest emitter of carbon dioxede, at 11 535 megatonnes (MGTs), followed by the US, at 5.107 MGTs, the EU, at 3 304 MGTs, India, at 2 597 MGTs, and Russia, at 1 792 MGTs.In per capita terms, the US is the largest emitter, at 15.5 tonnes, followed by Russia, at 12.5 tonnes, China, at 8.1 tonnes, the EU, at 6.5 tonnes, and India, at 1.9 tonnes.The summit has been flawed even before it started. It was delayed by a year, thanks to the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic. The COP out of Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi is more than simply a  big mistake as Biden professed. It is a catastrophe for the transition to net zero by 2050 and for achieving a 1.5% rise in global temperature.The G20 Summit in Rome on Sunday too failed to rule out new investment in coal power.Spare a thought for Israeli Energy Minister Marine Elharrar who uses a wheelchair. He was refused access to the conference because there was no accessibility for disabled delegates \- inexcusable in this age of heightened diversity consciousness.Biden came to Glasgow bereft of his Climate Action Programme. Congress is stalling because of any alleged potential negative impact on the US oil and fracking industry. Xi confirmed China would go ahead with five new coal-fired power stations, and Modi asserted that India would continue to use coal power in its energy mix.India and China\' s pledges to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 simply kicks the Paris targets into touch.The IPCC maintains that it is possible to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C by the end of the century, but only with steep reduction in global emissions by 2030 and if we reach global net zero around 2050, based on targets defined by Nationally Determined Contributions.China\' s chief climate negotiator at COP26, Xie Zhenhua, was quick to push back at the 1.5\'b0C, insisting that the higher rise of 2\'b0C agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement  had to remain up for discussion . Even the  landmark promise by 110 world leaders to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, hailed as COP26\' s  first major deal \- smacks of hubris.The arch climate denier and supporter of deforestation of the Amazon, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, seems to have undergone a Damascene conversion. Perhaps it has to do with a $19.2bn sweetener of public and private funds for the deal? A similar deforestation deal in 2014 failed spectacularly.With world leaders jetting off home on Tuesday, the ball is in the court of their negotiators and experts over the next 10 days.Will it be more endless promises of policy and target commitments, and financing, beyond the $100bn a year, to effect real socio-economy climate change, or will it dissipate into yet another orgy of Blah Blah Blah? The world waits with bated breath.Parker is an economist and writer based in London Load-Date:\~November 3, 2021\l"

Most condoms contain additives and chemicals that cannot be recycled. For some, being eco-friendly sexually means selecting lubes, toys, bed sheets and condoms that have less impact on the planet, Akinsemolu told the BBC. For others, it entails reducing the damage in the creation of porn to workers and the environment, she said.Akinsemolu says that while lambskin condoms are the only fully biodegradable alternative, they do not prevent sexually transmitted infections and are made from the intestines of sheep.In addition, there are a number of home-made lube options, with an increase in water-based and organic products, whereas before, most were petroleum-based, containing fossil fuels. The water-based lubricants, organic and vegan condoms are a good pick for having fun   They not only cause minor damage to the environment, but offer their users a great time, Akinsemolu said. \l"

We have less than 30 years to bring that down to zero if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe. Eskom is the 12th-largest carbon emitter in the world, which makes the transition from coal to clean sources of energy a no-brainer.Ageing power stations, lack of maintenance and rampant corruption have brought the power utility to its knees, and it now has no money to transition to greener energy. But COP26, which opens in Glasgow today, holds out the prospect of help in this regard.Eskom is using the opportunity to seek a $30bn (R460bn) concessional loan to help finance its transition to renewables, said CEO Andre de Ruyter.The European Commission announced that the UK, US, France and Germany, would sign a ""just energy transition"" partnership to help SA and other developing nations phase out coal. ""This partnership could become a template in how to support the just transition around the globe with sponsoring countries and countries that have to move faster in the just transition,"" European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told the newspaper.This is encouraging. Climate change - like the Covid pandemic - is a global issue and no-one can be safe if we are not all safe. The developed world emits by far the most greenhouse gases, but the effects are felt more acutely by nations unable to mitigate the consequences of climate change.G20 countries meeting in Rome on the eve of COP26 say they will pledge to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C, a level scientists deem necessary to avoid devastating new climate patterns. The G20 nations account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions, so this is an important step.

This is according to Roland Henwood, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of Pretoria.However, the move to renewable sources of energy will require a reprioritising of resources that could result in SA losing out on funding from the EU to finance its own energy transition.During a webinar hosted by Absa on how the war in Ukraine might affect global trade, energy, commodity markets and agriculture, Henwood said that the ""green funds"" from Europe SA was hoping to benefit from might not materialise as expected ""because European countries will now look at how they need to help themselves first"".SA concluded a landmark climate finance agreement at the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November with the governments of France, Germany, the UK and the US, as well as the EU, that would mobilise $8.5bn to support SA's ""just transition"".The funding was to be made available over a period of three to five years through a range of instruments, including grants and concessional finance.During a meeting of the Presidential Climate Commission in February, public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, citing recent experiences with Covid-19 and vaccine access, expressed reservations about the deal. He said that it remained to be seen if SA's partners would stick to their word and whether it would ultimately ""be worth taking"".The longer-term consequences of the war in Ukraine might be that European governments would look at funding quicker energy transitions for themselves, said Henwood. This, he said, might create a new divide between countries that were able to afford faster transitions to renewable energy and those countries that had to wait and rely on funding from richer countries to do so.This could have consequences for SA's plans to gradually move away from using coal to generate electricity towards renewable sources, given the ""expectation of funding"" from countries in the EU to fund this move.Absa Agribusiness senior economist Marlene Louw said: ""The war [in Ukraine] is resulting in further disruption to supply chains and global logistics.""There are reports that shipping times have been increased [at European ports] because containers have to be screened for [products affected by] sanctions.""This would provide further impetus for countries to become more ""inward looking"" and to focus on sustainable supply sources that would not be disrupted by geopolitical events, she said.""The benefits we saw from globalisation from during the 1990s and early 2000s will lose momentum given the dynamics that are at play now.""Anyone who is involved in global trade will find it harder to do business.""For SA this would mean that the agriculture sector, for example, may find it more difficult to secure access to new markets as other countries.Louw said this should result in SA gaining an opportunity to increase trade with other Southern African countries.erasmusd@businesslive.co.zaPicture: 123RF/PETKOV\l"

Why businesses need to follow suit","February 10, 2022 Thursday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","President Cyril Ramaphosa's upcoming State of the Nation Address (SONA) is expected to focus on climate change. Set to have a significant impact on the private sector, directors and business leaders should view climate risks and opportunities as more than a reporting or disclosure matter.-Justin Smith, executive head of business development at WWF, says that climate change, together with biodiversity loss, is one of the biggest and most systemic challenges of our time. Despite the clear goals of the Paris Agreement, and the urgent need for each country to put in place the necessary plans to curb emissions, progress is still much too slow, and the threats and impacts of climate change are becoming ever more critical. Catastrophic losses caused by extreme weather cost the global economy $280bn in 2021, and the number and scale of these events continue to grow each year, leading to it being recognised as one of the top risks to the global economy by the WEF s Global Risk Report over every time horizon. Although COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021 saw some substantial progress in terms of improved Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from many countries, it s still not enough to shift our global climate trajectory and ensure we remain within a 1.5\'b0C temperature increase scenario, says Smith.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/704/224228.html :EMBED-->Just energy transitionAn important outcome of COP26, and likely to be included in Ramaphosa s SONA tonight is the $8.5bn just transition financing package to assist South Africa to shift away from our coal-based energy system to a more renewable energy-based system.However, Smith cautions that this transition needs to happen in a manner that creates new opportunities for businesses and communities that are currently part of the coal supply chain, while at the same time ensuring South Africa s economy is not hit by trade barriers and tariffs due to being too carbon emission-intensive. Therefore, corporate and investment sector participation is critical. If we are serious about addressing the challenge of climate change, we must continue to engage the corporate and investor sectors in our efforts to influence the redirection of financial flows as a powerful lever to release money for sustainable investments. At the same time, we should withdraw the resources that underpin environmentally, socially or economically harmful impacts. Currently, South Africa s Presidential Climate Change Commission is undertaking extensive stakeholder and community engagement on this critical topic in recognition of the fact that climate risk is not only an environmental issue but also a direct economic and social issue with implications for the future competitiveness of the country and the livelihoods of its people.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/224865.html :EMBED-->Identifying vulnerabilitiesIn the 2021 edition of the Trialogue Business in Society Handbook, a publication produced annually by responsible business consultancy Trialogue, Smith advises directors and business leaders to understand that Scope 1 and 2 emissions are unlikely to be the only source of their climate risk. They should look up and down their value chains to identify vulnerabilities as well as opportunities for growth.The World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risk report published early in January 2022 continues to highlight how central environmental and social risks are to the stability and future of the global economy. Over the 5-10-year horizon, the top five risks are all environmental in nature, including climate action failure, extreme weather events and biodiversity loss. Trialogue manager Matthew le Cordeur says that directors need to factor climate change into their deliberations about strategy, risk management, and opportunities as part of their duty of care. Both the Companies Act and King IV create a basis for the expectation that directors should have the necessary skill and experience to perform their duties, and that this should extend to a broad range of matters that could significantly affect an organisation s ability to create value . <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/224458.html :EMBED-->Implications for boardsLe Cordeur explains that this has two implications for boards. Firstly, all directors should have a foundational understanding of climate change and other key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Secondly, given the complexity associated with climate and biodiversity issues, and growing expectations around disclosure, appropriate risk management and engagement with stakeholders, directors with specific experience should be recruited or developed. This is especially true for those directors serving on board committees with delegated responsibility for climate and other ESG issues. Very little director training on climate and ESG issues seems to be available in South Africa, and more effort will need to be made by the Institute of Directors and similar organisations to close this gap. This will ensure that more directors are able to engage with investors on ESG issues in a competent manner, play the necessary internal oversight role, ensure the alignment of executive compensation with ESG performance and the identification, assessment, mitigation, and disclosure of climate and other ESG risks. Instead of simply reacting to the uncertainty of climate change impacts, companies should track new risks affecting their industry, shape the correct strategic response, and strengthen their agility and resilience to build an uncertainty advantage, concludes Le Cordeur.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

The companies that have been making the finds of oil and gas in Namibia have been harassed out of South Africa because we want to be an 'island of angels\' in a sea of poverty. It's the most dangerous tactic for us in South Africa, they go out and make huge oil finds elsewhere, he said.Last week, Shell lost its bid to appeal against an interim interdict for seismic survey operations. This comes after small fishing communities protesting along Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Western Cape shores voicing their stance against seismic activity.Mantashe said the country's oceans, especially in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal had the potential to be the next growth point in energy, which might lead them to be a sector on its own.During his speech, Mantashe also emphasised the importance of countries fostering stronger ties on the inter-African oil and gas trade. Already, South Africa imports the bulk of its crude requirements from African producers, including Nigeria and Angola. There is ample opportunity for a massive expansion of gas trade, especially from the Gulf of Guinea and the broader West Coast of Africa, where we have many producers and some already exporting. On the just transition, Mantashe said it must aid development and address historical inequalities, not undermine, and exacerbate them.""We must not be ambivalent about the just energy transition debate. The assumed pendulum swing, or what others call \' accelerated transition\' , intent on replacing one system with another in a flash, is both irrational and dangerous, he said.The just transition was offered R131 billion at COP26 by France, Germany, the UK and the US, as well as the European Union to accelerate South Africa's transition from high carbon to low carbon economy.Mantashe, who has been under fire for slow procurement of renewable energy, said Africa must define its own just energy transition strategy, otherwise developed economies would employ their strategies on it.  You want to give us R131bn to move faster away from coal, and yet coal gives us R130bn turnover in a year , he said.Mantashe said in response to a Business Report question that he did not know what the just transition funds would be used for.\l"

Coal consumption has nearly doubled in the past decade \- only China burns more \- and the fuel still powers 70 percent of India\' s electricity grid.The government has dragged its feet on tougher regulations for coal plants and just last year announced a series of commercial mining auctions to boost domestic production.Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to weaning his country off coal, but told Glasgow delegates India would only aim to be carbon-neutral by 2070 \- a decade after China and 20 years after the world\' s other big emitters.But without decisive action sooner, experts warn India\' s emissions will soar in coming years and scuttle worldwide efforts to rein in global warming.The effects of India\' s fossil fuel addiction are already keenly felt, with a shroud of thick grey haze enveloping New Delhi each winter.Coal plant emissions and vehicle exhaust fumes combine with smoke from farm fires to choke the megacity\' s 20 million residents.On the same day that COP26 delegates were finalising the global climate accord, Delhi shut its schools for a week to keep children inside.Smog is blamed for more than a million deaths in India annually, and a recent University of Chicago study found that air pollution was likely to reduce life expectancy by more than nine years for four in every 10 Indians.Modi\' s government aims to mitigate the problem by scaling up renewables, pledging to make solar power as big a share of the energy mix as coal by the end of the decade.But India lacks the high-tech capacity to meet demand for solar panels and relies heavily on expensive components from overseas.It has tried to spur domestic manufacturing of solar tech by increasing import duties, raising the cost of renewable energy.The 2030 solar goal  is a huge and a very stiff target to meet , Sengupta of the Centre for Science and Environment said. It requires a lot of cheap finance and technologies to be made available. India has long argued that historical polluters such as the US and Europe are obligated to provide the technical expertise and funding for climate mitigation.Its environment minister told COP26 delegates on Saturday that developing countries were  entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels .Bhupender Yadav said nations with little historical responsibility for climate change should not be held to the same standards as the world\' s biggest per-capita emitters. In such a situation, how can anyone expect developing countries to make promises of phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies? he asked.The weakened COP26 commitment was adopted with deep reluctance by other nations, which were anxious to get the deal over the l"

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa107","Boards must stop mewing over climate change and start roaring","March 24, 2022 Thursday","Daily Dispatch (South Africa)","As pressure from all stakeholders moves climate change up the boardroom and executive agenda, there is an urgent need for directors and business leaders in SA and globally to view climate risks and opportunities as more than a reporting or disclosure matter. Catastrophic losses caused by extreme weather cost the global economy R4,200bn in 2021, and the number and scale of these events continue to grow each year, leading to it being recognised as one of the top risks to the global economy by the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report over every time horizon. Despite this, most corporates have been found to be lagging. A report, ""Changing the Climate in the Boardroom"", which looks at what boards around the world are currently doing, found there is a clear disconnect between what board members say about the importance of climate change and what they are actually doing. Three-quarters understand that climate change is very important to the strategic success of their companies. However, 43% indicated their companies do not have clear targets for reducing carbon emissions. In SA, the annual Trialogue Business in Society Handbook found that corporate social investment (CSI) initiatives related to the environment were supported by only 17% of SA companies, with an average of 4% of total CSI spend allocated to these initiatives in 2021. While greenhouse gas emissions are now widely acknowledged, most companies do not understand their dependencies on ecosystems or how they affect biodiversity in turn. The average CSI spend on water conservation and wetlands management was just 13% of CSI spend on the environment (an already small number), down from 19% in 2020, which is surprising considering the country's water scarcity concerns. As a developing country, SA is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and multiple sectors underpinning the economy are susceptible, including mining, agriculture and transport. The science shows that parts of SA are likely to warm at twice the global rate and that our water-stressed country is likely to become more arid in the west, with an increased risk of extreme biodiversity loss and degradation of critical catchment areas and an increased risk of heat stress. If we do not adapt or mitigate the risks we face, it could have a devastating effect on the economy and an already impoverished and unequal society. As highlighted by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his recent state of the nation address, at COP26 SA signed a historic R131bn just-transition financing package to assist in the shift from our coal-based energy system to a more renewable energy-based system. One of the risks associated with the move to a low-carbon economy is transition risk, which includes risks associated with regulatory change, consumer preferences and stranded assets. A failure on the part of companies to take this risk into account can result in reduced creditworthiness, which negatively affects the ability to attract investment and secure long-term loans, and appeal to insurers, among others. Another type of climate-change risk is physical risk. This includes the increased likelihood of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and wildfires. Physical risks can result in interruptions in day-to-day business activity as well as a detrimental effect on supply chains, market position and the business's overall value. Worth noting is that the vulnerable members of society are usually the ones most affected by physical risks - their jobs, livelihoods and homes can be destroyed, which can lead to increased inequality and poverty, which could in turn lead to increased social unrest and crime. Though climate-change risks are high, they can also create opportunities for companies and investors. Companies can become more resilient to the effects of climate change by focusing on their operations and supply chains. Instead of simply reacting to the uncertainty of climate-change effects, companies that are proactive about using their advantage to track new risks affecting their industry, shaping the correct strategic response and strengthening their agility and resilience, stand the chance of building an uncertainty advantage.

Significantly, for the first time at this month's COP summit, the role nature can play in saving the planet was highlighted - which could benefit Africa.""Land and ocean ecosystems are responsible for the removal of 56% of the carbon dioxide and it is important that the role of nature was acknowledged in the text [of the draft agreement adopted by the conference],"" said Fernanda Carvalho, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) climate specialist, in an interview after the draft accord was released.""I am Brazilian, where the forests are a big issue but their protection is not on track,"" said Carvalho.In a positive step, more than 100 countries, with 85% of the forests on Earth, promised to stop deforestation by 2030.Forests, kelp forests off SA's shores and peatlands in the African tropics are among the habitats that absorb carbon dioxide and prevent it entering Earth's atmosphere.The Great Green Wall reforestation project in Africa - targeting the revival of 100-million hectares of degraded land, the storing of 250-million tonnes of carbon and the creation of 10-million jobs - gained momentum in Glasgow from VIPs such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Britain's Prince Charles and France's President Emmanuel Macron.However, even though positive deals were being struck on the side, the amount of climate financing in the accord to offset the ""permanent losses and damages"" of developing countries was slammed by activists as ""fuzzy and vague"".African Climate Alliance spokesperson Ayakha Melithafa said from Glasgow: ""This is a big greenwashing event, where countries exploiting the resources of the global South brag about what they can do, but do not commit.""COP26. ""There is no Planet B"" and ""Liar, Liar, Earth on Fire"" were among the myriad placards waved in the streets.Standing knee-deep in the ocean off the Pacific island of Tuvalu, foreign minister Simon Kofe recorded a speech for , to show how rising seas threaten the survival of small island states, which are among those least responsible for climate change.Hard hit by faster rising temperatures than other continents, Africa could benefit from COP26's recognition that nature and climate change are inextricably connected, since the continent needs support in protecting its rich biodiversity and vulnerable species.Dr Harriet Davies-Mostert, head of conservation at the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT), said: ""South Africa is likely to be hammered by changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Biodiversity is the basic building block we need to protect everything, to handle the climate shocks that are coming.""Higher temperatures, intense and longer droughts, more storms and flooding are forecast for SA and the rest of the continent.Southern and Central Africa are the worst affected but the continent has many vulnerable hotspots, said professor Guy Midgley, a leading climate scientist from Stellenbosch University.""Extreme climate events in Africa are increasingly likely ... causing havoc in urban and rural areas,"" he said.""We already see the adverse effects in the northwest, like the Richtersveld and Namaqualand, where succulent species are dying back because of very severe, long-term drought. When some of the toughest plants are keeling over, this is a worrying sign.""The Kruger National Park, in the savannah ecosystem, is another area where species have been affected. Studies by the late Wits distinguished professor Bob Scholes, who was director of the Global Change Institute, have shown shifts in keystone species like the mopane worm in response to climate and land degradation.Higher than normal numbers of the edible mopane worm influence the ecology of mopane woodlands.""We see the impact of climate change on plants and animals, terrestrial and marine, across all the principal biomes,"" said climate scientist Emma Archer of Pretoria University.""The flipside of this is that we have an amazing rich repository of biodiversity, which can help combat climate change.""A giant ""sea bamboo"" kelp forest off Cape Point plays a vital role in capturing carbon dioxide in the water, thereby cleaning up the ocean's lungs, and kelp protects against storm surges and some of the effects of rising seas on the shore.When the environment and wildlife suffer, so do people. In Kenya, when livestock animals die during drought, the genital mutilation and early marriage of girls becomes more common, researchers have found. When families are struggling, the cattle traditionally provided to the bride's family support them.Africa is particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by extreme events as it is heating up faster than the global average, and is forecast to have longer and more frequent heatwaves.New projections released at COP26 - that the planet will heat up by 2.4\'b0C if countries follow their current plans - could mean temperatures rising by 3.5\'b0C to 4\'b0C for much of Southern Africa, said Midgley. This is significantly more than the target of a rise of no more than 1.5\'b0CWater security is a critical issue. Professor Mark New, director of the African Climate & Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town, said: ""All the projections for rainfall and evaporation in the future for South Africa show progressively higher evaporation and progressively lower rainfall across nearly all the country.""So, for each fraction of a degree above the target of 1.5\'b0C the Earth warms, there will be greater reduction in water availability in South Africa.""But the future is not all bleak, with pockets of ecosystem recovery expanding across SA. Environmental organisations, including the WWF-SA and EWT, are working with communities to offer support and solutions to the climate threats.For example, the EWT is piloting a project in the Karoo with farmers to protect the watercourses where the critically endangered riverine rabbit competes with sheep for food.""We are looking at models of compensation,"" said Davies-Mostert.""We need to think of solutions that have never been tried before and how to unlock livelihoods.""In the Drakensberg, the EWT is exploring the benefits of carbon trading with landowners who commit to biodiversity stewardship. ""We have signed up some farmers in the last few months,"" Davies-Mostert said.The EWT is working with emerging farmers in Limpopo's Waterberg to make them more resilient against stock losses and lessen the clash with predators from surrounding game reserves.However, even though biodiversity has come to the fore at COP26, the focus echoes that of previous summits - the role of fossil fuels and cutting their use to stay under 1.5\'b0C.New said: ""The big South African story is the announcement of R131bn funding by several countries to help accelerate a transition out of coal, but we are still waiting to see what this will actually look like in detail ... and what kinds of strings will be attached.""SA has the highest carbon intensity among the G20 countries.Most of the targets promised by SA are ""conditional"" and can only happen if international finance is provided.""Like many African countries,"" said New, ""SA is struggling to keep things running as they are.""The promised funding for the transition out of coal is a positive signal and shows political will to co-operate with SA, said Dr Prabhat Upadhyaya of WWF-SA - who noted that the biggest delegation at the climate summit was fielded by the fossil fuel industry.Also of concern was the underrepresentation of delegates from the global South, restricted by Covid-19 vaccine shortages and requirements for travelling to Scotland. Even in Glasgow, delegates found themselves excluded from attending events in person when small numbers of tickets ran out.COP26, as with prior summits, has produced positive pledges and signals while falling short of the critical steps needed to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C.But Southern Africa needs ""every 0.1\'b0C"" decl"

The company, a member of the Ikamva equity consortium, won preferred bidder status for 12 of the 25 projects awarded the state's renewable power plan announced last week.De Ruyter said the COP26 announcement would enable ""South Africa to meet its new and ambitious nationally determined contribution targets"".But the Eskom boss said the utility would require $35bn over 15 years\~to wean South Africa's 13 coal-fired power stations to more renewable energy.South Africa presently emits the most greenhouse gases on the continent because of its reliance on coal for electricity, a blight on its carbon footprint that US president Joe Biden, at COP26, said they wanted to help tackle. ""We want to help transform their economy to a clean energy economy, more quickly.""On Friday afternoon, Eskom went from announcing load shedding Stage 2 to load shedding Stage 4, in a matter of hours. This time it was attributed to generating units having shut down at the Kendal power station and the trip of units at both Tutuka and Matimba power stations.Energy analyst and managing director at EE Business Intelligence Chris Yelland said he was pleased to hear the COP26 announcement because South Africa's carbon emissions were the highest in Africa.""To reach a partnership agreement to gain access to funding that helps us do what we need to do, helps South Africa and helps decarbonise the world.""Yelland added: ""If we use this money correctly and we carry out our commitment to decarbonising our economy, this is just the beginning of our green finance.""Yelland believed that the most efficient way to use this funding was to combine solar, wind, gas-to-power and battery energy storage systems.""These offer the least-cost pathway for new generation capacity while generating the least amount of carbon emissions.""The energy expert said one of the highlights of transition was two-fold job creation.""There are jobs that occur in the construction phase and also in operation and maintenance,"" Yelland said.Additionally, he shared that more jobs were created in the renewable energy sector, despite it currently being a significant minority in the energy sector.Senior energy analyst at Greencape Collins Nyamadzawo said choosing renewable energy sources was advantageous in many ways.""They are a vehicle to reduce the rising global temperatures and the subsequent climate change catastrophe.""Nyamadzawo said an ideal energy policy for South Africa was aimed to reduce the cost of electricity while increasing grid reliability.""It looks at environmentally friendly and socially inclusive ways of powering our homes and industries,"" he said.He added: ""This move also improves the country's attractiveness as an investment destination. Now that we know better, we must do better.""Nyamadzawo echoed Yelland's words on how renewable energy will be pivotal for job creation.""The growth of renewable energy means new jobs, some skills are transferable and some of them will be new jobs altogether if you look at the whole value chain.""Independent energy analyst Andrew Kenny was critical of renewable energy sources for South Africa.""It is good to have renewable options, but wind and solar are useless for good electricity. They are unreliable,"" he said.He added: ""A good nuclear plant will last for 60 years and produce affordable and reliable electricity.""Kenny said South Africa should learn from European countries such as Germany and Denmark.""They moved towards solar and wind power and now their electricity prices are going through the roof, people can't pay their bills and industries are shutting down.""He added: ""Solar and wind don't work for good electricity, R500 billion is an enormous sum and that is crazy.""He previously used an example of Australia, which closed coal stations, built wind turbines and some solar plants, and supplemented them with natural gas, which Australia, unlike SA, has in abundance.

By embedding its alternative credit scoring technology in ride-hailing, e-logistics and instant delivery platforms, it can use proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite loans to drivers that have previously been excluded from financial services. More than 3 million rides have been completed in Moove-financed vehicles across six markets (Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Nairobi and Ibadan) and three product categories: cars, trucks and motorbikes. Moove co-founder and co-chief executive Ladi Delano said less than two years ago they discovered this white space of mobility fintech and launched Moove. Having now surpassed over 3 million trips in Moove-financed vehicles across Africa, launched in six new cities and connected thousands of ambitious mobility entrepreneurs to ride-hailing, e-logistics and instant delivery marketplaces, we\' re now leading this growing category within fintech. But there are still millions of budding mobility entrepreneurs in emerging markets who have limited or no access to vehicle financing and marketplaces that are facing critical supply issues. With this new fund-raise, we are well-positioned and well funded to help solve this global problem.  We\' re delighted to have the support of leading investors across the globe who will be integral in enabling us to take our Nigerian-born model to the world, Delano said.Launched in 2020 by Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi, Moove was democratising vehicle ownership across Africa by providing mobility entrepreneurs access to revenue-based financing in markets with low access to credit. Using its alternative credit scoring technology, Moove provides vehicle financing to its customers to purchase new vehicles using a percentage of their weekly revenue.Moove has had overwhelming demand and exponential growth across Africa, with its Moove-financed vehicles covering more than 25 million kilometres. Now, Moove said it was expanding its model globally.This new $105m Series A2 round brings the total raised by the mobility fintech pioneer to $174.5m.Moove said it would rapidly scale its revenue-based vehicle financing model to seven new markets across Asia, Mena (the Middle East and North Africa) and Europe over the next six months.Moove is part of a new generation of Nigerian-born start-ups that are upending financial services across Africa.Moove co-founder and co-chief executive Jide Odunsi, said at Moove, they were working hard to create disruptive and impactful tech solutions to solve real-world problems.  The Moove model that we\' ve pioneered in Africa providing revenue-based vehicle financing to mobility entrepreneurs can be applied anywhere in the world.  As we scale, we remain committed to empowering women, leading the electrification of the mobility space and driving financial inclusion. These ideals are at the core of what we do as we continue to build a sustainable and impact-driven global business, Odunsi said.Moove said it was committed to ensuring that at least 60 percent of the vehicles it financed were electric or hybrid in l"

While I welcome the G20\' s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled \- but at least they are not buried, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Twitter.Richer countries have failed to meet a $100 billion (about R1.5 trillion) annual target for climate finance by 2020. Poorer nations like India want more cash to move past their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels. It\' s one minute to midnight and we need to act now, Johnson was due to tell them in his keynote speech, according to Downing Street. If we don\' t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow. The Glasgow gathering, which runs until November 12, comes as an accelerating onslaught of extreme weather events across the world underscores the devastating impacts of climate change from 150 years of burning fossil fuels.The current commitments of the Paris signatories \- if they were followed \- would still lead to a  catastrophic warming of 2.7\'baC, according to the UN.COP26 marks the  last, best hope to keep 1.5\'baC in reach , summit president Alok Sharma said on Sunday. If we act now and we act together, we can protect our precious planet, he said.Climate advocacy groups expressed disappointment at the statement released at the end of the G20 summit. These so-called leaders need to do better. They have another shot at this: starting (Monday), said Namrata Chowdhary from the NGO 350.org.China, by far the world\' s biggest carbon polluter, has just submitted to the UN its revised climate plan, which repeats a long-standing goal of peaking emissions by 2030. But President Xi Jinping is absent from Glasgow, and India is now at the centre of expectations.India has yet to submit a revised  nationally determined contribution .But if Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces new efforts to curb emissions in his own speech, it could put more pressure on China and others, said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate and energy think tank E3G. If he feels confident enough that there\' s going to be financing and technology assistance from Europe, the US, Japan and others, he might signal that India is willing to update its NDC, Meyer said.The goal has been postponed to 2023, exacerbating the crisis of confidence between the North, responsible for global warming, and the South, which is the victim of its effects. Climate finance is not charity. It is a question of justice, stressed Lia Nicholson, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States vulnerable to climate change.Forecasts by the UN climate experts panel (IPCC) that the threshold of a 1.5 Celsius \'baC degrees Celsius increase could be reached 10 years earlier than expected, around 2030, are  terrifying , she said.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa116","Creecy: Phase down of coal should happen in a just manner","South African Official News"," ","Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Minister Barbara Creecy says the Glasgow climate conference outcome on helping developing countries like South Africa accelerate the phase down of unfiltered coal to low-carbon energy should be done in a manner that takes into consideration national interests and availability of resources.The Minister said this when she briefed the media on the outcomes of the recently concluded Glasgow Climate Conference ().The final text of the cover agreement at the end of the two-week COP26 negotiations with regards to the issue of coal contains wording that talks about the phase down of coal.'There is also wording there that talks about the recognition of national circumstances and the importance of a just transition.'And I think that what that language is all about ... is saying that for developing countries, there is a recognition of the enormous cost that transitioning economies to lower carbon growth paths and to climate resilient societies is going to have.'I think that there is been an estimation by the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] that developing countries will require in the region of US$4 trillion over the next 15 years to achieve these transitions.'And I think that text was really about saying that countries must be transitioning. Like our country, we have to do our fair share. But we have to be transitioning at a manner and at a pace that is determined by our national sovereign interests and by the availability of resources.'We can't be signing up to a situation that we are not ensuring that we have adequate financial support for the transitions that will be taking place,' she said.This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa recently announced that South Africa has secured a historic partnership with leaders of the world of a R131 billion highly concessional climate financing to help SA transition from coal to low-carbon energy.Briefing the media on Wednesday, Creecy said the international community has united behind a shared objective to inject a greater sense of urgency to address the global climate crisis and to do so on the basis of international equity and latest available science.She said the concluded Paris Agreement Work Programme will assist Parties to fully implement the Paris Agreement, in the context of a Just Transition and Sustainable Development, leaving no one behind.The complex Glasgow package outcome strikes the right balance to accommodate the very different national circumstances and capacities among nearly 200 Parties, so that all are enabled and empowered to contribute their fair share and to enhance their climate ambition.'COP26\l"

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa119","The heat is turned up on developing countries","November 24, 2021","Post (South Africa)","COP26, the recently concluded UN climate change conference in Glasgow, marked a critical turning point in global politics. From now on, the issue of climate justice will be unavoidable for rich countries.The Glasgow Climate Pact  urges rich countries like the US (referred to as  developed countries in the text) to increase funding for poor countries like Bangladesh ( developing countries ) to around $40 billion (R622.1 billion) annually by 2025, to help them adapt to mounting floods, droughts and other effects of climate change.This is pretty strong language in UN speak and is welcome support. But the rich world has a history of failing to meet its financial promises. Only 80% of the $100 billion promised annually by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate their emissions and adapt to climate change has been delivered.The failure to meet the amount developing countries need to adapt to climate change means the world faces a life sentence of escalating climate impacts. Those impacts that we won\' t be able to prevent or adapt to are referred to as  loss and damage in the lingo of international climate policy, and they are already beginning to bite in the most vulnerable countries. The failure of COP26 to commit to keeping warming below 1.5\'b0C will mean more such loss and damage in future.Some consider work on loss and damage to be a form of compensation for the harm rich countries have indirectly caused poor ones by disproportionately contributing to climate change with their greenhouse gas emissions. Others prefer the term  climate reparations , and yet others talk about  solidarity funds .However you describe it, the fine print of the previous UN climate treaty, the 2015 Paris agreement, sought to squash any notion of developed countries being liable. But the outcome of COP26 shows that the issue of who is responsible and who should pay for the consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored. However, even the annual climate funding that has been pledged doesn\' t include any money allocated for loss and damage.Who should pay?The idea of paying for loss and damage was introduced with the first UN climate treaty negotiations in 1991 as something owed to small island states. But over the years, other groups, including the poorest countries and others across Africa, have begun to champion the issue.Thanks to major advances in the field of attribution science, there is growing understanding of the precise link between human-caused emissions and specific severe weather events. This relationship will intensify with every ton of emissions, and for many of these climate-consequences, there is no turning back.Loss and damage in GlasgowHeading into the Glasgow summit, delegates were mindful of the growing adaptation needs of developing countries. Adapting to climate change is not straightforward: even the UK, for all its wealth and its relative lack of exposure, is not getting it right.In the lead up to COP26, all countries were expected to update their climate action plans, known as NDCs. Recent analysis showed an increasing number were talking about loss and damage in their plans. This makes sense: as countries increasingly have to divert resources towards preparing for and responding to disasters like cyclones, or sea-level rise and melting glaciers, there will be less public financing available for them to cut their emissions and contribute to meeting the 1.5\'baC goal.More talk?There was important progress in Glasgow. But much of this came from outside the negotiating rooms.The negotiators working on loss and damage conducted their talks late into the night to flesh out what the Santiago Network \- a new way of offering technical assistance to developing countries \- should be doing to support countries in a practical way.But progress was slow and calls to set up a  Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility , which would have provided financial support for vulnerable countries, went unheeded.Agreed instead was the establishment of a  Glasgow Dialogue to discuss funding arrangements over the coming years. This could be an important step to real, material support for vulnerable countries. But in some ways, this feels like deja vu.COP23 in 2017 established a  Suva Expert Dialogue \- a two-day workshop, which produced a technical paper \- to explore information on finance for loss and damage. COP24 the following year and COP25 in 2019 pushed for the establishment of an expert group on loss and damage, which was finally launched in early 2021.Progress is incremental, but with all these dialogues, it\' s no wonder that young protesters decry this  blah, blah, blah approach to climate action.One surprise in Glasgow was the symbolic and material support for loss and damage which came from those outside the negotiating room. Scotland\' s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, promised \£32 million (R41.7 million) of funding to alleviate the impacts of climate change. This was augmented by a $3 million pledge from philanthropists. Since then, a Belgian provincial climate minister has also committed \€ 1 million (R17.5 million).This is a drop in the ocean. It nonetheless represents an interesting twist in terms of who is stepping up to take responsibility for the harm that climate change is already causing and looks set to cause in the future.Vanhala is a professor of political science, UCL. | d.\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa120","COP26 - the Many Links Between Food Systems & Climate Change: Message to Glasgow","November 02, 2021","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Unless food systems transformation is put at the center of climate action, commitments governments have already made, and could make at COP26, will be jeopardized.Today's industrialized food system - which includes the growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items - makes us ill, doesn't meet the needs of the global population, and has adverse effects on climate change.Almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food systems. The industrialized practices - from chemical pesticide use to mono-culture crops - at the heart of the dominant global food system have also destroyed 66% of biodiversity, 61% of commercial fish stocks, and 33% of soils.Then there's food wastage which equates to 1.3 billion tonnes a per year and produces enough GHG emissions that, should it be a country, it would be the third-largest source of GHG emissions.We know that waste and loss occur throughout the food supply-chain and mostly involve the waste of edible food by consumers in medium- and high-income countries and loss during harvest, storage, and transport in lower-income countries.Both food waste and the resulting GHG emissions raise major equity and ethical considerations.Of course, those detrimental climate impacts then come back to roost in a variety of ways, affecting weather patterns and the very land or seas that are heavily relied upon for crops, fish, and other food.The resulting lack of ability to grow or access food then becomes a major driver in malnutrition (in all its forms) within communities, with the impacts felt worst by the most vulnerable in our societies - smallholder farmers, the poor, and women.The 2021 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World estimates that around a tenth of the global population - up to 811 million people - were undernourished last year. Do we really need any other signals that the industrialized food system is simply no longer fit for purpose?The globalized food system must be overhauled so that food production can be delivered in a way that works with, rather than destroys, our natural resources and pushes planetary boundaries.It is precisely action on food that is critical to restoring planetary health, radically reducing carbon emissions, protecting nature and biodiversity, and also delivering on all Sustainable Development Goals, from zero hunger to good health and wellbeing for all.Despite a diversity of evidence making this need for transformation abundantly clear - from scientific reports and peer-reviewed literature to lived experience, oral histories, and ways of knowing - the action we need is still not where it should be on the political agenda: at the top.The risk to climate commitmentsThere is hardly any mention of food systems in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) plans - the non-binding national plans that highlight countries' actions to tackle climate change - that we've assessed to date.The Global Alliance for the Future of Food is a strategic alliance of philanthropic foundations working to transform global food systems. Out of eight assessments of countries' NDCs we have done so far, none fully account for emissions associated with food imports, particularly those related to deforestation.Research shows that, in the average European diet, a sixth of the carbon footprint comes from deforestation emissions. Meat and dairy production already use 30% of the Earth's land surface, driving unsustainable land-use as land is cleared to produce more and more livestock and the crops that feed them.Only Germany provides a clear commitment to move away from harmful subsidies and to promote sustainable food consumption, and, just Colombia and Kenya have put forward ambitious measures around agroecology and regenerative agriculture.These concepts promote sustainable farming approaches that compliment nature's systems rather than diminish them and respect human rights.Action to be takenUnless others follow suit, all climate efforts will be undermined and any commitments negotiated in Glasgow that lack a systemic and global approach to food systems transformation will simply be inadequate given the vast mitigation and adaptation potential that the sector holds.Governments worldwide must look at food systems through the lens of climate action and find new and restorative ways of feeding communities, without pushing the planet to the limits. Fortunately, approaching climate adaptation and mitigation in the context of food systems broadens the range of opportunities to achieve climate goals and facilitates the consideration of systems level effects and interactions.A food systems perspective also enables engagement of the full range of stakeholders that should be involved in food systems transformation such as those from other sectors as well as local and Indigenous groups that have knowledge of the issues.Such a perspective is critical to addressing climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which are all linked by food as the golden thread.Tried and tested methods of agroecology and regenerative agriculture already exist for others to roll out and replicate. For example, in India, chemical-free farming has been used by the 600,000 farmers involved in the Andhra Pradesh Community Managed Natural Farming programme to tackle soil degradation - which includes erosion, desertification, and other changes in soil that reduce its capacity to provide ecosystem services - and produce more variety of crops.Research shows that farming without the addition of synthetic fertilizer or pesticides is leading to incredible reductions in pollution and emissions, and better wages and earnings for farmers. Meanwhile, while in Africa, in the Luangwa Valley of Zambia, COMACO - the social enterprise promoting agroforestry - is retraining poachers to be farmers, tackling deforestation, reporting significant impacts in carbon offset, and putting an end to wildlife killing.Alongside these 'beacons of hope' governments could also promote nutritious, sustainable, whole-food diets adapted to local ecosystems and socio-cultural contexts, acting on the interconnections between food and climate.There's a growing body of research that shows that dietary change can help tackle climate change. For example, increased GHG emissions have been associated with diets higher in animal products. Yet, historically, this has received less consideration in climate policy than, say, the energy and transport sectors. Policymakers have it in their power to catalyze initiatives that enable and create positive food environments that provide equitable access and dietary guidance.There are steps governments can immediately take, ready-made policies they can adopt, partnerships they can forge. We have the evidence, we have the science, we have the urgency.What we need now is to see the political will and climate finance moving alongside bravery and connected action from our leaders so that we can all live better, as well as sustainably, on this one Earth of ours.Ruth Richardson is Executive Director, Global Alliance for the Future of FoodFollow @IPSNewsUNBureau\l"

Bye referred to devastating recent weather events, including floods in Europe, and said there was a lot at stake at COP26 with an opportunity to  build back better and create a more just society.

Africa's Special Needs and Circumstances need to be recognised globally because of our natural resource based economies, and owing to high levels of poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment,' the President said.He urged AU members to 'promote and defend' the right for African and other developing nations to develop their own climate change strategies.President Ramaphosa added that these countries must also be given support 'in the form of finance, technology and capacity building' for these strategies to be implemented and carried out.'Developed economy countries have agreed to support the implementation of Just Transitions that promote sustainable development, poverty eradication, and the creation of decent work and quality jobs.'It is still of concern that the necessary financial flows to enable developing economy countries in particular to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change remain vastly inadequate,' he said.The President reflected that global warming has had a costly impact on the countries on the continent.'Africa is experiencing the worst impacts of phenomena associated with global warming such as droughts, floods and cyclones. Climate change impacts are costing African economies between 3 and 5% of their GDPs. Despite not being responsible for causing climate change, it is Africans who are bearing both the brunt and the cost,' he said.President Ramaphosa urged that countries continue to collaborate to address climate change and its repercussions.'The nations of the world can only address the global climate change crisis by working together. All Parties should honour their undertakings and commitments, and base their climate actions and policies on latest available science. They should furthermore respect the UNFCCC's guiding principles,' Ramaphosa said. - SAnews.gov.za\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa126","OPINION: Slowly weaning South Africa off coal","November 14, 2021 Sunday","DFA","A future without coal for South Africa (decoalinisation) sounds beguiling but it is far more complex than it appears, writes Mushtak Parker.File pictureAS PRESIDENT of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa has never been wooed and flattered as much as in the months leading up to in Glasgow.As dapper as he is, the likes of John Kerry, Angela Merkel, Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen want one thing above all else from Ramaphosa.They want to wean him and the country off coal, which accounts for 80% of South Africa's energy mix, as part of 's ambition towards 'consigning coal power to history'.Of all the fossil fuels, coal is a bigger source of carbon emissions than oil and gas \- 14.7Gt of CO2 compared with 11.5Gt for oil and 7.7Gt for gas, according to the Global Carbon Budget 2021.But coal is a resilient adversary and like all commodities subject to market vagaries.Instead of a retreat from coal, European countries sought refuge in coal and lignite in Q3 2021 as record gas prices hit the continent. The European Electricity Generation Summary Q3-2021 of EnAppSys, confirms that coal and lignite contributed a greater fuel mix share than gas, producing 110TWh compared with 92TWh by gas-fired plants.Eskom's Emalahleni coal mine in Mpumalanga, one of 15 across the country, which supplies most of its coal feedstock, has contributed to making South Africa the 12th biggest CO and the largest SO emitter in the world.The carrot is an initial commitment of $8.5bn (R126bn) \- money the National Treasury needs given the current state of the economy \- pledged by rich western nations in Glasgow last Tuesday, for the next three to five years in a partnership with Pretoria to support a just transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy and society bereft of coal power.""The idea is that the countries support South Africa to phase out of coal faster, and to go earlier and faster into developing renewables. I am confident that this partnership could become a template on how to support just transitions around the globe,"" said Von der Leyen.The rewards for ""Not King Coal"" Ramaphosa and the country are potentially huge \- a future without polluting coal which has devastated communities with shockingly poor air quality and respiratory conditions. And a contribution towards Pretoria's stated now revised ambition of initially reducing coal's contribution to the energy mix to less than 60% and eventually phasing it out completely, and upscaling wind, solar and other non-polluting power.""South Africa is committed to playing its part in reducing global emissions,"" Ramaphosa said.""The partnership that we have established today is a watershed moment not only for our own just transition, but for the world as a whole. It is proof that we can take ambitious climate action while increasing our energy security, creating jobs and harnessing new opportunities for investment, with support from developed economies.""A future without coal for South Africa (decoalinisation) sounds beguiling but it is far more complex than it appears. The transition may take up to half a century and will need regular injections of new funds.The real costs will be much higher when you factor in medium-term GDP growth, which Fitch Ratings projects ""to decl"

The deal, announced in November, to help SA manage the transition of its carbon-intensive economy, was a world first and was seen as one of the successes of the climate change conference, COP26, held in Glasgow, Scotland. In terms of the agreement, the governments of France, Germany, the UK and the US, as well as the EU, would help SA ""mobilise"" $8.5bn (about R129bn) to support SA's ""just transition"". Though Ramaphosa described the agreement, which seeks to help SA end its reliance on coal while supporting communities and workers in coal-producing areas, as a ""watershed moment"", others in the government - notably mineral resources and energy minister Gwede Mantashe - have been more sceptical. Speaking during a planning session of the presidential climate commission Gordhan expressed doubt that SA's partners would stick to their word, citing recent experiences with Covid-19 and vaccine access. ""The developing world as a whole has to learn some lessons from our past 18 months of experience in access to Covid-19 vaccines. ""The reality is that you will get a few minor donations, but the rest of the stuff is going to cost you money, which was the case as far as [SA was] concerned."" The comments from SA may create unease with partner nations as they indicate that a widely hailed agreement that could be seen as a model for other countries is far from being a done deal.

The partnership between SA and the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU is the first transaction to emerge from COP26, with world leaders expressing hope that it can be ""a template"" for other economies.While the money will not flow to Eskom but into an independently managed Just Transition Financing Facility, the funders have made it clear that their interest is to fund Eskom's transition, which is where the big wins for emissions reductions lie.De Ruyter, who was a major force behind the deal, said in a short statement on Wednesday: ""As a major contributor to SA's carbon footprint, Eskom will play a pivotal role in enabling a just energy transition from coal to low- and no-carbon sources of electricity generation.""The estimated cost of the transition is between $30bn-35bn over 15 years. The agreement announced at COP26 is therefore an important first step towards funding the transition in a socially and economically just way, while enabling SA to meet its new and ambitious nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets.""NDC targets are self-imposed emissions reductions targets adopted by national governments.The $8.5bn will flow over three to five years and will enable Eskom to begin the retirement of certain coal stations, build renewable energy and invest in the transmission grid to enable new connections of renewable energy.

The agency, Mwungano (alliance) will specialise in pan-African environment, social and governance (ESG).-. Mwungano ESG will serve companies that are prioritising ESG, to address the complex landscape of issues with an effective and clear communications strategy - and a team of senior specialists to implement it. The agency is based in Johannesburg, South Africa with another office in Abidjan, C\'f4te d Ivoire.The importance of ESG disclosure by companies has been lingering in Africa for decades, however, the Covid-19 pandemic has elevated the issue and now investors are convinced more than ever that companies should focus their resources on ESG.According to Morningstar, by end of June 2021, global sustainability-themed fund assets grew by 12% to over $2tn. Additionally, the world especially Africa - has seen great efforts in achieving sound corporate governance in the past years. Although inclusivity has made many strides, there is still a long way to go.Numerous global companies are changing their business objectives and policies, incorporating specific and binding ESG related regulations that are aligned with the sustainability-related standards and goals set by organisations such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), and COP26.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/224920.html :EMBED-->This is an increasingly growing trend that has a long-term outlook and requires partnerships across the private and public sectors. Moreover, global institutions are now creating ESG business divisions within, to help bolster their sustainable business approach.Masipa says, We are seeing an increase of ESG related crises for companies, and our ambition is to strategically guide entities and investors and help them tell their stories in a compelling manner. We have a dedicated team of experts and tools to proactively manage them and show their impact. Our two agencies have had strategic relations for a while, this expansion of our offering opens doors and positions us well to also capitalise on the new economic synergies across Francophone and Anglophone markets, and opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA). adds Masipa ESG is expected to become mainstream in doing business as companies want to grow all while considering societal impact, preserving the environment and minimising the effects of climate change.For the African continent, it is important for companies to build with the young population in mind. This requires a deep-seated integration within companies policies, financial regulations, marketing, and advertising practices, as well as human relations (HR) policies, says Senou. And that is precisely why we are introducing a specialist firm with African interest at the heart of it, which considers risks and opportunities on sustainability issues for domestic and international companies. At Mwungano, we are better positioned to deliver sustainable investment communications advisory, he concludes.The team will also be supported by a team of expert advisors in ESG, communications and business experts across Africa.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa133","South Africa's energy transition package: still in green and browncamouflage","November 24, 2021 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","It's never been easy to categorise South Africa's energy policies. While the country has been eager to excel in global climate diplomacy, being both a UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conference host and a Pan-African voice amplifying the call for western historical responsibilities, South Africa's domestic climate and energy policies have been less outspoken.-Long-standing path dependencies, labelled as the minerals-energy complex , have resulted in a conglomerate of mining industry, national banks and the notoriously indebted energy monopolist Eskom. Although South Africa was an early adopter of clean energy policies, only its highly credited energy auction instrument finally turned the tide by adding more than 5GW of clean energy to the national grid. But this move was met with reluctance. This resulted in Eskom blocking grid access to dozens of renewable energy providers in 2018. South Africa s energy transition shows signs of progress. But due to its market-driven impetus, the country can t create green jobs in provinces such as Limpopo or Mpumalanga where coal mines will close and put 90,000 workers at risk. And while more than 59,000 green jobs have been created, their healthier labour conditions aren t met by wages that equal those in the coal industry. This is why trade unions watch the transition process with less enthusiasm.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/222303.html :EMBED-->The COP26On the road to Glasgow, South Africa had already underscored the need for a just transition fund , which would tap western financial sources and pave a way out of coal. Indeed, during the first COP26 days, a just transition partnership was announced as one of the most powerful commitments of the international community. The US, Britain, the EU, France and Germany mobilised $8.5bn (about R131bn) in concessional loans and grants to be channelled via multilateral development banks within the next three to five years to finance South Africa s decarbonisation. Yet at the same time the South African delegation to COP26 joined forces with India and China, demanding that one of COP26 s central statements regarding decarbonisation should phase down but not phase out coal. This slight change in wording profoundly weakens the political ambitions and undermines political consensus on decarbonisation. Phasing out would demand a rapid decarbonisation of the economy, including the whole value production chain. Phasing down would opt for a much slower coal exit. In general, the finance instrument builds on the cheap pricing of clean energy and considers coal assets as too risky. The just transition partnership with South Africa is the first of its kind. It uses an innovative instrument, the Accelerating Coal Transition facility, which was designed by the World Bank s Climate Investment Fund. It will target energy governance, mining communities needs and infrastructural demands. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/222084.html :EMBED-->The deal so farWhile the details of this particular partnership have not yet been laid open to the public, several points give an impression of its direction and aims:- Support Eskom to decommission coal power stations and replace them with greener stations. This sounds like a solution to the pending transition risk, with Eskom planning to remove 22GW generation capacity from the energy system by 2035. But while Eskom is indeed turning to renewable energy, not least to avoid financial risks, this conversion still includes erecting new coal power stations. These are less carbon dioxide intense, but prolong the carbon economy. It s also unclear whether gas is considered as a bridge technology .- Strengthen private investment in renewable energy. This could foster energy auctions and competition in the energy market. But the current auction scheme has resulted in uneven renewable energy development. Enhanced competition may be detrimental for renewable energy projects with high public ownership. A transformation driven by the accelerating coal transition instrument may increase financialisation, i.e., the dominance of private and transnational interests over South Africa s energy sector at the expense of public and domestic interests and needs.- Strengthen investment in green hydrogen. This closely matches with Germany s and the EU s geopolitical interests, as their hydrogen strategies consider South Africa a target country for producing and exporting hydrogen. Still, a hydrogen economy is projected to materialise only around 2050, as the technologies for producing and transporting hydrogen are still in prototypical stage and are currently subject to massively subsidised research.- Decarbonising value chains, and converting brown jobs into green jobs. This is a strong commitment to a just transition, which may indeed bring social security to the mine workers at risk. It may also enhance political stability. Still, this also targets South Africa s political sovereignty, especially as social welfare issues such as job conversion a centrepiece of public governance become subject to the way green funds work.Overall, this kind of partnership is laudable as far as it may support South Africa in overcoming its huge transition risk and in stabilising social peace. The move towards job conversion is remarkable, as a just transition scenario needs to reflect the social situation of mine workers and go beyond cheap talk. To live up to this, government must foster strong cooperation with trade unions. Yet the managerial language of the accelerating coal transition instrument tells a different story, as the main aim is to de-risk energy governance, social tensions and infrastructural challenges. This managerial language makes greater cooperation with trade unions difficult. In this regard the package is a win for the minerals-energy complex, which will receive lavish support to transform its business model. The next year will tell what emerges.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

Since HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/article/brexit-uk-eu-explained.htmlBrexit, the United Kingdom is desperate for a showpiece to prove that there is such a thing as ""Global Britain"".The stakes are high. Research by the UN showed last month that global temperatures are on course to rise to 2.7\'b0C higher than pre-industrial levels. The talks are key to pushing countries to be more ambitious in the measures they are taking to prevent that from happening. Developing countries are also asking where the $100-billion a year is that they were promised by rich countries to adapt to climate change.But success at COP26 is now up against the reality of how the UK and its peers have treated the rest of the world. The latest chapter is Covid-19. Wealthy countries raced to lock down as many vaccines as possible. Despite having money on the table, African countries and their peers were locked out and people are dying as a result. Those purposefully excluded countries are angry.Covid-19 has shown that when a crisis unfolds, selfishness prevails. It is particularly significant because climate negotiations, like , are based on every country working together to tackle the most complicated challenge in human history.But The GuardianThis week, South Africa's chief diplomatic spokesperson floated the idea on Twitter of affected countries rejecting this unequal treatment and not going to the negotiations.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa135","R130bn funding is Eskom\u8217 s \u8216 first step\u8217 ","November 7, 2021 Sunday","Cape Argus (South Africa)/Argus Weekend (South Africa)","DAYS after the announcement that South Africa would receive R130 billion from wealthier nations to end the country\' s reliance on coal, embattled power utility Eskom struggled to keep the lights on again.While Eskom chief executive Andr\'e9 de Ruyter welcomed the COP26 climate summit deal, he cautioned it was only the first step in South Africa\' s  just energy transition that would take place over the next 15 years.President Cyril Ramaphosa hailed the deal as  a watershed moment for the renewable sector in which his brother-in-law and mining billionaire businessman Patrice Motsepe\' s African Rainbow Energy and Power (AREP) has continued its expansion.AREP won just under half of the projects awarded in the state\' s latest push for green energy. The company, a member of the Ikamva equity consortium, won preferred bidder status for 12 of the 25 projects awarded in the State\' s renewable power plan announced last week.De Ruyter said the COP26 an- nouncement would enable  South Africa to meet its new and ambitious nationally determined contribution targets .But the Eskom boss said the utility would require $35bn over 15 years to wean South Africa\' s 13 coal-fired power stations to more renewable energy.South Africa currently emits the most greenhouse gases on the continent, because of its reliance on coal for electricity, a blight on its carbon footprint which US president Joe Biden, at COP26, said they wanted to help tackle.  We want to help transform their economy to a clean energy economy more quickly. On Friday afternoon, Eskom went from announcing load shedding stage 2 to load shedding stage 4, in a matter of hours. This time it was attributed to generating units having shut down at the Kendal power station and the tripping of units at both the Tutuka and Matimba power stations.Energy analyst and the managing director at EE Business Intelligence, Chris Yelland, said he was pleased to hear the announcement because South Africa\' s carbon emissions were the highest in Africa. To reach a partnership agreement to gain access to funding that helps us do what we need to do helps South Africa and helps decarbonise the world.  If we use this money correctly and we carry out our commitment to decarbonising our economy, this is just the beginning of our green finance, he said.Yelland believed the most efficient way to use this funding was to combine solar, wind, gas-to-power and battery energy storage systems. These offer the least-cost pathway for new generation capacity while generating the least amount of carbon emissions. The energy expert said one of the highlights of transition was two-fold job creation. There are jobs that occur in the construction phase and also in operation and maintenance, Yelland said.Additionally, he said that more jobs were created in the renewable energy sector, despite the fact that it was currently a significant minority in the energy sector.Senior energy analyst at Greencape Collins Nyamadzawo said choosing renewable energy sources was advantageous in many ways. They are a vehicle to reduce the rising global temperatures and the subsequent climate change catastrophe. Nyamadzawo said an ideal energy policy for South Africa was aimed to reduce the cost of electricity while increasing grid reliability.He said:  It looks at environmentally friendly and socially inclusive ways of powering our homes and industries. Nyamadzawo added:  This move also improves the country\' s attractiveness as an investment destination. Now that we know better, we must do better. He echoed Yelland\' s words on how renewable energy would be pivotal for job creation. The growth of renewable energy means new jobs. Some skills are transferable and some of them will be new jobs altogether if you look at the whole value chain. Independent energy analyst Andrew Kenny was critical of renewable energy sources for South Africa. It is good to have renewable options, but wind and solar are useless for good electricity. They are unreliable, he said.Kenny added:  A good nuclear plant will last for 60 years and produce affordable and reliable electricity. He said South Africa should learn from European countries such as Denmark and Germany. They moved towards solar and wind power and now their electricity prices are going through the roof, people can\' t pay their bills and industries are shutting down. He added:  Solar and wind don't work for good electricity, R500 billion is an enormous sum and that is crazy. He previously used the example of Australia which closed coal stations, built wind turbines and some solar plants, and supplemented them with natural gas, which Australia, unlike South Africa, has in abundance. But electricity prices soared.The South African consumer could ill afford hefty electricity bills after years of power outage frustrations, he said. \l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa136","South African company directors lag on climate awareness","November 4, 2021 Thursday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","Climate change is a systemic risk for business, but research shows that South African companies are behind the curve when it comes to addressing climate impact.Around 40% of 177 directors surveyed by the Institute of Directors South Africa (IoDSA) this year cannot comfortably explain the causes of global warming, while 80% cannot explain the difference between a 1.5 \'b0C, 2 \'b0C or 4 \'b0C scenario. In addition, 34% do not currently have an approach to building capacity and competence on climate-related issues, and only 8% of directors are using the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework. Less than 8% of directors were aware of South Africa s Green Finance Taxonomy, which is currently being developed by National Treasury with support from the International Finance Corporation, the National Business Initiative and the Carbon Trust. These alarming findings were shared during the first webinar in a series devoted to empowering South African directors to make informed decisions about climate-related issues, which was by Trialogue in association with the Sustainability Institute (SI) and IoDSA on 26 October. The webinar explored key topics around the science of climate change, director-level awareness relating to the topic, and business views on the latest developments in new codes, standards and frameworks that have emerged in response to climate change. The webinar was held ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which is currently being held from 1-12 November in Glasgow, Scotland, where decisions will be taken that will have a direct impact on South African businesses. Climate change and other key risks interconnectedAccording to Dr Jess Schulschenk, director of the Sustainability Institute and one of the panelists taking part in the webinar, the world needs to halve global emissions by 2030 and reach a net zero target by 2050 to stay within a 1.5 \'b0C warming scenario. Explaining the science behind climate change, Schulshenk drew attention to the World Economic Forum s 2021 Global Risks Report (see illustration from the report below), which points to the interconnectedness of climate change to other key risks. We see that climate action failure is deeply connected and reinforces a number of global risks, many of which we see unfolding in the African context, she explained, adding that this is a social justice issue because those most affected by global warming are people who have barely contributed to it. There is a need for capacity development among business leaders to mitigate these climate-related risks, according to Trialogue senior associate consultant Nicole Martens, who indicated that South Africa is at risk of doing the bare minimum while failing to invest in capacity to do more. Company directors are therefore urged to understand the risks and assess the potential impact on their operations. -Global warming already affecting South African businessesClimate change is a systemic risk for the financial sector, explained Old Mutual Limited ESG and responsible investment analyst Terusha Ramchund. It s no longer just the heavy emitters that are responsible, but also the fiduciaries of capital having significant influence over the deployment of funds, she said. Looking across from a strategic, financial, as well as operational risk perspective, it is definitely something that needs to be integrated into the way in which we do business. Shoprite Holdings group sustainability manager Sanjeev Raghubir pointed out that heavy rainfall in Mpumalanga and drought in the Eastern and Western Cape have affected the supply and availability of some produce, like tomatoes, pushing up prices. Low income communities are set to face the biggest impact of climate change, with many of Shoprite s customers, suppliers and employees living in these areas. Raghubir said communities are already receiving support through food garden programmes and mobile soup kitchens, which Shoprite deploys in the event of any climate emergency or disaster. The retailer has committed to a 1.5 \'b0C trajectory and net zero carbon emissions by 2050, said Raghubir. This includes a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. -Where to begin to address climate impactIndependent sustainability advisor Paul Jorgensen, who focuses on climate change and natural capital strategy, said keeping up with climate news, policies, pledges, commitments, frameworks and tools can be overwhelming, but the approach to identify and manage these risks does not need to be complex. That s where TCFD really provides a helpful process to just begin, he said, noting that it is an iterative process. We need to make a start; we need to move to a low carbon economy, and we need to understand the risks and opportunities in doing so. Raghubir pointed out that science, debates, predictions and components of climate change are very complex and potentially discouraging for new entrants to engage with. It may be better to look across the value chain of your business with a climate change lens on to identify business impacts and opportunities, and address these. The layers of governance, strategy and metrics can be added thereafter, he said. Take the complexity out and be more action orientated.

It is already having to adapt to pronounced climate change impacts, including significant variations in precipitation patterns, higher temperatures, and increasing frequency and intensity of severe weather events such as droughts, floods, and cyclones.In 2015, at the United Nation's annual global climate summit COP 21, the Paris Agreement was hammered. In 2016 Eswatini joined many other countries in signing up to the Paris Agreement, a landmark agreement committing nations to a global effort to tackle climate change.Article 4 of that agreement commits national governments to provide a National Determined Contribution (NDC) every five years.The Government of Eswatini submitted its first NDC to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. But since then, technology, policies, partnerships, data, and stakeholder engagement for climate action have all advanced.In preparing its second NDC, the government looked to take these advances into account. It went back and reviewed what it had done in 2015 and sought to this time provide an NDC with even greater ambition.Over a period of 18 months, an inclusive process of assessment, analysis, and modelling of climate change, informed by data and science, was implemented to revise the NDC.Climate change will affect everyone, and as such, the government put stakeholder participation at the heart of the revision process.Adopting £ whole of government and society approach' it held over twenty stakeholders' consultations including virtual and physical workshops. A review of national gender policy to integrate climate change was also carried out.The process was not always smooth though. There were significant hurdles, not least the Covid-19 pandemic which not only delayed the expected submission of NDCs at the end of 2020 but impacted Eswatini's technical capacity to undertake such a nationwide participatory stakeholder's consultative process.However, these challenges were overcome, and the revised NDC, submitted to the UNFCCC just days ago ahead of COP26, represents an ambitious step-up from its 2015 predecessor.It adopts an economy-wide GHG emissions reduction target of 5% by 2030 compared to the basel"

This was the message President Cyril Ramaphosa gave to heads of state gathered for the two-day 35th ordinary session of the assembly of the heads of state and government of the AU taking place in Ethiopia. ""A one-size-fits-all approach to complex issues such as a transition from fossil fuels that disregards the realities on the ground in Africa will simply not work, and is neither just nor equitable,"" Ramaphosa, who attended virtually, said. ""To achieve the expected results for Africa at COP27, it is imperative that we develop a strong and well-co-ordinated common African position, that we formulate a set of robust key messages that encapsulate Africa's aspirations."" In his capacity as the outgoing co-ordinator of the AU's committee of African heads of state and government on climate change, Ramaphosa said the Covid-19 pandemic had set back multilateral processes, including climate change. ""Africa is experiencing the worst impacts of phenomena associated with global warming such as droughts, floods and cyclones."" Ramaphosa said despite not being responsible for climate change, it was costing African economies between 3%-5% of their GDP. ""It is Africans who are bearing both the brunt and cost."" He said a number of key outcomes that had been achieved since COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 included the conclusion of the Paris agreement work programme which would provide a basis for parties to implement the agreement fully. ""The complex Glasgow climate pact strives to strike the right balance by accommodating the differing national circumstances and capacities among the nearly 200 parties,"" Ramaphosa said. ""The aim is that all are enabled and empowered to contribute their fair share as well as to enhance their climate ambition."" Furthermore, he said Glasgow had sent a clear signal that the world would be safer under the 1.5& xB0;C temperature rise scenario, compared to 2& xB0;C or more. ""Developed economy countries have agreed to support the implementation of just transitions that promote sustainable development, poverty eradication, and the creation of decent work and quality jobs. ""Much more work needs to be done for Africa and the world to keep global temperature rise to 1.5& xB0;C by the end of the century."" Financial support to enable developing economy countries to mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change remained inadequate, Rama-phosa said.

""My background is in the trade union movement. ""I'm suspicious of any programme that is based on money, that will give you money. ""I don't like that,"" the minister told delegates at the Joburg Indaba on Thursday. ""I want us to have a programme, and then we look for funding. If we get green funding, I support it. ""But we should not collapse our economy because they are greedy for green funding. Mantashe's comments come a week after several ministers met with climate envoys from abroad to explore plans to fund SA's transition away from fossil fuels, including accelerating the decommissioning of SA's ageing coal-fired power plants. Mantashe, who maintains support for coal as a prominent part of SA's energy mix, was notably not part of the engagements. Rather, the SA delegation was led by minister of forestry, fisheries & the environment, Barbara Creecy, and included the ministers of trade, industry & competition and of public enterprises, as well as the deputy minister of finance and of the department of international relations & co-operation. After the engagements with the envoys last week, Creecy said SA required substantial concessional and grant funding and technical assistance to implement a just energy transition. As such, SA is proposing the establishment of a just transition financing facility, which will support the just transition process across the relevant sectors of the economy. ""This represents a win-win for SA and its international partners, enabling ambitious climate action in South Africa, addressing social impacts comprehensively while meeting developed-country commitments to finance the transition."" The engagements were ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which Mantashe will not attend. ""If I go to COP26 I think many people will be frightened - 'what is this coal fundamentalist doing in COP26?' I'm not pressured not to go, but we will keep our delegation to size and the team that go there, I have confidence in them; they will negotiate a deal that will be helpful for the SA economy.""

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa144","World: we hear cries of our trees","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","Pretoria News (South Africa)/Pretoria News Weekend (South Africa)","GLASGOW: More than 100 world leaders representing more than 85% of the world\' s forests yesterday, at COP26, the United Nations climate summit under way in Glasgow, Scotland, pledged to halt deforestation over the next decade.The announcement included Brazil, which is home to the Amazon rainforest, as well as Canada, Russia, Norway, Colombia and Indonesia. The US also signed onto the agreement, which was backed by $12 billion in public funds and $7.2bn in private money.The destruction of forests is a major factor driving up global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with about 23% of total emissions stemming from agriculture, forestry and other land uses.Trees play a critical role in absorbing carbon dioxide as they grow, thereby slowing global warming. When they are cut, and are either burned or decay, they release this carbon into the atmosphere. While environmentalists and many politicians have worked to keep the world\' s remaining forests intact for years during previous UN climate summits, they suggested the new agreement could make a turning point. Our challenge now must be to halt deforestation and begin restoring forests around the world, and we must do this within the decade or risk the collapse of forests world wide. It\' s a huge undertaking, said David Attenborough.  We need to accelerate action on a global scale. Britain, which is co-hosting COP26 with Italy, has coined the mantra  coal, cars, cash and trees to describe the top priorities at the climate summit: phasing out fossil fuels, switching to clean vehicles, mobilizing funding and stopping deforestation.In addition to the deforestation pledge, 28 countries also agreed to sign a  Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade statement aimed at removing deforestation from the global supply chain \- for goods such as palm oil, soy and cocoa. As part of the announcements, over than 30 financial institutions covering more than $8.7 trillion in assets have also agreed to eliminate investment in commodity-driven deforestation from agriculture.Other efforts in the past have fallen far short of their goals. In 2014, more than 200 governments, companies and civil society organisations signed the New York Declaration of Forests, which called for halving the rate deforestation by 2020 and halting it by 2030.Instead, deforestation remains rampant worldwide. A satellite-based survey by Global Forest Watch found that, last year, the world lost nearly 100 000 square miles of tree cover \- an area roughly the size of Colorado. It\' s become abundantly clear that the destruction of nature writ large is causing unprecedented harm, said Morgan Gillespy, director of the Food and Land Use Coalition at World Resources Institute.In Costa Risa, the government has been paying farmers to protect forests near their farms. The project was among the five inaugural winners of Prince William\' s Earthshot prize, which highlights creative climate solutions.As for the latest agreement,  it is unclear who has participated in the negotiations , wrote Luciana T\'e9llez Ch\'e1vez, a researcher at Human Rights Watch.  The Forest Deal should commit to goals that are more ambitious, rather than simply duplicate past pledges to end deforestation by 2030. More details on COP26 proposal are expected throughout the conference, including on Saturday, which is themed as  nature day. I can\' t think of anything we can do that\' s not founded on nature\' s processes, said Partha Dasgupta, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Cambridge, also in the video.  If we jeopardize that, it\' s not just our economies that are in trouble \- our lives are in trouble. \l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa145","Nature-Based Solutions for Enhancing Coordinated Action Around Climate Change, Land and Biodiversity [opinion]","December 17, 2021","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","A key outcome of COP26 climate summit is the enhanced focus on ""nature-based solutions"" - the plans for people to work closely alongside nature to avert a planetary catastrophe.While there is emerging consensus around nature-based solutions (NbS), the overarching concept encompasses a wide range of approaches and actions that involve the ecosystem, which address societal and biodiversity challenges while also benefitting human well-being and nature.In terms of climate change, it implies working with nature's capacity to absorb greenhouse gases that cause global warming. This includes sustainable land-use practices and management of forests that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it for millions of years. It can also entail transformations in major sectors such as agriculture, livestock, land, water and waste management to ensure the protection of our planet.Nature-based solutions not only help to mitigate climate change by expanding natural carbon sinks, they enhance biodiversity, provide food and water, help clean the air and sustain other resources, as well as provide job opportunities, whilst also protecting communities against flooding and landslides. Some estimates state that NbS have the potential to supply up to 37 percent of our climate change mitigation needs.Importantly, NbS meet the cross-cutting goals of the three key United Nations treaties on the environment - also known as the Rio Conventions, on climate change, biodiversity and desertification. Across the 54 countries of the Commonwealth, governments, communities and the private sector are keenly adopting NbS approaches, with most countries incorporating NbS actions in their national climate plans. Some examples of NbS include Pakistan's Ten Billion Tree Tsunami programme, which aims to restore about 600,000 hectares of forest and create thousands of jobs; Sri Lanka's response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami by rehabilitating vast areas of mangrove swamps; and the ""We Plantin'"" campaign of Barbados to plant one million trees.To make natural climate solutions truly effective, there are several issues that we must address. One key challenge is the lack so far of an agreed framework or standard as to what constitutes an effective NbS. As IUCN points out, ""misunderstanding and misuse of NbS have led to applications that cause harm to biodiversity and communities and threaten to erode stakeholders' trust in the approach."" Examples include mass reforestation of single-species or non-native species, land grabbing for reforestation, and curtailing of rights of Indigenous peoples through conservation projects.Further, NbS should not support or encourage carbon offsetting by polluting industries, as a way to justify their continued or growing emissions. A strong framework and standards have to be developed to guard against the misuse of ""nature-based"" to ensure effective climate action.There is also a need to enhance awareness and knowledge about the different ways to include NbS in national climate plans. A recent study suggests that though large-scale tree planting and reforestation have become the most popular route for many governments, other solutions such as sustainable farming and animal-rearing practices, sustainable land and water conservation and management, reducing food waste and engaging indigenous communities in NbS would be more beneficial. The conservation of high-carbon ecosystems - such as peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests - also deliver the largest and most timely climate benefits.Finally, there is a massive financing gap to be filled, for, despite our significant dependence on nature, the sector receives very little investment. Estimates by UN environment shows that if our world is to meet targets for climate change, biodiversity and land degradation, it needs to close a US$4.1 trillion financing gap, requiring tripling investments in NbS over the next 10 years and quadrupling them by 2050. This amounts to an estimated US$536 billion worth of funding required every year.There were some promising announcements at COP26, including a US$12 billion pledge in public financing for ending deforestation, however, we are far short of the required target. At the moment, the total falls significantly short, and private sector funding, in particular, needs to be scaled up.Of the estimated US$133 billion per year directed towards NbS globally, only 14 percent is private sector finance, compared to 86 percent from public funds and subsidies. Lack of private sector funding is partly related to the complex nature of NbS projects and financial instruments and the long-time frame for returns on investments. The public sector thus has a crucial role to play in leveraging increased private sector funding by de-risking investments in NbS.Innovative financing mechanisms such as green bonds, credit swaps for climate, debt-for-nature swaps, and carbon markets are also being actively explored in Commonwealth countries.The Commonwealth through its 'Call to Action on Living Lands' is leading on tackling the climate change challenges. Addressing the issues in the context of meeting the targets of the three Rio conventions, leaders from member countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific expressed their support during the COP26 summit for a proposed Commonwealth Living Lands Charter.The proposed Charter is a progression of the on-going programme on land, biodiversity and climate change of the Secretariat since 2017. The Charter will be discussed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Rwanda in 2022, with a potential to spur cooperation among all 54 Commonwealth nations to manage land use sustainably, protect the natural world and fight climate change. Focus areas being explored include climate resilient agriculture, soil and water conservation and management, sustainable green cover and biodiversity, low carbon livestock management and active engagement of indigenous people.Nature-based solutions for acceleration of action around land, climate change and biodiversity need judicial attention and support, not least in terms of finance. NbS do not offer a silver bullet to resolve the climate crisis, but they are extremely vital to drastically curtail greenhouse gas emissions and meet the Nationally Determined Contributions to 2030.Dr Ruth Kattumuri is Senior Director, Economic, Youth and Sustainable Development at the Commonwealth Secretariat.Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau\l"

We welcome the R131bn in concessional funding SA scored at COP26 in Glasgow as an opportunity to reimagine our future. Our carbon emissions are a significant contribution to global greenhouse gases; communities close to coal mines endure conflict and environmental degradation as the price of jobs. Carbon neutrality has up to now been an unrealisable dream.COP26 has been to a significant extent about how to finance the transition away from carbon-producing forms of energy, notably coal. It has also been about the duties of rich countries to help developing countries.Gwede Mantashe, minister of mineral resources & energy, doesn't want anyone to tell us when to close our coal mines. And we agree that it is easy to find hypocrisy in Western countries that want the rest of the world to give up fossil fuels while they continue to burn through disproportionately high amounts of carbon-emitting energy.But it is quixotic, if not suicidal, to complain about a global consensus to phase out coal before 2050 when that is the best contribution we can make to bringing global warming into the safety zone, and when we are being given the finance to do it.Coal mines can't be closed down without cleaner energies being available, but it is in everyone's interests for them to close, or at least significantly recede in importance in our energy mix. This deal gives us the opportunity to develop other sources of energy.This is not a time to be carping about Ts & Cs. It is a carpe diem moment, a time for creative and consultative interventions to ensure coal-mining communities are upskilled to make a decent living, rehabilitate their environments and become resilient against the effects of climate change.

As part of the application for an exploration right, applicants were required to develop an environmental management programme in terms of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002, which in this instance was approved in 2013 by the DMRE, it said.The exploration right was subsequently granted by the department in April 2014, allowing the holder to, among other activities, acquire three-dimensional seismic data during the survey window period, which was usually from December to May, to avoid migratory marine mammals.The department said an independent audit was undertaken last year to confirm that the controls and mitigation measures were still valid. The outcomes of the audit were that the measures contained in the environmental management programme sufficiently provide for the avoidance and mitigation of potential environmental impacts, the department said.At Cape Town Harbour, where the Amazon Warrior is docked, screams of  to hell with Shell by environmental activists were heard. The ship is set to begin a seismic survey off the Eastern Cape\' s Wild Coast on December 1 in a search for oil and gas. The Oceans Not Oil Coalition\' s petition against Shell\' s exploration in South Africa has drawn more than 200 000 signatures.However, the department said it stood by its initial decision and that the development of an upstream oil and gas industry was a necessary part of South Africa\' s economic recovery strategy.The petition\' s creator and Oceans Not Oil Coalition\' s founding member, Janet Solomon, said the negative impacts of seismic surveys went across the food chain, and since sound travelled more easily under water than through air, the blasts from a single seismic survey could travel tens of thousands of square kilometres, interrupting the communication, reproduction, navigation and eating habits essential to the survival of marine life.Extinction Rebellion Cape Town spokesperson Michael Wolf said:  With COP26 fresh on our minds, the desperate need to stop fossil fuel developments to avert catastrophic climate change has never been clearer and scientifically more substantiated. AfriOceans Conservation Alliance founder Lesley Rochat said South Africa was the 12th biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the world and if the country did not fulfil its recent commitments at COP26 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through fossil fuel burning \- which this seismic survey would increase \- the nation stood to lose a lot more than Shell\' s venture promised to bring.\l"

Now it's the first question they ask.Yet at both a company and national level, we have to answer that our electricity is supplied by Eskom, the world's worst-polluting power company, according to the Centre for Research and Energy on Clean Air. It immediately puts us at a disadvantage.SA has committed to achieving net -zero emissions by 2050 but faces difficult challenges for its transition, the primary one being that we're the world's 12th-highest emitter of greenhouse gases. This is largely because we are still overly reliant on coal-generated electricity.The harsh practicality of this means that in a country that also has the world's highest unemployment rate, the lifespan of an important, labour-intensive industry is finite.At the same time, though, development of renewable energy will be blossoming, with gas power as a transition fuel also being developed, creating new jobs. Our challenge lies in repurposing coal mines where possible and reskilling coal miners while accelerating our development in the high-growth renewables sector.The private sector is working hard to reduce emissions. All major emitters have strategies in place, with Sasol planning to cut emissions 30% by 2030 while ArcelorMittal has implemented a global $10bn strategy to reach net zero by 2050. Organised business, through the National Business Initiative, has been instrumental in charting a path for each sector towards net zero.Heading into the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow next week, we have in place a plan for the transition: the presidential climate commission has plotted a pathway for the transition with set targets. We have no choice but to implement it.If we don't, fewer and fewer offshore companies will want to do business with us, global fund managers will exclude us from their investment portfolios and international pressure will keep ratcheting up. But to implement that plan, we need to secure green funding and this is proving a struggle.At COP26And here I despair that we're not putting up a united front, with the result that our case is weaker than it could be.Last month, minerals & energy minister Gwede Mantashe skipped a meeting with the Climate Investment Fund and climate envoys from the UK, US, Germany, France and the EU who were in SA to discuss green financing, and he has repeatedly stated in public that he rejects conditions to loans such as banning new coal power projects.The 2019 Integrated Resource Plan, which most experts agree is already out of date, allows for 1,500MW of new coal capacity. Even though numerous studies show that renewables are the least-cost solution for electricity supply while reducing emissions, Mantashe asserts that with coal, SA will experiment with ""new technologies that may cut emissions when the fuel is burnt"".I fear that he will find his international counterparts at COP26 as well as international investors give him short shrift.That makes it all the more difficult for the rest of the SA team, who are all committed to the country's important objective of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and integrating wholly into the international business community.Mavuso is CEO of Business Leadership SA..A demonstrator holds up a sign on October 1 2021 as he attends a Fridays for Future climate strike in Milan, Italy ahead of Glasgow's COP26 meeting.

Shell says it complied fully with public consultation and environmental impact laws and before commencing the Wild Coast seismic survey. Asked how seismic blasting fitted in with Shell's nature-based approach, the company adopted a ""funnel"" metaphor - and spoke of their hope of expanding ever further. Their statement read: ""In order for us to meet energy demand, we must ensure we have a strong project funnel and resilient future development opportunities."" One objector who signed up as an interested and affected party said the consultation process happened almost six years ago when Silver Wave Pty Ltd owned exploration right 12/3/252. ""We thought it was on the shelf, but suddenly on June 25 this year I got an email from SLR notifying me of an audit report of an environment management programme summary. It is all very hazy and sudden."" Shell's bland response came hours after world leaders launched the UN's Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow this week with dire warnings about climate chaos caused by fossil fuel emissions already harming humanity. Fiery warning speeches were delivered by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Prince of Wales Charles George, and nature moviemaker activist Sir Richard Attenborough. But the stage belonged to Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley who attacked the polluting north for not trying hard enough, and placing millions of people in southern islands at risk of being engulfed by rising oceans. The last six years were the hottest on record. On Thursday, Shell's consultant, Eloise Costandius of SLR Consulting in Johannesburg, said SLR was not involved in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process, but was appointed to ""distribute the commencement of operation notice"" published in the Dispatch on Tuesday. Shell said they had complied with the National Environmental Management Act's environmental impact regulations, appointing an ""independent environmental practitioner"" to compile a list of interested and affected parties and issuing a ""background information document"". There were two rounds of commenting, everyone on the database was promised notifications and updates on outcomes, and parties could comment on the draft environmental management programme (EMPr). There was ""a series of face-to-face"" group meetings ""in an open-house format"", focused group meetings, and then, Shell said, ""the environmental authorisation has been obtained to undertake this survey."" It did not state when this happened. Shell said it would be using three ""airgun arrays"" for ""12 to 18 hours a day"". Asked if research was done on the impact of the airgun sounds on marine life, such as Brydes and beaked whales, and the entire marine ecosystem, Shell responded: ""Specialist studies have been undertaken by independent environmental specialists, which have informed the assessment of impacts in the area and mitigation measures to be adopted for the project."" The source said the marine mammal report produced in 2014-15 was outdated. Shell said it was a deeply committed partner of SA government in its ""just energy transition"". Dr Jean Harris, executive director of WildOceans, said: ""It is outrageous that these surveys will begin before the last of the humpback whales have completed their migration through that area.

This finance would bolster the bank's funding for green projects and strengthen its position as a leader in financing renewable projects in South Africa.-While countries in Africa may be least responsible for the severity of the climate change we are currently experiencing, it is also the continent on which the impacts are likely to be most readily felt. A just transition to renewable energies is needed, particularly in those countries that have until now depended on fossil fuels to provide much-needed employment. The way in which that transition occurs will be vastly different to how it comes about in other, more developed markets, so sustainable finance solutions are vital if we want to drive inclusive growth and mitigate alarming climate impacts.Absa Group was the first South African company to voluntarily include a climate-change resolution in its 2020 AGM agenda, with a view to investing substantial resources in understanding, and ameliorating, climate change. We were a founding signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking and signed an agreement with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, which includes financing climate action. We also established the dedicated Sustainable Finance team in our Corporate and Investment Banking business; elevated Sustainability Risk within our Risk Management Framework and published our first Task Force Report, early last year, on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.We also announced sustainable finance targets and have financed 33 deals, or 46% of South Africa s renewables projects, to date, making us one of the leading financiers for the country s extensive renewable energy programmes. In addition, we are a lead arranger and senior lender in South Africa s largest concentrated solar-powered tower plant, valued at R12bn. We partnered with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to do a pilot on climate change impacts and have committed to developing standards for the oil, gas and mining sectors before the end of the year.In light of COP26 and the energy transition<!>An important COP26 webinar for all finance institutions The Power to Transform: Leveraging Sustainable Finance for the Energy Transition was held on 4 November 2021. The speakers focused on the financial innovation needed, on a global basis, to unlock the capital to drive what they referred to as the energy transition . This they defined as a shift away from fossil-fuel-linked energy production and consumption towards renewable energy sources in which regulation would see investors prioritising environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.Here in South Africa, Absa Group has shown its commitment to a just transition to net-zero emissions along its now-lengthy sustainability journey. Foremost among these is, of course, our 2019 pledge to take an active leadership role in encouraging sustainable practices and enabling economic activities that create shared prosperity for current and future generations. The Principles for Responsible Banking pledge we made is supported by a strong implementation and accountability framework.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa158","Greenwashed imperialism is not a climate solution","December 17, 2021 Friday","Cape Times (South Africa)","FIGHTING global warming is not just about providing a path to net-zero carbon emissions for all countries. It is also about figuring out how best to meet the energy needs of people across the world, while working towards net-zero emissions. If fossil fuels have to be given up, which has now become an urgent need given the current environmental challenges, countries in Africa and a significant part of Asia, including India, need an alternate path for providing electricity to their people. What then is the best alternate course for poorer countries to follow for electricity production \- if they do not use the fossil fuel route \- that is being used by rich countries? This in turn also raises questions about how much this alternative energy source route will cost poorer countries, and who will pay the bills incurred when making the switch to this new source of energy?Discussions on these issues, which are pertinent to resolving the climate crisis were completely absent from the agenda, which concluded on November 13. The financing of a low-carbon emission path was conveniently delinked from commitments towards cutting down carbon emissions and now faces an uncertain future, with developed countries failing to live up to their earlier  pledge of providing finance to developing nations to  help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature .Some numbers are important here to understand the extent to which developing nations have contributed to the present climate crisis and to greenhouse gas emissions. The EU plus the UK produce more than twice the carbon emissions of the entire continent of Africa, with less than half of Africa\' s population.It is argued that as the cost of electricity from renewables has now fallen below the cost of electricity from fossil fuels, it should be possible for all countries, rich or poor, to phase out fossil fuels completely and shift to renewable energy sources without addressing the issue of funding. What has been overlooked here is that for poor countries to make this switch, they would need to build three or four times the capacity to generate electricity from renewables to supply the same amount of energy that they currently get from fossil-fuel plants. This is why rich countries asking poor countries to make net-zero pledges without committing to providing them with any money is completely hypocritical.Tomorrow, the rich countries can \- and most probably will \- turn around and say that the poor countries made the commitment towards ensuring net-zero emissions, and they should now borrow from the rich countries at high interest rates and make good on their promises or else face sanctions. In other words, this would lead to a new form of green colonialism.The second problem with renewables as the main source of electricity is that there are significant additional costs for setting up the grid for short-term or long-term storage of electricity.The point here is that shifting to a grid that is entirely based on renewable energy is still technologically some time away. Meanwhile, rich countries like the US and those in Europe have enough gas resources. Poorer countries like India and China do not; they only have coal resources. The last word on hypocrisy is Norway\' s. At a time when it is expanding its own oil and gas production, Norway, along with seven other Nordic and Baltic countries, has been lobbying the World Bank  to stop all financing of natural gas projects in Africa and elsewhere, as soon as 2025 .While Norway may have been the most blatant, 20 countries made similar resolutions at COP26 to end  financing for fossil-fuel development overseas , according to The Guardian newspaper. For them, climate change negotiations are the way to keep their dominant energy positions while denying not only climate reparations, but also finances to the poorest of countries that are trying to provide their people with subsistence energy.Purkayastha is the founding editor of Newsclick, a digital media-platform.\l"

The plan is to decommission Eskom's coal-fired power stations and repurpose them for renewable energy.The funding will take the form of grants, concessional loans, investment and risk-sharing instruments, as well as mobilising the private sector to reduce emissions, develop electric vehicles and implement green hydrogen.Celebrating the partnership, President Cyril Ramaphosa said: ""Climate change is an existential challenge that confronts us all, and South Africa is committed to playing its part in reducing global emissions. The partnership that we have established is a watershed moment not only for our own just transition, but for the world as a whole. It is proof that we can take ambitious climate action while increasing our energy security, creating jobs and harnessing new opportunities for investment, with support from developed economies.""In a broader sense, Creecy says the Glasgow outcome has to be a package deal that advances the negotiations and all three aspects of the Paris Agreement, namely mitigation, adaptation, and the means of implementation of climate action.\~For almost three decades, governments across the globe have met nearly every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), every country is treaty-bound to ""avoid dangerous climate change"" and to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way.Over the years, the summit has swung between fractious and soporific, interspersed with moments of high drama, occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009).\~ The COP26 summit was postponed by a year due to Covid-19 and is being viewed by many as pivotal to saving the planet from the continued negative effects of climate change. It aims to curb emissions, negotiate how best to ensure global average temperature increases stay below 1.5\'b0C, reduce coal use, establish rules for a global carbon market, and raise billions in climate finance.Temperatures around the world are about 1.1 - 1.2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, and greenhouse gas emissions are still on an upward trend. Carbon dioxide output plunged globally during the Covid-19 lockdowns last year, but this was temporary and has begun to surge as economies recover. To stay within the 1.5\'b0C goal, global emissions need to come down by about 7% a year for this decade.Since the Paris Accord in 2015, scientists have issued increasingly urgent warnings that the goal of 1.5\'b0C is slipping out of reach.

The Climate Change Bill provides for a co-ordinated and integrated response by the economy and society to climate change and its impacts. It provides for the effective management of inevitable climate change impacts by enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, said Modise. He said the tabling of the Climate Bill in the National Assembly represented an important step forward in the development of the country\' s architecture to manage and combat climate change.In his recent address at the annual Windaba conference, Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) executive director Crispian Olver highlighted that by 2050, a renewables-dominated power system would be the most cost-competitive system for South Africa.However, for the country to reach net zero by 2050, Olver said it needed to speed up deployment of renewable energy capacity. Transitioning South Africa\' s power system to net-zero will require the deployment of roughly 150GW of wind and solar capacity by 2050. This is almost four times the total capacity of South Africa\' s coal power plants today. It represents an investment of around R3 trillion within the next 30 years, said Olver.Sawea believed the deployment of wind and other renewable sources of energy would go a long way to enable the necessary de-carbonisation, as set out by the Climate Change Bill, to reach the global net zero by 2050 target.From the latest CO2 emission targets released by the PCC, Sawea technical programmes officer Letlhogonolo Tsoai said they noted increased commitment from the state to de-carbonise, and acknowledged this commitment as symbolic to mitigating the global climate emergency.\l"

Let's allow it to benefit [SA] as long as it can,"" he said on Thursday.The country has had its fair share of load-shedding due to regular breakdowns of coal-fired power stations such as Kusile and Medupi, with load-shedding said to have cost the economy more than R400bn.Mantashe, who was a mineworker for 31 years, said coal mining had given blacks access to ownership, and the government could not shut down coal generation overnight.Last year, the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU offered to mobilise an initial $8.5bn over the next three to five years to support SA's transition from fossil fuels, including accelerating the decommissioning of SA's ageing coal-fired power plants.Mantashe, who refused to attend the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, arguing that ""many people will be frightened"" or even ask why a ""coal fundamentalist"" was there, said any decision on coal phase-out must be systematic.""It must protect livelihoods. To me just transition is a term. Just transition is a transition from high-carbon emissions to low-carbon emissions. Others say it's a transition to renewables. But I say 'no, it's a transition from high-carbon emissions to low-carbon emissions'.""The president says I'm a coal fundamentalist, it's a title that I've earned,"" he said. ""This thing of saying destroy coal quickly is second to Nongqawuse ... a prophet who said we must kill all our cattle and we will be rich. We are still waiting for those riches.

Climate change will be high on the agenda, with divisions deep over the rapid emissions reductions scientists say are needed to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels.The meeting will  set the tone for COP26, which starts on October 31, the letter said. The signatories include Grenada, which like the Marshall Islands is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts such as storms and rising seas, along with Sweden, Latvia, Belgium, Estonia and Ireland.Climate envoys from Britain, the EU and US are making a last-minute diplomatic push to clinch more ambitious pledges in time for the summit. But consensus looks a long way off. Sources said on Wednesday that with days to go before the G20 meets, countries are still split over committing to phase out coal.Meanwhile, a group of like-minded developing countries this week released a statement slamming developed countries for expecting poorer nations to commit to tougher emissions targets when rich countries have broken their own promises to cut CO2.The group, which includes China, India and Saudi Arabia, also said richer nations had failed to deliver on promises of $100 billion (R14.5bn) a year by 2020 to help developing countries battle climate change.

And the transition to electro-mobility (e-mobility) will play an increasingly important role.Promoting higher electric vehicle (EV) adoption will have a direct benefit on the environment as these vehicles generate about 50% fewer greenhouse gas emissions over their life span compared to internal combustion engines, according to information from UC Berkeley School of Law's Center for Law, Energy and the Environment.To help reduce CO2 emissions from the use phase of vehicles, the BMW Group aims to at least halve CO2 emissions per vehicle and kilometre driven from 2019 by 2030.""The most powerful driver on this path to climate neutrality is e-mobility, with the BMW Group's Neue Klasse set to provide significant momentum to the market,"" says Deena Govender, Head of Corporate Communications and Governmental Affairs at BMW Group South Africa.However, climate-friendly mobility is not automatically created through more EVs on the road. Says Govender: ""It is crucial to reduce primary material use, and the related environmentally harmful exploitation of resources and their often CO2-intensive processing, especially in a resource-intensive industry such as car manufacturing.""The BMW Group has set firm and verifiable interim goals for 2030 throughout its value chain as production generates about 90% of the company's emissions. These targets include reducing CO2 emissions per vehicle produced, which has fallen more than 70% since 2006. The company now aims to reduce its emissions from 2019 by a further 80% by 2030.In addition to sourcing 100% green power as of this year, the BMW Group will drive further expansion of renewable energy sources at its worldwide locations, including green hydrogen at suitable sites.Other aspects of sustainability include energy-efficient installations and water management - it already reduced its water consumption by more than 30% since 2006.The company is also a member of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) and signed the Business Ambition for 1.5\'b0C pledge ahead of COP26.Another part of BMW's approach to sustainability entails significantly increasing the percentage of secondary materials in its vehicles.""On average, we manufacture current vehicles using almost 30% recycled and reusable materials. With the 'Secondary First' approach, we plan to successively raise this figure to 50%,"" says Govender. The BMW Group also showcased its i Vision Circular concept at the recent IAA, which demonstrated the consistent design of a car according to circular economy principles. ""The design goal is to create a vehicle that is optimised for closed material cycles and achieves a 100% recyclability rate, including the energy storage system.""Locally, BMW Group Plant Rosslyn outside Pretoria has partnered with Bio2Watt, an industrial-scale biogas waste-to-energy company based in Bronkhorstspruit.""This partnership, formed in 2015, is part of the company's strategy to achieve carbon-neutral production at the plant,"" says Govender.Deena Govender ... momentum.\l"

He said the loan deal was the outcome of discussions between the US, Germany, the UK, France and the EU which had agreed to assist South Africa with its move from coal to renewable energy.Appearing optimistic about the deal, De Ruyter said President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a presidential task team to engage in further discussion on the implementation of the agreement reached at COP26. De Ruyter was adamant that his entity would play a great role in the talks. The funds allocated will assist Eskom with the just energy transition. The loan will also allow us to introduce electric vehicles and the hydrogen economy in the country, Ruyter said. He refuted claims that Environmental Affairs Minister Barbara Creecy and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe were opposed to the loan deal. De Ruyter said Creecy and Mantashe were only opposed to a proposal by about 30 countries at the COP26 which wanted to force countries such as South Africa and others to stop coal projects. Minister Mantashe and Creecy did not align themselves with the move to stop coal projects. So their objections had nothing to do with the loan agreement, De Ruyter emphasised.Yesterday, the power utility also announced that it had served legal notices to some of the big municipalities and key industries which had allegedly contravened instructions to implement load shedding.

Coal is still king. The reliance on fossil fuels is still pretty much universal - especially if you look to the bloviating leaders of the world as shining examples of carbon neutrality. Did any of them actually resist the urge to fly private jet planes from the G20 summit in Rome to Glasgow? One of those private trips translates into 1.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person vs 0.25 tonnes had they chosen to fly commercial - just saying. And all the money coming SA's way to wean us off Eskom (because you know we're all very attached to this particular state utility) may end up financing a whole lot of unscheduled private flights in the name of saving the planet. But the hot air I am on about is of the more prosaic variety.Camilla Parker Bowles, or rather the Duchess of Cornwall, has apparently been dining out on the global warming-level emissions emerging from President Joe Biden's nether regions when he met her at the COP26 summit. The guy is of a certain age, so this sort of thing is probably par for the course. But the Daily Fail - or whatever that salacious rag is called - has quoted several very important but unnamed sources close to the duchess on the subject of the US president's flatulence. Apparently the president let out a very long, pronounced fart in her presence.I don't precisely know what the protocol for letting off some steam around a royal is. What is certain is that the king or queen has the droit d'odeurs. The bowel movements, all of them, of such a royal personage were a very serious matter for the courtiers of yore. They probably still are. People would compete, hard, to become the ""Groom of the Stool"". Duties included attending to the king in the privy chamber and tracking his excrement in extreme detail, also removing said excretment from the presence of the monarch and disposing of them in a diplomatic fashion. Naturally this coprophiliac position of intimacy and power led to the Groom of the Stool becoming rather closely acquainted with all the ""business"" of the state, and thereby morphing into the chief financial officer of the realm. Maybe that's what's really meant by No 2. At some point prudery seems to have prevailed and the Stool in the Groom's title was changed to Groom of the Stole. See what they did there?I'm not averse to a little toilet humour myself. I think it's important to stay in touch with our much younger selves. Which is why I think the duchess, who has spent a goodly part of her life laughing about the fact that the prince she's now married to was once desperate to lodge inside her in the form of a tampon, would naturally see the lighter side of the gaseous state of the leader of the free world.Camilla Parker Bowles, aka the Duchess of Cornwall.

We have realised that in those places where an effective vaccination campaign has taken place, the risk of severe repercussions of the disease has decreased, he said.  It is therefore important to continue the effort to immunise the general population as much as possible .Francis, who dedicated about a fifth of his six-page address to the pandemic, warned against ideological statements regarding vaccinations. Sadly, we are finding increasingly that we live in a world of strong ideological divides. Frequently people let themselves be influenced by the ideology of the moment, often bolstered by baseless information or poorly documented facts, he said. Vaccines are not a magical means of healing, yet surely they represent, in addition to other treatments that need to be developed, the most reasonable solution for the prevention of the disease, he told the diplomats in the Vatican\' s Hall of the Benedictions.By saying that  health care is a moral obligation in the context of a speech supporting vaccinations, Francis appeared to be responding to Christians, particularly in the US, who say they have a religion-based right of conscientious objection to vaccines.The pope, who is fully vaccinated, called for a global political commitment  to pursue the good of the general population through measures of prevention and immunisation .Francis renewed his appeal for the equitable distribution of vaccines to poor nations.He also reiterated his defence of migrants, saying each country should accept as many as possible and that responsibility for their integration should be shared.On climate change, he said the results of last year\' s COP26 summit in Glasgow were  rather weak in light of the gravity of the problem and hoped that action on global warming could be consolidated at COP27 in Egypt in November.He repeated calls for dialogue on conflict or crisis in Lebanon, Ukraine and Myanmar as well as his call for a ban on nuclear weapons.The Vatican, the world\' s smallest state, has diplomatic relations with 183 states. \l"

""A one-size-fits-all approach to complex issues such as a transition from fossil fuels that disregards the realities on the ground in Africa will simply not work, and is neither just nor equitable.

In his capacity as the outgoing co-ordinator of the AU's committee of African heads of state and government on climate change (CAHOSCC), Ramaphosa said the Covid-19 pandemic had set back multilateral processes, including those dealing with climate change. ""Africa is experiencing the worst impacts of phenomena associated with global warming such as droughts, floods and cyclones.""

""The complex Glasgow climate pact strives to strike the right balance by accommodating the differing national circumstances and capacities among the nearly 200 parties. The aim is that all are enabled and empowered to contribute their fair share as well as to enhance their climate ambition.""

These are her thoughts.This year s COP26-However, it s not all bad. There is so much to celebrate since Paris:- 40% of global financial assets have committed to financing $130tn of climate change solutions driven by Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.- $100tn in financial assets and 300 companies are aligned in terms of commitment to net zero emissions by 2050.- Central banks are implementing climate stress testing which will require lenders to report on a common set of climate risk metrics, including the volume of greenhouse gas emissions they finance.- We are seeing more mandatory requirements around the built environment and the way cities are designed.- There is increasing legislation around organisational reporting on sustainability and ESGs - environment, social and (corporate) governance. There is still a way to go though, so what now? How can we implement sustainability into our lives, as individuals and as organisations? The key is to realise that we don t need to make massive changes; just taking small steps can help contribute to decreasing our collective carbon footprint. We also don t need to choose between becoming sustainable and the financial costs of doing so.Retrofitting legacy buildingsOne of the solutions being looked at globally is retrofitting legacy buildings to improve their efficiency and emit less carbon. This is a critical step towards a net-zero carbon future as old buildings are responsible for a large portion of the world s energy consumption. By reusing the buildings that we already have and incorporating sustainable office fit outs, we can make them work harder and more cost-effectively. The Share Action group in London, a non-profit that aims to improve corporate behaviour, claims that for every existing building, 5% of stock will need to be retrofitted annually to ensure net zero operational and embodied carbon by 2050. This is no small feat, but it is possible, and investors are in a unique position to ensure this transition.Sustainability in the built environment, however, is about so much more than going green and addressing climate change. It encompasses employee wellbeing, social responsibility, and diverse hiring policies, and today s companies are putting more focus on incorporating these ESG principles into their company culture.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/640/222885.html :EMBED-->Solutions are multi-dimensionalGoing forward, we will hopefully see much more collaboration.

Already, buildings are morphing into vertical farms in cities across the globe, and we need more of this. I think human beings have an innate ability in dire moments to respond in innovative and effective ways. I love what David Attenborough said in his speech at COP26: Is this how our story is due to end a tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals?

So what have we learnt from two weeks of leaders statements, massive protests and side deals on coal, stopping fossil fuel finance and deforestation, plus the final signed Glasgow Climate Pact? From phasing out coal to carbon market loopholes, here is what you need to know: 1. Progress on cutting emissions, but nowhere near enoughThe Glasgow Climate Pact is incremental progress and not the breakthrough moment needed to curb the worst impacts of climate change. The UK government as host and therefore president of COP26 wanted to keep 1.5\'b0C alive, the stronger goal of the Paris Agreement. But at best we can say the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C is on life support it has a pulse but it s nearly dead. The Paris Agreement says temperatures should be limited to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and countries should pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C. Before COP26, the world was on track for 2.7\'b0C of warming, based on commitments by countries and expectation of the changes in technology. Announcements at COP26, including new pledges to cut emissions this decade, by some key countries, have reduced this to a best estimate of 2.4\'b0C. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/221733.htmlhttps://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/221733.html :EMBED-->More countries also announced long-term net zero goals. One of the most important was India s pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2070.

Fast-growing Nigeria also pledged net zero emissions by 2060.

Animportant factor to recognise is that this is a political declaration; it is not yet awe've promised, one of which is faster decommissioning of Eskom power stations.This is a contentious issue, and while the cabinet has signed Eskom's financingplan for its energy transition, it has not signed a faster pace of decommissioning, andthere are elements within the government that oppose this.Historically, SAhasn't dealt well with imposed conditionality on funding. Given the unemploymentcrisis, it's imperative that the entire green energy transition causes as few joblosses as possible. Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter succinctly encapsulated what ourapproach should be when he told the Joburg Indaba in October: ""We should plan carefully.We are tinkering with the aorta of the SA economy. So let's do this carefully.Let's do it deliberately. But let's do it.""Eskom is alreadyimplementing its plans to switch to green energy and save jobs. When the internationalclimate envoys visited last month, the power utility was able to display its plans toconvert the Komati coal power station to renewable energy. That is part of a widerstrategy to repurpose other coal-fired stations as well as reskill workers intorenewables and other industries.An integral part of saving jobs is to ensure thefunding secured at COP26 is directed towards the intended areas so we achieve the goalsset out in the agreement. Those goals include addressing the social imperatives of thetransition. The $8.5bn climate funding facility agreed to by the leaders of the US, UK,France and Germany is scheduled to kick in from mid-2022 and run for three to five years.Most of it is earmarked for Eskom and the remainder for the hydrogen economy andtransport's green transition.There are lots of woolly areas that still haveto be ironed out. To prevent any issues from becoming overly contentious and potentiallydecision-making will be important - labour, business and civil societyrepresentatives should sit around a table with the government to decide on the mostappropriate funding allocations.The political declaration also provides for a taskforce to develop a programme of work over the next 12 months. Again, this should bemust bear in mind that while there is some grant funding, most of the package has to berepaid, so it is still debt, albeit at the soft rates that come with concessional funding.For Eskom, that will be new debt - and it will have to continue servicing itsexisting R400bn debt pile.The funding package is worth $8.5bn and it is a soberingthought that De Ruyter puts Eskom's requirement for the transition at $35bn to$50bn, so further funding will be required. The situation we must work towards is longer-term, sustainable market financing for the transition, and to get to that point, Eskommust improve its credit quality by further reducing its debt.It has been gainingground on this front, with the debt coming down from R496bn to R401bn in the past twodebt has been reduced since 2005, when it was around R30bn.The challenges ahead maybe daunting, but we've made an excellent start. Let's salute the SA climateteam for a great achievement - including the oft-disparaged Eskom, which is showingrefreshing signs of innovation for a state entity.The team went to COP26 wellprepared, with a clear plan, including set targets to get us to net-zero emissions by2050. It didn't take long to be noticed, and the deal was secured on the second dayof the event. That has put SA at the forefront of international climate funding deals. We need that team to follow through by ensuring we implement all the measures neededfor us to deliver on our promises, effectively. The cost of failure will be severe- it's one we cannot afford.Mavuso is CEO of Business Leadership SA.\l"

Oil majors will be among the big companies conspicuous by their absence at the Cop26 meeting that begins in Glasgow, Scotland, today to attempt to agree on ways to limit the planet\' s warming to 1.5\'baC above pre-industrial levels. Cop26. European oil majors have set much more ambitious emissions-cutting targets than their US rivals, but they also have to fend off accusations that, over decades, they hid the role that their products played in heating the planet. They have long supported carbon pricing as a business-friendly way to engineer a transition to a cleaner economy, but agreement on the role of carbon markets has proved a major sticking point at climate talks.  Our positions are well known, we are in favour of carbon pricing. Shell\' s Van Beurden in a LinkedIn post on Friday, echoing previous comments by BP chief executive Bernard Looney, said oil companies alone could not control demand for fossil fuels.  Let\' s say Shell switched the products we sell overnight. Instead of petrol and diesel, motorists at our service stations could only get hydrogen, or recharge their electric cars. It wouldn\' t make people buy a hydrogen or battery electric car. They would simply drive down the road and fill up at one of our competitors, Van Beurden said.  So governments will have to play an essential role in helping to shape demand, using mandates where needed, creating the right climate for investment, and helping steer society towards low-carbon and renewable energy. The summit, taking place in the Scottish industrial city of Glasgow, is scheduled to run until November 12 and will bring together world leaders from governments, business and civil society. The summit hopes to set out new and ambitious targets under the three pillars of the Paris Agreement: mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to the impact of global warming, and financial commitment to support those most vulnerable to climate change.\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa181","Forestry: The surprise weapon in the fight against climate change","March 18, 2022 Friday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","It's fair to say that most people when thinking about the resources we have to fight climate change don't immediately think of forestry. But there is a climate case for wood - it is the only material that can naturally and significantly decarbonise our planet by driving down demand for illegally harvested wood and provide functional alternatives to non-renewable materials that have significantly higher environmental footprints.-Industrial forestry isn t the destructive force it once was. Instead, it is a sustainable forest bioeconomy, harvesting renewable products that can be recycled. And, once those products have reached end use, the carbon can be a source for bio-energy.Forestry achieves this both through the growing of trees, which sequesters carbon, but also by harvesting them at the right time, with carbon being stored in harvested wood products. Wood can also be a substitute for carbon-intensive materials such as steel and concrete in construction, and plastic and textiles in a variety of applications. But it is also present in everyday life in the form of paper products, packaging and cellulose in our detergents and pharmaceuticals, and long-life wood products (e.g., textiles produced from wood fibre and timber in buildings).<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/226078.html :EMBED-->Forests and climate changeAs discussed at a panel during a Cop26 side event last year, part of the problem is that forests are usually discussed in the realm of land-use change and forestry, and the economy is discussed separately - when in fact, they are inextricably linked. In addition, discussions around the circular economy don t consider carbon recycling and the displacement of fossils.According to The Forest Carbon Debit Illusion report, there is a greater net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when forests or plantations are actively managed through the cyclical and sustainable planting, growing and harvesting of trees.In essence, the missing piece of the puzzle is that active forestry produces two major climate benefits when combined with efficient value chains. First, there is stable and increasing carbon storage both in the forest itself, and in the products of forestry. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation s (FAO) Forest Resource Assessment 2015, forests in the world were sequestering close to 300 Gigatonnes of carbon.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/225635.html :EMBED-->Younger trees take up more carbon dioxide than their older counterparts. And second, all wood-based products soluble, fibre and bio-energy products such as nanocellulose, paper packaging, timber for construction and wood-derived chemicals can displace fossil-based alternatives in a variety of sectors.Of course, deforestation must be reduced in the context of indigenous or tropical forests. At the same time, many vilify the forestry sector without understanding its circularity, its ability to store carbon and crucially, how it helps to cut back on fossils.Innovation in the forestry spaceClimate change is not caused by people in developing countries felling trees. Instead, it s caused by high- and middle-income countries burning fossils. We need to focus on the contribution of forestry to displace these fossil emissions.We will do this by growing a circular bio-economy - by substituting common materials that are fossil-based or non-renewable, with alternatives that come from wood. There are three areas of innovation for the forest sector in this space. First, we should aim to increase uptake of wood products in traditional markets such as construction and packaging, most typically paper. Second, we need to find more new applications for wood fibre, to really go into niche markets, such as the use of lignin for batteries for electronics. Finally, we need to maximise the circularity aspect of the circular bioeconomy, which is also an area where innovation is needed to increase recycling, cascading use of wood, re-use, etc..<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/474/221715.html :EMBED-->Globally, our sector has access to a wide range of data and information. Not only in terms of trade and production statistics, but also that there is a variability across tree species and regions. We also know that how wood products such as paper are disposed of makes a difference. Paper recycling and wood reuse is key to ensuring that carbon remains locked up. And we know that wood-based products are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions over their entire lifecycle compared to similar products made from emissions-intensive materials.South African ecosystems are not tree dominated. We only have half a million hectares of indigenous forests, which are fragmented and occur along the south and eastern coastal inland mountains, and importantly, they are protected. It s also important to understand that different regions will have different forestry practices.How forestry can help curb climate changeWe plant fast-growing exotic tree species to produce timber, and currently have 1.2 million hectares of these industrial plantations. It must also be noted, however, that 25% of forestry owned land is not planted to trees, but home to wetlands, grasslands, indigenous forests and area of high conservation value.It s unlikely that the world s natural forests will be able to meet global wood demand. On the other hand, industrial plantations, if established on degraded land, can improve the land, sequester carbon, and facilitate the circular economy by providing materials that can replace fossil-based chemistry.Furthermore, we can adapt more easily to climate change because of shorter harvesting cycles, which will allow us to replant with different genotypes, and we can demonstrate in South Africa that having commercial plantations has prevented the increased use, destruction, and degradation of natural forests.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/474/214677.html :EMBED-->This speaks to the heart of the way South African forests are managed sustainably and responsibly, treating the renewable resource of wood and the resources that trees share with consideration. It speaks to the fact that the sector doesn t harvest swathes of trees, leaving the land desolate for years. Forestry companies have nurseries growing more trees that will take the place of those gone before, most often at a ratio of 2:1. Even harvesting residues are left behind to enhance soil fertility and protection.Finally, harvesting wood makes the circular bio-economy possible. If we don t have sustainably grown and sourced wood, we can t replace fossil-based products and do all of the things that climate adaptation demands.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

If we get green funding, I support it. But we should not collapse our economy because they are greedy for green funding. I don't believe in that; I think it is a dangerous step to take.""Mantashe's comments come a week after several ministers met climate envoys from abroad to explore plans to fund SA's transition away from fossil fuels, including accelerating the decommissioning of SA's ageing coal-fired power plants.Also speaking at the indaba, Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter said one need only look at the recent cabinet decision to adjust SA's nationally determined contribution - its climate action plan - and to lower its target carbon emissions to align with global goals to limit temperature increases to 1.5\'b0C by the end of the century.The tripartite alliance has also issued a statement that supports green financing, he noted.This echoed recent comments by Vicky Ford, the UK's Africa minister, who, when asked about mixed messages coming out of the SA government about the transition away from fossil fuels, told Business Day the most important thing was that President Cyril Ramaphosa and the cabinet had endorsed a nationally determined contribution that was more ambitious than what had previously been on the table.De Ruyter, however, said he agreed with Mantashe that ""we shouldn't rush into this thing in an unstructured way.""We should plan carefully. We are tinkering with the aorta of the SA economy. So let's do this carefully. Let's do it deliberately. But let's do it.""Last month, at Eskom's annual results presentation, De Ruyter denied there was an impasse over Eskom's accelerated decommission proposal, saying ""maybe the controversy is a bit manufactured by certain members of the media.""Obviously, there will be debates and engagement. Sometimes the debate will be robust, but it will always be healthy. And we will abide by government policy"" as it is made by the department of mineral resources & energy.Mantashe, who maintains support for coal as a prominent part of SA's energy mix, was notably not part of last week's engagements with the climate envoys. The SA delegation was led by the minister of the environment, forestry & fisheries, Barbara Creecy, and included the ministers of trade, industry & competition and of public enterprises, as well as the deputy minister of finance and of the department of international relations & co-operation.After the meeting, Creecy said SA required substantial concessional and grant funding and technical assistance to implement a just energy transition. As such, SA is proposing the establishment of a just transition financing facility. ""This represents a win-win for SA and its international partners, enabling ambitious climate action in SA, addressing social impacts comprehensively while meeting developed-country commitments to finance the transition.""The intensifying rhetoric around a green deal comes ahead of COP26 in Scotland next month, which Mantashe does not plan to attend.""If I go to COP26 I think many people will be frightened - 'what is this coal fundamentalist doing in COP26?' I'm not pressured not to go, but we will keep our delegation to size and the team that go there, I have confidence in them; they will negotiate a deal that will be helpful for the SA economy.""On Thursday, De Ruyter said SA's transition away from fossil fuel will be challenging and exciting. ""And it will offer significant opportunities for investors to come and put the money where their mouth is and also earn a fair and reasonable return from investments in the electricity industry,"" he said.Joanne Yawitch, CEO of the National Business Initiative and member of the presidential climate commission, said Eskom's just energy transaction would enable SA to exploit an immediate ""window of opportunity"" to access green financing.steynl@businesslive.co.zaGwede Mantashe.

The AU must demonstrate strong leadership and present a united front for such collaboration to work, so that the establishment of the proposed Combined Exclusive Maritime Zone for Africa (CEMZA) can achieve impactful results and not be just a paper tiger.African voices and indigenous expertise in producing scientific knowledge and policies have been marginalized since colonial times including vis-\'e0-vis marine fisheries.Africa continues to be at a disadvantage on account of the historical processes through which individual countries were integrated into the world's economic and financial system - often driven by former colonizing powers - e.g., France, U.K.Therefore, the needs and concerns of local African fishing communities were historically unseen and unheard in national and international deliberations over fisheries. The ""new"" scramble for African resources, brought a new player to the fore, namely the People's Republic of China - triggering rapid expansion of Chinese investments, trade, development cooperation and loans aimed at exploiting Africa's resources.Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing predominantly by Chinese, and European trawlers, endanger marine ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, and thus the survival of local African fishing communities. IUU fishing affects those countries that cannot effectively monitor and control their maritime waters and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs).An increasing number of organizations are exploring AI, data analytics, and blockchain to combat the threat of IUU fishing - as noted by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (2020) in ""How Data and Technology Can Help Address Corruption in IUU fishing"" - HYPERLINK https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/tnrc-blog-how-data-and-technology-can-help-address-corruption-in-iuu-fishinghttps://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/tnrc-blog-how-data-and-technology-can-help-address-corruption-in-iuu-fishing.The arrangements in place are often abused and thus fall short in fighting the impediment of IUU fishing. It is to tackle these significant problems at the operational level that Africa's Integrated Maritime Strategy proposes to establish the Combined Exclusive Maritime Zone for Africa (CEMZA) - as noted by Vishal Surbun (February 2021) in ""Africa's combined exclusive maritime zone concept"" in Institute for Security Studies, Africa Report 32 - HYPERLINK https://issafrica.org/research/africa-report/africas-combined-exclusive-maritime-zone-concepthttps://issafrica.org/research/africa-report/africas-combined-exclusive-maritime-zone-concept.CEMZA is a future project that remains on paper only for the time being, which needs to be implemented in full to facilitate economic and security benefits for target African countries.A consequence of the inability of individual African states to maintain law and order, to varying degrees, opened the door to the possibility of some level of continental federalization in the form of CEMZA or combining other zones falling within the African Maritime Domain (AMD).West Africa presents coastal countries where the problems are particularly felt. The area has attracted industrial fishing boats from all over the world, particularly from China, while controls have remained entirely inadequate in the last decade.A series of non-transparent practices often make governmental checks and control difficult. Frequent changes of the shipowner, flag country, registration, low maintenance of databases, and navigation records represent a significant challenge for state authorities and non-governmental organizations (e.g., Sea Shepherd Global, Environmental Justice Foundation) concerned with fishing rights in Africa.There are irregularities in the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and the non-use or improper use of the satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS). On July 22, 2021, the Defense Innovation Unit and Global Fishing Watch, a non-profit that uses satellites to view global fishing activities, announced a new AI challenge to combat IUU fishing to tackle this transnational crime.Likewise, an international program to track illegal fishing from space has been launched by the Canadian government - as noted by Rosie Frost (January 2021) in ""What are illegal 'dark vessels' and why are satellites spying on them?"" in Euronews - HYPERLINK https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/02/25/what-are-illegal-dark-vessels-and-why-are-satellites-spying-on-themhttps://www.euronews.com/green/2021/02/25/what-are-illegal-dark-vessels-and-why-are-satellites-spying-on-them. It can use environmental conditions, including the temperature of the water and chlorophyll levels, to work out where the fish will be.With the fish comes the fishermen and fisherwomen who help narrow down the areas that governmental authorities need to fully concentrate on, thereby helping them locate, identify and interdict illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.Such information must be shared with the central body of the combined EEZ not only to gather pieces of evidence but also to assist local fishing communities in earning their livelihood. The current focus on environmental concerns worldwide has drawn attention to the global crisis in fisheries and aquaculture, and the need to manage these industries in environmentally sustainable ways.Indigenous communities have become vital partners to international climate, environmental and development missions seeking global sustainability. In many West African countries, fishing continues to be carried out through artisanal means often by poor fisherwomen.An example is the wooden pirogues mainly in use in West Africa from Mauritania to Senegal, on which a crew composed of less than ten people usually embark and stays at sea for a few days.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro pulls the plug.From shutting down speed trap radars on the country\' s deadly highways to hiding data on a surging pandemic death toll, no problem is too big for the Americas\' denialist in chief to try to bury.Perhaps nothing speaks more to this wilful myopia than the Bolsonaro administration\' s handling of environmental emergencies. In three years, his government has gutted spending on science and technology, left Amazon research in penury and pauperised the Environment Ministry.Yet Bolsonaro\' s favourite target has been the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which is tasked with tracking deforestation. In 2019, he summarily fired the institute\' s director after he reported a surge in Amazon clear-cutting. Now the landmark Cerrado monitor- ing programme is under assault.The move further threatens the country\' s vast savanna, even as Big Agriculture carpets the frontier with export crops and cattle. Another 8 546km\'b2 or so, an area roughly the size of Puerto Rico, was razed in the year ending in July last year. If INPE fails to secure alternative financing, the Cerrado money runs out in April.With the Amazon in flames, the fate of the savanna might seem a lesser emergency. Scientists know better. Calls to extend the Amazon  zero deforestation mandate to the Cerrado, a global bread basket that doubles as Brazil\' s economic engine, may be misguided. Yet sustainable agriculture is essential. This means curbing cutting, burning and land grabbing to prevent the frontier bounty from falling into ruin. No institution looks closer than Latin America\' s marquee space institute, which works year round to render a faithful, nearly real-time picture of habitats under siege.For five decades, INPE has tracked the changing Brazilian countryside, keeping close watch over the Amazon and the Cerrado. What began as a low-tech survey, with teams of analysts poring over hard copies of pictures snapped from the skies, has evolved into expert-driven analysis of high-resolution images captured by orbiting satellites such as Amazonia 1.INPE has kept an annual inventory of deforestation (Prodes) since 1998 and, since 2004, has deployed an emergency alert system (Deter) that detects fires and felling nearly as they unfold.The sharper visualisation gives Brazilian authorities a powerful tool to intervene and dispatch inspectors to the field to stop environmental outlaws in the act. The result: Brazil reduced Amazon felling by 83% between 2004 and 2012, even as the economy surged. The institute\' s platforms have also become part of the tool kit of Brazilian soft power, helping other tropical nations ramp up their habitat surveillance systems. INPE data has been cited in some 1 200 indexed scientific journals and scores of dissertations.What escapes no one is that the defunding of INPE comes amid an international outcry over spiking deforestation, which the government has proved helpless to contain, when it hasn\' t actively encouraged it. Deforestation has increased dramatically since 2018.You wouldn\' t know that by the bromides from government officials. In his international debut, Bolsonaro\' s new environment minister \- whose predecessor quit under a cloud \- touted Brazil\' s green commitments at COP26 in Glasgow, while failing to mention the latest data showing a surge in Amazon deforestation.Brazil\' s legacy military leaders, to whom Bolsonaro swears fealty, might be scandalised. The generalissimos (1964-1985) weren\' t out to save Amazonia. Rather, they meant to keep it from foreign clutches and harness science to remake Latin America\' s biggest underachiever into a wheelhouse of technological innovation.They stacked leading research centres with foreign-trained PhDs, engineers and computer geeks, hoping to transform INPE into a developing world Nasa. The space aces went on to turn their country into the benchmark for environmental monitoring in the tropics. Bolsonaro risks being remembered as the leader who looked the other way.Margolis is a former Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Latin and South America.

The survey captured the experiences and perceptions of climate change of just over 1,000 South Africans. SA citizens optimistic climate crisis will be avertedOptimistic South Africans believe that science and technology can solve the climate change problem (27.9%), that the country can move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources (28.4%) and that people are more aware of climate dangers than they were historically (27.4%).Those who are pessimistic (17.4%) and believe we won t avoid a climate disaster in their lifetime cite a lack of awareness of the dangers of climate change (34.3%), a lack of government action (27.4%) and a slow switch to renewable sources of energy such as wind turbines (24%) as reasons for their pessimism.Respondents were asked what they believe the top three effects of climate change to be. Most identified higher temperatures (81.2%), more wildfires and more extreme weather (both 79%).<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/223539.html :EMBED-->The goal of Epson s barometer is to raise greater public awareness of the impacts of climate change, to influence transformative business decisions and to better inform policy makers. It was timed to help frame discussions at held in the UK in November 2021.It also coincides with South Africa s cabinet having recently passed the Climate Change Bill, soon to be tabled in parliament. According to the Department of Environment, Forests and Fisheries, the bill gives effect to South Africa s international commitments and obligations in relation to climate change and defines the steps to be taken to protect and preserve the planet for the benefit of present and future generations. The barometer s findings highlight the significant difference between people s perceptions and the reality of the climate emergency we re facing in South Africa, which reports say have increased the frequency of extreme temperature events in Southern Africa, with temperatures spiking twice as fast as the global average, says Timothy Thomas, country manager, Epson South Africa.South Africans accepting responsibility to mitigate climate change When asked who should be primarily responsible for tackling the climate emergency, encouragingly, 18% of respondents see that they are personally the most responsible , while almost a third believe that we are collectively responsible.There is early evidence to suggest that South Africans are accepting personal and collective responsibility to mitigate the effects of climate change, with the top three actions including reducing plastic use (63.3%), improving recycling habits (62.1%), and walking or cycling more often (60.3%).<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/222562.html :EMBED-->Many however believe the responsibility lies elsewhere, with nearly a third saying that governments should be most responsible for tackling the climate emergency, while 17.5% say big and small business should. The Epson Climate Reality Barometer and its discovery of a climate reality deficit shows that awareness, coupled with action, will be critical to tackling the climate emergency we re facing. We believe that we can all build a better future if we work together to make smarter decisions to reduce our individual and collective impacts on the environment, Thomas says.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa187","COP26 - Funding Innovation Crucial for Strengthening Climate-Stressed Food Systems [opinion]","October 25, 2021","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The global food system is facing more demands from society than ever before in modern times - and rightly so.From responding to the climate crisis to dealing with rising malnutrition and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and protection of biodiversity, the responsibility of our food systems is no longer just to ""feed the world.""The recent action agenda released by the UN Secretary General at the Food Systems Summit not only highlighted this urgency but reminded us that our food systems are also one of our greatest hopes for making progress on these fronts.While the US$10 billion pledged by the United States to end hunger and malnutrition is a welcome start, our food systems have been forced to cope with an increasingly complex, interconnected set of challenges for too long - often without a corresponding shift in focus from governments and other key players.The changes required also need sufficient funding for food systems transformation, estimated to be in the range of $400 billion per year. This goal is within reach and is roughly comparable to three times New York City's annual budget or less than 0.5 percent of world GDP in 2020.Food systems transformation also requires impactful innovations, so particular importance in this funding should therefore be placed on investment in research and innovation.Increased and sustained funding for research and innovation is crucial, as the world requires technological, policy and institutional innovation to address the increasingly complex set of challenges that are facing, and threatening, food, land and water systems in a climate crisis.Investments in agricultural research and innovation generate significant returns. Benefit-cost ratios of CGIAR research, for example, have shown consistent returns on investments to the order of 10:1.Despite this, international agricultural research remains underfunded, threatening food, economic, and environmental security around the world, whilst hunger and poverty continue to rise.In addition to securing funding for research and innovation, research itself must evolve to address the growing challenges around the world. In particular, research efforts should favour more circular business models that are driven by value, rather than volume, and those that promote resilience to shocks and balance with nature over more environmentally damaging models.We must also ensure that more research translates into concrete innovations that truly advance food systems transformation. While we desperately need technological innovations to increase productivity, reduce poverty, hunger and malnutrition, as well as climate proofing our food systems and making them more equitable, such innovations can only be taken forward if they are bundled with appropriate national policies, institutional changes and global actions, and strategies to deal with shocks and conflict.Sometimes the implementation of innovations inevitably involves trade-offs, not only synergies. Research and innovation efforts will be crucial to understanding and managing such trade-offs, as well as to help ensure that interconnected challenges are tackled in the most efficient and holistic way.To both achieve and maximize the potential of research and innovation, governments of the world should consider allocating just one per cent of the portion of their national GDP that relates to food systems, towards research and innovation.At present, many countries, including many of the world's richest, only spend half of this. For the least developed countries, aid will be needed to reach such a level, potentially through a special trust fund backed by the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).Such a fund, when properly backed by developed countries, would help to support greater scientific capacity on the ground in low- and middle-income countries, which will be needed if we are to address the challenges facing the whole world, not just the developed world.Today's agri-food systems no longer simply feed people. They must also provide nutrition, promote livelihoods, protect the environment, and tackle climate change - often all at once. Financing and unlocking innovations are needed to address these challenges together.If our food, land and water systems are ever able to achieve society's mounting demands, we must ensure our priorities are in order and begin to properly finance them.Ultimately, all of the ambition generated around the UN Food Systems Summit will fall short if we fail to finance the new research and innovation we know we need.Claudia Sadoff is Executive Management Team Convener, and Managing Director, Research Delivery and Impact, CGIAR; Joachim von Braun is Chair of the Scientific Group, UN Food Systems SummitFollow @IPSNewsUNBureau\l"

If we can succeed in that, we will ensure a major victory for the country, Mantashe said. Coupled with the re-prioritisation of state agency PetroSA, the country would have a bigger supply. The reality is that the only countries that currently provide electricity at a lower cost are the oil-producing countries such as Nigeria and Angola. If we produce our own, we have a better chance of lowering energy prices, said Mantashe.Mantashe urged the African continent to invest in sustainable solutions as it faced  energy poverty .He said energy consumption in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, was below 30GW, the equivalent of Argentina\' s consumption.A member of Parliament in Sierra Leone, Dr Kandeh Yumkella, said Africa was faced with an opportunity to be a leading producer of batteries for renewable energy storage. Africa sits on 50% of the world\' s cobalt, significant quantities of lithium, manganese and other minerals required to create batteries. We can drive the green energy revolution. We can be the leading producers of batteries in Congo, Zambia, and green hydrogen production. Southern Africa sits on over 75% of platinum metals needed for fuel cells for storing the hydrogen power. Africa has the best solar radiation opportunities in the world \- we can be the leaders in hydrogen energy, Yumkella said.Former Eskom chief executive Thulani Gcabashe agreed. We have an abundance of minerals needed for renewable energy resources, particularly for solar and wind energy. The world is looking for these. We have an opportunity to start planning and investing in the new technologies. Capital markets are favourable to developing these systems, and it\' s for us to create that safe environment. The demand is there, said Gcabashe. The capital cost of installing these systems has dropped drastically over the past 10 years. We need to focus on setting out policies that support independent power producers, co-operatives or community based renewable power producers, he said.Mantashe said there was an opportunity for a  massive expansion of gas trade, especially from the Gulf of Guinea and the broader West Coast of Africa.Yumkella said the continent needed private sector investment in infrastructure, and a good regulatory framework, to support or drive the renewable energy sector.Mantashe cautioned that the transition from coal should  aid development and address historical inequalities.  The so-called accelerated transition intent on replacing one system with another in a flash is both irrational and dangerous, Mantashe added.A total of $8.5 billion was pledged to South Africa at COP26 to help the country transition from coal to renewable energy. A presidential task team had been set up to oversee how the money would be utilised.Eskom chief executive Andre de Ruyter is hoping that the bulk of the funds will be allocated to the power utility to help it expand the energy grid and build new generation capacity.De Ruyter said there was a need to accelerate grid access connection and make huge investments into infrastructure. To ensure security of supply we need 30GW of new generation capacity, (70% of which will be renewables) by 2030, he said. Significant transmission infrastructure upgrades are required in the short and medium term at a cost of R180bn between now and 2031. And that means we have to build about 2 598km of new l"

Philipp W& xF6;rz, fund manager at PSG Asset Management, said the MSCI (formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International) Index, measuring a broad cross-section of global markets, has seen investment in the energy sector plummet from 6%, only three years ago, to 3.1% currently. ""Investors have been punishing energy companies, depressing their valuations, even as many of them are re-evaluating their business models and making an effort to transition to cleaner energy."" He said that though agreements to limit global warming were made at COP26, the 26th UN climate change conference in Glasgow last year, crucial commitments to exit coal were watered down. This has increased pressure on the goal of achieving carbon neutrality, or ""net zero"" emissions, to restrict temperatures rising to 1.5& x2DA;C by 2100. ""The answer to climate change at its heart seems simple: stop using fossil fuels and switch to renewables, problem solved. Wholesale disinvestment from the carbon economy makes sense. ""But such simplifications belie the enormity of the task ahead of us. Simply put, we are not in a position to give up fossil fuels yet, and won't be in a position to do so for some years to come. ""As recently as 2020, fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) made up about 83% of the energy mix, with low emission sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and nuclear contributing roughly 13% and 4% respectively."" For example, he said, during last year's energy crunch, the UK was forced to generate more power from coal, despite its intentions to the contrary. ""Part of the strategy to achieve CO2 reductions involves switching to less dirty fossil fuel options, typically by substituting gas for coal, at least in the shorter term, rather than moving away from fossil fuels immediately."" He said fossil fuels were part of everyday life. Oil is used to make goods as diverse as plastic, asphalt, fertiliser and chemicals, as well as contact lenses, shoes, soap, lipstick and smartphones. ""We not only have to replace the obvious uses of oil in fuelling cars and planes, we also have to find substitutes for these less obvious uses. ""Even if electric vehicles were 35% of global car sales by 2030, global oil demand would still grow from current levels. ""This makes the coming energy transition not only a very complex one, but also one that needs to happen very swiftly. ""In the developing world, the challenge will be to meet increasing energy demand sustainably, while also cutting back on the use of fossil fuels."" He said many African countries depend on developing gas and oil reserves to fund economic development. ""Decarbonising the global economy could further jeopardise energy equality. ""It is concerns like these that have led to words like 'just transition' being added to our climate change lexicon."" In the interim, resources required for global energy security and economic development must be extracted as cleanly and sustainably as possible.

The coal from Grootgeluk, SA's largest coal mine and the world's third-largest, is carried by conveyor belts to the power stations, which together supply a big chunk of SA's electricity. Exxaro partnered the government to take a party of journalists up to the mine last week, ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa's fourth annual investment conference on Thursday.It's a strangely appropriate spot to stage a curtain-raiser for the investment conference, touching as it does on so many of the issues around it. Companies pledged about R744bn of investment since Ramaphosa embarked on his drive to raise $100m, or R1.2-trillion over five years, not long after he took office as president early in 2018. About R314bn (40.6%) of that has been spent.Mining accounted for R150bn of the pledges, and these clearly are turning into projects. Exxaro pledged R20bn and has spent R17bn to expand and modernise its operations, with more than half of that at Grootgeluk. Anglo American, which is a sponsor of the investment conference, as is Exxaro, pledged R100bn. Of that more than 80% has been spent on projects, including expanding its iron ore and diamond mining operations.Arguably, those investments would have happened with or without Ramaphosa's showpieces. That touches on the big questions of whether these conferences serve any purpose - and whether they are moving the dial at all on growth.That's an inevitable question, given that investment spending was hardly growing even before the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the president's efforts, and though it picked up in 2021 is still well down on prepandemic levels, with the ratio of fixed investment to GDP at less than half the National Development Plan's 30% ambition.Exxaro's executives argue that the first 2018 conference did help get them over the l"

While the final numbers are not yetout, analysts predict SA might raise its exports from R160bn in 2020 to R173bn in 2021.As the only sector other than government services to grow in 2020 (at a whoppingrate of 13.4% for the year, to boot) and employing considerably more than double themining sector's total workforce, agriculture's importance cannot beunderstated.But before we start patting ourselves on the back with too much vigour,serious consideration must be given to some ominous clouds on the horizon. Over the pastmonth, the Trade & Industrial Policy Strategies (Tips) research group has released tworeports unpacking the increasingly foreboding trade effects of the European Green Deal (EGD).This wide-reaching framework of policy initiatives aims to transition theEuropean economy into a state more sustainable, and is set to herald a new era ofenvironmental regulations at a global level. The EGD will have significant implicationsfor the R270bn worth of goods SA exports to the EU for starters, but foreshadows thedevelopment of similar initiatives in other SA export destinations, including the US and Japan, on the back of the new emission reduction commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow inNovember 2021.While there are several key sectors that are set to be affected,including mining, manufacturing, metals, transport equipment and chemicals,agriculture's critical role in both our export and domestic economy requires thatit receive special attention.According to Tips, SA's agricultural exportsare extreme outliers at the global level in carbon intensity. At more than 1,100 tonnes ofcarbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per $1m of exports, SA is almost twice as carbonintensive as the second country, Poland, which posts a mere 650 tCO2e per $1m. Most countries have an intensity of between 100 and 500 tCO2e per $1m.As a result of theEGD, the EU has grown mightily concerned about less stringent environmental and climatepolicies in non-EU countries that result in ""carbon leakage"" that can shift emissions outside Europe to places such as SA. To counteract this, the EU has developed the carbonborder adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which places a tax on emissions from imports relativeto the carbon emitted during the production of imports from non-EU countries.Themechanism will be introduced in a transitional phase in January 2023 until the end of2025, with a focus on direct emissions from the electricity, cement, fertiliser, steel andaluminium sectors. But the commission is also proposing to aim for an ""EU-level objectiveto reach climate neutrality in the combined land use, forestry and agriculture sector by2035, including non-carbon dioxide agricultural emissions, such as those from fertiliser use and livestock"" under its Farm-to-Fork Strategy.The Farm-to-Fork programme isexplicit in its intent to ""support the global transition to sustainable agri-food systemsthrough its trade policies and international co-operation instruments"" by focusing onenvironmental impacts, climate change and biodiversity.Yet in SA we have donelittle to prepare for this rapidly approaching market crunch. The carbon intensity of thesector is just horrific. We have no national organic production policy in place, andfarmer subsidy programmes such as the Massive Food Production Programme rely on the distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and synthetic fertilisers andpesticides, due to the limitations in place under section 36 of the Agricultural ProductsStandards Act, which was promulgated way back in 1947.As a country, we have alreadysector to its knees.

That equals about a third of the generating capacity of Africa\' s most industrialised country. South Africa relies on Eskom for more than 90 percent of its electricity, which derives chiefly from 15 ageing coal-fired power stations, for which it has enjoyed waivers on emissions limits for soot, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. The heavily-indebted provider says it cannot afford the technology required to meet them.  If implemented, the decision will result in an immediate shutting down of 16 000MW of installed coal fired capacity, Eskom said, adding that it would cost more than R300 billion to adhere to it.Pollution in the coal belt is among the worst in the world, rivalling Beijing and Mumbai, and researchers estimate the smog kills thousands of people a year, with one putting the cost at $2.37bn (R37.51bn) a year. Eskom said the Department of Environment allowed it to postpone meeting emissions standards at seven power stations, with five requests rejected and four only partially granted.Neither Eskom nor the department responded to requests for more details. The utility is working on a plan with donors, agreed at the COP26 climate talks in November, to shut down its coal-fired power stations and replace them with renewables.It said it should seek to clean the air that way, not by expensively retrofitting old plants with pollution filters.Eskom is due to close half of its 46 000MW of nominal capacity by 2035, replacing some of that with gas and renewables and allowing independent producers to make up the shortfall. | Reuters\l"

The health of our planet and our very survival are at stake. How can we ensure that this meeting achieves real action that improves people's lives in rich and poor countries alike?\~More than empty political rhetoric, what we need is a new social contract between decision-makers and people, one that achieves genuine mass support for climate action and connects people with their planet. Leaders need to ensure that their climate action plans will tackle inequality, poverty, injustice, and promote the implementation of human rights above all.\~After all, climate change threatens the enjoyment of a range of human rights, including food, health, housing, culture and development.\~ And there is one human right in particular that is at risk from climate change and could have a domino effect on all the others: HYPERLINK https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/human-rights/the human right to clean drinking water. This is the most basic of all human rights (together with sanitation), and a key one in the fight against climate change.Ninety percent of climate change is happening through weather-related events, which have a profound impact on the hydrological cycle - often resulting in too much water or too little water. \~All this in a world where HYPERLINK https://www.who.int/news/item/01-07-2021-billions-of-people-will-lack-access-to-safe-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-in-2030-unless-progress-quadruples-warn-who-uniceftwo-billion people, or one inThe most outrageous injustice is that the same people who lack access to water and sanitation are usually the ones most vulnerable to the effects of climate change - and the least responsible for causing it in the first place. HYPERLINK https://www.unicef.org/media/49621/file/UNICEF_Thirsting_for_a_Future_ENG.pdfOne report estimates HYPERLINK 1% of the billions pledgedIn the end, those left furthest behind end up bearing the brunt of increasing water scarcity and poverty. These marginalised populations - women, children, and those living in extreme poverty - face a vicious and unjust cycle, in which a lack of access to water and sanitation is aggravated by extreme weather events, leading to more expensive, and unaffordable, services.\~Connecting the dots\~\~\~\~\~But where the problem starts may also be where the solution begins. We need a radical approach that guarantees the human right to water by tackling inequalities and putting people's needs front and centre - especially the needs of those whose voices continue to be marginalised and disregarded. This is both a necessary response, and a step toward ending the climate change crisis, as it offers benefits both for mitigation (stopping climate change) and adaptation (adjusting to the new normal).The good news is that the solutions are well known and readily available. Well-managed water systems can protect access to reliable water supplies during times of drought. Strong sanitation systems can resist floods. And protecting water and sanitation services from extreme weather is highly cost-effective - HYPERLINK http://ft-bc-cms.herokuapp.com/partnercontent/wateraid/how-water-in-48-countries-is-key-to-the-success-of-the-worlds-most-important-climate-summitfor every $1 spent upgrading flood-resistant infrastructure, $62 is saved in flood restoration costs.\~If world leaders were to prioritise universal access to climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure, it would be a long-term investment, HYPERLINK yielding net benefits of $37-to-86-billion per year and avoiding up to six-billion cases of diarrhoea and 12-billion cases of parasitic worms, with significant implications for child health and nutrition over the next twenty years.\~\~\~\~\~Just add waterAs we look to COP26, we need to ensure that climate decision-makers understand the adaptation needs and mitigation opportunities of water and sanitation systems, as well as the risks that climate change poses to sustainable services. They must additionally align climate and water policies so that access to water is equitable, climate risks are reduced, and there is more money available for adaptation.After all, ensuring effective climate action and sustainable access to water and sanitation are matters of human rights. This means that we must tackle the root causes of the water crisis globally and ensure prioritisation of water for the realisation of human rights, over other uses, such as large-scale agriculture and industries, including extractive industries. To realise these rights, municipalities and villages also must be supported to improve their capacity to manage their water sources sustainably and efficiently.Without urgent measures to slow climate change and adapt to the damage already done to our planet, there is a real risk that people's access to water and sanitation will worsen rather than improve. Without sanitation, we cannot guarantee the right to education; without hygiene, our health is diminished; and without reliable access to water, gender equality can never be achieved.COP26 is an opportunity for a reset, not only for the planet, but also for the social contract between governments and people. Eliminating inequalities, including in access to water and sanitation, is a foundational requirement for effective climate action. We hope that decision-makers in Glasgow are champions for this vision of a better world.The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/opinion/2021-11-03-climate-justice-begins-with-the-human-right-to-water/Climate justice begins with the human right to water appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.zaThe Mail & Guardian\l"

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa204","#BizTrends2022: SA's energy landscape - 2021 insights and the outlook for 2022","January 5, 2022 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","As 2021 drew to a close, South Africa's energy landscape was abuzz with discussions around alternative energy, renewables, and the potential that digital - more specifically smart - technology poses for resource optimisation in the short-term future.-Load shedding, which is likely to feature throughout 2022, has played a central role in driving these conversations, as has the landmark announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa to raise the threshold for embedded generation to 100MW last year.These weren t the only major developments that garnered attention in 2021 all eyes are on South Africa following the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) and our historic pledge, along with nearly 200 other countries around the world, to phase down coal consumption by 2030. The $8.5bn cash injection pledged by the world s rich nations to support South Africa s migration away from coal towards renewables is another helpful push towards wider adoption of green energy.Developments such as the appetite among private energy providers to supply the country with electricity, the very real need to ease intense strain on the national power grid already bogged down by ageing infrastructure, and the abundance of green funding available in the continent, showcase plenty of incentive to start making the necessary changes that will see a positive shift in the local energy landscape.So, what can we expect to see in 2022?Renewable energy adoption on the riseConsidering the success of COP26 for Team South Africa, particularly in positioning the requirement for funding to support an energy transition, private sector players will invest as and when they can over the coming years, to allow for more flexibility with the use of their resources.We ve already seen announcements from the mining sector and some of South Africa s biggest companies, among others, and even private households across South Africa, trying to shift away from the grid by making use of renewable energy sources like wind, solar and gas. This will be a trend that will certainly continue well into next year, not least because of the enabling environment for harnessing renewable energy that already naturally exists in South Africa.From a national utility perspective, there is going to be an intense acceleration towards leveraging the renewable assets that are currently operating in the country. Eskom s recent (albeit controversial) R14bn energy storage procurement project is some indication of this.Realistically, the deployment is going to take time, as will Eskom s ability to pivot to meet the requirements of renewable adoption. As such, there won t be major change taking place in 2022, but some structural change in terms of splitting Eskom into generation, transmission and distribution entities will more than likely start to take shape.Overall there will be a continuous shift toward renewable energy going into next year and the coming years. This is the only opportunity for SA and the continent to reach the 1.5 degree climate goal and lower carbon emissions across the board.Alternative energy: incomingI will preface these ideas by saying that I don t believe there will be any seismic shifts happening in the next 12 months. There is still groundwork that needs to be done before we will see any real change taking place on the alternative energy front, which includes municipalities sourcing proposals from independent power producers (IPPs) before they will be able to get their large-scale power generation projects off the ground, as well as upgrades to grid infrastructure.While the new 100MW threshold is certainly a welcomed first step, establishing more significant opportunities to inject as much of the energy generated by IPPs into the grid is crucial. We are still barely scratching the surface in terms of reaching the potential that embedded, distributed and self-generated energy presents.This necessitates a shift in regulatory frameworks, which is the biggest barrier to accelerated adoption of alternative energy solutions from private providers. There will most certainly be uptake in the coming year, but not at the rate that was expected when news of the raised embedded energy threshold first broke.What will accelerate uptake is putting infrastructure in place that ensures the opening of bi-directional energy flow opportunities, as well as the setting of more attractive tariffs from Eskom and municipalities. There is an abundance of green funding available to African IPPs, but access to this funding needs to improve by removing some of the red tape surrounding the process.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/723/223795.html :EMBED-->Digital intelligence will be keySupporting the acceleration of new additions to South Africa s energy mix will be achieved through the adoption of digital technologies that increase and optimise available energy. Energy storage opportunities will flourish and abound considering these developments.Take, for example, the potential of electric vehicles. These can be used to provide power to a person s home during load shedding and can be charged using the solar panels. Surplus storage can then be supplied to one s neighbours or leveraged by the local municipality and directed to the grid. Intelligent algorithms can be employed to identify when to charge and when to push power back into the grid, optimising usage and helping to lower emissions in the process.This is not a pipe dream not only is this achievable in South Africa today, but it is completely feasible too, provided that the national utility and private players create the environment that will allow people to aggregate energy and use that technology. All that is required for this kind of grid technology to be realised is the right investment to modernise and maintain.All in all, the future is bright for South Africa s energy landscape in 2022 and beyond. It s going to require a leapfrog approach in many ways giving private players the flexibility to not have to go through all the granular steps in the renewable and alternative energy process, but to take a leap and take full advantage of historical opportunities. And I am very bullish about creating opportunities to make these leapfrogs happen. In this way, South Africa has the best possible chance to go from being an overwhelmingly coal-based energy consumer, to having an energy mix that is renewable, diversified, distributed, and smart.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa207","Government's R172bn fossil fuel subsidy at odds with ambitions","February 2, 2022 Wednesday","The Herald (South Africa)","CLIMATE CHANGE Denene ErasmusThe SA government's spending on energy subsidies is out of tune with its stated climate change ambitions contained in its Paris Agreement commitment and the energy transition deal it struck with major developed economies late in 2021, according to a report published on Monday. SA, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in Africa, has a standing commitment to limit emissions to between 350-million tonnes and 420-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent - a reduction of about 20%-33% by 2030. It won an $8.5bn deal to manage and finance its green transition - though it is subject to conditions that are still up for negotiations - at the climate change conference known as COP26, held in Glasgow. However, a report published by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) - an independent think-tank based in Canada that promotes human development and environmental sustainability - says the government needs to review energy spending policies that favour fossil fuels. Energy subsidies in SA more than tripled between 2017 and 2020 from R58bn to R172bn, with the highest subsidies allocated to fossil fuels, including coal-fired electricity, the IISD said. About 77% of the subsidies were delivered in the form of bailouts to Eskom or in foregone revenue as in carbon and VAT exemptions. The government spent nearly R67bn on bailouts for carbon-intensive companies, including R56bn for Eskom in 2020/2021, as well as R43bn to support the oil and gas industry, which benefited from VAT exemptions provided for the sale of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin. These subsidies supported the use of coal in SA, which, according to the report, made up 88% of the electricity mix in 2018, with Eskom producing more than 90% of total power supply. The report also found that pollution from fossil fuel use costs the country R550bn each year in environmental harm and damage to public health. Some of the recommendations made in the report include raising fossil fuel taxes (specifically taxes on coal) and ending the exemptions to the carbon tax. ""The government uses fiscal policy to influence the economy to meet the needs of the people and to move slowly towards a less carbon-intensive economy. But the bailouts and exemptions are doing the opposite of this, locking in high-carbon energy and pushing out clean energy,"" said Richard Bridle, senior policy adviser at the IISD. He conceded that taxes on coal would affect electricity prices but said these costs could be mitigated through targeted assistance to vulnerable consumers using coal tax revenues. The IISD argued in the report that coal is the most underpriced fossil fuel in SA due to bailouts, which distort the price of electricity generated from coal while failing to account for its true cost, adding that the retail price would need to double to reflect coal's social and environmental costs. The report highlights the challenges faced by countries seeking to transform carbon-intensive economies at a time when climate change is dominating debate globally as the biggest risk to economies. SA faces a potential loss of market share for its exports as economies such as the EU consider levies on imported carbon-intensive products. Proposals that may lift the price of energy for consumers may also prove controversial. ""The era in which cheap coal provided cheap energy is over. Medupi and Kusile showed us that [coal-powered stations] are not cheap to build and when we take account of the damage to public health, it is not cheap to operate,"" Bridle said. There was a strong case for targeted subsidies and people facing energy access issues should receive support, he said. But blanket energy subsidies were ""regressive"" and mainly benefited those who consumed the most, ""who tend to be the richest people in society"". Raising fossil fuel taxes ""would generate revenues that can be spent on social priorities [such as] improving energy access, as well as funding education, health and other priorities and ensuring that the energy system is properly maintained and developed"", he said.- BusinessLIVE Picture: THE TIMES\l"

The reality is that you will get a few minor donations, but the rest of the stuff is going to cost you money, which was the case as far as [SA was] concerned,"" he said.The comments from SA may create unease with partner nations as they indicate that a widely hailed agreement that could be seen as a model for other countries is far from being a done deal.When it was announced, much was left unsettled, with the official text saying it was subject to conditions such as ""concurrence on the investment framework, and in l"

His emphasis that it is the private sector that creates jobs and his moves to ease pressure on the small business sector, were also encouraging.First, he announced a redesigned loan scheme for small businesses, which will involve development finance institutions. Second, he said he had appointed Sipho Nkosi, chair of the Small Business Institute and former CEO of Exxaro Resources, to the presidency ""to cut the red tape that stops small businesses from growing and thriving"".This is something Business Leadership SA (BLSA) has long been calling for, and both measures come at a critical time for SMEs that have been battered by the ravages of the Covid-19 lockdowns.CAPABLE STATEThe president provided an important update on the drive to build a capable state, saying the government would soon finalise a framework for the professionalisation of the public service. This will include tighter measures for the recruitment of public servants, as well as continuous professional development. Improving the capacity of the public sector is vital to our long-term development.However, it's concerning that Ramaphosa did not mention anything new on the disbursement of the $8.5bn pledged at towards SA's just energy transition, merely repeating the announcement of the appointment of former Absa CEO Daniel Mminele as head of the presidential climate finance task team.We would like to have learnt more about the composition of that task team. When the pledge was announced, the political declaration also provided for a task force to develop a programme of work, and BLSA called for this task force to be inclusive, with representatives from all spheres of society.We hope business, labour and other social partners are fully included in the decision-making process and, critically, there are strong measures imposed to combat the ever-present threat of corruption.Where the president displayed strength was in his response to the expert panel's report on the July unrest. Promising changes in positions within the security cluster and the recruitment of 12,000 new police personnel, he quoted some of the report's more jarring conclusions. These included that there was an unequivocal failure of the country's police and intelligence services, that the ""internal differences"" and factional fights in the governing ANC contributed to the carnage, and that these squabbles should be viewed as a national security threat.PROSECUTIONSBLSA also welcomes Ramaphosa's commitment to pursue and accelerate prosecutions against those implicated in fraudulent Covid-19-related tenders, and in judge Raymond Zondo's reports into state capture. However, that swings attention back onto the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and questions of whether it has the resources to deal with the slew of anti-corruption cases that need to be successfully prosecuted.BLSA is committed to supporting prosecution processes and capacitating the NPA, and we are assessing ways in which we can do so without compromising ethical considerations. We believe there are ways to achieve this and are hoping for fruitful engagement on this issue.The president did not go into the other set of Zondo's recommendations, which BLSA believes will go a long way in preventing future corruption, but he has said he will address them once the third and final Zondo report is submitted. These include that a national charter against corruption be adopted by the government, business sector and relevant stakeholders, and that an independent public procurement anti-corruption agency - including a council, inspectorate, litigation unit, tribunal and court - be established.Other measures are aimed at tightening up processes around state tenders and the appointment of executives to state-owned entities.Accountability and strong anti-corruption mechanisms need to be integral features in SA in the years ahead, and efficient implementation of all of Zondo's recommendations will send an important message that the days of impunity are behind us.Mavuso is CEO of Business Leadership SA\l"

As delegates prepare to converge on Glasgow for COP26 to re-evaluate and negotiate their commitment to this plan, we are faced with global governments' reluctance to follow through with commitments and the threat of carbon majors derailing any potential progress.\~The South African Climate Action Network (SACAN) is a coalition of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) working to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change to ecologically sustainable levels. SACAN as a network will, alongside numerous South African NGOs, send delegates to COP26, to engage in meaningful climate action. SACAN endeavours to ensure that despite the vaccine inequity and prohibitive participation costs, that the Global South's priorities are heard and prioritised.The Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP), has long been criticised for its exclusionary nature.

About 77% of the subsidies were delivered in the form of bailouts to Eskom or in foregone revenue as in carbon and VAT exemptions.The government spent nearly R67bn on bailouts for carbon-intensive companies, including R56bn for Eskom in 2020/2021, as well as R43bn to support the oil and gas industry, which benefited from VAT exemptions provided for the sale of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin.These subsidies supported the use of coal in SA, which, according to the report, made up 88% of the electricity mix in 2018, with Eskom producing more than 90% of total power supply. The report also found that pollution from fossil fuel use costs the country R550bn each year in environmental harm and damage to public health.Some of the recommendations made in the report include raising fossil fuel taxes (specifically taxes on coal) and ending the exemptions to the carbon tax.""The government uses fiscal policy to influence the economy to meet the needs of the people and to move slowly towards a less carbon-intensive economy. But the bailouts and exemptions are doing the opposite of this, locking in high-carbon energy and pushing out clean energy,"" said Richard Bridle, senior policy adviser at the IISD.He conceded that taxes on coal would affect electricity prices but said these costs could be mitigated through targeted assistance to vulnerable consumers using coal tax revenues.The IISD argued in the report that coal is the most underpriced fossil fuel in SA due to bailouts, which distort the price of electricity generated from coal while failing to account for its true cost, adding that the retail price would need to double to reflect coal's social and environmental costs.The report highlights the challenges faced by countries seeking to transform carbon-intensive economies at a time when climate change is dominating debate globally as the biggest risk to economies. SA faces a potential loss of market share for its exports as economies such as the EU consider levies on imported carbon-intensive products. Proposals that may lift the price of energy for consumers may also prove controversial.""The era in which cheap coal provided cheap energy is over. Medupi and Kusile showed us that [coal-powered stations] are not cheap to build and when we take account of the damage to public health, it is not cheap to operate,"" Bridle said.There is a strong case for targeted subsidies and people facing energy access issues should receive support, he said. But blanket energy subsidies are ""regressive"" and mainly benefit those who consume the most, ""who tend to be the richest people in society"".Raising fossil fuel taxes ""would generate revenues that can be spent on social priorities [such as] improving energy access, as well as funding education, health and other priorities and ensuring that the energy system is properly maintained and developed"", he said.erasmusd@businesslive.co.za\l"

That's catastrophic. Rich countries are almost entirely to blame for that global heating. They aren't taking responsibility for this, by meaningfully dropping their carbon emissions or paying poorer countries for the damage of those emissions. And the selfishness of the West's Covid-19 response has shown how the response to the climate crisis will go.In this context, African countries are increasingly solving their own problems: This continent's carbon emissions could drop by 32% by 2030, if the plans submitted by the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop26/COP26 climate conference go ahead. The International Renewable Energy Agency expects two-thirds of the energy needs of sub-Saharan Africa will be met by 2030. A quarter of that new capacity will be renewable. Right now, 770-million people on the continent don't have access to electricity. This will mean less pollution while also getting lights on in more homes for children to do their homework. More countries are committing to a total of zero carbon emissions by the middle of this century. Nigeria and Kenya recently announced plans to get there. All but two African states have ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, which requires countries to submit plans on how they reduce carbon emissions and help communities adapt to climate change. Submitting a plan is a Herculean task and means more investment in climate science. It also means countries have a base from which they can then plan development. Those climate plans are turning into climate laws. Nigeria passed its law last month. Laws mean that civil society can hold governments to account in court, often the one place where this happens. In South Africa, climate legislation has seen a spate of cases enforcing climate action in the last few years. Where regimes don't listen to the courts or voters, climate becomes about governance and who decides what the future will look like.

However, Eskom is focusing on addressing the automation issue.""We acknowledge the fact that at times it takes (a long time) to finalise some matters. This is mainly due to the complexity of the matters and the shortage of internal capacity to deal with the volumes of disciplinary actions.""The process to outsource some of these matters is rigid due to the governance process required by the National Treasury. This notwithstanding, there has been significant progress made in addressing these matters,"" Gordhan said.He also said that Eskom's reliance on State funds would decrease in the future if it could receive a cost-reflective tariff, recover municipal debt in arrears, manage internal costs, and deal with its current excessive leverage.Eskom is currently insolvent.The utility is set to benefit from $8.5 billion (R130.59 billion) in loans and grants pledged to South Africa by countries such as the US and the UK at the COP26 climate change meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, last year.But it wants the government to cut out more than half of its debt before accepting the Western aid.Gordhan said Eskom's current debt-service costs could not be adequately covered by the amount left over from operations: ""Eskom can afford to service a debt of approximately R200 billion. This means that the balance sheet needs to be de-leveraged by R200 billion.""He also said Eskom had communicated the need to reduce its debt by at least half of its current level to its shareholder representative.""A significant proportion of funding offered by the international partner group countries (the so-called $8.5 billion) is expected to be used for Eskom's just transition plans. In particular, these funds will be utilised to support Eskom's plans to repower and repurpose coal plants that are shutting down with renewables, battery storage and gas.""This financing will not (and cannot) be used for financing the legacy coal debt.

Global leaders must come together and adopt a co-ordinated multi-stakeholder approach to tackle unrelenting global challenges and build resilience ahead of the next crisis, Zahidi said.Globally, climate risks dominated concerns as the world enters the third year of the pandemic.The WEF report said environmental risks were perceived to be the five most critical long-term threats to the world as well as the most potentially damaging to people and the planet.Climate action failure, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss ranked as the top three most severe and long-term risks as the pandemic will limit the ability to respond adequately.Peter Giger, the group chief risk officer for Zurich Insurance Group, said the climate crisis remained the biggest long-term threat facing humanity. Failure to act on climate change could shrink global GDP by one-sixth and the commitments taken at COP26 are still not enough to achieve the 1.5 C goal, Giger said. Humans are not good in the boiling frog scenario, which is climate change, they\' re much better in the fight or flight scenario, which has been the pandemic. Giger said it was not too late for governments and businesses to act on the risks they face and to drive an innovative transition that protects economies and people.World Wide Fund for Nature director general Marco Lambertini said businesses and policy makers were finally waking up to the real risks posed by both climate change and biodiversity loss. This is the result of a new \' eco-awakening\' , Lambertini said. As the world\' s leaders gear up for this year\' s biodiversity talks in China, it is critical that they act on society\' s concerns and finally connect the dots between climate change, the destruction of nature and our current production and consumption model. \l"

Such an amount would mark a dramatic increase from the current goal of $100bn annually that developed nations have struggled to meet.-Zaheer Fakir, a lead coordinator for finance for the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change, said the new goal had been formally adopted by African environment ministers in September and would be suggested by African nations at COP26, the UN climate conference kicking off on 31 October in Glasgow, Scotland.Developed nations with historical responsibility for climate-warming emissions have currently committed to channel $100bn per year in climate finance to vulnerable countries by 2020, and up until 2025. The issue is set to be high on the agenda at COP26 after they likely fell short of that target.Discussions around what climate finance should look like post-2025 should start now, Fakir said, adding that the $100bn commitment was first set in 2009 and not based on the needs of developing countries.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/220482.html :EMBED-->""The point we are trying to make is that we need a climate finance figure that is ambitious, that is based on science and based on needs,"" he said, adding it should also be balanced between funding for both mitigating climate change and adapting to it.Pressure to pay moreDeveloping nations are an essential part of global ambitions to achieve ""net zero"" emissions, including among their number nine out of the 20 biggest carbon dioxide emitters.

The platform helps young people to have a voice on issues that matter to them and to access information, tools and services to influence positive social change.Of those impacted, 20% said their homes were damaged, 16% stated that their education was disrupted and 14% had limited access to safe water. Air pollution, drought, flooding, and water pollution top the reasons given for the impact.Christine Muhigana, Unicef South Africa representative said children and young people were already feeling the brunt of the climate crisis and environmental degradation.""That's why their voices need to be heard and why urgent investment in climate adaptation and mitigation efforts is needed to protect the services that children depend upon,"" added Muhigana.Unicef said its findings were that there was optimism that the green economy could provide future employment, with 65% of young people polled stating that the sector would help, 25% were not sure and only 10% said it wouldn't make a difference.Agriculture, tourism and renewable energy are the three areas identified as being of most interest to young people.The majority polled also believed that the COP26 climate talks would make a difference in the climate fight, with only 13% saying there would be no positive impact.Unicef said the Just Energy Transition Partnership, announced this month between the governments of South Africa, France, Germany, the UK and US was a critical step forward to support South Africa's transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient society that promotes employment and livelihoods.Muhigana said: ""The future of South Africa's children is at stake but there is hope that world leaders will commit to climate action that also strengthens the resilience of essential services that children rely on.""Include children and young people in all climate-related decisions, according to the Youth Climate Action Plan developed by young people with support from the South African Institute of International Affairs (Saiia)Increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children, including water, sanitation and hygiene systems, health and education.Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a just and equitable transition towards an environmentally sustainable and inclusive economy.It said it would also be working with partners to support children and young people by:Launching the Yoma Green Challenge to engage young people in efforts to preserve and protect the environment through climate-related community tasks.Collaborating with youth volunteers to monitor water quality through a citizen science programme across the country.Providing young people with access to skills and climate-related livelihood opportunities through Generation Unlimited and the Digital Livelihoods challenge.Installing handwashing facilities in schools where access to safe water is limited.Promoting the 'Tippy Tap' challenge where children and young people build simple water-saving handwashing facilities.THE MERCURYDaily News 1999 - 2021 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.

By city leaders I mean not only the municipal political and administrative leadership, but leaders in business and civil society as well. If we can work together as change agents, adopting an open, optimistic-but-realistic growth mindset based on shared values and interests, there is much that is achievable in the year ahead. Some of these ""quick wins"" will require public-private partnerships and co-operation; others are stumbling blocks which can be addressed by improving efficiencies in the municipality and putting political differences aside. Restoration of the Baakens River Valley: A chamber study to assess viability and develop a business plan in consultation with stakeholders, completed at the end of last year, shows the city's ""green lung"" can be an economic as well as an environmental asset. Clearing of water-sapping alien vegetation will not only restore the natural environment but create more than 700 jobs in ongoing removal operations as well as in new eco-friendly manufacturing enterprises processing the cleared timber and vegetation into profitable goods. A healthy valley will support recreation, sports, eco-tourism and public events, and be a key resource in mitigating the impact of climate change by providing a natural flood barrier. A minimal capital investment of about R50m will unlock massive and diverse opportunities. Spin-offs include relatively easy job creation, enhancing the ecosystem value, improving safety, accessibility and use of the area by locals and tourists, with opportunities also in links to the urban renewal of the lower valley and future harbour and beachfront developments. The chamber is taking the next steps to engage the municipality and the broad spectrum of stakeholders to get working groups going so this project can deliver tangible results by the end of the year. Cleaning and greening holds great potential to improve the metro living and business environment, and achieve sustainable job creation. Pay local people to clear illegally dumped rubble and litter that can be directed to recycling or upcycling for income generation; clear alien vegetation that becomes input for manufactured products. There is serious global funding available out of commitments at last year's Glasgow Climate Change Conference, COP26, for green business and carbon emissions reduction initiatives - an opportunity the Bay should seize without delay. The PE Golf Club's planned development of a residential golf estate is also relatively easy to implement. Approve the sale of the land, and allow the club to develop free-standing and high-density housing around the golf course, creating hundreds of direct and indirect jobs and an estimated additional R50m a month for the municipality in rates and service charges. The proposed development has been stymied due to the ever-changing metro administrations and office-bearers of the last few years, meaning the club has repeatedly had to start its application and motivation afresh. These applications take many months, even years, to finalise and approve. Our ask of the metro's political and executive leadership is to swiftly put the resources in place and simpler, transparent processes to ensure rezoning applications are turned about within three months. Covid-19 delayed the establishment of a Conference Bureau to proactively market the Bay as a business events destination, and bid for hosting of conventions, exhibitions, trade shows and other major events. With an affordable estimated budget of R3m a year, a public-private partnership to drive this could develop a new revenue-generating and tourism-supporting sector to benefit the metro. The appointment of a suitably qualified permanent city manager, accountable to clear and transparent performance indicators, is key to achieving much-needed stability in the metro. It is time to resolve this issue - it requires a simple human resources process that needs to be rigorous, transparent and free of political agendas. These and other quick wins have been tabled by the chamber's leadership team in ongoing engagements with the metro's political leaders, parties and city officials. As organised business, we are passionate about this city and want it to succeed, and believe that through a collaborated approach we can ignite a resurgence of the Bay.

We do think the world needs to transition but we need to do it in the right way otherwise there will be huge unintended consequences.""A report released by the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) this month shows SA will need R300bn in investment from the international community over the next three decades to support a just transition to low carbon emissions.The UK, the US, France, Germany and the EU have already committed $8.5bn in funding to help Eskom transition its coal-fired power generation fleet to a less carbon-intensive system in a deal announced at the COP26 climate conference in November 2021.The bank will halt lending, capital markets and advisory services to new clients that derive the majority of their revenues from the extraction of coal, and by 2024 the firm will phase out remaining credit exposure to such companies. JPMorgan will also refuse project financing or other forms of asset-specific financing where the proceeds will be used to develop new, or refinance existing coal-fired power plants, unless they use technology to mitigate emissions.""Although there are cleaner, lower-carbon alternatives to coal we don't have renewable energy technology of sufficient scale to replace oil and gas so this sector is regarded slightly differently,"" said Umunna.Umunna says a big driver in the shift to a carbon-neutral future is the changing demographics of asset ownership in developed markets such as the US, where the ageing baby boomer generation is slowly being replaced by millennials as the largest generational cohort. He says the younger generation is far more ""values-centred"" about investment, which is driving banks and asset managers to reconsider their capital allocation towards carbon-intensive projects.""We certainly don't see the transition to net zero as optional - it is essential if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe,"" Umunna said. ""But the question is how you do it without unintended consequences. You can't just jump to the promised land in the course of a few months.

There's an increasing appreciation for a nuanced approach. It's about the quality of transition plans for countries and for companies,"" he told Business Day.""It's starting to develop. It's [at an] early stage. Regulators are not quite there yet. They need to think a bit wider than the countries which they're regulating.""Financial services firms are under pressure from shareholder activists, climate lobbyists and investors to take steps to mitigate climate change by reducing funding for companies involved in carbon-intensive industries such as coal mining or oil extraction. That leaves us with a complex situation of having to embrace the global shift towards carbon neutrality while delivering investment returns.""As allocators of capital, one of our key jobs is to back the winners and make sure that the perennially destructive businesses change,"" said Du Toit. ""For us it is important to use our capital pool to transition SA and make it competitive and not leave it as one of the world's biggest carbon emitters.""Ninety One, formerly known as Investec Asset Management before being spun out of the banking group in 2020, has long argued for developing countries to be allowed to transition their economies gradually to carbon neutrality.The asset manager says that while emerging markets are responsible for more than two-thirds of annual global emissions at present, OECD member countries have produced three-fifths of cumulative historic emissions, which is seven times more than the rest of the world on a per capita basis.That is why Du Toit says a myopic focus on ""portfolio purity"", with capital allocators investing only in companies that make them look green, will not result in real-world carbon reduction across developed and emerging markets.By way of example, he says a 50% reduction in exposure to Brazil, Russia, India, China, SA (Brics) plus Indonesia in a typical global equity portfolio will reduce that portfolio's reported carbon intensity only 3%. That is because those emerging markets have a cumulative weighting of only about 8% in most global equity portfolios.Du Toit argues that if asset managers adopt a ""buy developed, sell developing"" investment strategy it could starve emerging markets of investment capital at a time when they need an extra $2.5-trillion a year to finance their energy transitions. That is why he argues for a fair transition path for emerging markets.theunisseng@businesslive.co.za$2.5-trillionextra amount emerging economies need yearly for energy transition3%cut in typical global equity portfolio's carbon intensity with 50% cut in exposure to Brics and Indonesia\l"

Eskom's green financing package was announced on November 2 at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders gathered to discuss how to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change. The $8.5bn deal for Eskom will see SA, the UK, the US, France, Germany and the EU partner in a transaction that is expected to serve as a template for other emerging markets. ""We are optimistic about the potential substantial decarbonisation benefits for SA that will move us closer to globally accepted emission targets,"" RMB CEO James Formby said on Tuesday. ""Having this financing to anchor projects will create great confidence in private investors to invest in these green transition projects. It will allow government to leverage the initial funding many times over resulting in a far greater impact in developing green sources of energy than just the initial funding number suggests."" Formby said that about 75% of the total cost of large scale infrastructure projects is typically covered by debt finance. If one assumes that the R130bn funding package for Eskom comes in the form of first-phase grant funding then about three times that amount could be crowded in via additional debt facilities provided by commercial lenders and other private investors. Formby said ideally the terms of the R130bn funding deal for Eskom should encourage this additional debt financing to be provided. He also stressed the need for an appropriately capitalised ""grid-co"", or grid company, to be established to ensure that any electricity produced and consumed in SA is paid for by consumers so that the state utility is not continually reliant on government bailouts or guarantees. That alludes to Eskom's widely publicised plan to split into three separate entities that are responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution. Should this split result in all three entities being financially sustainable, it would boost lenders' confidence to provide more debt funding for power projects, said Formby. That comes as much of SA faces stage 4 rolling blackouts as Eskom is forced to shed power from parts of the country for up to 7.5 hours a day to prevent a collapse of the grid. This is happening against a backdrop where banks, asset managers and governments are under pressure to reduce funding for carbon intensive projects such as coal mines, which provide the fuel that powers the majority of Eskom's power stations. Eskom's R130bn green financing package is meant to ultimately enable the retirement of its entire fleet of coal-fired powered stations over the next few decades as the world moves to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Nevertheless, Formby said infrastructure assets could provide the ideal long-term investment for pension funds, which need to match their long-term commitments to retirees with investments that provide predictable returns over time. Allocating capital to debt facilities linked to long-term power infrastructure projects, which in theory could bank on consumer electricity bill payments, could help pension funds generate the yields required to preserve wealth for pensioners. ""This is why there are proposed changes to Regulation 28, which governs where pension funds can invest, to include an explicit infrastructure category to support the allocation to infrastructure assets,"" said Formby.

South Africa welcomes the long-awaited sixth assessment by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change. This is an important contribution to enhancing scientific understanding on climate change that must inform international policy at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change s COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, Creecy said.In 2022, the IPCC will release the next reports on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, another report dealing with mitigation of climate change, and finally, a synthesis report of the key findings. Impact of climate change on southern AfricaThe report also highlights and analyses the detail available in terms of climate change in southern Africa, reinforcing existing scientific evidence that the region is likely to become drier, and reductions in precipitation can already be detected. The report states that droughts will become more frequent at 1.5\'b0C of global warming, and more so as the level of global warming increases.It has also long been known that the region is warming drastically, at about twice the global rate of warming. The effects of warming and the limited options for adaptation to new temperatures and rainfall patterns will be assessed in the upcoming Working Group II report to be tabled next year. Sustaining the global temperature of 1.5\'b0C by the end of the 21st century will require global scale negative emissions in the second half of the century to reduce atmospheric CO2. In this regard, the work of the Climate Commission to identify pathways for a just transition to a low carbon economy and climate resilient society by mid-century has never been more important.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/499/218624.html :EMBED-->National and international priority Climate action remains a national and international priority. And South Africa remains firmly committed to contributing our best effort towards the global cause of addressing climate change. In this regard, we will be submitting our revised Nationally Determined Contribution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC ahead of COP26, the minister said.South Africa supports the common position of the African Group of Negotiators, ahead of COP26, that ambition and climate action need to be dramatically increased to advance all three of the interconnected global goals in the UNFCCC\'b4s Paris Agreement, namely mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. In this regard, it is urgent that developed countries urgently honour their obligation to provide financial support to developing countries that already face the impact of climate change.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/218524.html :EMBED-->Climate justice In the context of this report, issues of climate justice have never been more compelling. As we transition our energy generation and at least seven sectors of our economy, we must ensure that those involved in the vulnerable sections of our society and economy do not carry a disproportionate burden for climate change and its mitigation. Eskom has already commissioned significant research on the impact of the transition on coal-fired power stations facing decommissioning later this decade. Significant long-term financial resources, at concessional rates, will be needed to introduce new technologies and open up significant new job creation opportunities so that our country joins others who are benefitting from the green technological transition across the world, Creecy said.African countries are already struggling to adapt to the reality of a changing climate and they urgently require international support for their mitigation and adaptation efforts. To avoid the stark future foreshadowed by the IPCCC report, COP26 needs to prioritise securing finance, technology and capacity building support from developed to developing countries, said Creecy.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

Developed countries promised $100bn every year in public and private funding from 2020. That target has not yet been reached.The BlackRock Institute, the asset manager's research arm, says that this amount is insufficient and that developing countries need $1-trillion annually to address climate change. It advocates that $100bn in grant funding be used to leverage $1-trillion in public and private finance.""Climate change is a global problem: without a successful transition to net zero everywhere, climate risk is unmanageable anywhere. Emerging markets are essential to the global transition - now accounting for 34% of global carbon emissions (excluding China) - but they are starved of capital to fund it. We estimate emerging markets will need at least $1-trillion per year to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 - more than six times current investment,"" the report said.""Given the collective interest in a successful transition and a shrinking window of time to act, we believe a much larger amount of public money needs to be directed from countries that can afford it to countries whose green transition is critical but underfunded,"" it said.Public money from the developed world could be used to absorb losses through loans, guarantees and equity in circumstance that would otherwise deter private investors. To leverage public budgetary funding at scale, financing would need to shift from a project-by-project basis to a facility level. Tools to do this could include ""green banks, mechanisms such as auctioned carbon price floors, securitisation and suitably designed facility-level credit enhancements"", the report said.Forestry, fisheries and environmental affairs minister Barbara Creecy said last week at a pre-COP26Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development research suggests developing countries will need between $3-trillion and $4-trillion to finance adaptation and mitigation.""But we are not seeing the developed countries coming to the party with regard to the finance,"" she said.

This is the estimated value of construction sector-related economic activity that could potentially be unlocked over the next few years after the announcements from President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow businesses to produce up to 100MW of power without the need for a generation licence from Nersa (the National Energy Regulator of SA). This will be further supported by the recent announcements out of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) of R131bn to accelerate SA's transition to clean energy projects. This will unlock a new era in electricity generation with gradual diversification away from almost sole reliance on Eskom. Importantly, this will incorporate funding mechanisms for communities in and around coal mining operations to lessen the impact of job losses and surrounding businesses. For the past two decades, industrial businesses in SA have been hamstrung by irregular power supply, rolling blackouts and load-shedding. Investors have been reluctant to deploy capital. Our bank expects to commit funding to a number of exciting energy projects over the next 24 months. Importantly, a number of businesses in the mining, property and industrial sectors have projects that are well advanced. We expect to see a couple of trends emerge over the next few months as funding for these projects is unlocked. The more common model for funding entails a business entering into a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with an independent power producer (IPP). This allows the respective businesses to focus on their core areas of competence. Organisations are actively seeking out IPPs with strong BBBEE credentials and we believe through a combination of financing from banks and financing institutions plus incentives from the department of trade, industry & competition (DTIC), we could see the emergence of a number of new entrants in the energy space over the next few years. These new captive power projects will be driven by private sector agreements without government support. In most cases banks are prepared to take a long-term view on the financing as the projects are value-enhancing and typically result in cost savings compared to Eskom's current electricity tariffs. Self-generation would help ensure energy security. SA electricity consumers were trapped in a cycle of double-digit tariff increases over the past decade with limited certainty around future increases. Captive power projects should result in savings on companies' electricity bills. Procuring power from renewable energy is already at ""grid parity"" and competitive. Add to this the sustainability and ""green"" aspect. To receive rollout at scale of captive power, clarity needs to be obtained around the wheeling arrangements and the cost thereof. Eskom is the custodian of the transmission infrastructure in SA. Self-generation and ""wheeling outside the fence"" must entail a wheeling charge. Wheeling is the delivery of electricity generated by a private operator in one location to a buyer in another location via a third party network (Eskom or a municipality). Individual homes can essentially be generators of power for self-consumption. Excess capacity can be sold back into the grid. This is another initiative that could alleviate pressure on Eskom's grid. The change in policy could translate into 5GW of additional renewable energy capacity - almost the entire capacity added to the grid over the past decade. It is likely to drive construction activity, job creation and general economic confidence across the broader economy. The future of electricity generation is indeed bright.

The rise of petrol prices indicates that commodity prices will inflate, and that includes food, and this will have a ripple effect on all households, particularly for low-income South Africans. Furthermore, the scourge of Covid-19 has left a lot of South Africans without jobs, with the government cushioning the citizens by introducing the Covid-19 relief grant. However, government help alone can only assist so much, while keeping a job is hard as industries keep retrenching.Finding a way to make extra income or redirect money is crucial. Some of the staple vegetables that are enjoyed by South Africans, such as cabbage, spinach, potatoes and onion, can grow in any soil type, thus making it easy for home growing.While recycling and reusing can assist in reducing our carbon footprint, which was the hot topic in the recently concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, this can also help in your little garden. Using vegetable peels and fruit remains to create your own manure can go a long way in fertilising your garden.Growing vegetables in a backyard garden can help cut costs and money that can be redirected to other needs.

Welcome to COP26, writes , where world leaders representing almost 8-billion people try to thrash out humanity's future What they are working towardsClimate change is linked to extreme weather, rising oceans, melting snowcaps, tornadoes, heat, floods, encroaching deserts and forest fires, among other disasters. If we don't take drastic steps, humanity will hurtle towards the extinction of all life on Earth.At COP21 in 2015, countries adopted the Paris Agreement to keep global warming ""well below"" 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. Countries agreed to aim for 1.5\'b0C.But temperatures have already risen by 1.1\'b0C-1.3\'b0C since the invention of the steam engine.So limiting heating to 1.5\'b0C is a colossal task.How can this possibly be achieved?For starters, the world must make total emissions of carbon dioxide 45% lower in 2030 than they were in 2010, and reduce them to zero by the middle of this century.So far there's been a lot of hot air. A UN report released this week warned that current pledges by countries would reduce carbon by only about 7.5% by 2030, far less than the 45% cut scientists say is needed.Brownie points for SAIn the run-up to COP26, countries were asked to submit national plans on emissions cuts - called nationally determined contributions - for the next decade. SA was one of the countries that set more ambitious targets for itself.President Cyril Ramaphosa isn't attending, but he has a local government election (and plenty of hot air at home) to deal with.Flunking the testFormer US president Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement during his term demonstrated how volatile international co-operation can be.Some of the biggest greenhouse gas culprits - China (28%), India (7%) and Russia (5%) - have yet to show any real commitment to cleaning up their collective acts. Neither Vladimir Putin nor Xi Jinping is in Glasgow.Humanity has reached a new milestone in its dominance of the planet. According to a study in Nature last December, human-made objects may now outweigh all living beings on Earth.Roads, houses, shopping malls and all the other movable and immovable goods made by humankind weigh in at about 1.1-trillion tonnes - equal to the combined weight of all plants, animals, fungi and other organisms on the planet.In 1900 artificial objects accounted for just 3% of the world's biomass.Anthropocene, the age of obscenity?For the first time humans have power over the Earth as great as the forces of nature. Our use of this power has opened up a new geological epoch that some scientists call the Anthropocene.Rich country, poor countryRich countries made their wealth using dirty energy, so who are they to now tell others to clean up their acts?Then there are the countries who suffer most from climate change, invariably developing nations.Some of the big debates at COP26 will centre on levelling the playing field.At the UN climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries committed to funding of $100bn (R1.5-trillion) a year to developing countries to limit the damage of climate change. Don't hold your breath.So what's the story with population growth?More people means a bigger carbon footprint.Ourworldindata.org did some calculations: it took nearly seven centuries for the population to double, from 0.25-billion in the early ninth century to 0.5-billion in the middle of the 16th century.Things sped up considerably after that and by the middle of the 20th century population growth was spinning out of control.The fastest doubling of the world population happened between 1950 and 1987, increasing from 2.5-billion to 5-billion people in just 37 years. This is twice the number of people in a little more than one generation.There are now just under 8-billion people on Earth. Though the population is no longer growing as fast, there will still be 2-billion more people by mid-century.Urban legendMore than 4-billion people - over half of the world - live in urban areas.The UN estimates the milestone event, when the number of people in urban areas overtook the number in rural settings, occurred in 2007.The one percentDespite this, only 1% of global land is defined as built-up area. If cities get their acts together, we could hugely improve the atmosphere.Choking to deathAir pollution is one of the world's leading causes of death, blamed for 5-million fatalities each year.Ye reap what ye sowHow we feed the world is critical to climate change.Food accounts for over 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Half of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture.The ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system, making it more acidic and less productive. This, along with practices such as overfishing, threatens marine resources that feed 3.2-billion people.On the other hand, over 17% of food is wasted, and up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food that is not consumed, says the UN.A meaty issueEstimates vary, but livestock animals are estimated to be responsible for up to 14% of all greenhouse emissions from human activities.A massive 94% of mammal biomass (excluding humans) is livestock. This means livestock outweighs wild mammals by a factor of 15 to one.Of the 28,000 species threatened with extinction, agriculture and aquaculture are listed as a threat for 24,000 of them.Demand for meat is growing: over the past 50 years, meat production has more than tripled.The beef with beefA study at the University of Illinois found that animal-based foods account for 57% of agricultural greenhouse gases, versus 29% for food from plants. Beef and cow's milk alone made up 34%.The spectre of Ebola worldwide ...The 2020 Arctic Report Card warned that the region is heating up more than twice as fast as other parts of the planet. One danger is the thawing permafrost in the Arctic, which is releasing micro-organisms that can cause disease and have not seen daylight for tens of thousands of years.The result could be catastrophic, with a pandemic of a disease as lethal as Ebola or worse. This alone could drive us to extinction.Power to the peopleRenewables grew almost 5% per year between 2009 and 2019, outpacing fossil fuels at 1.7%, says the UN.In 2018, coal's share of global energy supply fell to 27%, the lowest in 15 years.Legal threats, investor pressure and fear of regulations have led investment in fossil fuels to slump 40% since 2015, says the Economist.Defective jeansThe fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined, says the World Bank.At this pace, the fashion industry's greenhouse gas emissions will surge more than 50% by 2030.Don't forget the plastic pandemicAround the world, 1-million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every minute, and 5-trillion single-use plastic bags are used worldwide every year.At least 8-million tonnes of plastic end up in our oceans every year, and make up 80% of all marine debris, from surface waters to deep-sea sediments.Scientists are warning politicians not to forget the plastic waste crisis.Manufacturing plastic items adds to greenhouse gas emissions, and extreme weather such as floods and typhoons associated with a heating planet will disperse and worsen plastic pollution in the sea.In the end, climate change affects everything, and everything affects climate change.Smoke billows from stacks at a coal-fired power plant in Shanxi, China.

But unsurprisingly, as a politician she is not alone in having made such reputational missteps. In a world where trust and transparency are in short supply, individuals holding office have lost sight of their duty, becoming fast and loose with the facts and spouting opinions as if they were truths.Another case in point is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's denial of culpability around the various gatherings held at 10 Downing Street that flouted UK lockdown restrictions.A litany of source-based evidence suggests the British premier knew precisely what went on at the events his office organised. Yet his continued protestations and denials remain at odds with the facts that have emerged.In a similar vein, Sisulu, on occasion via her spokesperson and also directly, has continued to double down on her two controversial pieces and denies plagiarism accusations - despite the publication of both pieces of content side by side clearly indicating otherwise. Though her endgame strategy around this episode remains unclear, what is clear is that her strategy appears to be precisely the opposite of what best practice dictates.This raises the question whether we as citizens have become so accustomed to broken promises and untruths that we no longer require or demand a higher standard from those who hold positions of power. In this age of misinformation it is not easy to distinguish between opinion, casting aspersions and the abuse or misappropriation of information used to push forward personal agendas.Unfortunately, in SA's case misguided utterances from public figures are seldom in the best interest of citizens. Sisulu's attempt at a hatchet job on the constitution she has sworn for over two decades to uphold says more about her than it does about SA. Her attempts to shift focus from her own ineptitude by blaming a ""greater issue"" were ill-conceived and poorly executed.In the wake of COP26 and the reaffirmation of the UN sustainable development goals 2030, the ability to deliver on these depends on authentic and effective leadership. Last year, SA recorded the highest level of unemployment among countries tracked by Bloomberg, at 44.4%. Historically, tourism, the portfolio Sisulu is responsible for, represented 13% of SA's GDP and a large chunk of all employment opportunities. With the urgent need to rebuild the sector so evident, it beggars belief that the tourism minister has instead chosen to undermine SA's constitution, which is widely recognised as among the most progressive in the world.What is actually required is a single-minded approach to attracting meaningful investment to the sector, improving skills levels to ensure we are competitive, and making SA attractive to visit, work and live in. Surely what our politicians should be doing is delivering on their elected promises? We need effective leadership that translates into prudent public policy formulation, successful implementation and reliable public service delivery. To get there, we need urgent and strong consequence-driven leadership.BRAND VALUEIn the Sisulu case, what has been most lamentable is how little regard public figures seem to have for their brand value or intellectual honesty.Protecting one's name - or reputation - requires more than not doing wrong. For our society to thrive, we require that individuals in leadership across the public and private sectors deliver on their commitments, consistently. Every misstep is another hole in the canvas of our nation's reputation, which has already been mortally wounded by the vagaries and corruption of the past decade.In the private sector, the same principle applies. Pragmatic management that regularly articulates the company vision, performance and strategic objectives is more likely to gain and maintain the trust and respect of stakeholders than those that don't. If SA were a corporation, would there be sufficient belief in the company's leadership and brand equity to continue attracting and retaining investment?As for Sisulu, her disagreeable approach seems misguided at best and delinquent in its attempts to incite turmoil at worst. For this, she must be held accountable, by the same judicial structure she has tried to undermine. After all, as citizens who continue to hold on to the belief in a prosperous, productive, unified SA, we must continue to advocate for effective leadership in a country that would be committed to serving the interests of all South Africans.Silke is associate director and Chatterton CEO and managing partner at Instinctif Partners Africa.\l"

It will end in particular when we have extra megawatts in the system. Gordhan added that there also other factors, including maintenance, which must be resolved before the country can begin to see the end of load shedding. All of these factors are causing an immense amount of frustration amongst our people whether they are residents, whether they live in working class areas or middle class areas and whether they are large or small businesses, he said.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa253","Mantashe fires up the fight to defend coal","February 6, 2022 Sunday","Sunday Times (South Africa)","Mantashe fires up the fight to defend coalMineral resources and energy minister Gwede Mantashe said coal is under siege despite being an affordable source of energy and this week challenged the industry and affected communities to defend its use.The fossil fuel accounts for more than 80% of SA's energy generation, but it is also the single biggest contributor to climate change.Globally, coal is becoming less economically viable due to costs associated with its environmental impact. The government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.But Mantashe, a former coal miner and unionist, told mining executives in Pretoria this week that the use of coal is under attack and should be defended.""The reason we are here is to discuss how we can survive that offensive and extend the life of coal mining. We are in a situation where coal is under siege,"" he said.Communities and unions whose livelihoods will be affected by the transition also needed to speak out.""What I am putting to you as labour and communities is that I do not hear you. Half the time you whisper,"" Mantashe said.He believes SA should not be quick to abandon coal, citing the 89,548 employees that rely on the sector, and its contribution to the fiscus.According to the department of mineral resources & energy, coal is the highest revenue earner in mining, contributing 21.4% (R130.57bn) of total mining revenues (R608.99bn) in 2020.In November 2021, rich nations at the COP26 climate change conference pledged $8.5bn (R130bn) towards SA's just transition to a low-carbon future over the next three to five years.""When you generate R130bn in one year, my mind gallops to say we are being offered R131bn to close coal mining, and I am saying you are making that money in one year. How do you close your projects for what you do in one year? I am not a rebel, I am raising the reality that must be in the analysis we are making,"" Mantashe said.Vuslat Bayoglu, MD at private investment company Menar, said there is pressure from groups seeking to eliminate the use of coal immediately, outside the government-approved and industry-supported Integrated Resource Plan.""Financial institutions are also increasingly adopting a hostile attitude to development of coal mines. And so are nongovernmental organisations that are causing significant obstruction in environmental authorisation processes and water-use licence applications.""Bayoglu said because many mining companies are focused on what they know best - mining - they haven't been vocal in the debate about beneficiation technologies.""As a result, the just transition debate has not adequately included the importance of clean coal technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage.""For Bayoglu, developing economies like SA's should be allowed to develop their own economic strategies that will allow them to manage carbon emissions without destroying the little potential there is for them to catch up.""Without reliable and cheap power - a combination which at this stage can only be provided by coal - we must forget about employment and poverty reduction, and we must accept socioeconomic instability as the permanent feature of our society.""Mantashe's comments come as research released by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (ISSD) think-tank recommends a review of SA's energy fiscal policy to align it with the action needed to achieve the energy transition.The ISSD report, titled ""South Africa's Energy Fiscal Policy"", released this week, points to the tripling of energy subsidies from R58bn in the 2017/2018 financial year to R172bn in 2020/2021.According to the report, the increase is mainly due to the need to bail out Eskom by R56bn in 2020-2021 against the state-owned entity's total accumulated debt of R488bn.""This effectively supported the ongoing combustion of coal in South Africa, which made up 88% of the electricity mix in 2018, with Eskom producing more than 90% of total power supply.""The report says reforming or reducing bailouts provided to Eskom is key to reforming the country's fiscal energy regime. It says comparing fossil fuel subsidies, tax and non-tax revenues reveals that social costs are five times higher than revenues, with an annual net cost to society of R550bn.National Treasury senior economist Memory Machingambi said the government is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to carbon pricing and the reduction and phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.""We sit in a very peculiar place where we are a top-10 global emitter of greenhouse gas,"" said Machingambi. By introducing a carbon tax the government was signalling that the economy needed to transition.""It took us 10 years to get the carbon tax in place but by introducing the carbon price, which we are introducing at low rates, we are hoping gradually that we are influencing future investment decisions.""A loader moves coal at a mine in Mpumalanga.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa254","The Climate Change Shuffle - Deny, Delay, and Do Nothing","March 07, 2022","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","While more than a half century ago the Twist was the craze in dance halls globally, today the Climate Change Shuffle is the craze in government halls and conference sites worldwide as officials dance around the dangers of climate change.The first step in the Climate Change Shuffle is a straightforward maneuver: deny climate change. With feet solidly on the floor, confidently dismiss any scientific consensus on climate change and global warming, including it is caused by human activities. Deny that climate change is a threat to humanity and health of the planet as long as possible (Table 1).The second step in the Climate Change Shuffle, which is highly popular and easily done, is the delay. With body swaying gently from left to right, emphasize that the true answers to environmental issues are economic growth, advanced technologies, and human ingenuity, all of which will need some time and resources. Lean forward proposing the establishment of commissions to produce lengthy technical reports and continue to delay as long as possible.The third and final step in the Climate Change Shuffle, which should be performed effortlessly without movement, is to do nothing. Simply remain still, don't take any steps forward and let time slowly pass waltz by as long as possible. Climate change will likely soon be forgotten, displaced by something more immediate, such as gas prices, a sex scandal, or a military invasion.Mounting scientific evidence, including the recent Sixth Assessment Report of International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), indicates that global warming is reshaping the world more rapidly and severely than was known several years ago. Nevertheless, governments, especially the major emitters of greenhouse gases, continue dancing the Climate Change Shuffle.The top ten emitters of greenhouse gases account for two-thirds of the world's CO2 emissions. Far in first place is China, which is responsible for about 30 percent of the world's CO2 emissions. In a distant second place is the United States at 14 percent, followed by India at 7 percent and Russia at 5 percent (Figure 1).Environmental scientists, naturalists, and concerned citizens, including young activists, worldwide have warned that human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature and affecting the lives of billions of people and calling for needed action. Ecosystems and populations least able to cope are expected to be hardest hit by the consequences of climate change.Also, thousands of scientists have warned governments that the future habitability of planet earth depends on immediate, large-scale action in no less than six critical and interrelated areas: energy, short-lived pollutants, nature, food, economy, and population.Their recommended actions include limiting the burning of fossil fuels, restoring ecosystems, moving to plant-based diets, curtailing consumption or degrowth, and stabilizing world population.However, most of the recommended actions are largely unappealing to governments and their constituents. Transitioning from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, for example, is considered a difficult task. Global greenhouse gas emissions are broadly from energy, agriculture, industry, and waste, with almost three-quarters from energy consumption.The alternatives to fossil fuels are not readily available to meet the rising global demand for electricity. Fossil fuels account about two-thirds of global electricity generation, with coal, natural gas, and oil contributing 38, 28 and 3 percent, respectively versus renewables contributing 9 percent.Some progress has recently been achieved moving from meat to a plant-based diet. However, curtailing consumption, or shrinking the economy, is not likely to be embraced by most populations any time soon.Also, attempts to stabilize populations are anathema to most governments, businesses, and many others. They consider demographic growth essential for economic growth, political power, and national identity. Consequently, rather than stabilization, world population is expected to increase from 8 billion today to 10 billion by around mid-century.When confronted by the overwhelming evidence of climate change, governments that have a major impact on global warming glide to the Shuffle's delay step. As witnessed at the disappointing Glasgow climate change summit (COP26) last November, many countries are simply not prepared to make firm commitments on needed actions with timetables.An important reason why many governments perform the Climate Change Shuffle is the demand for electricity and the reliance on coal-fired power stations to meet that rising demand. The top four countries, namely, China, India, the United States, and Japan, were responsible for 76 percent of the world's coal-fired electricity in 2020 (Figure 2).With its 1,110 coal-fired power stations, China alone accounted for approximately 53 percent of the world's coal-fired electricity in 2020 and those power stations provided 61 percent of China's electricity. Following China but at a considerably lower level is India, which is responsible for 14 percent of the world's coal-fired electricity with its coal-fired power stations providing 71 percent of India's electricity.In third and fourth place are the United States and Japan, which accounted for 11 and 9 percent, respectively of the world's coal-fired electricity in 2020. However, in contrast to China and India, the contributions of the coal-fired power stations to domestic electricity consumption in the U.S. and Japan are substantially less, 19 and 29 percent, respectively.Another important reason why some governments continue doing the Shuffle is because climate change has become a highly partisan issue. With climate change becoming a contentious issue contributing to political paralysis, few elected governments are able to adopt the necessary legislation and implement the needed actions to address climate change.In the United States, for example, 139 elected officials in the 117th Congress continue to deny the scientific consensus of human-caused climate change. Also, Democratic and Republican voters in the U.S. are far apart in their views regarding climate change.Whereas 78 percent of Democrats said climate change should be a top priority in 2020, 21 percent of Republicans said it should be. Moreover, the gap between them has widened over the past several years, with increasing proportions of Democrats saying climate change should be a top priority (Figure 3).When faced with the unequivocal scientific evidence about climate change and the lack of needed actions, some observers, organizations, and funds have increased their efforts to urge governments to adopt the needed climate change policies.However, others, including many students, have become incredibly worried by years of empty promises by political leaders and are pessimistic about the outlook for future.They note that a quarter century ago when world population was nearly 6 billion, government leaders gathered in Kyoto, Japan, and agreed to curb greenhouse emissions. Seven years ago, when world population had reached more than 7 billion, governments adopted the Paris Agreement's vision of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees. And today with world population at 8 billion and expected to reach 9 billion in 15 years, few nations are living up to their commitments.Also, others have become fatalistic about global warming as they witness a rapidly closing window to secure a livable future as governments dance the Climate Change Shuffle. Additional scientific studies, they feel, will make little difference in the near certain outcomes. They are convinced that governments will not be able to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. With direct and clear language, many have simply concluded: ""we're screwed"".In sum, whether one is optimistic, pessimistic, fatalistic, or indifferent regarding climate change and the responses of governments, three conclusions seem warranted.First, the widely reported scientific evidence and findings of published reports on human-induced climate change and its far-reaching effects worldwide are clear, unequivocal, indisputable, and distressing.Second, countries will continue to experience the consequences of climate change with serious disruptions to the planet's natural environment and severe adverse effects on human populations, including flooding, droughts, heat waves, shortages of water and food, warming oceans, storms, rising sea levels, wildfires, and melting glaciers and polar ice caps.Third, until governments are fully committed to taking the needed actions to address climate change, which does not appear likely any time soon, government officials will continue to dance the Climate Change Shuffle, i.e., deny, delay, and do nothing.Joseph Chamie is a consulting demographer, a former director of the United Nations Population Division and author of numerous publications on population issues, including his recent book, ""Births, Deaths, Migrations and Other Important Population Matters.""\l"

SA has requested that the facility include grant financing as well as substantial concessional debt financing from development finance institutions.The proposal is for a facility at government level and would raise funds for three sectors: the power sector, where the decommissioning and repurposing of some Eskom power stations and investment in transmission are required; support for the shift to the manufacture of electric vehicles; and the development of a green hydrogen production strategy.The envoys, led by the UK's COP envoy John Murton, on Tuesday met minister of the environment, forestry & fisheries Barbara Creecy; public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan; minister of trade, industry & competition Ebrahim Patel; and deputy ministers of finance David Masondo and of international relations & co-operation Alvin Botes.In a statement, Creecy said SA's more ambitious commitment to mitigating greenhouse gases, endorsed by the cabinet and contained in the nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, ""required an equally ambitious multilateral commitment of financial support by developed countries"" for a just transition.The ""just energy transition"" refers to the need to shift away from fossil fuels in a way that communities and workers who have depended on it for their livelihoods are not left stranded.""We need certainty and predictability of the quantum of financing available to us, to accelerate this transition. We do need an irrevocable agreement that we can sign at COP26 where our commitments, as all parties, are clear.""SA's just transition requires substantial concessional and grant funding and technical assistance, which takes into account fiscal constraints and supports government's quest to promote long-term financial sustainability,"" said Creecy.The delegation ""commended SA on its revised and ambitious nationally determined contribution"" and ""agreed to revert on issues ... raised in the meeting"".Experts from all parties are to form a technical team to work towards an agreement.Eskom has been in talks with overseas development finance institutions for several months in the hope that it can secure concessional finance.

Typically, a company's effect on the environment and the communities in which it operates is not captured in its financial reports. Similarly, governance principles, such as thorough board-level oversight to ensure operational integrity, have been neglected. A growing global movement is allocating considerable effort towards ensuring that ESG performance becomes a key criterion through which companies in all industries attain access to responsible finance.\~ESG factors have affected a range of industries; the extractives industry in particular has deep and unique ESG risks that are proving challenging to address. However, the ruling to stop Shell from continuing with its seismic exploration survey off the Wild Coast has shown that ESG matters significantly, because it will increasingly form part of the external legal constraints to which companies are subject. For this reason, and because ESG makes inherent business sense, it should be taken seriously in companies' decision-making processes.\~Shell judgmentThe Shell judgment forms part of a series of significant decisions at home and abroad, such as the HYPERLINK http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPPHC/2018/829.htmlXolobeni case in the Eastern Cape in South Africa and HYPERLINK https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2018-0068-judgment.pdfOkpabi case in the Niger Delta in Nigeria.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa260","Time to deliver on water promises","November 18, 2021 Thursday","The Herald (South Africa)","There is a common denominator between the recent local government elections and the climate change summit held in Glasgow, COP26 - both occurrences delivered promises and intentions to improve the lives of people for the better. But pundits from both political and environmental fields have cautioned that it is actions that count and make a difference, as people affected by lacklustre delivery of services and climate change effects have had enough with promises. During the local government elections in SA politicians criss-crossed the country, making pronouncements that they would take steps to correct the current wrongs and introduce measures to improve service delivery at the local sphere of government. They all promised one thing, a better life for all, but differed on the ""how"" part of their promises. In the UK, various leaders from the Seychelles, Barbados, India, France, Liberia, Malawi and the US and environmentalists all made fundamental speeches with different contexts but a singular message in the ultimate - that of dealing with climate change to save the planet. As some would often argue, rightfully so, people do not eat speeches and perpetual promises, people need a palpable sense of urgency from the powers-that-be to provide efficient services. At the heart of promises made on the local government election campaign trail was the provision of a reliable water supply for all. It is a fact that has been acknowledged by our government that even though strides have been made to deal with the backlog of water provision to communities, there are still communities that do not have access to a clean and reliable water supply. This is an achilles heel for a government that has had to contend with many competing needs of communities in this country with a growing population. Though access to clean water has increased, Stats SA reveals that about 3.1% of households still fetched water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools, dams, wells and springs in 2019. It is worth noting that SA remains one of the driest countries in the world, with intermittent rain patterns. Another factor is the increasing demand for water and population growth. However, the biggest elephant in the room is our own shortcomings as government that needs a palpable sense of urgency to address the ideals espoused in our National Development Plan Vision 2030 and National Water and Sanitation Master Plan among others. We need people who will wear their hearts on their sleeves in addressing the structural problems the country has. The dilapidating infrastructure that needs proper operations and maintenance needs to be prioritised. This is one of the biggest challenges facing local government. While we are a water-scarce country, the amount of water that we lose due to leakages is enormous and this needs to stop. We need to end water leaks if we are to address water shortages in this country. We need to improve on our turnaround times and treat this with the urgency it deserves because we cannot expect people to fix their taps at home when we can't do the same to stop the loss of this precious and scarce resource. Minister Senzo Mchunu, in his provincial working sessions that he has been undertaking since taking office in August, has decried the amount of time we take to fix problems and complete projects, saying that we need to work together in a more co-ordinated manner. Mchunu has said that his department will work together with municipalities, assist them where they are struggling with capacity issues to ensure that there is no pointing of fingers between national and local government when communities do not have water. As the new councils are settling in, inducted and about to get on with the business of the day for the next five-year term of office, they need to understand the needs of their communities and take them along in a transparent manner. The problem can be over-promising and delivering little, and this leads ultimately to all sorts of problems such as service delivery protest and vandalism. The leaders at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow said ""we are digging our own graves"" by not acting on the promises they made at all other summits. This resonates with the water sector as the municipalities prepare to go about their business in this term. Should those in power not act on the promises they made of ensuring access to water for those they represent, they are digging their graves.

The proposal is for a facility at government level and would raise funds for three sectors: the power sector, where the decommissioning and repurposing of some Eskom power stations and investment in transmission are required; support for the shift to the manufacture of electric vehicles; and the development of a green hydrogen production strategy. The envoys, led by the UK's COP envoy John Murton, on Tuesday met minister of the environment, forestry & fisheries Barbara Creecy; public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan; minister of trade, industry & competition Ebrahim Patel; and deputy ministers of finance David Masondo and of international relations & co-operation Alvin Botes. In a statement, Creecy said SA's more ambitious commitment to mitigating greenhouse gases, endorsed by the cabinet and contained in the nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, ""required an equally ambitious multilateral commitment of financial support by developed countries"" for a just transition. The ""just energy transition"" refers to the need to shift away from fossil fuels in a way that communities and workers who have depended on it for their livelihoods are not left stranded. ""We need certainty and predictability of the quantum of financing available to us, to accelerate this transition. We do need an irrevocable agreement that we can sign at COP26 where our commitments, as all parties, are clear. ""SA's just transition requires substantial concessional and grant funding and technical assistance, which takes into account fiscal constraints and supports government's quest to promote long-term financial sustainability,"" said Creecy. The delegation ""commended SA on its revised and ambitious nationally determined contribution"" and ""agreed to revert on issues ... raised in the meeting"". Experts from all parties are to form a technical team to work towards an agreement.

The ruling sent shock waves around the world; it was the first time a company had been legally obliged to align its climate action policies with those of the Paris Accord, according to Friends of the Earth.The environmental group had brought the case on behalf of six other bodies and 17,000 Dutch citizens. At the time, Shell said it would appeal against what it called a ""disappointing ruling"".What is disappointing for us is that this company seems to have not learnt anything from this episode, given its behaviour elsewhere in the world. Environmental groups here at home are aghast at plans by Shell, with the support of the department of energy & mineral resources, to embark on a major seismic survey off the coast between Morgans Bay and Port St Johns. The concern is that the exercise will place marine life in grave danger. All of this in search of oil and gas reserves.Blasting 220 decibels into waters rich with marine life, including fish, occasional whales and other seafood resources, is bad. Shell is making use of an existing exploration licence granted in 2013 by the department of energy.We find it curious that a government department would continue to endorse this environmentally disastrous exploration, which, if successful, will uncover more fossil fuels. Barbara Creecy, the minister of forestry, fisheries & the environment, has just come back from a successful COP26 in Glasgow, where SA made commitments to gradually dump fossil fuels.The question to ask the government is, does the right hand know what the left hand is doing?Express Petroleum, a leading Eastern Cape fuel supplier, is de-branding 35 of its stations from Shell as a form of protest.

It plans to expand by opening another fund in the coming years that will target other infrastructure projects.""The AWS project, which was completed ahead of schedule, proves that we can deliver on these projects that have massive returns and facilitate economic transformation,"" said Mupita.The sisters, both chartered accountants, have experience in private equity, asset management and advisory, with Mupita having been a portfolio manager at Old Mutual's Infrastructure Development and Environmental Asset Fund.The Mahlako Energy Fund (MEF) is managed by Mahlako Financial Services. Mupita said the investment company wants to be part of the growth of the South African infrastructure industry that will lead to economic transformation.Mahlako is also keen to participate in the ""just transition"" programme, which has an $8.5bn (about R130bn) commitment from the US, the UK and other countries. The commitment is aimed at helping SA transition to clean energy.SA is the world's 12th-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and relies on coal for more than 80% of its power. The transition to clean energy will include investments in renewable energy projects and areas such as electric vehicles and green hydrogen.""With the recent announcement by the South African government at COP26 to accelerate investment in renewable energy and other sectors, we are committed to contributing towards SA's just transition goals to using cleaner forms of energy,"" said Mhlarhi, who is the fund principal of the MEF and executive director of Mahlako Financial Services.Last week, the MEF announced the commercial launch of the 10MW AWS solar plant in Khathu, which will supply renewable energy to AWS data centres.The solar project is expected to generate up to 28,000MWh a year, which is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of more than 8,000 average South African homes.Mupita says the AWS project uses technology that has never been used in SA before. The solar photovoltaic panels track the sun throughout the day, absorbing irradiance from the sky and reflected light from the ground.""We want to transform the energy sector and the infrastructure sector as a whole as we believe we can't grow South Africa without improving infrastructure,"" said Mupita.Mahlako owns 45% of the solar project.""Historically, black women have been critically underrepresented in infrastructure, agriculture and utility ownership. Energy projects that enable black investment are our surest way to a just transition to renewable energy,"" said Mhlarhi.Mupita said raising funds remains a challenge but as the market for renewable energy opens up more, she hopes that funders will follow.Simon Nicholas, energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis, said recently that funding such as that announced at COP26 could help to attract further private investment in South African companies, accelerate the development of new technologies and drive down the cost of green technologies.""This could clearly be of huge benefit to South Africa given the economy's current dependence on unreliable coal-fired power plants producing power that is increasingly expensive for consumers. Actions that accelerate the energy transition are a boost to the economic outlook and hence a boost to the employment outlook,"" he said.During construction the AWS project created 167 jobs. ""The project contributed to the province's economic development during the building phase and will over its lifetime sustain permanent jobs in electrical maintenance, operation and security,"" said Mhlarhi. Globally, Amazon has ambitious plans to cut its carbon footprint and aims to be using only renewable energy to power its operations within four years.According to the company, last year it became the world's largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, with 65% of its energy needs - 10GW - met by more than 230 renewable energy projects around the world.Makole Mupita and Meta Mhlarhi, founders of Mahlako Financial Services.

Many will be looking to the future with a sense of uncertainty and trepidation, but, while there is no crystal ball to predict what the year ahead holds, there are certain themes likely to play a fundamental role in shaping the financial and investment environment for 2022 and beyond. Three trends are likely to be relevant to how we think about and manage our financial affairs. These are a clear shift in the interest rate environment; the impact of climate change on big business and investor sentiment; and technology, including how digital is disrupting conventional business. An unprecedented low interest rate environment looks set to change in the year ahead. The SA Reserve Bank recently increased the repo rate by 0,25%, the first interest rate hike in three years. Those who have capitalised on the previously low interest environment by taking out significant gearing in the form of bonds or loans will experience the pinch on higher repayments. Conversely, increased rates present a good opportunity to increase savings. Climate change is starting to have a direct impact on business, investment funds and investor sentiment.COP26 Summit in Glasgow, illustrates how central tackling the climate crisis has become for mainstream business. The principles of ESG - environmental, social and governance - are driving tangible and material changes to the way corporates do business. Investors are becoming increasingly discerning, avoiding laggards to the green economy. The collective power of the consumer (and investor) will be a compelling force. The third trend is the growing role digital technology, big data and artificial intelligence is playing in disrupting conventional business.

But opinions on the summit's success are polarised.-We owe a profound gratitude to the developing nations including those from Africa - who agreed to the pact. In doing so, they chose not to insist that richer developed nations, whose historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions have largely caused the climate crisis, pay reparations to them for the damage they ve inflicted. African nations continue to hold the unenviable position of being disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. Although the continent accounts for the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions - only 3.8% - it s already heating faster than the rest of the world. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/223831.htmlhttps://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/223831.html :EMBED-->And if the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels is missed, Africa could be facing catastrophic temperature increases of up to 3 degrees Celcius by 2050. At the same time, the threat to GDP of African nations that are most vulnerable to these changes meaning the amount of economic activity that stands to be lost if these changes are severe enough - is projected to increase from \£3660bn in 2018 to over \£31tn in 2023. That s almost half of the continent s projected GDP. -Given these estimates, Africa s climate resilience must exceed the global norm. And some steps are being taken to protect the continent against the worst climate consequences through investments from national governments and the private sector. Organisations such as the African Development Bank and the UN Environment Programme are also leading climate change adaptation measures, like working to protect mangroves on over 200 million hectares of land. However, the estimated yearly cost of this kind of climate adaptation for developing nations is around \£352bn - and is expected to rise to between \£3100bn to \£3220bn by 2030. While developed nations agreed in the Glasgow pact to double climate change contributions to their developing counterparts by about \£329bn by 2025, this amount is just a fraction of what s needed. Next stepsOne way to close this gap could be to leverage the Paris climate agreement, specifically, a subsection of article six that allows countries with high emissions, such as the US and UK, to offset them through investing in sustainable initiatives like reforestation in low-emitting countries: including those in Africa. Such partnerships could act as a catalyst for the growth of low carbon energy projects such as solar, geothermal and wind power. Another option could be to redirect local government money towards sustainable schemes. The total amount provided by African national governments in fossil fuel subsidies rose to \£355bn in 2015 alone, causing calls for phasing down these subsidies to be enshrined in the Glasgow climate pact. -Since subsidy money was flowing into an industry employing less than 1% of Africa s workforce, it could instead be invested back into African economies, creating inclusive, environmentally friendly job opportunities. For example, it might be used to fund startups like Gjenge Makers: a Kenyan business making paving blocks and tiles out of recycled plastic.Despite contributing the least to the changing climate, many African nations are also taking strides to transition to renewable energy. The world s largest concentrated solar power (CSP) facility in Morocco, Noor Power Plant, converts the Sun s energy to electricity for around two million households.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/223539.html :EMBED--> Unlike more widely used photovoltaic panels, CSP enables solar energy to be stored for nights and cloudy days. The facility generates more than a third of Morocco s power while reducing carbon emissions by around 690,000 tonnes per year. Projects like these don t just create more jobs, they also make more money. Up to \£3236bn of new business opportunities that aim to climate-proof food and land systems - including preserving local forest ecosystems and restoring degraded landscapes - could be added each year to Africa s economies between now and 2030.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The proposed new legislation is meant to fast-track the country's transition to a greener economy and comes weeks before the UN's climate change conference known as COP26, where the country is likely to attract attention as Africa's biggest source of greenhouse gases and the world's 12th largest. It seeks to give effect to SA's international climate change commitment and comes a month after the cabinet approved the revised climate change target for submission to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, a body tasked with stabilising greenhouse gas emissions. SA's new target - known as nationally determined contributions - is for annual greenhouse emissions to be kept at between 371 and 420 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. To achieve that broader goal, the bill proposes a higher carbon tax rate for businesses that fail to reduce emissions. The current carbon tax rate is R120/tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. This rate will increase annually by inflation plus 2% until 2022, and annually by inflation thereafter. The bill proposes that entities be allocated ""carbon budgets"", which they will not be allowed to exceed. Where the carbon budget for any period under review is exceeded, that entity will be subject to a higher carbon tax rate than is currently set. The department of forestry, fisheries and the environment, where the proposed legislation is housed, says the Treasury will determine the tax rate for heavy polluters. The IMF has previously stated that a carbon tax is the best way to cut emissions, as it allows for a reduction in energy consumption, favours cleaner energies and provides much-needed revenues, which could be used to finance sustainable and more inclusive growth. But a counter-argument is that an additional tax increases the cost of doing business and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. Raymond Parsons of the North West University Business School said any proposals for raising existing carbon taxes will need to be fitted into SA's overall tax policy and must be treated with caution. ""New global research from Canada and Europe has warned about the inflationary impact of carbon taxes."" Parsons said, however, that the draft bill takes SA's debate and decision-making about climate change to the next level. ""The commitments SA makes on the climate change front will have important socioeconomic consequences and there are difficult trade-offs still to be managed. ""Apart from how the 'just transition' to a greener economy in SA is to be financed, there are other key structural economic adaptations that will need to be carefully handled,"" he said. Parsons said the proposed climate change legislation must create an acceptable framework that encourages honest, realistic climate and energy policies that can be well managed and are affordable. ""The proposed approach in the bill will need to be tested against sound economic criteria by all key stakeholders, especially on the eve of COP26,"" Parsons said.

A 45% drop will avoid 1.5 heating and 25% will avoid a global heating of 2 (which is Paris Agreement aligned, while 1.5 is what scientists say we should be aiming for.) Scientists say every degree of warming makes a difference in the severity of climate change.\~\~All climate action is, however, not equal. This is particularly true for climate diplomacy at a level of the UN, where people's capacity to adjust to existing and future harm from climate change takes a back seat.\~Why the adaptation talks must be central\~Climate change is not gender-neutral and that existing inequalities have left women and girls more vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change.\~When women farmers in KwaZulu-Natal take part in training to learn new ways of dealing with droughts, they are essentially learning to adapt to climate change.\~One such adaptation project is happening in the Mkuze River ecosystem.

The current carbon tax rate is R120/tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. This rate will increase annually by inflation plus 2% until 2022, and annually by inflation thereafter.The bill proposes that entities be allocated ""carbon budgets"", which they will not be allowed to exceed.Where the carbon budget for any period under review is exceeded, that entity will be subject to a higher carbon tax rate than is currently set.The department of forestry, fisheries and the environment, where the proposed legislation is housed, says the Treasury will determine the tax rate for heavy polluters.The IMF has previously stated that a carbon tax is the best way to cut emissions, as it allows for a reduction in energy consumption, favours cleaner energies and provides much-needed revenues, which could be used to finance sustainable and more inclusive growth.But a counter-argument is that an additional tax increases the cost of doing business and, by extension, the cost of goods and services.Raymond Parsons of the North West University Business School said any proposals for raising existing carbon taxes will need to be fitted into SA's overall tax policy and must be treated with caution.""New global research from Canada and Europe has warned about the inflationary impact of carbon taxes.""Parsons said, however, that the draft bill takes SA's debate and decision-making about climate change to the next level.""The commitments SA makes on the climate change front will have important socioeconomic consequences and there are difficult trade-offs still to be managed. Apart from how the 'just transition' to a greener economy in SA is to be financed, there are other key structural economic adaptations that will need to be carefully handled,"" he said.Parsons said the proposed climate change legislation must create an acceptable framework that encourages honest, realistic climate and energy policies that can be well managed and are affordable. ""The proposed approach in the bill will need to be tested against sound economic criteria by all key stakeholders, especially on the eve of COP26,"" Parsons said.phakathib@businesslive.co.zaR120per tonne is the current carbon tax rate2%plus inflation is the rate at which the existing tax rises per year until 2022\l"

Animal agriculture is the second-largest global emitter of CO2.  Each year, 88 billion animals are raised and then slaughtered for food consumption.  Intensive livestock farming is responsible for 14.5-16.5% of the world\' s human-made greenhouse gas emissions, exceeding emission levels from global transport combined, said Pfabigan.Pfabigan said it was now or never for global leaders to come together and ensure the implementation of fundamental changes that were needed to confront the challenges of the climate emergency, with animal welfare and animal agriculture front and centre of the debate.ProVeg SA director Donovan Will agreed that animal agriculture needed attention.He said its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced almost immediately by the public simply choosing to eat more plant-based food and products \- individuals could reduce their total carbon footprints by up to half through this mitigation strategy. The easiest and fastest mitigation strategy, and one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions is not on the agenda at . Governments around the world are failing to bring about the changes needed, and they are failing to even talk about one of the best mitigation strategies we have.

So far, it has not seen the light of day.The study, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, showed more than 5,000 South Africans die annually in the country s coal belt because the government has failed to enforce its own air quality standards.Of the world s most pollutedSouth Africa's coal industry, the world's fifth largest, employs 90,000 miners, generates 80% of the country's electricity, and supplies the feedstock for about a quarter of the country's liquid fuel for vehicles, all at a time of soaring unemployment and frequent blackouts.But the costs of a mammoth coal industry are also high, and not just for the climate.South Africa's coal belt is blanketed in smog and coal ash; the stink of sulphur pervades.The area east of Johannesburg is among the world's most polluted, experts say, rivalling Beijing and New Delhi.Health impactIn 2017, British air pollution expert Mike Holland calculated that the health impacts from Eskom's emissions alone cost South Africa $2.37bn every year, more than Eskom's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation.For local Emalahleni mother, Mbali Matabule the impact of coal has been severely traumatic for her and her daughter, Princess.In May 2018, as she approached her fourth birthday, Princess started struggling to breathe. Matabule rushed her to the hospital, where a doctor put a mask on Princess's face attached to a nebuliser.Matabule was shocked to find out that Princess had asthma. Three years later, Matabule lives in constant fear that her daughter will not survive the disease.""I get very concerned because I feel like my child won't live for a long time because of these mines - that really worries me. It means any time she could die because of her situation,"" she says, tearfully.A doctor who practices in the coal mine town told Reuters that respiratory diseases are very common amongst adults and children because of the pollution they are exposed to on a daily basis.""Most of the doctors around, we have sort of become experts in treating allergic rhinitis and asthma simply because there's so much of it. And I also mention the fact that one could say it's environmental,"" Dr Alexis Mashifane says.Smog released from burning coal is laced with chemicals like sulphur and nitrogen oxides, mercury and lead, and radioactive elements like uranium and thorium.Saving 5,125 livesA 2019 Council for Scientific and Industrial Research CSIR) study obtained by Reuters concluded that 5,125 lives could be saved every year in the coal belt by enforcing national air quality standards on soot, otherwise known as particulate matter.The air in Emalahleni, it said, contains around 20% more particulate matter than the nation's limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre, and more than three times more than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).COP26As the United Nations (UN) climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow gets underway this month, coal, the most carbon-intensive energy source, is in the crosshairs of a global push to replace it with cleaner fuels.South Africa is the world's 12th largest greenhouse gas emitter, according to the non-profit Global Carbon Atlas.This water-stressed country also stands to be one of the big losers from climate change.Temperatures in southern Africa are rising twice as fast as the global average, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, pushing the region's north-western deserts south.Eskom s green pushIn an effort to secure foreign investment, Eskom is pitching a $10bn plan to shut most of its coal-fired plants by 2050 and embrace renewables. Few countries have as much harvestable sun and wind energy as South Africa.Eskom's green push, however, has put the company in conflict with Energy Minister, Gwede Mantashe, who has called ditching coal ""economic suicide.""""These power stations do not have the pollution control mechanisms on because they were developed in the old apartheid system.

That's probably because, although the intervention has followed the contours of a modern land war, it has also marked a break with the past in a number of ways. The world has become used to military interventions by the United States. This is, however, not a US intervention. That in itself is a surprise - one that has befuddled reporters and pundits alike.Even as we deplore the violence and the loss of life in Ukraine resulting from the Russian intervention (and the neofascist violence in the Donbas), it is valuable to step back and look at how the rest of the world may perceive this conflict, starting with the West's ethnocentric interest in an attack whose participants and victims they believe they share aspects of identity with - whether related to culture, religion, or skin colour.White warsWar in Ukraine joins a sequence of wars that have opened sores on a very fragile planet. Wars in Africa and Asia seem endless, and some of them are rarely commented upon with any feeling in media outlets across the world or in the cascade of posts found on social media platforms.\~For example, the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which HYPERLINK https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/monuc/background.shtmlstarted in 1996 and which has resulted in millions of casualties, has not elicited the kind of sympathy from the world now seen during the reporting on Ukraine. In contrast, the startlingly frank comments from political leaders and journalists during the conflict in Ukraine have revealed the grip of racism on the imaginations of these shapers of public opinion.It was impossible recently to get major global media outlets interested in HYPERLINK https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/09/rwandas-military-is-the-french-proxy-on-african-soil/the conflict in Cabo DelgadoCOP26, I told a group of oil company executives about this intervention - which I had covered for HYPERLINK https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/09/rwandas-military-is-the-french-proxy-on-african-soil/Globetrotter - and one of them responded with precise accuracy: ""You're right about what you say, but no one cares.""No one, which is to say the political forces in the North Atlantic states, cares about the suffering of children in Africa and Asia. They are, however, gripped by the war in Ukraine, which should grip them, which distresses all of us, but which should not be allowed to be seen as worse than other conflicts taking place across the globe that are much more brutal and are likely to slip out of everyone's memory due to the lack of interest and attention given by world leaders and media outlets to them.Charlie D'Agata of CBS News HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3eDZean39ssaid that Ukraine ""isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilised, relatively European - I have to choose those words carefully, too - city, where you wouldn't expect that, or hope that ... [a conflict] is going to happen."" Clearly, these are the things one expects to see in Kabul (Afghanistan) or Baghdad (Iraq) or Goma (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), but not in a ""relatively civilised, relatively European"" city in Ukraine. If these are things that one expects in the former cities respectively, then there is very little need to be particularly outraged by the violence that is witnessed in these cities.You would not expect such violence in Ukraine, HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQ392yepF0said the country's deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, to the BBC, because of the kind of people who were caught in the crossfire: ""European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed every day."" Sakvarelidze considers the Ukrainians to be Europeans, although D'Agata calls them ""relatively European"".\~But they are certainly not African or Asian, people who - if you think carefully about what is being said here - certain world leaders and international media outlets expect to be killed by the violence unleashed against them by the global great powers and by the weapons sold to the local thugs in these regions by these great powers.Worst war?On 23 February 23, United Nations secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres - in a heartfelt statement about the Russian military intervention in Ukraine - HYPERLINK said, ""In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century.""

Fascism, C\'e9saire wrote, is the colonial experiment brought back to Europe.When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, neither the UN secretary general nor the president of the European Commission came forward to make any immediate condemnation of that war. Both international institutions went along with the war, allowing the destruction of Iraq, which resulted in the death of HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-deaths-survey/iraq-conflict-has-killed-a-million-iraqis-survey-idUSL3048857920080130more than a million people.\~In 2004, a year into the US war on Iraq, after reports of grave violations of human rights (including by Amnesty International on HYPERLINK torture in the prison of Abu Ghraib) came to light, then UN secretary general Kofi Annan HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2004/09/115352-lessons-iraq-war-underscore-importance-un-charter-annancalled the war ""illegal"". In 2006, three years after the war had begun, Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who had been the president of the European Commission in 2003, HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/19/world/europe/19italy.htmlcalled the war a ""grave error.""In the case of the Russian intervention, these institutions rushed to condemn the war, which is all very well; but does this mean that they will be just as quick to condemn the US when it starts its next bombing campaign?War stenographyPeople often ask me, what's the most reliable news outlet? This is a hard question to answer these days, because Western news outlets are increasingly becoming stenographers of their governments (with the racist attitudes of the reporters on full display more and more often, making the apologies that come later hardly comforting). State-sponsored outlets in Russia and China now increasingly find themselves banned on social media sites. Anyone who counters Washington's narrative is dismissed as irrelevant, and these fringe voices find it hard to develop an audience.So-called cancel culture demonstrates its limits.

He ""misspoke"", they might say, but this is a Freudian slip.Calculations of warWars are ugly, especially wars of aggression. The role of the reporter is to explain why a country goes to war, particularly an unprovoked war. If this were 1941, I might try to explain the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II or the Japanese assumption that the Nazis would soon defeat the Soviets and then take the war across the Atlantic Ocean. But the Soviets held out, saving the world from fascism.\~In the same way, the Russian attack on Ukraine requires explanation: the roots of it go deep to various political and foreign policy developments, such as the post-Soviet emergence of ethnic nationalism along the spine of Eastern Europe, the eastward advance of US power - through Nato - toward the Russian border, and the turbulent relationship between the major European states and their eastern neighbours (including Russia).

These are designed to deeply reduce carbon emissions while satisfying socioeconomic objectives.Steel is essential for the functioning of our society and economy. It is the world's largest materials industry, generating annual turnover of $1-trillion.Most primary steel demand will come from the construction of new transport, energy and urban infrastructure, much of which is required to meet the global sustainable development goals. This demand will not be met from recycled steel, so vast quantities of primary iron will be required.However, the researchers point out that current processes to manufacture primary steel ""produce the most emissions of all heavy industry sectors"" at between 2 gigatonnes (Gt) and 3.6Gt ""amounting to 5.6%-10% of global combustion and process CO2 emissions"".This is where SA has a strong competitive advantage, in the form of abundant renewable energy and hydrogen potential allied to rich iron ore stocks and relatively well-developed infrastructure, much of which has been used in the past to drive the country's industrialisation.As you are aware, SA also faces an imminent decl"

But the failure of governments to make sufficient (and binding) commitments should not stop the private sector changing its production patterns to become more sustainable.Indeed, companies are embracing environmental, social & governance (ESG) imperatives and incorporating them into their decision-making. Some have seen ESG performance as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine capitalism, using the power of markets to tackle some of the most pressing issues of our time. It is indeed an opportunity for companies to incorporate long-term value creation and stakeholder engagement into their calculus for success and profitability.Integrating ESG performance as a criterion for accessing capital portends a potential seismic systemic shift in how markets operate. In short, ESG promises to advance enlightened self-interest, rescind short-termism and fix the planet; all while companies continue making profits.However, the ESG debate is far from settled, and there has been mounting backlash from both regulators and activists. For instance, Tariq Fancy, who was involved in the initial propagation of the ESG idea while chief investment officer for sustainability at BlackRock, the biggest global asset manager, now criticises its operationalisation. In late August Fancy wrote a series of articles titled ""Diaries of a 'Sustainable Investor"", criticising ESG as a dangerous placebo harming the public interest, and a way for companies to avoid regulation. By marketing ESG to solve systemic issues, companies can avoid regulations such as higher taxes and even carbon tax. Similarly, Robert Armstrong of the Financial Times has openly opposed ESG, calling it a dangerous distraction. Armstrong points out that an investment in a low-carbon exchange-traded fund does not have much potential for any ameliorative effect on climate change. Aswath Damodaran posits that ESG is a mistake that will cost companies and investors money while making the world worse off. For Damodaran, ESG stands to enrich consultants and bankers while reducing shareholder power. To this end, corporate executives and fund managers and not individuals become experts of value systems.The first big criticism of the ESG obsession is that ESG ratings of fund managers tend to differ in accordance with the secret sauce used to develop ratings. A Washington Post article comparing ESG fund ratings for companies (ExxonMobil, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway) illustrates this.The ratings and scores are often difficult to understand due to a lack of clarity in the underpinning methodologies. Disclosures are unregulated, and the data informing ESG scores is difficult to understand going from one ESG fund to another. ESG funds decide for themselves how ESG criteria will factor in their makeup. This lack of standardisation and easily understandable metrics confuses investors as they do not know how the proverbial ESG sausage is made.Fancy argues that ESG scores can be a type of corporate virtue-signalling without substance, while evaluating sustainability criteria across fund managers is a challenge for investors. Some rating systems grade a company's stated commitment to ESG principles even where there is no evident action to bestow credibility on those intentions.Adherence to ESG becomes tantamount to a marketing strategy to attract green capital without genuine execution. In other words, it is easier (and profitable) for companies to present themselves as supporting ESG for the potential capital that can be gained rather than for genuine commitment to ESG performance. Armstrong and Fancy also suggest a misalignment of time horizons. Fund managers are motivated by earnings from quarterly management fees while systemic ESG issues such as climate change, poverty, and wealth inequality require longer timel"

The legal authority to do the survey is old, dating back to 2013, and critics say the department of mineral resources and energy has failed to heed scientists' warnings that such exploration could wreak havoc on marine life. The impact on whales and dolphins of the seismic ""pulses"" used in such surveys - 220 decibel explosions fired every 10 seconds for four months by 36 or more air guns - reportedly ""could include physiological injury, behavioural avoidance of seismic survey areas, masking of environmental sounds and communication and indirect impacts due to effects of prey"". This hardly accords with growing awareness of the need to preserve the natural environment and it is little wonder that in a matter of days more than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling on forestry, fisheries and environment minister Barbara Creecy to intervene. Activists are, meanwhile, poised to take legal action. It is understandable the department was intrigued by the possibility of finding ""black gold"" in the sea bed, a development which could be an energy game-changer. SA, similarly, needs to focus on a green energy quest. Environmentalists have asked Creecy to use her powers in terms of the National Environmental Management Act to halt the survey, pending a full investigation. However, the minister says she can't intervene because authority for exploration came from minister Gwede Mantashe's minerals and energy department. Surely the two ministers, who serve in the same cabinet, talk. This sounds like a convenient way of ducking a burning issue. What the point is of SA attending COP26 and then in a matter of weeks pursuing oil exploration at the expense of the province's unique marine heritage, is hard to understand. Shell's exploration vessel is expected to arrive in Cape Town this weekend, after which it will make its way to the Wild Coast. This means the matter is urgent and we urge both Creecy and Mantashe to pay attention to the legitimate concerns expressed by diverse groupings, ranging from international environmental activists to local residents who depend on this coastl"

The meeting heard that the emerging markets require an estimated $3-4tn annually in low-carbon investments over the next 15 years in order to operationalise and implement the current round of updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and then to prepare a second updated NDC in 2025, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment said on Tuesday, 27 July.NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.As part of the Paris outcome, developed countries were urged to scale-up their level of support with a concrete roadmap to achieve the goal of mobilising $100bn per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. With regard [to] the $100bn [by] 2020 and through to 2025, [Creecy] stressed that it is imperative from the perspective of restoring and maintaining trust and transparency that the Conference of the Parties (COP) assess whether the goal of mobilising jointly $100bn has been achieved, the department said.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/218142.html :EMBED-->Laying the groundwork for successThe July ministerial meeting brought climate and environment ministers and representatives from more than 50 countries together to lay the groundwork for success ahead of November s Glasgow COP26 negotiations on climate change.The event marks the first face-to-face ministerial of its kind in more than 18 months.The topics under discussion included the global goal on adaptation and scaling up efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change, keeping 1.5\'b0C alive, loss and damage caused by climate change, focus on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and mobilising climate finance.The minister stressed that for the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow to be relevant, responsive and successful, they need ambition and progression on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/218306.html :EMBED-->Enabling practical progress South Africa envisages an outcome at COP26 on adaptation that will enable practical progress, including launching a formal programme of work on the operationalisation of the global goal on adaptation.

It was acknowledged that while much of the debates revolved around commitments aimed at limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5\'baC, climate change was already causing devastating losses of lives, land and livelihoods.Uncontrolled disaster wildland fires have been one of the most visible negative impacts of climate change on a global scale. It is intriguing, but not surprising, to note that recent disaster fires have been occurring in South Africa with increasing regularity. The present trajectory of climate change suggests that much worst is yet to come, even as the fire emergency services in many parts of the country struggle to meet the demand for their services. However, a glimmer of hope emerges from the gloom of the litany of failed and failing state structures and SOEs. The government-funded Working on Fire (WoF) programme, part of the broader Expanded Public Works Programmes, has grown over the past 18 years to become a globally recognised wildland fire-fighting force. This programme is clearly one of the undersold success stories in government\' s EPWP initiatives.Indeed, since its inception in 2003, WoF dispatch, aerial resources, ground teams and vehicles have always been the major components of combating disaster fires in South Africa. The WoF personnel, vehicles and aerial resources have been the major component of the firefighting resources in these disaster fires.Moreover, Working on Fire has also had the distinction of carrying the South African flag high in international deployments to Chile, Indonesia and on four occasions to Canada. In its last deployment to Manitoba, Canada, in August-September, the Manitoba Minister for Climate and Conservation issued a personal letter of appreciation to each of the 109 Working on Fire personnel, who served with distinction in assisting the Manitoba Wildfire department in managing its wildfires, in a season in which Canada experienced record levels of wildland fires from British Columbia to Ontario.WoF employs more than 5 000 formerly unemployed young men and women in fire prone regions of the country, trains them into skilled and fit firefighters, clothes them with the appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment, and deploys them at 235 bases in all nine provinces. The WoF programme also encompasses an invasive alien eradication project targeting inaccessible mountainous areas, the High Altitude Teams (HAT) and a Forestry Support Programme (FSP) to assist with fire management on the state\' s forests.The WoF programme was developed on the basis of a private company, Kishugu Holdings, which used its prior experience in serving the forestry industry in Mpumalanga and a study tour of the US Forestry service in early 2003. Kishugu has developed an Integrated Fire Management approach to managing wildland fires in South Africa. This is a globally recognised approach to managing wildland fires.WoF\' s contribution to combating on average 2 500 wildland fires per annum is not the only accolade of this award-winning programme. WoF\' s achievements include having some 30% women in its ranks (the highest in any comparable firefighting force in the world) and 50% women in its management. Indeed, some 60% of WoF management are former firefighters who have risen through the ranks, supported by development programmes such as those at UCT Business School and the University of the Free State.The employment opportunities afforded to the more than 5 000 youth in WoF is no small achievement in the context of the stubbornly high unemployment in South Africa. It is imperative the WoF programme be developed as South Africa faces a growing challenge of wildland fires.Abrahams is the managing director of Working on Fire.\l"

Promoting a circular economy will continue to be the talk of the new year. Here are some trends that we need to keep an eye on in 2022:Enforcing the 50% reduction of organic waste to landfillThe discussion around the 50% reduction of organic waste to landfill in 2022 and a complete ban in 2027 seemed to receive more attention. We have already seen AWT technology like on-site composting units being used more frequently. Every business that produces large volumes of organic waste should keep a waste inventory to track the volumes produced and treated. Over the next few years, on-site AWT technology will become the preferred treatment method for organic waste, especially as we move towards a complete organic waste landfill ban. Using on-site AWT makes it easier to monitor the volumes of waste produced and treated.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/703/220391.html :EMBED-->Integrated waste management to industrial symbiosis A typical IWM system may have source reduction measures, composting systems, a solid waste recyclable facility, digestion plants, a material recovery facility (MRF) and possibly a thermal treatment plant. While IWM is not a new concept to the waste sector, the development of IWM models has been slow at a municipal level.However, there seems to be a more promising progression with IWM within industrial parks and environments. This leads us to the concept of industrial symbiosis, which implies that businesses and industries should work together to use by-products or unused resources as secondary resources. These secondary resources could come in the form of waste materials, energy, captured emissions or water. Industrial symbiosis has gained a lot of traction in South Africa over the past five years, with four major industrial symbiosis programmes (ISPs) running in the country currently. With the opportunity to save resources costs, collaborate with other businesses and reduce waste going to landfill, industries across South Africa are joining ISPs.As industrial symbiosis develops in the country, material supply chains and waste treatment will look at technology that creates secondary resource opportunities. According to the most recent data, since 2015, 215,000 tonnes of waste has been diverted from landfill through South Africa s current ISPs.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/700/220961.html :EMBED-->Data-driven circular economyTo fully understand the efficiency around material flows and supply chains, waste management service providers need to emphasize collecting more and better-quality data on waste streams. For the most part, collecting data on waste generation and treatment has been fairly manual, leaving room for human error and oversight. Using technology to collect high-quality, accurate data can strengthen the economic value of a waste stream by positioning it as a secondary resource. If we specifically look at how this would apply to organic waste, fully knowing the volumes of feedstock (food waste, for example) that would go into a composting unit will give us a good idea of output product volumes (compost). This degree of understanding allows one to create an accurate business case for a secondary resource produced at a specific site.More focus on carbon and emissions managementFollowing COP26, South Africa has been put in the spotlight with our carbon-intensive economy. With carbon and emission production, the waste sector has a role to play. Disposal of the organic waste stream at landfill is still responsible for a large portion of South Africa s carbon and methane emissions. This makes organic waste diversion a priority in 2022 and in further years to come.Sources: National Cleaner Production Centre South Africa: 2020 Impact report-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

Illegal fishing takes different forms, but large-scale industrial operators do the most\~damage\~to ecosystems and the environment.Climate change worsens the effects of overexploited fish stocks, limiting their ability to regenerate. Given the current crisis, urgent measures are needed in vulnerable coastal communities, particularly in West Africa where piracy, armed robbery and kidnapping are rampant.Illegal fishing in West Africa is a challenge on three levels. First, it jeopardises the management of fish stock by disrupting regulatory processes. To achieve a sustainable fishing sector, countries must manage the growth and depletion of fish stock, enforce safety and operational rules, and del"

The Constitutional Court this month refused the application for leave to appeal, with costs.It concluded that the application should be dismissed  as it is not in the interests of justice for this court to entertain it at this stage .The decision is the latest milestone in a long-running legal battle by a coalition of eight civil society organisations, represented by the Centre for Environmental Rights (CER), to overturn the approvals given for the mine. They say the proposed coal mine would fall within a Strategic Water Source Area \- one of only 22 areas where more than 50% of South Africa\' s freshwater originates. Currently there are six court challenges pending before the High Court, the organisations said. Over the last six years we have done everything within our power to overturn the approvals given for this mine in order to prevent the long-term threat to water security in South Africa that would arise from coal mining \- a highly water intensive and water contaminating form of mining - in this ecologically sensitive area, said Federation for a Sustainable Environment chief executive Mariette Liefferink. The Constitutional Court\' s decision comes in a week when many world leaders gathered at COP26 committed to accelerate the transition away from coal power generation to avoid catastrophic climate change. That commitment includes refusing permits for new coal-fired power generation projects and promoting investment in and development of clean energy, in a way that benefits workers and communities, added groundwork director, Bobby Peek. We welcome the Constitutional Court decision as an important local acknowledgement of the need to pause development of new coal mining, particularly in our strategic water source areas, when the impact of coal mining and burning on global warming is irrefutable. Our focus, particularly here in Africa, needs to be on building our resilience to climate change, not making it worse, Peek said. \l"

It has roughly R400bn of debt that it services through regular government bailouts.""From the crisis that Eskom currently finds itself in very poor plant performance, excessive debt this contains the opportunity for us to really act as the foundation for a new dispensation in South Africa,"" CEO Andre de Ruyter told the Reuters Next conference.""Hopefully we can persuade people to come and set up factories here, to build components for renewable energy, that will create jobs that will create demand for electricity which will turn this challenge that we have got at the moment from a vicious downward cycle into a virtuous upward cycle,"" he added.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/222378.html :EMBED-->Coal plants reaching the end of their lifeEskom operates 15 coal-fired power stations that generate more than 80% of the country's electricity but regularly break down. It also runs Africa's only nuclear power station and a handful of smaller pumped storage, hydroelectric, backup gas plants and a wind farm.But it is due to shut down about 22,000 megawatts (MW) of coal plants that are reaching the end of their life by 2035, close to half its 46,000MW of nominal capacity now. The plan is to replace some of that with gas and renewables, and allow independent power producers to make up the shortfall.The plan to move decisively away from coal has prompted criticism from mines and energy minister Gwede Mantashe, a powerful figure in the governing African National Congress and former trade union leader, who in August likened it to ""economic suicide"".De Ruyter said Eskom had identified two potential gas projects - one with a 3,000MW capacity at Richards Bay and another 1,000MW one at its retiring Komati coal plant. By 2050, Eskom hopes to achieve ""net zero"" carbon emissions through offset initiatives.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/222384.html :EMBED-->$8.5bn financing from the WestDe Ruyter, who took the helm of Eskom in January 2020, said Eskom hoped to get the ""lion's share"" of the $8.5bn of financing that South Africa secured from Western countries in a deal announced at the COP26 climate conference in November.It will prioritise spending that money on building transmission infrastructure to connect to the best solar and wind acreage in the country, as well as strengthening the distribution grid to accommodate more private generation.Eskom has been trying to lift the performance of its coal fleet through deep maintenance, but that has yet to yield results. Reflecting the gravity of the situation, De Ruyter said it could take another three to four years to see a significant change in the energy availability factor of the coal units still in operation.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

Under current circumstances, global governance is guaranteed to disappoint.In a new report, HYPERLINK https://globalcommissionforpostpandemicpolicy.org/home/our-global-condition-report/Our Global Condition HYPERLINK https://globalcommissionforpostpandemicpolicy.org/Global Commission for Post-Pandemic Policy attribute these difficulties to the fact that we are in the grip of not one but four crises.\~The only way forward is to recognise the connections between planetary public health, climate change, declining public trust and democratic legitimacy, and geopolitical instability. These issues are interlinked. Treating them as separate domains will get us nowhere.Environmental stresses increase the likelihood that zoonotic diseases will spread to humans and become pandemics.\~The social, political and economic stresses introduced by a pandemic then foster attitudes and behaviours that undermine social solidarity, making it harder for governments to secure public buy-in for strong decarbonisation measures.\~In countries and political systems where trust in institutions and the authority of expertise has been undermined by the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis and the growth of social media, coping with new crises remains an uphill struggle.This description is especially apt for the US, the country to which so many look for leadership. The crisis of trust has weakened the US both internally and on the world stage, contributing to the deteriorating relations between the West and China.\~Following the logic of feedback loops, tensions over the pandemic and climate change have contributed to the world's foremost geopolitical crisis. Yet without US-China engagement and mutual understanding, little substantive progress against either the pandemic or climate change can be made.Similar dynamics are evident in the failure to deliver a sufficient supply of vaccines to poorer countries, a reality made salient by the emergence of the new Omicron variant. According to the Global Commission's HYPERLINK https://globalcommissionforpostpandemicpolicy.org/home/vaccine-countdown/vaccination countdownSino-American cooperation could close this gap, given the two countries' unmatched capital and logistical resources, and also could deal swiftly with the looming sovereign-debt crisis that is likely to strike low-income countries and then the rest of the world in 2022. Unfortunately, there is no prospect of such agreements any time soon.It is a bleak picture, auguring not imminent disaster but rather continuing disappointment and vulnerability. To confront this situation, we must develop new strategies based on four key principles. The first principle - and the most immediate task - is to get all populations vaccinated, so that we can accelerate the shift from a pandemic to a more manageable endemic public-health issue.\~Whether they act alone or in groups, all countries need to place the highest priority on delivering vaccines to Africa and other lagging regions, as well as devoting more resources - medical, financial, logistical and administrative - to support vaccination programmes. Eliminating pandemic-driven uncertainties may also be the surest way to create trust and public buy-in for sustained climate measures and other necessary but costly ""build back better"" policies.The second (and longer-term) principle is to recognise that US-China rivalry plays a central role in global affairs. Neither that rivalry nor the continuing importance of either countries can be wished away.\~The US and the Soviet Union exercised such discipl"

Or, just as likely, colliding with each other as we lose our balance and plunge our part of the globe's biodiversity into free fall.My father used to say that it was the way of the world that when things that seemed to take forever to find form moved into the realm of the real, they did so with such speed that even the prepared were surprised.It's how we've treated our sick planet for decades, ignoring the warning signals - and there have been many - only waking up to our dire plight now when management, not healing, of the Earth's condition is possible.\~Well, it's time to talk about ""saving the planet"" at the 26th HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop26/United Nations\~Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) taking place in Scotland.\~Glasgow, famed for its Victorian and art nouveau architecture, is host to the biggest gathering of world leaders ever assembled on British soil over the next few days.\~Will there be a ""generation-defining"" agreement to pull back greenhouse gas emissions? Will we slow the pace of global heating - meeting the goals set in the Paris Agreement signed in 2015?But most importantly, will the world's leaders be there to lend support to the discussions and debates and make critical decisions that they will agree to implement?Even Queen Elizabeth II has her doubts, evidenced by overheard remarks at the opening of the Welsh parliament a week before of her irritation with people who ""talk but don't do"".She could be proved right: the heads of state of two of the biggest polluting nations, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping are not at the summit.The usual suspects - environmental activists Sir David Attenborough and scary teenager Greta Thunberg - are.\~This conference has been called humanity's ""best last chance"" to get some sort of handle on climate change.My dad used to say that we humans take a long time, ""allowing"" things before we act. He meant apartheid, but it has a wider context too. And so we have lived through an extended slow-slow phase and the Earth is now, if not terminally ill, definitely on life support.Warning rumblings from early last century have included Silent Spring, Rachel Carson's 1962 groundbreaking environmental science book describing the adverse environmental effects caused by the wide use of pesticides. Going 65 years back, lovely broadcaster, author and natural historian David Attenborough began recording the degradation of our planet.I was moved to tears by his 2020 documentary HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64R2MYUt394Life on Our Planetwhere the 93-year-old introduced himself saying: ""This is my witness statement.""There was a touching finality in this quietly spoken warning from a man who has, as he says, witnessed the onset of a climate emergency that has largely been ignored, one that has speeded up exponentially in recent years.His is a personal account of a life spent mapping out how humans have destroyed nature and are in the process of making our home uninhabitable for millions.Attenborough has statistics to back him up. Since the 1950s, animal populations have more than halved. An astonishing 70% of birds on the planet are mostly chickens, bred for our consumption.Sustainable farming and the health of our planet is something the HYPERLINK https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/sustainability#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20global,stocks%20endure%20for%20future%20generations.Prince of Wales - who is lending his respected voice to COP26 - has been promoting since the 1980s.\~Forty years after he began the environmental conservation dance, his son Prince William has learnt the steps and added to the choreography. Together, they have moved finding solutions to the planet's problems to the top of the agenda.It is something of a relief that the royals have used their unique position to tackle the challenges presented by climate change. William has collaborated on what I suspect will be one of the most important cogs in the wheel of the environmental battle.Enter HYPERLINK https://earthshotprize.org/The Earthshot PrizeThe much belittled future monarch, Charles, has been a staunch champion for sustainable measures and systems that could help save the environment. He has preached, most often to deaf ears, about the global challenges of climate change, deforestation, pollution of our oceans. People thought him a little peculiar, this man who talked to plants.To reduce his carbon footprint, the prince stopped eating meat and dairy for a few days a week, the principle being that eating fewer animal products is important to fight the climate crisis.\~ Attenborough tells us that humans make up a third of the weight of mammals on Earth with 60% of animals being those that are raised for us to eat. Domestic animals require vast swathes of land and half of the fertile land on the planet is now farmland. Hence fewer cows, less methane, which, apparently, diffuses quickly and therefore creates a quicker warming effect than other greenhouse gases.\~Now, in the quick-quick phase that we are in, plant-based diets are being hailed as the way to go.\~Another HYPERLINK man ahead of the curve was HYPERLINK https://environmentalmigration.iom.int/ted-talk-al-gore-climate-change-trends-toward-extremesAl Gore, vice-president to the United States' Bill Clinton.He first moved onto my radar in my first year at Rhodes University in 1977 when the young congressman's views on climate issues were quickly (but carelessly) adopted by me and my nerd-herd.\~Almost two decades later, in 1994 as vice-president, he launched the Globe programme, designed to educate children on the environmental challenges that would affect their future.As the American correspondent for a Sunday newspaper in 1998, I wrote about Gore's support of the Kyoto Protocol - which called for the global reduction of carbon emissions. It was hoped that countries within the United Nations would comply. Few did, including the US, which refused to ratify this critical protocol.Now US President Joe Biden wants to pledge his country's support in the fight against global warming, but his efforts appear to have been hamstrung by Congress.If Biden had had his way, there'd be legislation that would fulfil an American promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half within the next nine years - when compared to levels recorded in 2005. He'd hoped to set an example for other countries to follow: throwing money - a lot of it - into clean energy for a start.We're a strange species, us humans. Like addicts, we ignore the obvious and laugh in the face of evidence that could kill us, that could wipe us out as a species.And in this foxtrot dance we are in, things that started out slow-slow have become quick-quick with remarkable speed.\~It's as though we all suddenly woke up - like women did when they screamed ""enough"" after centuries of sexual misconduct, giving birth to #MeToo.The social #MeToo movement has highlighted sexual abuse and harassment, and shines a spotlight on those accused of sex crimes. Again it took years before this phrase - coined by Tarana Burke in 2006, to raise awareness of women who'd been abused - moved into regular use. It was only after actress Alyssa Milano's 2017 tweet called Hollywood bigwig film producer Harvey Weinstein a sexual predator that it became a global term.The world is ready for change. And we, most right thinking people, are ready to act for change.Think how a series of pro-democracy protests and uprisings called the Arab Spring led to first free elections and toppled leaders in Tunisia and in Egypt. Once begun, the tide could not be turned.It's how I feel about joining the fight for the survival of our planet. Friends who once shrugged as they asked what single individuals can do, have changed their tune if only to recycle.We can all play a role: limiting our diet of red meat and dairy products, lobbying our supermarkets to use less packaging, planting trees, recycling and building more energy efficient homes.\~We live on this planet - we've got skin in the game - so, I suppose, it's up to us to make sure that the generations to come have a world to inhabit.As Thunberg and teen environmental activists everywhere have been telling us, we owe it to them.And so, we need to keep the quick-quick rhythm of our global dance going.The post https://mg.co.za/opinion/2021-11-06-we-danced-our-way-to-the-earths-demise/We danced our way to the Earth's demise appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.zaThe Mail & Guardian\l"

It also looks at the challenges and opportunities that will arise in the next five to ten years. Each of the 21 country chapters responds to the same set of questions and themes, allowing for comparative analysis.-While major steps are being made in the decarbonisation of African countries, with 12 out of the 21 countries in this report already relying on clean energy as an important part of their power mix, many jurisdictions are still very much fossil fuel reliant. Significant differences also exist between countries in energy supply diversity and power systems which is resulting in inconsistent development across the continent.Despite these differences, the report identifies a clear theme of governments across Africa increasing renewable energy capacity, both as part of a pro-energy transition agenda and as the most effective way to meet rising energy demand, which is expected to double by 2040. In some jurisdictions (Angola, Burundi and Ethiopia), this will take the form of expanded hydroelectric capacity and in others, the focus is on developing solar and wind infrastructure (Botswana, Kenya and South Africa) in each case aimed at reducing dependence on fossil fuels and biomass sources.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/693/222706.html :EMBED-->Other trends emerging from the report are:- Almost all of the 21 countries surveyed have legislative and/or investment programmes in place for renewables, presenting both the chance for African nations to lead the energy transition and a large-scale cross-continental investment opportunity.- It is anticipated that use of fossil fuels and biomass will continue to play a large part of the energy mix for almost all of the jurisdictions in the next five to ten years. However, outliers (Algeria, Angola and Nigeria) continue to encourage and secure investment in new oil and gas developments.- The incentives for transitioning to renewable energy are recognised and acknowledged in Africa s markets. In particular, it is perceived as a solution to overcome generation deficits as well as a way of achieving middle-income country status by 2030.- The key to achieving the energy transition will be implementation. Countries will need to ensure that they have in place not only attractive legislative frameworks, but also real drive from governments to incentivise clean energy investment and bankable projects.DLA Piper's head of the UK energy and natural resources practice and partner, James Carter, said: ""Given the post-COP26 backdrop and findings, there is a heavy focus on how energy transition will help arrest climate change. Africa, because of its size and predicted future growth and development, will play a key role in decarbonising the global economy through its adoption of renewables and other technological breakthroughs.

Bravo to the electorate for finally stomping on a party that has sown misery and mistrust.Peter Bachtis, BenoniRenewables can't do it allYour correspondent Kim Polley, ""What, if anything, will COP26 change for SA?"" (October 31), has given us a good insight into the importance of this week's COP26 UN climate change conference.The activists target fossil fuel, nuclear and hydro generation, advocating solar and wind energy in their stead. But their technical insight is deploringly amiss. Consider Eskom's rather disastrous new projects, Medupi and Kusile, among the largest in the world. Together they generate 9.6GW of power, and if correctly managed can operate at 80% availability. So, effectively they should eventually supply 7.7GW to customers.By contrast, a wind farm has a typical availability of up to 30%. So to replace the coal stations will require 13,000 wind turbines of 2MW each. And as the wind doesn't blow when we want the power, that is 24/7, there will be lots of times when little or no power is available. The activists suggest overcoming this problem with storage batteries. Really? How many megawatts? Not likely in the foreseeable future!There are similar problems with solar power. Regrettably the solution is not available using renewables only, but an intelligent mix of them with the hardy reliables of nuclear, fossil and hydro. Properly managed of course!Bev Lawrence, EmalahleniLucky to have BarneyHow lucky we are to have Barney Mthombothi as a regular contributor to your Insight pages!

But there s never been a better time to be a business leader in Africa. We re living in a time when several technology, consumer and cultural megatrends are colliding head-on, creating an environment that s ripe for disruption (and a whole lot of innovation).What s really positive is that we re starting to get some clarity on how these mega-trends will affect African businesses. Here are my top five trends for the year. They span technology, culture and business, and reflect a world that s changing faster than we realise.Web 3.0 - People and businesses take back controlWeb 1.0 saw information pushed at us. With Web 2.0, the internet got social, and businesses and users started creating their own content. But the big move for 2022 and beyond is Web 3.0 it s the Internet, but it belongs to everyone.Here s why it s important. Web 3.0 is an incredible opportunity for Africa to build new businesses, social networks and marketplaces in the digital age. Last year, $27bn was raised by Web 3.0-related start-ups compared to the $1.3bn raised by the African startup ecosystem in 2020. When you think about how the Web 3.0 opportunity is fully disconnected from geographical constraints, you get a sense of the massive opportunity it presents to African businesses and new careers for young Africans.NFTs go mainstreamThere s a good reason the Collins Dictionary declared NFT the 2021 word of the year (and why metaverse made the short list). NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital assets that are created using the blockchain. According to the DappRadar Industry Report for 2021, NFT trading volume for the year surpassed $23bn- compared with just $100m in 2020.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/462/223364.html :EMBED-->The rise of NFTs shows that digital assets as a store of value are being taken seriously in financial markets, and formal ownership of these assets can be documented. Apart from opening new markets for African digital creators, artists and brands, the digitalisation of data records will be a massive business.In 2022, we can expect to see growing numbers of African brands using NFTs to offer new experiences to their customers, build communities and to increase brand awareness and loyalty.The return of trustFor the past few years, the Edelman Trust Barometer has shown how trust in our societal institutions and leaders is broken. Web2.0 allowed the rampant spread of misinformation and fake news.This year, I expect to see African business leaders taking clear action to build trust. Forrester believes that in 2022 leading companies will use trust to benefit the planet, empower the organisations and individuals they serve and seize the opportunities presented by new digital models. How? By being seen to address societal challenges - like poverty, financial inclusion, job security, climate change and vaccinations. Dealing with these issues benefits society at large and trust will be built, or broken, on how organisations declare their intent and take real actions to back it up.Sustainability becomes a way of lifeThe COP26 conference in Glasgow late last year showed us that the world s transition to a low carbon economy will need to accelerate dramatically if we re going to save our planet. Practically every business in Africa (and the world) will have to turbo-charge their decarbonisation efforts.But how does this work in the real world? Every company in Africa, from startups to giant conglomerates, must start finding ways to integrate sustainability into their business from renewable energy sources to biodegradable packaging. In 2022, businesses that take sustainability will start to be preferred by consumers. Expect to see more inter-Africa trade underpinned by the African Continental Free Trade Area to boost the sustainability of African natural resources and increase contribution to Africa GDP growth.The rise and rise of the nomadic workforceWe ve talked a lot about hybrid work in the past couple of years, and how difficult it is for businesses to find a model that works for them.

""Taking account of scientific advice and current technological progress, as well as varying transition challenges across member states, the commission considers there is a role for natural gas and nuclear as a means to facilitate the transition towards a predominantly renewable-based future,"" the European Commission said on January 1. According to the commission, gas and nuclear projects would be considered green if they produce emissions below 270g of CO& xB2; equivalent per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Though the EU's move has elicited a backlash from climate change activists who accuse it of ""greenwashing"" dirty fuels, the proposal could be a game-changer in Africa. The Berkeley, California-based Breakthrough Institute's energy and development director, Vijaya Ramachandran, said the commission's decision was a step in the right direction but should be followed with action. ""However, it may decide to follow one set of policies at home (classifying natural gas as green) while still opposing the financing of natural gas by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. ""If this is the case, these actions can be termed immoral and unjust; a form of green colonialism.""

By your logic, wouldn't the architects of COP26's clean energy agreements also be guilty of & colonialism& by seeking to torpedo investments in coal which otherwise could contribute to the country's & development& Is his boss, President Cyril Ramaphosa, aware that in Mantashe's world, anything goes in the search for money - in contrast to the assurances Ramaphosa gave in Glasgow. Perhaps the funders who agreed to provide R131bn to SA to fund its green energy transition need to reconsider, given Mantashe's agnosticism on clean energy.As arresting as his statement was, it's not surprising. Mantashe, after all, has vigorously backed another looming environmental and fiscal catastrophe: the 20-year, R200bn-plus contract to Turkish group Karpowership for the supply of & emergency& power while Eskom gets its act together.That he sees colonialist hobgoblins behind the bid to stop an environmental disaster on the Wild Coast is all the more ironic since it's hardly a & white fight& The black fishing communities of Dwesa-Cwebe, Port St Johns and Amadiba have now penned a scathing open letter to Mantashe in which they say the minister & insults us when he implies that the fight to protect our oceans from corporations like Shell is only the struggle of white environmentalists ... he is trying to make it seem as though we cannot think for ourselves& Shell's promised riches are also far from assured. Scientist Liz McDaid, the strategic lead of the Green Connection - a lobby group opposing Shell - points out that the World Bank's research of 12 Sub-Saharan countries where oil and gas was discovered between 2002 and 2020 found that & government revenues were lower than predicted& while & resources were overvalued& Mantashe says there's no evidence that seismic surveys damage marine life, implying it is a feverish conspiracy created so that activists can keep doing tai chi and yoga on pristine beaches.Yet, this is what a group of actual experts say: & Seismic surveying, which employs large arrays of air guns that produce high-amplitude, low-frequency pulses ... every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day and for months on end, over extensive areas of ocean, is fundamentally damaging to marine ecosystems.& Their argument - that blasting causes irreparable harm - is the basis for a second court challenge in Makhanda this week, to stop the survey.What makes Mantashe's spin more mysterious is that he has not been seized with the need for & development& enough to actually do anything to ensure SA has the power it needs, as he has spurned opportunities to push renewable power.So why, now, is he defending Shell? Could it have something to do with the fact that the Thebe Investment Corp owns 28% of Shell's downstream refining and marketing business in SA, and that when Thebe was founded back in 1992, it was an ANC investment company?Surely, Mantashe's impassioned defence of Shell's commercial ambitions can't be so venal?\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa307","#BizTrends2022: Better waste management will be critical to a sustainable future","January 7, 2022 Friday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The waste management industry is in for an exciting 2022, with new environmental regulations, the use of digital technologies and a focus on the circular economy combining to improve sustainability.-While there is recognition at the highest levels of the need to urgently address climate change and biodiversity restoration, even high-profile summits like COP26 have delivered mixed outcomes. Nonetheless, the facts are clear enough: humanity needs to modify both its behaviours and actions if it hopes to meet the requirement of ensuring a sustainable planet for future generations. The good news is that I believe 2022 will be seen as the year of implementing new processes and models with a view to ensuring just such a sustainable future. One of the critical drivers of innovation and change in the waste management industry is the existing environmental legislative framework, particularly some of the new regulations, goals and strategies<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/721/223804.html :EMBED-->A good example of this is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations being implemented. These laws are all about producers of a product that creates waste being made to take more responsibility for its disposal or recycling. This has led to a greater focus being placed on the use of recyclate in packaging as well as the post-consumer collection and beneficiation of such waste streams. EPR rules come at a time when we are well aware of the diminishing capacity of landfill airspace in most provinces, exacerbated by population growth and rapid urbanisation. This is also the key driver in the proposed zero waste to landfill concept - the goal being to divert 90% of waste from landfills to more sustainable purposes.Use waste as an alternative fuelOne way of achieving this is to use waste as an alternative fuel. It is vital that waste that can t be recycled or reused is repurposed as an alternative energy source. Turning waste into energy offers twofold value: playing to the zero waste to landfill principle and helping impact SA s ongoing energy crisis.Of course, with South Africa only recycling 10% of its waste, the zero waste to landfill goal appears ambitious. However, through minimisation, recycling, reuse and recovery of this waste - as well as beneficiation technologies - we can still build a circular economy that can properly tackle this challenge.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/703/220391.html :EMBED-->A circular economy model is premised on the concept of designing out waste and pollution. It follows the hierarchy of waste management principles to avoid, reduce, repurpose, recycle, recover, treat and contain waste first, before seeking to dispose of it to landfill. In light of this, it is an approach that offers huge opportunities to deliver more inclusive economic growth, increase job opportunities and make positive environmental practices the norm.It means businesses must examine how to strip out all unnecessary waste materials, energy losses and related carbon emissions across their supply chain. They must then find solutions to ensure that these materials, resources and energy can be fed back into the cycle. Digital revolution crucial in waste managementFinally, the digital revolution is also going to become increasingly imperative as companies seek to leverage technologies in various ways to optimise waste management. This may include the tracking of products and materials throughout their lifecycle to ensure safe and responsible disposal, or using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors on waste bins to signal when ready for emptying or collection.Other ways to use digital technology include the testing of autonomous waste collection vehicles or robotics being utilised for sorting, separating and processing waste. It could even encompass the use of specific green technologies designed for processing and treating a wide variety of waste types.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/700/220961.html :EMBED-->All of these trends are ultimately aimed at reducing carbon emissions, achieving the sustainable development goals and generally reducing the impact of waste on the planet. They are also a response to consumer awareness and pressure for companies to visibly be more environmentally and socially conscious. It is an exciting time for anyone operating in this space as the waste sector today goes far beyond traditional recycling. In fact, during the course of 2022, I expect the industry will only become more focused on resilience and long-term sustainability - a crucial approach if South Africa hopes to move into a greener and more profitable future.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

Their aim is to encourage innovation and excellence in integrated reporting in southern Africa.They took place at an interesting time this year given that COP26 has just taken place, according to Stephen Sadie, CGISA CEO. ""Never before have companies placed so much emphasis on climate change and ESG,"" he says.The pandemic gave rise to significant opportunities for organisations to consider aspects of environmental, societal and governance (ESG) matters, agrees Jayne Mammat, Sustainability and Climate Change & ESG Africa lead at PwC, the convenor of judges.""This was particularly the case with regard to societal elements where organisations sought to focus on employees, health care and suitable flexible working arrangements,"" she says.There has long been criticism of how fragmented the sustainability reporting space is globally with numerous different players adding to the reporting burden on companies. Sadie points out that the integrated reporting landscape is shifting quite dramatically with a number of new bodies.""The launch of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) earlier this month is a game changer. Its sustainability standards will have the same status as, and work in conjunction with, the IFRS Accounting Standards.""The establishment of the ISSB takes sustainability-related financial disclosure mainstream and puts it alongside financial reporting, says Leigh Roberts, CEO of the Integrated Reporting Committee (IRC) of SA.Each country will have the choice of mandating the use of the ISSB standards and fitting them with local regulations and practices. Although the IASB and ISSB will be independent, their standards will complement each other in providing information required by investors and creditors.

Shell was due to start acoustic surveying along the Wild Coast on Wednesday, but environmental groups have applied for an urgent interdict in the Makhanda high court. Marine tracking websites showed the survey vessel is off the coast of Morgan Bay. In a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa and cabinet members Gwede Mantashe and Barbara Creecy, the scientists say recent studies suggest that seismic surveys are harmful to large marine mammals, like whales and dolphins, and to microscopic plankton. The scientists include several leaders in the fields of marine biology and marine ecology: Dr Larry Oellermann, CEO of the SA Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR); Prof Kenneth Findlay, research chair: Oceans Economy, Centre for Sustainable Oceans at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology; and Prof Isabelle Ansorge, head of the University of Cape Town's oceanography department. ""SA's marine ecosystems, and the coastal community's sustainable blue economies that depend on their health, are being threatened by the deployment of offshore seismic surveying,"" the letter reads. ""There is a growing body of evidence pointing to the immediate and long-term, and largely unmitigable, negative impacts of this invasive method on marine creatures. ""We point out that much of this evidence, and a growing global opposition to this method of surveying [it has been stopped in some countries' exclusive economic zones], has only come to light after the granting of current permits, notwithstanding their questionable legal status,"" the group said. The Makhanda high court is expected to issue a ruling on the the urgent interdict on Friday, which could scupper Shell's local offshore ambitions. The oil giant's legal representatives told the court that Shell may have to walk away from the project should it be prevented from surveying. ""Their [the applicants'] entire case is based on speculative harm, which is belied by the actual evidence and experience of seismic surveys around the world,"" Shell lawyer Adrian Friedman told the Cape Times. ""The seismic survey is being conducted pursuant to an economic imperative, to the benefit of the entire country, of energy security. The applicants allege that irreversible harm will be suffered, without explaining what that means."" The scientists say there are numerous scientific and regulatory concerns with seismic surveys, including an alleged ""deficiency in the current Environmental Impact Regulations"" related to the technology. ""This omission must be rectified before any further permits are considered,"" the group said. They have also requested a strategic environmental assessment of all current and future seismic surveys ""to determine key environmental and social constraints and sensitivities"".

Just five years ago, Sibanye was a gold miner. Then it bet big on platinum group metals (PGMs), buying into the sector in the US and SA with spectacular success. Now it is moving swiftly into the raw materials - lithium, nickel and copper - needed to power battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and renewable energy storage.Second, Impala Platinum announced last week it is in talks on a deal that would extend the life of its PGM mines, with Impala and smaller producer Royal Bafokeng Platinum announcing they are contemplating a merger that has the potential for all sorts of synergies between the two.The PGMs - mainly platinum, palladium and rhodium - are needed for the autocatalysts that cut emissions in vehicles with petrol- or diesel-powered internal combustion engines (ICEs).The ICE versus BEV mix is where the big question is for the ""green"" sector. How far and how fast electric vehicles (EVs) will displace petrol/diesel cars and trucks over the next decade is key to the longer-term outlook for battery metals versus PGMs, and to the investment case for the Sibanye and Impala deals.In the shorter term, however, there is much uncertainty about the outlook for PGM prices in particular.The global semiconductor chip shortage has dented global vehicle production, and hence the demand from the vehicle manufacturers for PGMs. The metals' prices had soared amid tightening emissions standards and short supply. But the PGM basket price is now a third or more off its peak of April and May this year because of the chip shortage.It is not clear how long the shortage will persist, nor how strong vehicle demand will be once the supply chain recovers. But prices are still way higher than they were three years ago. And the fundamentals, said Implats CEO Nico Muller, ""remain robust"".How long that robust picture lasts depends crucially on the ICE versus BEV timel"

The effects of warming and the limited options for adaptation to new temperatures and rainfall patterns will be assessed in the upcoming Working Group II report to be tabled next year.""Sustaining the global temperature of 1.5 \'b0C by the end of the 21st century will require global scale negative emissions in the second half of the century to reduce atmospheric CO2,"" said the Minister.""In this regard the work of the Climate Commission to identify pathways for a Just Transition to a low carbon economy and climate resilient society by mid-century has never been more important.""""Climate action remains a national and international priority. And South Africa remains firmly committed to contributing our best effort towards the global cause of addressing climate change. In this regard we will be submitting our revised Nationally Determined Contribution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC ahead of COP 26,"" said Creecy.The minister said South Africa supports the common position of the African Group of Negotiators, ahead of COP26, that ambition and climate action need to be dramatically increased to advance all three of the interconnected global goals in the UNFCCC\'b4s Paris Agreement, namely; mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation.In this regard, Creecy said it is urgent that developed countries urgently honour their obligation to provide financial support to developing countries who already face the impact of climate change. ""In the context of this report, issues of climate justice have never been more compelling. As we transition our energy generation and at least seven sectors of our economy, we must ensure that those involved in the vulnerable sections of our society and economy do not carry a disproportionate burden for climate change and its mitigation.""Eskom has already commissioned significant research on the impact of the transition on coal fired power stations facing decommissioning later this decade. Significant long term financial resources, at concessional rates, will be needed to introduce new technologies and open up significant new job creation opportunities so that our country joins others who are benefitting from the green technological transition across the world."" said the minister.She said African countries are already struggling to adapt to the reality of a changing climate and they urgently require international support for their mitigation and adaptation efforts. To avoid the stark future foreshadowed by the IPCCC report, COP26 needs to prioritise securing finance, technology and capacity building support from developed to developing countries.We live in a world where facts and fiction get blurred In times of uncertainty you need journalism you cantrust.

This comes after the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe, last month spoke out in support of prolonging coal-fired power generation, angering a section of renewable energy activists.Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele yesterday said the Cabinet has welcomed the $8.5 billion (R135bn) Just Transition Partnership announced at the Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow two weeks ago.The partnership was established by South Africa with France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to support the country\' s financing needs in building its renewable energy arsenal.The countries agreed to mobilise finance over the next three to five years through a range of instruments, including grants and concessional finance, to accelerate investment in renewable energy.

It will support Eskom's plans to repurpose eight to 10 ageing power stations, reskill and upskill workers for new jobs, and develop new enterprises in towns historically dependent on Eskom's value chain alone.The transition process will be based on the full involvement of organised labour and business in targeted programmes to ensure workers, women and young people are the major beneficiaries of our shift to a greener future.In terms of the Integrated Resource Plan 2019, several coal-fired power stations are due to be decommissioned between now and 2030. This is necessary not only to reduce carbon emissions but to address the deteriorating performance of older coal plants that are nearing their end of life.In anticipation of this reality, the Eskom plan will rapidly expand alternative sources of power, achieve greater energy access and security of supply, reduce the risk of load-shedding and improve air quality.A joint negotiations team will be set up between SA and the international partner countries to discuss an investment plan and financing modalities that will form the basis of a future deal.

You just cannot trust the US on environmental matters. This is one of the biggest threats to solving the climate crisis. I have been involved in the global effort to reduce emissions since the time I served as environment minister 21 years ago. I have witnessed, first hand, the destructive role of the US in climate negotiations.Year after year, the world attempts to draw the US into an agreement - hoping against hope that it can be rehabilitated. Next month, at the COP26 meeting of world leaders, yet another attempt will be made. And yet again we will not know whether the US will keep to the agreement.Some years after retiring from politics, I was called upon to facilitate global negotiations in the run-up to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. At the time, the US demanded that the Paris agreement should not be legally binding, and that every country's emission targets should be purely voluntary. (This was during President Barack Obama's time, nogal). Europe and the developing world reluctantly gave in to this demand. It is now history that the US reneged anyway.Why should we be worried stiff?One country, the US, has over time pumped out 25% of all the bad gases in the atmosphere. Remember that the US makes up only 4% of the world population. Even today, in 2021, the US has among the world's highest emissions per person. It is more than double that of China! Because of its outsized emissions, the global emissions reduction effort will not succeed without America. Our atmosphere has been ravaged in the name of money. Without paying for it, the rich and powerful countries have consumed an atmosphere that belongs to us all.Let's call it by its name. Taking what does not belong to you, in plain language, is called theft. The burning of oil and coal, without paying for the cost of the resulting emissions, has been a big driver of economies in modern times.A stark way of putting it is that much of the wealth of many rich countries is based on the proceeds of crime: the crime of appropriating common property for private gain. Indeed, the crime of destroying nature. We Africans will fail our moral responsibility if we don't call out these climate culprits.The planet is on fire. Wildfires, floods and droughts wreak havoc on every continent. Science tells us that this is only the beginning. We expect the climate culprits to stand up and be counted at the forthcoming COP26 meeting.Human beings have walked planet Earth for a long time. For many thousands of years we lived at the mercy of nature. Humans were part of nature, not above it. The inexorable forces of nature were beyond our control. All that changed in the very recent past.It took a very short time for man to declare himself master of nature - a cruel master. We are selfishly depleting the fish in the sea. Nothing will be left in another generation. We are polluting the sources of fresh water. We are pumping gases into the atmosphere, resulting in a changed climate.Twenty-one years ago, when I served as environment minister, very few people had heard of climate change. Fewer believed there was a danger that planet Earth would heat up. Even fewer believed that the heating up would be as a result of human greed.Those who warned that the burning of coal and oil released carbon dioxide that detrimentally changed the fragile composition of the atmosphere were dismissed as bunny huggers and looney environmentalists. The growing body of scientific evidence was simply ignored.Fortunately, attitudes have changed. Unfortunately, it took devastation to make the world sit up. It also took the emergence of a grassroots global environmental movement to bring the message home. And it took consumers to start choosing ethical goods.SA, of course, is a relatively high emissions country. It is not good enough to simply repeat that we are and have been far less bad than others. We have a moral responsibility to act - regardless of whether others are playing their part. Notwithstanding our economic and social challenges, South Africans from all walks of life are in agreement that the environment must be protected.Climate sceptics are a small minority. The only debate is how to get to net zero by 2050, not whether we should get there. Our democratic constitution was the first in the world - and is still one of the very few - to entrench the right to environmental protection as a fundamental human right.SA has a strong environmental movement that has fought - with some significant successes - against attempts to conduct mining and other activities that would cause serious damage to the environment. Our total installed wind and solar power capacity is just over 5,000MW. That is significant by any measure.This trend in the rollout of renewable energy will continue.

In all this, there are plans to build 1,500MW of new coal capacity contained in the government's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), a 2019 document laying out the energy mix up to 2030.Michelle Manook, CEO of the World Coal Association, which represents the global coal industry, says even if R100bn is thrown at this problem, it is unlikely to be a quick fix to the role coal plays in SA's economy.""When we're looking at the sort of funds that support that decarbonisation, it ought to include some of those clean coal technologies which SA has also identified in its own programme and policies including high-efficiency low emissions.""Efforts should be focused on using a multitude of energy sources, including coal, she said. ""We don't really lean into this 'either or' thing. There is room for everyone and there has to be. That is actually what a secure energy system looks like.""Developing and emerging countries have more choice today, Manook said. ""They are lucky and they should engage with that choice in a way in which they can continue to provide affordable and reliable power, but the idea that we can't have baseload power that would be coal, with new technologies supporting its abatement, I think is naive.""She concludes that coal will continue to be ""important and relevant"" for years to come, ""but where we want to get to is really supporting the clean technologies"".According to the department of mineral resources & energy, about 77% of SA's primary energy needs are provided by coal.

Speaking at the African Energy Week conference in Cape Town yesterday, Mantashe said the government was fully committed to a just transition away from harmful carbon emissions.However, he said the government would not abandon coal in favour of renewable energy at the cost of economic growth. While we are committed to low carbon emissions \- even net-zero emissions \- we do so within the reality of the energy that guarantees national economic growth, development and industrialisation, Mantashe said. In this context, all energy sources, concomitant technologies and minerals for low carbon emissions, and an industrial complex sensitive to our development needs, constitute the most appropriate agenda for a just energy transition. There has been a raging debate since President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a political declaration between the US and the EU this week which made a commitment to mobilise an initial amount of R131 billion over the next three to five years to support South Africa's just transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient future.Mantashe said South Africa welcomed the commitments made recently to invest in renewable energy, but this debate had already become divisive. In our case, this debate should not further entrench the urban labour reserves that are the legacy of our past. Therefore, the present must not enslave us further, he said.

He said this would enable South Africa to implement its ambitious goals and to develop a model for a just transition that was hoped can be used elsewhere.'We are entering a brave new world bound together by our common destiny as humanity.

It is interesting because it gives us some insight into what our president is thinking.This week, he wrote about investment and the decision to postpone an investment conference South Africa has been hosting since 2018. It is integral to the government\' s plan of raising R1.2 trillion in new investment over five years.Ramaphosa said there were a few reasons why the conference, which should have taken place around now, was being postponed until next year. This included local government elections as well as global meetings like the COP26 climate conference and the Intra-African Trade Fair which will take place in Durban next week.He was hopeful that when the investment conference gets going in March, more people would have been vaccinated, making travelling and getting together easier.But there is a far more important reason that postponing the investment conference makes sense \- load shedding.Imagine inviting business people from across the world to invest in your country but, as you start speaking, the microphone goes dead and the lights go out. It\' s simply not the place anyone would want to put their money.While there are many reasons why the economy is not growing, the lack of sufficient electricity must be top of the list.With stage 4 load shedding, businesses with no back-up power are losing between two and six hours of operations a day.Those that have generators are having to pay higher prices for petrol or diesel and have to run the machines for longer. Those with inverters are finding they need more batteries to keep the tills on for longer, and batteries don\' t come cheap.With overheads rising and turnover falling, many businesses are not going to survive. That, in turn, means higher levels of unemployment which, in turn, means fewer and fewer taxes will be raised. Given the enormity of the situation, one would have thought the government would have made generating more electricity a priority. But, since load shedding started 13 years ago, the government has failed miserably to manage the situation.The two new power stations it built became get-rich-quick schemes for the corrupt and, despite the cost, are unreliable. At the same time, the government did everything possible to keep out private energy producers.Ramaphosa ended this week\' s newsletter by saying:  We are building a firm foundation for a sustained economic recovery that encourages further investment, creating more jobs and providing new opportunities for emerging businesses. The problem is that we can\' t see it and neither will potential investors.\l"

He said on Monday: ""Technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy, particularly over time - and achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially in developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life.""Instead of the commitments climate activists (and any halfway sensible person) would have liked from the man Down Under, Morrison says science and technology will offer the solutions needed to transform economies, much like how the medical science world rallied to develop Covid-19 vaccines.Eighteen months ago, he said, we were ""staring into the abyss"" when ""the vaccines we would need had not only not been invented, but there had never been a vaccine for coronavirus. But here we are. Billions vaccinated and the world is reclaiming what Covid has taken from us. The challenge of combating climate change will be met the same way."" The governments' role in this, Morrison said, is merely to back the technologists and others who would make this happen.At the risk of understatement, this is a short-sighted comment. It's not that I don't think scientists and technologists will come forth with innovative means of mitigation. They will. They have. We're literally banking on it. As the Financial Times reported, ""there was a record $17bn in venture capital pumped into the so-called 'climate tech' space in 2020, according to data from [research group] BloombergNEF - triple the sum spent four years before"". Data from PitchBook indicates that in the first nine months of 2021 about $30.8bn was invested in climate tech.But investing in innovation is not enough.We have already had a boom and bust in ""cleantech"" that seems to be conveniently forgotten. In 2016 MIT did a cross-cutting study of $25bn in venture capital (VC) and the clean energy companies that benefited from it in 2006-2011, writing ""cleantech offered VCs a dismal risk-return profile, dragged down by companies developing new materials, chemistries, or processes that never achieved manufacturing scale"". It concluded that ""the VC model is broken for the cleantech sector, which suffers especially from a dearth of large corporations willing to invest in innovation"".""Aha!"" you may exclaim, now the large corporations are willing to invest and the cost curve looks totally different. Venture capitalist Rob Toews took this view in a recent oped for Forbes. He believes software, not hardware, will be the game-changer, as automation and artificial intelligence (AI) enable things such as efficient carbon offsets and precision agriculture.Toews's piece is full of optimism, much of it warranted, but even he concedes that ""software alone will never fix climate change"" because ""climate change is ultimately a physical event, a phenomenon of atoms rather than bits"". That's why, he says, we need breakthroughs in ""electricity generation, energy storage, carbon removal and sustainable transportation"".In fact, we're already using tech to make things more efficient and transform power sources, pinning our hopes on technology for carbon capture and green fuel. Research from the London-based international think-tank the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) shows that the price of renewable energy generation (such as wind and solar) has fallen 60%-90% in the past 10 years. That is the result of advances in technology, with more to follow.And let's remember that tech isn't green by nature. Data centres are huge users of energy, and tech manufacturers contribute masses of plastic and other muck to the problem, among many other failings.The researchers are telling us that accelerating the changes we are already capable of is the key. ""To reach net-zero emissions,"" the ETC told the Financial Times (in a separate article) the ""first priority should be the mass scale-up of renewable power ... cranking up installations"" by at least 500% of 2019 levels.Morrison's comment fails us because it's just not accurate. It's ahistorical and cherry-picking. Regulation and global collaboration were crucial in the fight against Covid-19, as they will be in this climate fight. His solution feels a little like saying: ""Why fix potholes now if we're going to have hoverbikes in the future?""That statement is clearly deficient and wholly ignores the fundamental premise of the climate tipping point. The potholes in this case are fiery death traps already opening all around us.Technology and science have given us electric vehicles and green energy. By their powers combined, we have the data needed and strategies to change our trajectory. What we still - unthinkably - lack is a willingness to heed scientific advice or change our ways. And I'm not talking about you and little old me here. In a demonstration of hypocrisy-resistant ego, about 400 private jets were reportedly involved in moving our leaders, billionaires and other VIPs into Scotland this week. Each emitting an average of 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per flight hour, according to the Transport & Environment campaign group's Matt Finch.Yes, the individual can commit to greener living - including recycling and eating less meat - but what we really need is to use the gifts technology has given us, and meaningful action from those with real power: corporates, the megawealthy, and governments.Thompson Davy, a freelance journalist, is an impactAFRICA fellow and WanaData member.On the wrong track: Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison told the COP26 in Glasgow on Monday that science and technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy.

In fact, according to Iata Economics, prior to Covid-19 the aviation sector contributed US$63bn to Africa's GDP and supported 7.7m jobs, including nearly 0.5m aviation jobs. The health crisis put US$36bn of this economic activity and 3.9m jobs at risk.-Yet, despite the devastation, it has also shown just how well our sector is able to adapt and become more agile in the face of adversity. If anything, this year has reemphasised the need for planning, adaptability, and passion - critical pillars when operating in uncertainty. Looking beyond 2022, air travel should continue to rise with domestic markets continuing to lead the travel economy, with passenger traffic to, from and within Africa reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2026. And while leisure travel is expected to recover fully in the medium and long term, we are likely to see more permanent changes to business travel, as hybrid business models and video have become more accepted ways of doing business. The World Trade Organisation also forecasts world trade to grow 5.6% in 2022 as companies continue to restock and recover and as such, aviation cargo demand is expected to exceed pre-Covid levels by 13%So, while the pandemic impacted aviation in unprecedented ways, the sector is still geared for good recovery. However, we know that political and regulatory changes, social and economic adjustments, technology and new ways of doing things - as well as environmental factors and sustainability policies will continue to drive transformation in this sector.

As voters head to the polls on November 1, Eskom will make use of emergency reserves during the day and recover it at night with a view to keep load-shedding to a minimum as votes are placed and counted, Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer said at state of the system briefing on Monday. Eskom also has portable emergency generators available to assist wherever possible, he said. The commitment comes after Eskom reinstated load-shedding at the weekend, which will continue into Tuesday as several unplanned outages have put pressure on the power system, including a unit trip at the Koeberg nuclear power station. Having implemented 32 days of load-shedding days since April 1 - compared to 47 days for year-end in March - Oberholzer said it was ""very worrying"" to have reached this number of days already. Plant performance, as measured by an Energy Availability Factor (EAF), was 65.3%, way below the 70% EAF target that Eskom has set itself for the current financial year. The frequency of trips is really concerning, said Oberholzer. Unplanned losses are not coming down and have in fact risen to 23.1% against a target of 18% for the financial year. Against a full-year budget target of R4.1bn, Eskom has so far spent R2.44bn to run its diesel generators, which have had to run harder and more frequently than anticipated. The Duvha, Kendal and Tutuka power plants have been the worst performing of Eskom's ageing plants, Oberholzer said, noting much of that related to a legacy of poor maintenance. Ultimately, SA required an additional 4,000MW-6,000MW of generation capacity, Oberholzer said. Eskom has proposed a green deal to attract funding to expand its generation capacity in return for an accelerated decommissioning of its power stations.

To make it work, you need to take the relationships and power dynamics of all the stakeholders into account, who despite conflicting interests and external influences have to collaborate for a shared cause. Obviously, when looking at food systems, the stakeholders are not musicians, but people who produce, distribute or consume food. And instead of harmonising different music genres, their shared cause is the triple challenge of 1) ensuring that the growing global population has access to enough good-quality food; 2) providing livelihoods for the millions of people working in agriculture and the food supply chains; and 3) that all this is done sustainably.Complete reset<!> The complexity of food systems goes far beyond supply chains and is deeply entwined with other systems, such as energy and water.

Indeed, understanding the risks and opportunities raised by climate change and biodiversity degradation are increasingly discussed in board rooms and it is expected that they will be integrated at all organisational levels, from finance to operations and marketing departments, in the near future. At the UCT GSB, we prepare students and professionals to identify ways to mitigate and adapt to these environmental degradations while unlocking opportunities. We are cognisant that the transition to a carbon-neutral future will only be achieved if done a socially inclusive manner, where the transition will stimulate job generation and identify new opportunities for value creation. Hence, we invite current and future leaders to think of a just transition that would contribute to the development of the country and continent, and especially their most vulnerable citizens. \~Tackling climate change through global business educationThe CEMS Business and the Environment faculty group, open to all CEMS member schools, was founded in the mid-90s with the aim of researching and teaching the managerial implications of the relationship between business and the natural environment.\~Members are grounded in a broad variety of disciplinary fields (including management and economics, chemistry, biology, mathematics), which has allowed them to develop and implement new way to introduce environmental issues into mainstream business education.\~\~Out of this faculty group has emerged innovative initiatives such as the Model UNFCCC simulation, the culmination of a semester long programme on climate policy which takes place at CEMS schools across Europe.

Yet the Centre for Development & Enterprise's (CDE's) penetrating analysis of the dangers of localisation makes it clear that this is by no means certain, and that localisation is in fact a complex web of trade-offs and unintended consequences that need to be carefully weighed.The steel industry demonstrates just how important many of the issues raised in the CDE paper are, and how much more thought needs to be given to the policy - followed by swift action.The first point to make is that the definition of localisation within the steel industry remains opaque. For example, would Duferco count as a local supplier? Thanks in the main to the unwise decision to close Saldanha Steel, we have had to resort to importing hot rolled coil. We beneficiate this imported hot rolled coil substantially to produce galvanised steel, which is then used in a wide range of downstream industries.Would this beneficiated product be considered ""local enough"" to fall into the government procurement guidel"

To date, adoption and availability of EVs have lagged international trends, with only a handful of models on the market. But EVs are finally bursting into the mainstream with around 20 EVs expected to be available in South Africa by 2023.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/390/222479.html :EMBED-->At the same time, we are seeing rising interest in EVs among personal and fleet drivers alike. The 2020 South Africa EV Car Buyer Survey by AutoTrader showed that 74.3% of respondents would consider buying an electric vehicle in the next five years or sooner. As prices fall and a wider range of models become available, we can expect a receptive market for EVs.<>bThe automotive industry is responsible for a quarter of emissionsThe benefits of an accelerated transition to EVs are substantial for drivers, businesses, societies and the environment alike. According to the UN, the automotive industry is responsible for about a quarter of global human greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing emissions from vehicles is thus essential for governments, cities and businesses to meet their wider emission reduction goals.Yet switching to EVs will not be enough on its own to make a dent into the automotive industry s well-to-wheel emissions. The ""well-to-wheel emissions"" of a vehicle is the measure of the total carbon and greenhouse gas emissions produced during the lifecycle of the vehicle, from sourcing of the manufacturing materials to its energy usage during its active years.Lower well-to-wheel emissions means a smaller carbon footprint and a higher level of sustainability.Solar PV reduces well-to-wheel emissions nine-foldA technical report by NREL a national laboratory of the US Department of Energy shows an EV powered from a 93% coal-powered grid has roughly the same well-to-wheel emissions as an equivalent ICE vehicle. By comparison, an EV powered from a 97% renewably powered grid has around nine times less well-to-wheel emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle.Given that South Africa s grid is around 84% coal-powered and that we face significant power generation shortfalls and continuous loadshedding, it s clear that we need to look at alternatives to power EVs if they are to become mainstream.In a country with as much sunshine as South Africa, solar PV is one of the best options. It s affordable, easy to install at nearly any home or office, and starts paying for itself immediately.Installing solar PV on your building to charge your EV will drastically amplify the sustainable advantage that your EV has over conventional internal combustion engine cars by reducing the total well-to-wheel emissions. In addition to helping you reduce carbon emissions, this also frees you from relying on the grid to power your EV and dramatically cuts the running costs of your EV-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

But, by 2050, heat stress induced by climate change may drastically alter this familiar picture. New findings from the International Livestock Research Institute show that, unless massive adaptation measures are put in place, the number of extreme heat events driven by climate change - especially in the continent's tropics - will increase. Poultry and pigs already face major heat stress challenges in many regions of the tropics where they are currently raised. The same is true for all five major domesticated species in large swathes of West Africa, where heat stress is likely to make it nearly impossible for livestock to be kept outdoors. Heat stress is likely to be only the beginning of the problems. Not enough is known about likely future impacts of increased climate variability on feed and forages, grazing area and water, or about shifts in climate-sensitive diseases and disease vectors and their impacts on livestock. Even under relatively mild but realistic climate scenarios, it will be necessary to reconfigure and relocate agricultural systems. This will have profound consequences for people's nutrition and well-being. Livelihoods will be threatened. The livestock sector contributes about 30-50% of agricultural GDP and supports the food security and livelihoods of about one-third of Africa's population, or about 350 million people. Livestock tends to be viewed merely as part of the climate change problem. Research focuses on mitigating the harms livestock causes. Some of these harms are very real: livestock emissions, particularly from cattle, are responsible for a significant fraction of the gases that contribute to global warming worldwide. But sub-Saharan Africa accounts for only a small part of those emissions. In the developing world, these harms are more than balanced by the good they do. Livestock provides livelihoods, nutrition and cultural capital. How, then, do we adapt to the challenges the sector faces and capitalise on the opportunities it presents? The UN climate change conference, or COP26, in Glasgow offers an opportunity to highlight these problems - and to put forward solutions. Projections show that, in the coming years, heat stress in animals will occur more frequently and for longer periods. This will affect milk and meat productivity for cattle, small ruminants, pigs and poultry across East Africa. This will make much of the region unsuitable for exotic pig, poultry and cattle production. Rising heat and humidity are already causing a drop in Tanzanian dairy cattle's milk yields, hitting the income of smallholder dairy farmers. In Uganda, heat stress levels are high and increasing. By the end of the century over 90% of Ugandan districts will experience severe heat stress, putting the livelihoods of pig producers and sustainability of the pig sector as a whole at risk. The International Livestock Research Institute has started to address these risks in various ways. The Index Based Livestock Insurance programme protects livestock keepers in drought-prone arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya and Ethiopia from climate-related losses. Unlike traditional insurance programmes, which pay out on the loss of the animal, it is tied to climatic conditions - such as the amount of rainfall and distribution of pasture availability - over a season. By tying the payouts to objective criteria, the programme avoids the moral hazards of traditional insurance programmes while giving herders the resources to help their animals survive periods of sustained crisis. Rangeland ecology in East and West Africa rationalises land use and protect livelihoods. Community land management programmes help resolve conflicts between land users.Recent modelling of heat stress impacts is one of our efforts to understand the impacts of climate change. In Ethiopia's arid pastoral Afar region, pastoralists are experiencing increased flooding and drought and an overall shift in seasonal weather patterns. In response, they are shifting from large to small ruminants, and changing their grazing and feed management systems. In Kenya's central rift valley, farmers who practise mixed crop and dairy farming have begun to experiment with different feed production and preservation strategies to overcome feed shortages in the prolonged dry seasons. Building climate-resilient livestock systems to cope with these challenges requires concerted, coordinated action from investors and policymakers at the national and global levels. This will need to be informed by a solid research base that scientists have only started to assemble with the minimal funds allocated so far. Unfortunately, because of donor priorities, most research attention to date has focused on mitigating the contributions of livestock production to climate change rather than adapting to its consequences - even though the priority in African countries is adaptation. Where there has been adaptation research, it has focused primarily on climate-induced impacts on cropping systems rather than on livestock. Researchers need to develop a toolbox of effective adaptation practices, technologies and policies that are robust across different scales, priorities and climate futures. They must also work with funders and governments to prioritise investments in the livestock sector. It's not just technical inputs that are needed, but institutional change in the way that livestock are viewed by funders and governments. This will require a considerable evidence base. Unfortunately, we are very far from these goals. Consider that between 2012 and 2017, $185.8bn was dedicated to climate-related development projects worldwide, with only 0.57%devoted to the livestock sector. COP26\l"

Various fund managers and sovereign funds have withdrawn planned investment in fossil fuels, while banks and financial institutions are becoming reluctant to fund such projects.Mantashe said an independent audit of the project's environmental impact was conducted in 2020 and the findings were shared with all interested parties and no objections were received. He also questioned the motives for the protests.""Could it be possible that this is an extreme pure love for the environment or an unrelenting campaign to ensure that Africa and South Africa do not see the investment inflows they need?""There was ""no conclusive evidence and/or scientific research globally that demonstrates that seismic surveys have caused irreparable harm to marine life, including mammals and fish"", Mantashe said.Climate change lobby groups, including Greenpeace, the Border Deep Sea Angling Association and the Kei Mouth Ski Boat Club last week failed in a bid to halt the project after the high court in Makhanda ruled they had failed to provide sufficient evidence that the seismic survey would cause irreparable environmental harm. Still, the dispute carries potential reputational risk for the oil company, which last week was forced to abandon a plan to develop an oilfield off the Scottish coast.Mantashe said the project - it involves firing shockwaves underwater and into the seabed - is expected to contribute to SA's economy, which has shed more than 1-million jobs since 2020 and has an unemployment rate of almost 35%.""Let's not be an island of anti-development in SA. We must be part of the world and play in the level field like everyone else,"" he said. ""SA's economic development is oppressed in the name of environmental protection when we have environmental framework that ensures that licensing is done with the utmost environmental care.""He said a successful survey could ease SA's reliance on coal to meet its energy demands as the country moves to a ""lower carbon economy as it has been scientifically proven that it [oil and gas] has lower emissions than other combustible fuels"".Melita Steele, Greenpeace Africa's interim programme manager said approval for the survey ""is a clear case of putting profits before people.""SA scientists have made it clear that there is a growing body of evidence that points to the harms that seismic blasting can cause for marine mammals, from whales to plankton and we know there will also be negative impacts.""It is not the first time Mantashe has found himself at odds with Eastern Cape communities over activities by international companies on their land. In 2019, he faced criticism from the Xolobeni community after saying he intended to appeal against a court ruling that his department first get approval from the local community before any mining exploration permits were awarded. The area is rich in titanium and was targeted by an Australian company. Mantashe said at the time the ruling risked handing over licensing in the mining sector from the state to communities, which he believed was potentially chaotic.maekot@businesslive.co.zaPushingthe survey: Energy minister Gwede Mantashe says a successful survey off the Wild Coast could lead to easing SA's reliance on coal to meet its energy demands.

SA's carbon intensity - it is the 12th-largest emitter in the world - and its high potential for the production of renewable energy as well as green hydrogen make it a good candidate for a globally funded effort to reduce greenhouse gases. However, while there is at least one concrete proposal on the table, made by Eskom, as well as other more ambitious proposals by expert technical groups, neither the SA government nor the envoy delegation would comment on the potential for a specific transaction. Energy policy in SA is highly contested and political, and the issues related to Eskom's capacity, especially its heavy debt burden, make it a complex environment in which to strike a deal. The visit has been convened by the British high commission and will be led by UK climate envoy John Murton. Envoys for the US, France, Germany and the EU are also included. Three days of talks are scheduled with key cabinet ministers, business, labour and other stakeholders. The British high commission's head of climate and energy, John Wade-Smith, said the idea is to initiate a broad conversation about SA's transition to cleaner energy in a manner that is just and takes account not only of changing energy technologies but also the social impact on communities. ""There is quite a lot of opportunity in SA's energy transition. We want to better understand how we can support that in a manner that is consistent with what SA wants to achieve,"" he said. The lead ministry from the SA side is environment, forestry & fisheries. A spokesperson, Albi Modise, last week said the visit would ""assess opportunities for enhanced co-operation around a just energy transition ... The developed economies have a responsibility to fund the just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate-resilient society."" COP26 In the interim, Eskom has proposed its own modest energy transition, which will entail a slightly accelerated decommissioning of Eskom power stations than that mapped out in the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), the government's long-term energy plan. In terms of the plan, eight power stations will be decommissioned (which would in fact amount to somewhat of an acceleration as the plan is lagging behind) and a ninth (Tutuka) would be decommissioned earlier than scheduled. In return, Eskom hopes to raise concessional climate change funding from international development funding institutions to make essential investments in the national grid. These are required to connect renewable energy and to build 7,400MW of its own renewable energy and battery storage. The head of Eskom's just energy transition office, Mandy Rambharos, said the utility has been talking to overseas development finance institutions for some time. ""Our hope is that coming out of the envoys' visit funders will see that Eskom is committed to decarbonising, but that we also need financing to do that. Due to our debt situation we need highly concessional funding. We are hoping to get a little more of a financial commitment,"" she said. The department of mineral resources & energy did not respond to a request for comment. Minister Gwede Mantashe has previously said it would be foolish for SA to retire its coal assets prematurely, because coal is one of its important strategic advantages. Business Unity SA CEO Cas Coovadia said business is committed to achieving a more sustainable energy mix in a way that minimises job losses and creates possibilities for new employment in new industries. ""The meeting with the envoys comes just over a month before the COP meeting, where we will be pushing for developed countries to make good on their commitment in the COP16 Accord to mobilise $100bn a year to address the needs of developing countries in their adaptation and mitigation efforts,"" he said.\l"

A key finding highlighted in the report is that the latest climate modelling studies for Africa reveal that the likely increase in temperature due to climate change is higher than for previous models.-Following the release of the report, the world s attention will now focus on Glasgow, Scotland when the UN will host 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) from 31 October to 12 November 2021. The COP26 summit brings together a range of global stakeholders to accelerate implementation of the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Paris Agreement aims to keep the average temperature increase to below 1.5 degrees Celsius and reach zero net global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.Developing Johannesburg s Climate Action PlanThis has motivated several cities like Johannesburg to set more ambitious climate change targets. Johannesburg s Climate Action Plan (CAP), developed between 2018 and 2020, aims for net-zero emissions and a resilient city by 2050. In this work, the city has been supported by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group through its Climate Action Planning Programme and Zutari, a local engineering consultancy firm.The Johannesburg CAP notes that, prior to the Paris Agreement, the city was already at the forefront of low-carbon development and resilience planning.

The existing and planned actions scenario was informed by current national, regional and local policies and programmes, as well as market trends, adjusted downwards based on certainty of implementation. The ambitious actions scenario, on the other hand, was informed by discussions, iterative follow-up communications and check-ins with relevant departments and other entities to identify an ambitious but realistic set of key actions that can be implemented.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/703/220780.html :EMBED-->Under the BAU scenario, emissions for Johannesburg are projected to grow by 133% by 2050, with the fastest growth in stationary energy, followed by transport.

Global warming, that is quite serious. We should pay more attention. Time never stands still, he said in a video message to the world leaders who are assembling in Glasgow from today to November 12 to discuss the best ways of tackling the climate crisis. So we are also part of that nature. The past is important, but it is already past.  So we can learn, otherwise we have no ability to change the past.  But the future is still in our hands. The damage to the ozone layer was reduced when we modified our behaviour.  The world belongs to all of us, so we need to stop consuming out of greed and be mindful of our action, the globetrotting elderly Buddhist monk warned. We must take care of the environment as a part of our daily life. Reiterating his concerns on the effects of climate change impacting the Tibetan Plateau \- the world\' s  third pole \- the Nobel Peace Laureate said:  At least in Asia, Tibet is the ultimate source of water. All major rivers of Pakistan, India\' s Ganga river and Brahmaputra, and China\' s Yellow river and Vietnam\' s Mekong river originate there, he noted.  We should pay more attention to preservation of Tibetan ecology, he said. This is not only in the interest of 67 million Tibetans but whole people in this area. Our life is hundred years, average. So we have to take serious concern about our century. Of course I am a monk, no children, but those people who have children and grandchildren, you have to take seriously their future.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa358","Debt guarantees a hurdle in green deal","October 22, 2021 Friday","Business Day (South Africa)","Debt guarantees a hurdle in green dealStrings attached to funding a just transition emerge as central difficulty in talks with envoys Debt strings snarl up green dealThe ability to repay any loan that is made to SA will be vital for a guarantee to be issuedEditor at Large The conditions attached to green finance, particularly the requirement for Treasury guarantees, are emerging as a central difficulty as SA seeks to secure a just transition transaction with developed countries ahead of the COP26 conference in Glasgow in November.Climate envoys from the UK, US, Germany and France in September met members of the cabinet as well as Eskom and other stakeholders to discuss a transaction that would provide grant and concessional funding to support the transition to a low-carbon economy.However, Business Day has learnt that the grant funding on offer was disappointingly small, in the region of $200m, which has since the initial meeting increased to $250m. The countries made clear they would require government guarantees for bilateral funding coming from their national development finance institutions.But SA's high national debt burden as well as Eskom's inability to take on more debt at this point, given its unsustainable balance sheet, are posing difficulties in reaching a deal.The presidential climate commission, the stakeholder body established by President Cyril Ramaphosa to negotiate a ""just transition"", received a high-level briefing from the presidency on Thursday. But despite pressure from commission deputy chair Valli Moosa, few details of the proposals were publicly revealed.Rudi Dicks, head of the project management office in the presidency, said the government envisages the establishment of a just energy transition fund, through which funding for all aspects of the transition would flow. Eskom, for instance, is unable to raise funding without the permission of the SA sovereign. He said, though, that the cabinet ministers who had been involved in the talks with the envoys, led by environmental affairs, forestry & fisheries minister Barbara Creecy, were concerned about the conditions attached to their proposal.Dicks said: ""There is a lot of concern that there is very little grant finance. A lot has been spoken about concessional finance but the [degree of] concessionality of that is not always quite clear. Is it, for example, at 0% interest or close to that? After how many years do we need to make a first repayment? Does it require [faster] repurposing of coal plants?""Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane, who also attended the commission meeting, said SA had to be cautious about the risks involved in green financing, as it was still money that had to be repaid.""We have to take into account the conditionalities, obviously making sure that we get the best deal for the country. As we access finance, we need to consider our national debt, which is heading towards 80% to 90% of GDP, plus Eskom's R400bn or so of debt. Then we are talking about several more billion. It is the balancing of that which is going to be quite critical in terms of our just transition programme,"" he said.Other institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank, are also considering concessional green financing and these terms also need to be looked at.Finance minister Enoch Godongwana has previously said he would not have any objection to Eskom using its existing guarantee space - of which there is about R40bn - in raising green finance. But this is unlikely to be anywhere near sufficient.Dicks said initial estimates of the cost of the first phase of the transition involve funding for Eskom amounting to R400bn over 10 years; funding for the transition to electric vehicle manufacturing (R150bn); and an initial estimated cost of the establishment of a green hydrogen manufacturing industry of $850m, with scenarios of between $119bn and $145bn over the next 15 to 25 years.In an interview after the meeting, Mogajane said additional guarantees for green financing are not a deal breaker for the Treasury.""Something will have to give. The question is, can Eskom take on more debt? Guarantees are a contingent liability and we have to approach them carefully. In issuing a guarantee, the key question to answer is, 'Will the entity be able to repay its loan?' The fiscal liability committee that recommends to the minister whether to grant a guarantee or not considers this issue first.""Eskom is unable to service its R400bn debt from revenue and has been dependent on grants from the fiscus to do so for the past three years. At most, its balance sheet is able to sustain about R200bn of debt.SA, as well as other developing countries, have emphasised that they require substantial financial support from the developed world to transition to a low-carbon economy. At COP21, developed nations promised $100bn a year for five years to assist.Creecy said not all of this funding had been mobilised and about $75bn-$80bn of a combination of grant and private finance had been made available. This money is available strictly for mitigation and not for adaptation, which is desperately required by the developing world on which the disastrous effects of climate change are being disproportionally visited.The demand for adaptations funding as well as for mitigation funding beyond 2025 will be at the heart of SA's negotiating position in Glasgow, she said.Whether the conference is able to mobilise the funds to which developed nations have already committed will be ""the big determinant as to whether COP26 will be successful"".patonc@businesslive.co.za\l"
"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa359","Minister Barbara Creecy: Launch of a Research Publication","South African Official News"," ","At the outset allow me to thank the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA) for the invitation extended to me to share insights on a Just Transition Framework for South Africa.United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described the climate emergency as the defining issue of our time, arguing that the shocks resulting from climate change not only damage the environment on which we depend, they also weaken our political, economic and social systems.Concern for the climate crisis is no longer confined to multilateral institutions or the non-governmental sector. This year, the World Economic Forum's annual Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) identified climate action failure, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as the top three of the top ten global risks by severity over the next ten years.Government, in considering the climate risk in our own context, has identified two categories of risk to our economy and our society.The first category of risk is a physical one. Scientific evidence indicates that sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change and is warming at twice the global average rate. This means that the average temperature increase is already above two degrees in our region.Apart from temperature increase, climate change causes severe storms, drought, and sea level rise. These pose a risk to our food and water security, built environment and human and animal health. The second category of risk we face is the transition risk - the global transition to a low-carbon economy has begun and will continue. Countries that are investing significantly in low carbon technologies are seeking to protect their investments with a range of non - tariff and border tax adjustments.Unless we join the technological transition taking place across the globe, our economy risks of being left behind, and in due course facing redundancy and/or non-competitiveness of our exports in a trade environment that favours goods and services produced in a low carbon environment. Our research indicates that this transition risk will affect major sectors of our economy including energy, mining, agriculture, transport and manufacturing.A concrete example of the threats that lie ahead is the recent decision by the European Union to ban the import of motor vehicles with internal combustion engines from 2035.Conscious of both the physical and transition risks, and the decision by more than 12 of our major trading partners to a 2050 net zero emissions target, our National Development Plan has a commitment to building a low carbon economy and climate resilient society by mid - century.South Africa as a signatory to the Paris Accord, has a responsibility to respond to all three goals relating to temperature, financial and resilience targets. We must pursue policies to achieve these goals and to ensure that our approach reflects both progress and enhanced ambition.Over the last two and a half years we have steadily put in place the architecture to pursue the Paris goals. Our revised Nationally Determined Contribution to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions was submitted to the UNFCCC in October last year. The range of the reduction has the two degree temperature increase as its upper limit. The lower limit is compatible with keeping temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.The Climate Bill was approved by Cabinet for submission to the National Assembly last year. We are working with seven sectors of our economy to set sectoral emission targets and the mechanisms to monitor compliance once low emission pathways are defined.To enhance domestic financing of the transition, National Treasury has introduced the carbon tax, and I must say we welcome the announcements made by Minister Godongwana yesterday on the proposed trajectory for the carbon tax over the next ten years.The National Adaptation Strategy has been adopted and we are working with municipalities across the country to mainstream climate resilience into municipal planning and budgeting.Central to our government's understanding of the role and place of our transition to a low carbon economy and climate resilient society is the understanding that this transition will only succeed if it helps us not just to address climate risk but to also address broader development challenges.When government included green technology in the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery plan, we understood that this sector can open up new sectors for energy generation, mining, manufacturing and the agricultural sector. But we are also clear that it must also help us with our broader objectives of re-industrialisation, localisation, economic inclusion and most importantly, job creation.The second aspect of our understanding of the climate transition is the concept of climate justice. This means that workers and communities in sectors most effected by the transition, cannot carry a disproportionate burden of the technological changes.A central aspect of identifying transition pathways must be addressing the transitional processes facing workers and communities and how they will be an integral part of developing and benefitting from new industries and enterprises, so that no one is left behind.In this regard, we fully agree with the point made in the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Perception Survey that, and I quote, 'the least disruptive climate transition measures will be those that holistically integrate the needs of individuals, societies, businesses and planet.'And so we have said that our just transition towards a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society must happen in a manner that does not impede socio-economic development, is socially just and results in an increase in sustainable jobs.The Just Transition is not a sudden shift in economic activity but must occur in a conscious, researched and phased manner over time.Equally important, it must be characterised by the active involvement of workers and communities who will be impacted upon by the transition in defining both the objectives and road map of the transition.It is for this reason that the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) has been established and driven by the Presidency to ensure a focused drive on the Just Transition, particularly identifying pathways for all sectors and buy-in by all stakeholders.From a national government point of view, we are clear that a central starting place for our low carbon transition must be our energy sector. Eskom generates eighty-eight percent of our energy from coal fired power stations and is responsible for over forty percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.This sector not only poses a significant risk to future economic competitiveness, it also offers new opportunities to promote access to new sources of cheaper and reliable energy and take advantage of our natural resources (sun and wind), and the opportunities offered by international cooperation under the Paris Agreement.The vulnerability of the coal sector emphasises the importance of our concept of a Just Transition. This is where both our power utility and our country are now entering new and unchartered territory on just exactly how we will ensure workers and communities in the coal value chain are both active framers and beneficiaries of the climate transition.To support this process, Eskom has already completed socio- economic studies at three power stations namely Komati, Grootvlei and Hendrina and we have secured funding for seven more studies of stations scheduled for decommissioning by 2030.These studies focus on the conditions in the plants themselves, in surrounding communities and in the broader environment. They analyse direct and indirect job losses and opportunities for repurposing, re-skilling and retraining and the development of new local industries and new job creation.Early findings from the completed studies suggest that repurposing can prevent any direct job losses in stations due for decommissioning. Furthermore, indirect job losses could be more than compensated for with a conscious and deliberate programme to develop downstream industries in related technologies and components.Because Eskom believes we can only learn the true meaning of what is involved in a Just Transition from doing so, Komati Power Station is the proof of concept project where Eskom is piloting the repowering of a station on existing Eskom land. To reach this point, households, organised labour, business, community formations and NGOs have been actively involved in conceptualising the project.This project involves the current installation of an agrivoltaics plant and a microgrid assembly plant. Eskom is completing the engineering studies to confirm the capacities of PV and Battery storage that will be installed in the next 12-28 months.Obviously to implement Eskom's transition is going to take resources, and so by way of conclusion let me say a few words about the offer made to South Africa of $8.5 billion from a number of developed countries on the side l"

We have seen recently that the world is not on course to limit warming to as close to 1.5\'baC degrees as possible, as laid out in the Paris Agreement, Uganda\' s Water and Environment Minister Sam Cheptoris was reported as saying. This increases the risk of severe impacts at a moment in which we are looking to grow quickly. For Africa, this is a generational crisis and one we will have to adapt to. In the face of the climate crisis, Africa must come together and chart a course to low-emission growth that is good for all Africans and the world. According to a UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released in August, the rate of surface temperature increase has generally been more rapid in Africa than the global average, with human-induced climate change being the dominant driver. | \l"

She spoke to Business Day on Friday.On the relationshipbetween the UK and SA:This is my second full week on the job and it has been anthe relationship between SA and the UK is so important. We have strong ties, we have verydeep shared values and [are] the largest country investing in SA. Trade between the UK andSA in 2020 was about \£38bn.Progress ahead of the COP26 conference:Thetiming of this is very important too because we are just a month away from COP, which isonly announced its nationally determined contribution (NDC) but also raised it and hasbeen ambitious with it.the moment is largely [reliant] on coal and is also unstable and that's why lastnight, the lights went out. That's disruptive to the manufacturing industry andpeople's lives. On the positive side, there are huge potential benefits living in acountry that has so much ability to harness renewables, especially solar and wind power. Discussions on Eskom:I had a lengthy meeting with our COP envoy. Theylooking at how you could stabilise Eskom to a position where you can start working on thattransition to bring in those renewable alternatives. I'm very hopeful and excitedfor the next few weeks, which will of course be critical as we move towards COP.There's a partnership of different countries and funding partners working togetherto help SA achieve what SA has said they want to achieve. That funding package ... Ican't get ahead of the game here but just to say that there's very seriousdiscussions going on.President [Cyril] Ramaphosa is absolutely clear he wants to grasp that opportunity.Britain, of course, is playing a really important role. We are hosting the conference andcan I just say that an enormously intense amount of work is being done. And the fact thatwe've had the COP envoy in SA with his team shows how important resolving thisissue is, for the whole of the globe.On policy uncertainty and mixed messagesfrom SA:The important thing is that the president has announced with the cabinetthat [increased] NDC. What we can do as friends and partners is help to bring othermembers of the international community together to say 'how do we help SA meetthat?' We know that the SA economy needs electricity, it needs stable electricity,and the SA people need that as well.The conversations that are happening throughthe COP envoy and with other countries are happening at the highest possible level to makesure that everybody is focusing on helping SA deliver that contribution that you say youwant to make.On SA's red listing by the UK:Having been herelistening to people, I really understand how important it is that we work to reopen thattravel.

This is absolutely horrific. In all my years I have never experienced anything like this, she said. There was a time where seals were dying more frequently than usual but this is something else. The conservationist said ocean pollution needs to be addressed urgently. The reduction of plastics and its damage to the environment was raised at the recent COP26 climate summit.Krynauw believed plastic in the ocean was a big contributor to the death and health of seals. The amount of disentanglement we face is horrific. There are massive ships in the ocean causing sea creatures to venture off their natural migration path too, she said.She added:  There is a combination of problems contributing to it. We need to identify what the main issue is. Krynauw said the ocean was in a terrible state which has repercussions on sea creatures. Our oceans are in so much trouble. This is something to be concerned about. Krynauw took ownership of the Hout Bay Seal Rescue Centre, a non-profit company in 2019, formerly known as Seal Alert.Krynauw pleaded with people who spotted the seals to leave them alone. Don\' t let your dogs harass them. Walk around it, respect the fact that they\' re lying on the beach. They are in a weakened state and don\' t need to be dragged toward or out of the ocean, she said.She added:  Respect your environment and all that live in it. Krynauw said the increasing death of seals was worrying. In the last year, we noticed many malnourished seals and convulsing seals. We performed an autopsy and it showed that they have low body fat and that they are starving. Krynauw said the convulsions were caused by hypoglycemia. I don\' t know what more can be done aside from getting more resources to speed up the testing and investigation, she said.Founder and chief executive at AfriOceans and marine conservationist Lesley Rochat agreed. All existing possible causes need to be considered and investigated, thoroughly. This includes lack of resources or food due to over-exploitation, as well as climate change effects on the distribution of migratory species which seals feed on. Rochat highlighted documented changes in the availability of prey species in the Benguela current, due to overfishing and climate change. These seals feed predominantly on small, migrating schooling fish at depths of less than 50 metres, she said.She added:  Studies have shown that female seals are exceeding their aerobic dive limits, diving deeper to find fish as stocks decl"

However, the recommended path would be a tough one for South Africa to follow, considering the country's heavy reliance on coal.- Given the current South African coal-dominated electricity generation context, the IEA milestone targets will prove a lot more difficult to achieve than most other countries, says Lethabo Manamela, interim CEO of the South African National Energy Development Institute (Sanedi). Among others, the report, Net Zero by 2050: A roadmap for the global energy sector, recommends that by 2030, all sub-critical coal fired power plants must be phased out and by 2050, global coal use must be 90% lower than in 2020.However, Manamela adds that there is reason for hope. Recent signals from the state president, together with the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE), other government ministries, Eskom and the private sector, show a clear commitment by all the major decision-makers to achieve this target. She adds that this, however, must take place within a just energy transition (JET) framework, which appears to be gaining a lot of momentum in the country and is sure to be a big focus of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26).Considering SA's socioeconomic landscape The socioeconomic situation in South Africa brings with it both a number of challenges, but also a lot of opportunities. That is why the emphasis placed on JET in South Africa is so important. The new opportunities brought about by a transition to newer, more modern and clean technologies provide with it the opportunity to introduce many more innovative skills into the economy, which will go a long way in reducing the high unemployment levels, especially amongst the youth, and it can potentially get the economy moving in the right direction, says Manamela. She adds that South Africa has many good news initiatives in place to report on at COP26.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/219254.html :EMBED-->For example, phase two of the carbon tax, due for implementation at the beginning of 2023, will see a radically different carbon pricing regime that will accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. Added to that, there is the envisaged growth in the hydrogen economy which, if successful, could see a major shift in the local energy landscape in the medium term. In addition, Sanedi has been involved in the implementation of the recently gazetted regulations on energy performance certificates (EPCs) for buildings, which will see building owners prioritising their energy efficiency initiatives in the coming years. Finally, President Cyril Ramaphosa s increase in the licence threshold for people to generate power from 1MW to 100MW is another step in the right direction. While the road to net-zero is sure to be a challenge for South Africa, we are up for this challenge. With many initiatives already in place, there is reason for hope as we work together to combat climate change. Sanedi looks forward to continuing its work in transforming our local energy sector to one which is sustainable, reliable and economically inclusive, Manamela concludes.-{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

They reflect quite clearly that SA is in an economic emergency. We have measures in place to put the country on a more stable growth path but everything is taking too long. And the more we stall on easing red tape and expediting processes, the worse our situation becomes.Soon after news that the official unemployment rate had climbed to 34.9% in the third quarter, up from 34.4%, Stats SA's GDP figures showed the economy contracted 1.5% in the same period. Not only was that worse than economists had forecast, it was the third-weakest GDP outcome in a quarter since 1993. The two worst periods were in the thick of the global financial crisis in quarter one of 2009 and then in quarter two of 2020, when the country was in the first, hard lockdown.What's particularly alarming is the retail trade and hospitality sector, which shrank 5.5%, as well as manufacturing, which contracted 4.2%, while factory output in October dropped a dramatic 8.8% year on year.Retail trade and hospitality businesses are set for further hardship as they face a third successive holiday season of operating under restrictions, while this December's tourism sector was wrecked by the latest international travel bans, with R1bn in bookings having been cancelled in the first week after the Omicron variant was first detected by SA scientists, according to a survey by the Southern Africa Tourism Services Association.In October, Cosatu called for the government to implement the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) in its totality. Cosatu's second deputy-president, Louisa Thipe, told Business Day that at alliance meetings, summits and lekgotlas, the labour federation consistently raised the need to expedite implementation of economic reforms and that the slow implementation of the ERRP should be tackled.Business conveys similar messages in each of its interactions with the government and so has the IMF. It's not the first time it has chided the government gently for its tardiness. Speaking after meetings with the government, organised business and state-owned enterprise officials, the IMF said the government is moving too slowly on implementing structural reforms on energy (embracing renewable energy sources), telecommunications (releasing new radio frequency spectrum), transport (opening ports to private sector investors), reducing red tape for businesses, tackling systemic corruption and paring down the degree of state ownership in SA.""Structural rigidities are depressing private investment and hindering inclusive growth and job creation. These rigidities need to be tackled immediately to increase the economy's productivity and competitiveness and reduce poverty and inequality,"" the IMF wrote in its statement.There's much the government needs to do to accelerate everything, ranging from easing red tape wherever it can to expediting the bid windows for the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme.But one area where we can't afford to suffer from similar foot-dragging is in allocating the $8.5bn package committed at COP26 for funding our transition to a low-carbon economy and getting the money to the intended beneficiaries as speedily as possible, while maintaining strict oversight.The bulk of the funding is likely to go towards supporting Eskom's own transition plan, which includes generating new energy from renewable sources. This needs to happen urgently because we need to increase our power supply as fast as possible in every way we possibly can, be that energy generated from independent producers or by Eskom itself.Let's see a sense of urgency from the government on that issue as well as the ERRP. To paraphrase the IMF, get a move on.Mavuso is CEO of Business Leadership SA.\l"

That's not only because we're reaching a point of no return when it comes to the rise in global temperature, it's because the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties - commonly known as COP26 - is due to take place in November in Glasgow.COP26 is widely considered the last chance for governments to combat the global climate catastrophe. In the wake of the pandemic, the summit will offer world leaders the chance to reimagine how their countries can bounce back with greener, sustainable economies.It'll also be the first time that signatories of the landmark Paris Agreement all gather together. Adopted by nearly 200 nations in 2015, it legally binds them to hold global temperature rise to below 2C.Quite rightly, in the lead up to COP26, focus is on tracking the progress signatories have made towards meeting those targets, as there's no denying that failure to reduce emissions will result in cataclysmic climate impacts.But on this World Environment Day on June 5, it needs to be highlighted that for millions of people, climate change is not some threat in a far-off future, but a reality they're facing right now. Significantly, the Paris Agreement, while heralded as a moment of unity in providing a global game plan to tackle one of the biggest challenges of our time, the playing field for dealing with climate change, isn't level at all.It is vulnerable communities in the world's poorest countries who've done the least to contribute to the climate emergency that are the ones living with its severe effects. Take Mozambique, whose CO2 emissions in 2017 were 7.7 million tonnes. But in that same year, the UK released 379 million tonnes of CO2 - 50 times as much. 1Yet in 2018, Mozambique's capital Maputo almost ran out of water following three years of drought. And a year later, the country experienced unprecedented, widespread, and devastating flooding. Access to clean water is one of the fundamental ways the climate crisis impacts on communities. 2.2 billion people do not have a reliable and safe supply of water, and climate change is making it harder for them to get clean water.Extreme weather events caused by climate change, such as prolonged droughts, dry up water sources, while rising sea levels and flooding pollute poorly protected water supplies. More people - often women and girls- are having to travel farther for water.Susmita Mandal Jana, 22 is a housewife, living in the Madhab Nagar area of Sundarbans, West Bengal. A round trip to collect water takes her one hour, and she crosses a rickety bridge over a canal about two to three times a day - while carrying heavy water containers.Frequent phenomenon in the area are high tides, which can be a consequence of rising sea levels. When they occur, the canal gushes with water, making the walk over the bridge even more perilous. Susmita says: ""The water quality is not good either. This water that I collect now is salty.""Despite the UN climate process, currently, only 5% of total global climate cash is spent helping countries adapt to the changing climate 2, and that money isn't even getting through to communities most vulnerable to climate change.But as it's communities on the frontl"

In July, Nigeria received its first six A-29 Super Tucano planes four years after the United States agreed to sell the light attack aircraft to fight insurgents.But analysts say Buhari has made little progress tackling corruption that has eroded the country's infrastructure or abuses by the security services.Blinken's final leg is Senegal, considered one of Africa's most stable democracies, where the focus will be on leaders and female entrepreneurs.The post HYPERLINK https://www.defenceweb.co.za/joint/diplomacy-a-peace/security-climate-dominate-as-us-secretary-of-state-kicks-off-africa-tour/Security, climate dominate as US Secretary of State kicks off Africa tour appeared first on HYPERLINK https://www.defenceweb.co.zadefenceWeb\l"

Nowhere is this truer than for women in the face of climate change,"" says Patricia Scotland, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.COP26, shows how underrepresentation of women in climate policies and plans, poor access to climate finance, technologies, and lack of capacity for effective decision-making compounds inequality.The lack of representation also creates a barrier to women fully contributing to climate action, reinforcing the circle, and continuing vulnerability.However, the report also showed that countries are increasingly acknowledging the vulnerability and inequality of women in climate action, taking concrete steps to address it.At the heart of the review is a macro-level overview of the extent of gender integration in NDCs - the technical term for national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement - in Commonwealth member countries. The study covered both 'intended' NDCs, and new or revised NDCs submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) before 26 July 2021.Overall, 65 percent of Commonwealth countries included gender as a cross-cutting or mainstreaming priority in new or updated NDCs.""Without women, these commitments to limit global warming won't be reached,"" says Scotland, adding that the Commonwealth Secretariat has undertaken to strengthen gender engagement within the respective NDCs of its 54 member states.Countries have also identified challenges, particularly in finance, where international support is urgently needed.""The Kingdom of Eswatini recognises gender as a cross-cutting issue with the National Development Strategy and National Development Policy calling for the mainstreaming of gender equity,"" says Duduzile Nhlengethwa-Masina, Director of the Eswatini Meteorological Service in the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs.""In developing the NDC, we specifically engaged gender and women groups.

Every person loses about two years of life on average because of air pollution, according to the air quality life index, published in an annual report by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute. The UN Environment Programme says nine out of 10 people in the world breathe polluted air, and about seven-million die as a result yearly. The World Health Organisation also estimates about seven million die each year from exposure to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system. The UN says air pollution is caused mostly by human activities such as driving cars, heavy-duty diesel-powered trucks and buses, and burning coal. As noted at the recent COP26 in Glasgow, limiting global warming is critical if poor nations are to avoid more disasters such as floods, deadly fires and droughts. So much for the obvious warnings: No wonder SA's retailers are seeking ways to respond to the UN climate change goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5& xBA;C. Shoprite - SA's biggest retailer - is leading the way in waving goodbye to diesel-powered refrigerated trucks and trailers as part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. It began to decarbonise its growing fleet of refrigerated trucks and trailers in 2017. Sanjeev Raghubir, Shoprite group sustainability manager, said the retailer had more than 1,300 trailers in its fleet; of these, 885 are fitted with solar-powered units. ""This is a continuous process as new trucks are acquired annually,"" he said. The nonsolar-powered trailers in the fleet are traditional refrigerated trailers, with diesel-powered cooling units. The diesel is saved from the reduced idling of trucks and reduced CO& xB2; emissions, and opting for a natural refrigerant (nitrogen). By equipping trailers with solar panels, trucks can be switched off while refrigeration and the tailgate lift are still able to run on solar power. Raghubir said for nonrefrigerated trailers, the company used two 325Wp (watt peak) solar panels. For refrigerated trailers, four 325Wp solar panels are used to generate energy stored in batteries, and this energy is used to move nitrogen around to cool the trailers. The nitrogen is refilled at Shoprite's depots, similar to the traditional cooling system where diesel has to be replenished. Shoprite is also using other technologies to ensure its trucks and trailers are decarbonised. The retailer uses cameras to monitor truck and trailer activity, remote locking and unlocking of trailers, plus remote temperature monitoring. ""This project is part of our wider environmental sustainability and climate change strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... cost savings and reduce noise,"" Raghubir said.

File pictureA TEN-megawatt solar plant in the Northern Cape has reached commercial operation three months ahead of schedule, providing clean energy to Amazon Web Services via the Eskom grid in a new model of private energy procurement called energy wheeling.The plant is situated between Kathu and Hotazel.CEO of the Sola group, Dom Wills said that this was the first operational large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) wheeling project in South Africa.""During construction, the plant created 167 jobs, where 63 percent of the workforce was recruited from the local surrounding area. The project will sustain permanent jobs for its lifetime in electrical maintenance, cleaning and security. Wooden waste generated during construction, including pallets and electrical cable drums, were donated to local furniture businesses and special skills schools, in order to further bolster the SMME contributions of the project.""Wills stated that the plant represents the technology cutting-edge in renewable energy design.""The single axis tracking plant consists of over 24,000 bi-facial solar modules covering an area of 20 hectares in the Northern Cape, where the solar resource is one of the best in the world. The solar PV facility tracks the sun throughout the day and absorbs irradiance from both the sky and reflected light from the ground, making it more efficient. The plant design will see over 25,000 tons of carbon emissions being avoided annually \- the equivalent of taking 5,400 cars off of the road for a year.""He added that the model uses the Eskom grid to connect private buyers and sellers together.""It's the first step forward in creating grid independence where private buyers and sellers of energy can trade with each other.""Wheeling is a financial transaction that allows power to be produced in one location and billed to an energy user in another region. The plant will provide a low-carbon alternative to coal-fired power without needing to be geographically located at the site of use. This model could also help South Africa significantly in sticking to its carbon emission reductions targets, which are at the forefront of discussion ahead of the COP26 climate change in Glasgow next week.""Wills stated that the launch of the solar plant symbolised the positive stance taken recently by the Department of Minerals and Energy, Nersa and Eskom towards renewable energy generation.""This has great potential to solve South Africa's energy crisis and reduce electricity costs.

If the US and China cannot work together on this issue, they cannot work together anywhere. Together, the two powers are responsible for more than HYPERLINK https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions40% of carbon dioxide emissions.Hence, many worry that without Sino-American cooperation to reduce emissions, no meaningful progress will be made. We will all be doomed. Even though both sides know that they must act rapidly to prevent a climate catastrophe, the latest evidence suggests that conventional diplomacy is not working.In the first US-China meeting of the Biden era, in Alaska in March, China's senior foreign affairs official, Yang Jiechi, launched a tirade against US secretary of state Antony Blinken after Blinken called out China's human-rights record. Then, in April, Biden's climate envoy, former secretary of state John Kerry, became the first senior administration official to visit China, where he met with his counterpart, Xie Zhenhua.

The world's response to climate change will succeed or fail on the basis of national self-interest.

Who will be first to harness the economic benefits arising from green technologies?The race for green tech will initially be about great-power rivalry. But self-preservation also will become a key factor. At what point will populations begin to see that climate inaction endangers them? How bad will conditions have to become before people demand radical change even in authoritarian states?China's national response so far has been a mixed bag. In September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the UN that his country would reach peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, putting it ahead of the US in formally committing to a target date for achieving net-zero emissions. But Chinese announcements since then have been less impressive.In Xi's UN speech this year, he broke new ground in only one area, by pledging to end China's support for https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/22/china-climate-no-new-coal-fired-power-projects-abroad-xi-jinpingcoal-fired power projects HYPERLINK 95% of such financingNonetheless, what matters in the green game is the choreography.

This also means that tackling this problem presents us with significant growth opportunities.The 16th edition of the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report is another reminder that failure to take action on climate change is the biggest risk we face as a species. In fact, it is the top risk not just by impact but also by likelihood.The Sixth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms, with science, what we have all feared to be true - that humanity has had an ""unequivocal"" influence on global warming and that widespread and rapid changes to the climate system have already begun.Every 0.1 degree of warming matters and unless urgent action is taken to decarbonise the global economy, global warming of 1.5\'b0C and even 2\'b0C (compared to pre-industrial levels) will be exceeded this century.Five years after the Paris Agreement (COP21), in which political leaders pledged nationally determined contributions to curb greenhouse gas emissions, many of those contributions are up for renewal with leaders needing to pledge ahead of COP26.COP26, we hope to see more positive news and announcements from many countries about the world.Due to the scale of the change in how we function as economies we have a rare opportunity to invest to support the step change needed.The latest International Energy Agency (IEA) report highlights that a fourfold increase in wind, solar and renewable energy capacity is required by 2030 from where we are now. It also states that by 2030 the number of electric cars on the road needs to increase by 18 times and the annual battery production for electric vehicles by 41 times. More capital must thus be spent in these areas, and the focus should shift to sustainable supply chains.The report further states that more than $4-trillion has to be spent by 2030 to have any hope of getting to net zero - a huge increase from the just less than $1-trillion that has been spent over the last few years.The IEA report focuses only on the energy system, which accounts for about two-thirds of global carbon emissions. There are additional areas that should be prioritised, including the future of food.The global population is expected to increase to 9-billion by 2050. To meet the demand associated with this number of people, food production will need to increase by 70%. It has to be achieved in a carbon-efficient way, with less land and in increasingly challenging environmental conditions.Almost 20% of global carbon emissions are derived from ""growing things"" for consumption - whether that is plants or animals - and it is becoming clear that change in agriculture, livestock and the supply chain is urgently needed to decarbonise this sector worldwide.One area in which we have carried out significant research is the decarbonisation of meat.We see potential for growth in plant and cellular-based meat because they have lower carbon emissions relative to what they are replacing in the meat supply chain. We expect this market to grow from tens of billions of dollars to $300bn by 2035.Other opportunities include the natural-based products and enzymes used in plant and cellular-based meat alternatives; and biochemicals and bio surfactants. Producers of these are helping to replace petrochemicals in many industries, for example the use of natural products to improve crop yields and resource efficiency when growing plants for consumption.It is no longer responsible or even viable to maintain current forms of agriculture, infrastructure, urban planning, land use and economic development. Climate change movements have put pressure on leaders to take action and tackle the climate crisis. What is decided by their pledges before COP26 will be key to how effective countries are at tackling the climate crisis in the next 10 years.It is our sincere hope that the findings of recent reports will galvanise far quicker political action, and leave the investment industry in no doubt that understanding how the flow of capital can help solve the climate crisis will be the single most important action of our generation.As investors, we are ready and able to provide the finance required to enable the transition to net zero, while creating opportunities for sustainable companies and investors alike.Baker is co-portfolio manager for Ninety One Global Environment.Burning planet: Events around the globe this year are underlining that much more needs to be done to address the climate crisis that is upon us. 123RF\l"

The Minister is wining and dining them to push her top priority: the lifting of a 2002 ban on the awarding of new logging concessions.The decision to lift the ban was approved this July by the Council of Ministers, presided by Pr\'e9sident F\'e9lix Tshisekedi, but an implementation decree is yet to be signed. In April, at Joe Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate, Congo's president had pledged to stop deforestation and increase forest cover by 8%.Minister Bazaiba has responded to a letter from local and international environmental and human rights groups by saying she has no lessons to learn from NGOs. She calls criticism of the lifting of the moratorium ""beyond daring for the 21st century""; the Ministry labels critics ""the beneficiaries of imperialists.""The lifting of the moratorium could open some 70 million hectares to logging - an area roughly the size of France - and its impacts would be catastrophic. With or without a ""sustainability"" label, the logging of the Congo Basin is a nightmare for the rule of law and a constant threat to local people.For millions of people who depend on the forest for their livelihoods, including Indigenous Peoples, selling it off to multinationals has meant land grabs, displacement and destitution. And bulldozing the rainforest will likely mean less rain.The Congo Basin forest is estimated to contribute more than half of the annual precipitation in Sub-Saharan Africa, an area already facing a plethora of droughts and extreme heat waves.One of the things the EU ambassadors the Minister is schmoozing ought to remind her is that no one appears to know exactly who these multinationals are.Nearly six months after the launch of an EU-funded legal review of logging titles, the lead auditor reported this month that his team still hasn't been able to pull together a list of titles... He hasn't yet glimpsed a ""so-called existing"" list; what there is is ""very incomplete."" \'c8ve Bazaiba took her time to sign the team's mission order, until two months after an intervention by the EU ambassador.Over 40 Congolese and international NGOs are still waiting for a reply to their 23 September letter to donors, warning of the impending catastrophe.In the letter they were told that lifting the moratorium in DRC, home to about 60 per cent of the Congo Basin forest, would remove the last shreds of credibility from COP15 on biodiversity in Kunming and from COP26 on climate in Glasgow.The Congo Basin forest has more than 600 tree species and 10,000 animal species, including forest elephants, lowland gorillas, bonobos, and okapi. Its vegetation is estimated to contain between 25-30 billion tons of carbon, equivalent to about four years of global anthropogenic emissions of CO2. Increased logging might mean greater risk of yet another pandemic.Just how out of it are the donors? Do they really have any clue what the current logging scene is in Congo?Over the years, one Minister after another has violated the moratorium, gratifying senior military - including an army general under EU and US sanctions for human rights abuses - and other makeshift ""logging"" firms.Bazaiba's predecessor, Claude Nyamugabo, is facing a legal challenge from Congolese civil society organisations for transferring two million hectares of illegally allocated concessions to Chinese front companies.The only shareholder of the firm that a Greenpeace Africa investigation has been able to identify is Aleksandar Voukovitch, a Belgian expat who's made his career in mining, oil and timber. He would appear to have no experience in conservation, and even less in the area of forest-rights protection.In September, the Minister missed the legal deadl"

But whereas the onus a decade ago was on rich-country governments to mobilise the money, the expectation now is that the private sector will do so.This bargain is problematic for two reasons: implicit political condescension and looming economic risks.The condescension can be summed up starkly: ""We, the rich, have messy politics, but the poor don't.""\~For example, when protesters in France pushed back against increases in fuel taxes in 2018 and 2019, the discussion focused on the difficulty of climate action and the need to accept the rollback of those taxes as an understandable consequence of democratic politics. But such latitude ends where the Global South begins. There, finance is somehow a magic bullet that overcomes social and political obstacles to climate action.The Indian government's HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-repeal-controversial-farm-laws-2021-11-19/retreat on its planned reforms of the agricultural sector, following a 15-month protest by farmers, shows how misguided this view is. One concession the farmers extracted from the government was to forestall any effort to reduce the large power subsidy they receive. The subsidy is devastatingly harmful in terms of CO2 emissions, soil quality, water availability, and atmospheric pollution. But reducing it will be fiendishly difficult, with or without external finance.More important are the bargain's economic risks. Climate change affords investors an opportunity to do global social good without sacrificing profits. ESG-related lending, which marries conscience and capital, has become a major financial fad.But mounting evidence suggests that this activity is displaying all the pathologies associated with financial manias and bubbles. Tariq Fancy, a former senior investment officer at BlackRock, has HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/24/blackrocks-former-sustainable-investing-chief-says-esg-is-a-dangerous-placebo.htmlspelled them out. Opportunities for green projects in developing countries are over-hyped. Questionable ESG standards and ratings result in fuzziness about how to measure the ESG effect of funding, as well as doubts about borrowers' incentives, given the light and back-loaded nature of penalties for noncompliance. Because finance is fungible, some firms may obtain ESG financing only to divert other sources of funding to non-ESG activities.If trillions of dollars in climate finance go to emerging markets, the flows could amount to 5% to 10% of these economies' GDP - similar to the financing surges that preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2013 ""taper tantrum"". Unregulated private capital flows of this magnitude will lead to overheating, volatility, imprudent lending and overvalued exchange rates. Eventually, when the mania is seen for what it is, costly consequences will follow: capital flows will reverse, and both output and the financial sector will collapse. We have seen this movie before in country after country, and we know how it ends. Badly.Turkey is only the latest example of financial globalisation gone wrong.

The ongoing lack of energy security and predictability in SA is causing widespread disruption to business, especially small business. Business costs are rising as power \' blackouts\' go to the next level in this country. It now also puts a serious question mark over the key growth forecasts that must form part of the forthcoming Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement due this week. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana needs to have confidence that his best forecasts of future economic growth in SA will not be weakened by uncertain extensive load shedding.There now needs to be the necessary urgency and leadership to at least identify creative short-term measures that could help to better manage and stabilise the immediate situation.Cas Coovadia, Business Unity SA (Busa) chief executive: Busa notes the calls for the resignation or termination of the Eskom executive leadership and board. Busa rejects these calls and stands with the Eskom leadership in these difficult times. It does not help to exacerbate the ongoing operational crisis by creating a leadership and governance crisis at Eskom. We are of the view that this leadership has taken tough decisions, shown remarkable openness and transparency and, critically, developed a progressive future-looking plan.Eskom\' s leadership has been clear, given the state and age of the plant, maintenance alone will not address the real and worsening supply crisis \- new capacity must urgently be added to the grid.Busa also believes we need to pull together as a country, as we demonstrated a Team SA effort at COP26, to address this crisis. The cost to the economy, including to small and medium enterprises, and the severe inconvenience and cost for citizens is becoming incalculable. Busa thus offers to mobilise capacity, as we have consistently offered to government, to work with the Eskom team to make significant progress in addressing the short-term issue of load shedding, but also to address the myriad issues at Eskom in a systemic way.Black Business Council (To read full story go to BR onl"

What really is a monumentally huge deal about the Glasgow UN COP26 meeting is its dark, unreported, obfuscated agenda that is neither science-based nor actually related to the environment.Climate change is a natural process as old as history itself. Droughts, floods, heat waves and hurricanes have occurred throughout recorded history.There were two warming periods in the past 2 000 years, which were unrelated to carbon emissions \- the Roman warming period which ended around 300AD and the Medieval one which ended around 1400.In 1920, global climate-related disasters killed 500 000. Despite the greatly increased population of our time, such human losses are exponentially no greater. Cold-related deaths are actually 40 times more common in North America. Recent scientific studies show increased ice levels in the polar regions.Steven Koonin, a New York university professor of engineering, who was Under-Secretary of Energy in Obama\' s administration, rejects global warming alarmism, pointing out that temperature fluctuations are no different than they were 60 years ago. Patrick Moore, Greenpeace founder, is adamant that there is  zero evidence that the world is in the midst of a  climate emergency . In other words, climate change is not human-driven.What the promoters of the de-carbonised, Green new deal do not state are the dark consequences of their agenda.

The Polar regions are indicative of the speed and severity of global warming and are experiencing changes faster than any other region on Earth.If the entire Greenland ice sheet were to melt, it would lead to a global sea level rise of seven metres.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa388","M&A soars during pandemic as acquirers target digital economy","December 20, 2021 Monday","Pretoria News (South Africa)/Pretoria News Weekend (South Africa)","WHILE it\' s too early for consolidated statistics on merger activity for all of 2021, available data on the first half suggests an exceptional year globally, for Africa and particularly for South Africa. A round-up of deals announced in the second half suggests even greater activity. This all points to a rising trend which augurs well for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2022.For instance, Refinitiv data shows Africa\' s M&A activity rose sharply in the first six months of 2021, with deals recorded worth more than $57.7 billion (R916.36bn), up an astounding 576 percent from $8.5bn year-on-year. And more than half of this activity was recorded in South Africa, where 169 deals worth $52bn were concluded. There were actually slightly fewer transactions, but deal value skyrocketed. Deals which were postponed in 2020 have been returning to the market, leading to a spike in value.Globally, the increase in deal activity has been just as considerable. According to Merger market\' s  Global & Regional M&A Report 1Q21 global activity in the first quarter of 2021 topped $1.16 trillion in transactions, which has been one of the most active first quarters on record.While there are a number of themes, what stands out is the technology sector\' s dominance and the continued strength of private equity. Domestically, we are seeing an international acquisition drive for South African technology companies, which were the primary targets for inbound deals in South Africa. This is all one with the major trend I expect to continue in the broader regional African market whereby African consumers are showing a penchant for technology across multiple platforms.The tech sector is leading the way in terms of high-value deals in South Africa and I expect this M&A trend to continue. The unabated growth of the digital economy across the continent has been the cause of extensive cross-sector disruption in energy, finance, health, transport, retail, and food sectors. Within technology, fintech is an area of rising popularity when it comes to investment, especially in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria.In South Africa, announcements of foreign direct investments came thick and fast in the final half. The Heineken announcement of a bid for Distell came close behind the COP26 announcement of $8.5bn renewables funding for South Africa; the R15bn investment by Vantage Data Centers in a Joburg campus; as well as a substantial investment by Chinese technology giant Huawei in its cloud computing service in South Africa. We ourselves were mandated by local tech company Sybrin to find investors to replace EOH. Does it make sense?A surge in M&A activity in the middle of a pandemic might appear counter intuitive. What we are seeing is alert companies adapting to a  new normal and looking to reposition their businesses \- driving deal activity both by divesting non-core divisions and by acquiring new capabilities.Furthermore, the record M&A volumes seen in the first half of 2021 are being driven by a highly supportive macroeconomic environment, specifi- cally a lower cost of capital provided by low interest rates. This enables acquirers to raise net debt cheaply and efficiently, to be supported by a substantial amount of  dry powder in the hands of private equity and alternative markets \- and consequently to be well positioned to move tactically for target acquisitions. We have seen a number of opportunistic deals.We ourselves at Deal Leaders International (DLI) have never been busier as 2022 dawns. M&A activity was certainly curtailed in 2020 by the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it was much less marked in 2021 and will be even less so in 2022 \- as statistics clearly demonstrate. Business South Africa has learnt to live with the ongoing global pandemic, and is well into a process of adaptation to the new normal.Covid-19 was the ultimate stress-test and among those businesses which survived and even thrived, their demonstrable long-term revenue stream visibility is attracting capital. We are seeing many medium-sized businesses looking to realign their portfolios to benefit from the post-pandemic recovery and position themselves for future growth opportunities in what will increasingly be the knowledge economy.In this environment, I expect the valuations of target companies to increase in tandem with the competition for good quality assets. My philosophy and advice when assisting a business owner to sell their business is, don\' t take a preconceived price to the market. This is demonstrated by one of our recent examples of a business for sale which had elicited interest from a number of potential local and offshore buyers. Local buyers are typically prepared to pay a price based on a four- to five-year pay back on their investment based on achieving economies of scale. In this case, we had a foreign buyer looking to make a strategic acquisition to enter the African market, and was prepared to accept a 10-year or even 15-year payback period. Consequently, they were prepared to pay double that of the local bidder.Essentially the value of your business is what the right acquirer could achieve with your business post-acquisition.Andrew Bahlmann is the chief executive: corporate advisory firm Deal Leaders International.\l"

It was Chief Seattle who once said that  We did not inherit this planet from our ancestors. We borrow it from our children. Inaction will haunt the planet for generations to come. It is evident that many will choose to ignore the report, supported by right-wing politicians, the coal industry, unenlightened industrialists and self-appointed experts, many of whom speak not from the high ground of sound technical knowledge and wisdom but from the pit of scientific illiteracy.It was Sir John Houghton, chief executive of the UK\' s meteorological office, who remarked on climate change:  Like terrorism, this weapon knows no boundaries. It can strike anywhere, in any form, a heat wave in one place, a drought, a flood or storm surge in another. The world\' s ecological health is now linked to an artificial life-support system. Irrefutable scientific evidence reveals that forests are disappearing and agricultural lands are eroding. In November 2006 in Nairobi, the UN climate change conference heard a warmer earth over the next 25 years will put at risk 65 to 95 million Africans, most of them in and around the Sahara. The UN\' s prediction prompted the intergovernmental panel on climate change to declare Africa  the continent most vulnerable to global warming .Fish stocks are rapidly diminishing. Land, water and air are being poisoned. Many species are disappearing. The planet is getting warmer, resulting in increasing super storms and dramatic changes in rainfall. We are witnessing the impact of global warming all around us. The past 100 years has seen an unprecedented retreat of glaciers all over the world and in the Alps around half of total glacier mass was lost between 1850 and 1990.In the US, the 150 glaciers that gave a name to Glacier National Park has been reduced to 48, while the ice caps of Patagonia are melting at an alarming rate, creating a deluge of freezing water up to a thousand cubic kilometres. In the Himalayas, rapidly retreating glaciers have created 40 huge lakes in Nepal and Bhutan. Hundreds more glacier-fed lakes continue to expand and threaten towns, villages and cities in Tibet, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India.When trees breathe in carbon dioxide from the air, sequester carbon, and they slowly exhale oxygen that all animals breathe. When trees are killed or chopped down for wood or burned for land, the carbon in the trees is released back into the atmosphere. Having too much carbon in the atmosphere has been proven by most scientists and researchers to cause global warming.Unfortunately, humanity is rapidly losing most of the world\' s forests. Thus, fewer forests indicate fewer trees are sequestering carbon, and more carbon is being released into the atmosphere. Thus, global climate change is increasing at an exponential rate. Even before we invented technology, we stripped the forest of Greece bare and denuded her soils.The fabled Cedars of Lebanon were gone long before the chainsaw was invented. By the middle of this century, global warming is likely to have displaced 175 million people. Diseases associated with climate change will spread globally. According to the World Health Organization, global warming can already be held directly responsible for 175 000 deaths due to malaria and other associated diseases. Countries with coastl"

While commodity enhanced revenue collection has provided some breathing room, pressure to increase spending to combat social deprivation is also climbing.That said, we still expect a well-balanced budget from Enoch Godongwana, the new finance minister, who is likely to advocate faster structural growth reforms rather than be tempted towards unsustainably large, populist spending plans.We expect the following themes to dominate:- Public sector wagesWith the FY21/22 public wage agreement wrapped up (agreeing on non-pensionable cash gratuities +0.3% of GDP as a compromise alongside a 1.5% pay progression increase), we expect the NT to continue to pencil in real growth contractions in public servants base pay over the medium-term framework. A reprioritisation of existing (not new) spending to allow for this year s gratuities will also be watched closely, we believe.- Grant systemWe expect the finance minister to put more formal clarification on the feasibility of a basic income grant in the outer years of the budget. Stark affordability concerns, an increasing debt service burden and a lack of debt stabilisation mean we expect Godongwana to rather advocate a restructuring of the existing grant framework and perhaps the introduction of a new, more targeted job-seekers grant which could look to replace the current special relief of distress grants in FY22/23. We estimate that this could cost the fiscus R30-35bn (0.5% of GDP per annum) as early as next year and would mean that social protection spending as a percentage of revenues settles 2-3pp above pre-Covid levels. More generally, though, we expect the NT to continue to call for speedier economic reforms rather than markedly increased levels of social dependence on the state.- State-owned companiesWe do not expect major announcements on large parastatals.Further hints on Eskom concessional financing arrangements and guarantee structure in the run-up to COP26While we don t expect the state-owned power utility to be granted additional capital support, we pencil in an additional (unbudgeted) R15bn (0.2% of GDP) support for smaller, financially strained SOE such as Denel, Land Bank, Sanral and state insurer, SASRIA, over the next year.It should be noted though that the MTBPS is prepared and printed well before the outcome of the local elections.\l"

A key question is how this funding issue is playing out in the SA context and what issues are cropping up in the space.Demand for sustainability-linked loans is surging, with banks competing to offer this new form of finance in SA. Webber Wentzel is being challenged to devise innovative ways to draft terms and agreements.JSE listedA sustainability-linked loan or a sustainability-linked debt security (collectively referred to as an SLL) is different from a green bond or other sustainability use of proceeds debt security.An SLL could be used for any purpose, such as making an acquisition, but the interest rate applicable is informed by the achievement of certain targets by the borrower on environmental, social and governance key indicators.Sustainability use of proceeds debt securities, on the other hand, are advanced to finance one or more green, sustainable, and social projects. A green bond, for example, is specifically lent to fund a ""green"" activity, such as building a solar plant.A green bond, like any other sustainability use of proceeds or sustainability-linked debt security, can be listed on the sustainability segment of the JSE and is available for investment by a wide group of financiers, including pension funds and asset managers.There are usually four performance indicators in a sustainability-linked loan - three are related to the environment and one is related to social factors.achieving targetsThe environmental goals are generally quite standard - improving the lender's carbon footprint, waste and water management. However, the social element is usually unique and is specifically tailored to the environment in which the borrower operates. For example, a sustainability-linked loan to a hospital might depend on achieving a specified level of patient satisfaction.These will not all be absolute goals. They could also be incremental. For example, a borrower could state its current carbon footprint is X and it intends to improve this to Y during the term of the loan - or even beyond the maturity of the loan, in which case annual targets would be set during the term of the loan and their achievement would be independently verified. Whether the borrower achieves its targets will influence the interest rate.One of the reasons banks are able to offer SLLs at favourable interest rates is related to their back-to-back funding. Entities such as the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) will provide funding to banks for onward lending at a concessional interest rate, on condition those funds are only lent to achieve sustainability objectives. Using this form of finance improves the funding costs of commercial banks, and they can offer better rates to their customers.SLLs are becoming popular in SA and we expect this trend will continue. The government can play a role in promoting sustainability-linked financing by providing more tax incentives.\l"

The nine-part thriller, in which cash-strapped contestants play childhood games with deadly consequences in a bid to win 45.6bn won (about R678bn), has become a worldwide sensation for Netflix since its launch less than a month ago. The dystopian drama has inspired countless memes, Halloween costumes of the ubiquitous green tracksuits worn by contestants and real world recreations of the games. It has also sparked a debate within South Korea about toxic competitive societies and prompted new interest in the country's culture and language around the world. ""Squid Game has officially reached 111-million fans, making it our biggest series launch ever,"" Netflix tweeted. The series reached that total in just 27 days since its release on September 17, easily outpacing the UK costume drama, Bridgerton, which was streamed by 82-million accounts in its first 28 days. Netflix gives limited information on viewing figures for its platform and cuts the data it does provide in different ways. The 28-day debut figures it released for Bridgerton and other shows included any account that watched an episode for at least two minutes. Netflix co-chief executive and chief content officer Ted Sarandos told a tech conference in California in September that the streaming service was surprised by how popular Squid Game had become. ""We did not see that coming in terms of its global popularity,"" he said. The series was so popular that South Korean internet service provider SK Broadband sued Netflix to pay for costs from increased network traffic and maintenance work because of the surge in viewers. A South Korean woman was in talks with the US firm about compensation after she was deluged with thousands of prank calls and text messages when her phone number was inadvertently highlighted as a key plot point in the series.

NDCs are non-binding plans for climate action submitted by countries since the Paris Agreement of 2016.The new target is for Zimbabwe's total greenhouse gas emissions to be curbed to 44.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) by 2030.

Zambians turned out en masse to vote for change on August 12, fed up with growing economic hardship and repression under their former leader Edgar Lungu.Hichilema inherited a heavily indebted country \- the first in Africa to default during Covid \- and soured bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Sworn in on August 24, he vowed to revive the economy, root out graft and woo back scarred investors to Africa\' s second copper producer.Much of the international community remains starry-eyed, but some Zambians are beginning to feel disenchanted. The president is too slow, said Martin Nawa, a 30-year-old newspaper vendor in the capital Lusaka.  These people are hiding whatever they have stolen, he said, referring to alleged embezzlement by the previous regime.Critics say Hichilema has been slow to take action against wrongdoers.Only one former state journalist has been charged for acquiring property with public funds. She was freed after surrendering her assets. He has only shown the will to fight corruption, but he will not achieve anything with the same officials in the police and anti-graft bodies, said Zambian rights activist Brebner Changala.A self-made businessman, Hichi-lema centred his campaign on economic restructuring.The 2022 budget he presented to parliament at the end of October was well-received among investors and creditors \- reassured by promised fiscal reforms, spending cuts and debt transparency.These measures  will help the country make progress in debt restructuring and facilitate negotiations with the IMF that resumed this month, said Aleix Montana of risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft.He claims it was grossly under- estimated, particularly regarding money owed to China.The president  is quite popular among investors, especially in the mining sector , said Montana, pointing to a new policy that will allow companies to deduct mineral royalties from corporate tax.Zambia\' s sovereign bond prices, which jumped after Hichilema\' s election, have continued to increase steadily, he added.Hichilema has sought to shelter citizens from the impact of fiscal reforms, increasing constituency development funds and introducing free access to secondary school.He also removed bribe-taking political cadres who controlled markets and bus stations under Lungu.But a  proposed reduction of subsidies for fertiliser, electricity and fuel is likely to have a serious knock-on effect on people\' s budgets , noted South Africa-based political analyst Nicole Beardsworth.Inflation has remained stuck at a high of more than 20%, she added, stressing that it was too early to draw a l"

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa397","Africa Investment Forum: A Continent; Its Destiny And Capital, By Fredrick Nwabufo","November 26, 2021 11:49 AM GMT","Sahara Reporters - Online","The Africa Investment Forum, a conference where the finest melange of the continent's leaders and policymakers on one side -- and investors, big businesses, critical industry players on the other wing -- converge to discuss, decide and transact deals on exigent matters affecting Africa such as healthcare, food security, electricity, and transportation will take place this year from December 1 to 3 in Abidjan, C\'f4te d&#039;Ivoire. The Forum which began in 2018 is a solution-primed initiative to create targeted investments and capital for the continent to meet its infrastructural needs.The Africa Investment Forum Market Days event brings together investors, project sponsors, transaction advisors, legal and other applicable professionals under 'one roof' to engage and continue the process of addressing the continent's investment gap. The inaugural Africa Investment Forum 2018 (AIF2018) boardrooms convened investors, project sponsors, and transaction facilitators around 63 deals valued at $46.9 billion. Also, the platform mobilised investment interests across 49 of these boardroom deals worth $38.7 billion -- across 24 countries. The 2019 edition (AIF2019) upped the ante. AIF2019 featured 57 boardroom deals valued at $67.7 billion and succeeded in crowding-in investment interests across 52 deals worth $40.1 billion from 25 countries. Fredrick Nwabufo Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank; Africa50, Afrexim Bank, the Africa Finance Corporation, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, the European Investment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Trade Development Bank set up the Forum as a transaction hub where real investment deals for Africa are concretised - so the Forum is essentially a dividend-deliverer and not a chatter assembly.According to AfDB's economic outlook on Africa (2018), the continent's infrastructure needs amount to $130-170 billion a year, with a financing gap in the range $68-$108 billion. Clearly, Africa needs investment in critical infrastructure - power, transportation, water, agriculture, etc -- if it must industrialise and bridge the deficit, as well as reduce the unemployment of millions of youths. This underscores the viability of the Forum.The theme of the 2021 edition is ""Accelerating Transformative Investments in Africa"". Sessions focusing on the five investment sectors that received priority under the Forum's Unified Response to COVID-19: agriculture and agro-processing; energy and climate change; health; ICT/Telecoms; and industrialisation and trade will be elemental to the programme.In addition, sector-specific discussions at this year's event will include energy and climate -including reflections on November's summit in Glasgow, UK - agriculture and agro-processing; health; ICT and telecommunications; and industry and trade.Nigeria has been a principal feature in the Africa Investment Forum since 2018. In the 2018 edition, out of the 63 boardroom deals presented at the Forum, Nigeria had five deals worth $7 Billion. This represents 14.9 percent of the total deals accounted for on the continent, and 43 percent of the deals accounted for in the region.The AfDB, facilitator of the Forum, had said it would help Nigeria to bridge its infrastructure gap estimated to cost about $3 trillion in the next 26 years. According to Ebrima Faal, former director AfDB, Nigeria and director of operations committee secretariat, Nigeria's infrastructure cumulative financing needs are estimated to reach $3 trillion by 2044 or about 100 billion dollars annually.The Africa Investment Forum offers Nigeria a smorgasbord of opportunities to attract the needed investments to the country. And as always, a high-level delegation of the Nigerian government and captains of industry from Nigeria are expected to be at the Forum this year. The Africa of the future will be driven by infrastructure. But to achieve that future, infrastructure-led investments are critical - most especially in this time of global economic peril brought on by the COVID pandemic. Africa needs more accessibility for citizens within the continent; it needs better healthcare; it needs to achieve food security, have stable power supply, affordable internet connectivity, technology innovation, good transport system, and ensure the safety and security of its populace. It all starts with the right investments.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa398","Eskom races to tap cheaper funding","August 2, 2021 Monday","Business Day (South Africa)","Eskom races to tap cheaper fundingPlan for a just transition is needed in time for COP26 to grab a chunk of concessional financing Eskom races to tap cheaper fundingEditor at LargeSA has less than 100 days to get a ""just energy transition"" plan in place if it is to access the window of opportunity presented by concessional climate financing or lose out to other countries, says Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter.A just energy transition refers to the movement away from carbon-intensive energy generation towards clean technologies such as solar PV and wind, but done in such a way that communities and workers in the coal economy are not left behind to face misery in ghost towns.As the world seeks to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, governments and funders are looking for ways to reduce global emissions. As the world's 12th-biggest emitter, SA offers an attractive opportunity to do this.But although the idea of accessing concessional finance for Eskom has been around for more than two years, there has been no movement on it by the government. An expert presidential task team formulated proposals in March 2019 for President Cyril Ramaphosa.De Ruyter, who set out the beginnings of Eskom's vision for an energy transition at a meeting of the Presidential Climate Commission on Friday, said SA needed to get a plan in place by the time COP26, the UN climate summit, meets in November.Eskom hopes to raise R150bn to fund the transition from multi-lateral lenders, including the World Bank, German and French government development finance institutions and the New Development Bank, which have all expressed interest in Eskom's proposals.Concessional climate financing will be linked to a faster retirement of Eskom's coal fleet than envisaged at present and the expansion of the national grid to enable the connection of Eskom and private sector renewable energy projects.""This is an exciting offer by these lender governments and we are very optimistic that there is very substantial money being put forward.""The opportunity is SA's to lose, before other countries take advantage,"" said De Ruyter at the commission meeting.The proposal under discussion involves a ""multi-tranche, multi-year facility by a multi-lender syndicate"" that will provide funding on a ""pay for performance"" basis.""It is important that we accelerate the drive to conclude this by COP26. We have 97 days to put such a transaction together. Government will be required to ensure all processes are expedited,"" he said.However, the Treasury, which would have to be integrally involved in the transaction, has over the past two years been lukewarm on concessional climate financing. In reply to questions on Sunday, the Treasury said it supported the spirit of the Eskom proposal.""The Treasury supports the transition of the electricity sector and a shift to alternate clean energy combined with appropriate investments in upgrading the grid infrastructure and adequate support measures for vulnerable workers and communities.""However, ""the pace and scale of the transition will be important and will have to be carefully managed taking into account the overall financial viability of Eskom"", it said.De Ruyter's just transition transaction is a more modest version of the one proposed to Ramaphosa and the Treasury by the expert task team two years ago. In that version, part of the intention was to reduce Eskom's debt burden by shifting this into a special purpose vehicle and exchanging expensive finance for cheaper concessional options.Eskom's financial position is extremely precarious and it is dependent on annual cash bailouts from the Treasury to service its R400bn debt burden.The Treasury has shied away from a big Eskom debt solution - such as taking a large chunk of debt onto the sovereign balance sheet - and has opted instead for annual transfers. The February budget allocated R31.7bn of support to Eskom.Deputy finance minister David Masondo set the cat among the pigeons in the commission meeting when he offered his personal views rather than those of the Treasury, which included a proposal in which Eskom debt holders agreed to a haircut in exchange for faster decarbonisation. The Treasury said on Sunday that it had noted Masondo's ""personal views"" and was still committed to pursuing the path it was on.""The Eskom debt matter is being dealt with as part of the unbundling process. It is anticipated that some debt relief will be required to enable Eskom and its subsidiaries to be financially sustainable, the nature and scale of such relief will be based on Eskom's improved operational and financial performance. It must be noted that the build-up of debt reflects underlying operational and regulatory challenges and a debt takeover won't solve these issues,"" it said.The resolution of Eskom's financial position must tackle several fundamental concerns, which included: tariff increases that earned a reasonable return; cost savings; the unbundling of Eskom into three separate entities; and the restructuring and/or reduction of debt to manageable levels, it said.patonc@businesslive.co.za\l"

As noted at the recent COP26 in Glasgow, limiting global warming is critical if poor nations are to avoid more disasters such as floods, deadly fires and droughts.So much for the obvious warnings. No wonder SA's retailers are seeking ways to respond to the UN climate change goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\'baC.Shoprite - SA's biggest retailer - is leading the way in waving goodbye to diesel-powered refrigerated trucks and trailers as part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. The retailer began to decarbonise its growing fleet of refrigerated trucks and trailers in 2017.Sanjeev Raghubir, Shoprite group sustainability manager, tells the FM that the retailer has more than 1,300 trailers in its fleet. Of these, 885 are fitted with solar-powered units.& This is a continuous process as new trucks are acquired annually,& he says.The nonsolar-powered trailers in the fleet are traditional refrigerated trailers, with diesel-powered cooling units.Raghubir says Shoprite saved more than 950,000l of diesel a year through the decarbonisation of its trailers.The diesel is saved from the reduced idling of trucks and reduced CO\'b2 emissions and opting for a natural refrigerant (nitrogen) to refrigerate products that are environmentally preferable.By equipping trailers with solar panels, trucks can be switched off while refrigeration and the tailgate lift are still able to run on solar power.Raghubir says for nonrefrigerated trailers, the company uses two 325Wp (watt peak) solar panels.He says for refrigerated trailers, four 325Wp solar panels are used to generate energy stored in batteries. This energy is used to move nitrogen around to cool the trailers.The nitrogen has to be refilled at Shoprite's depots, similar to the traditional cooling system where the diesel has to be replenished.Shoprite is also using other technologies to ensure its trucks and trailers are decarbonised.The retailer uses cameras to monitor truck and trailer activity, remote locking and unlocking of trailers, plus remote temperature monitoring.& This project is part of our wider environmental sustainability and climate change strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ... cost savings and reduce noise,& says Raghubir.Woolworths has begun trials with electric vans to deliver goods, ordered onl"

It should be noted that the coal mining and coal power generation industries are so interlinked that they are naturally lumped together when dealing with the challenges of carbon emission.Mining companies should naturally be concerned about the usage of coal for energy generation, and form part of the debate about them themselves. They must participate in the investigations of technologies and innovations to help move from higher to lower carbon emissions as part of our just energy transition.Whilst we commit to combatting climate change, we must be mindful of the three major factors pertinent to our national realities:South Africa is highly endowed with coal.South Africa is highly depended on coal for its baseload and energy security.Coal mining and energy generation industries do not only bring massive revenue but also employ thousands of employees.The critical question then becomes how can we respond to these national realities? This is what the energy transition discourse and programme must engage with.The discourse on the challenges facing coal mining and energy generation industries cannot be that of the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. It is an industry discourse.The coal sector must take the bull by the horns in clarifying what must be the national development trajectory with regards to the usage of coal against the realities that I have alluded to. We need to hear from the captains of the industry on what are their envisaged roles and what their areas of support or synergy in the just energy transition.IMPORTANCE OF COAL IN THE ECONOMYCoal is the second most important energy source in the world after oil. It is also one of the cheapest and abundant energy carriers. Coal power continues to play an important role in improving the welfare of communities across the globe, having lifted hundreds of millions of people out of energy poverty and spurred industrial development in many nations.In South Africa, coal remains an essential component in the country's energy mix, accounting for about seventy (70) percent of our primary energy consumption, about seventy-five (75) percent of our electricity generation and about thirty (30) percent of petroleum liquid fuels.Coal is also an essential component of the iron and steel production, cement manufacturing, ferroalloys, industrial and manufacturing sectors.South Africa is ranked amongst the top ten (10) countries globally in terms of coal reserves, standing at number six (6), in terms of production we are ranked at number seven (7) and number five (5) in terms of exports.South Africa is host to considerable mineral reserves of strategic significance to the global economy with recent studies estimating the mineral preliminary gross in-situ value of South Africa at 9.6 trillion USD, an almost 290% increase from the previous estimate of 2.5 trillion USD. Of these, about 43% are coal resources, followed by PGM's (31.5%) and Gold (11.7%).The coal sector produced approximately 248 Mt of saleable coal in 2020. Coal was the highest revenue earner, contributing 21.4 percent (R130.57 billion) of total mining revenue (R608.99 billion). The coal sector was the highest earner of total local sales revenue contributing 53.42 percent (R85.02 billion) of (R159.16 billion). The sector generated 10.13 percent (R45.55 billion) of total foreign exchange earnings (R449.83 billion). In addition, coal was the third largest employer in the mining industry after precious metals and PGMs, directly employing 89 548 people, 20.48 percent of total mining industry employment of 437 288. These employees received over R30.71 billion in wages and salaries, which constituted 20.27 percent of the mining industry's total wage income (R 151.53 billion).For developing nations like South Africa, coal is a very affordable source of primary energy, and it is abundantly available. However, it faces several challenges not least among them, the fact that as a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is viewed as responsible for environmental degradation. In this regard, financial institutions and green energy advocates have increased the pressure to shift away from the reliance on coal.At an international level, governments have developed and rectified legislation to cut down the use of coal in electricity generation. As a replacement, environmentally friendly technologies are subsidised with the hope that soon they will replace coal in the generation of electricity. In countries such as the US, Britain and Germany, coal power has decl"

Eskom is South Africa's biggest greenhouse gas emitter.\~In 2019, South Africa's delegation arrived at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid in Spain as Eskom escalated the rolling blackouts that have plagued the country for more than a decade to stage six, an unprecedented move that meant that the utility's capacity was slashed by 40%.The latest round of power cuts shows how ""desperate"" South Africa is for new reliable capacity, Mandy Rambharos, the general manager of Eskom's Just Energy Transition (JET) office, told the Mail & Guardian.""Why would we throw more money into maintaining an old coal plant, which is becoming obsolete, which is not operationally and economically viable, when we should rather take that money and build new clean capacity?"" Rambharos said.""If you think back to when people used a horse and a cart and then the car was invented - if the horse and cart weren't working properly, you didn't look at ways of fixing that - you'd rather move towards a car.Eskom is expected to decommission three of its oldest coal-fired power stations by 2026.The latest assessment by HYPERLINK Climate Transparency InternationalRenewables accounted for 7.6% of the country's power generation last year, a significant increase from previous years, but still well below the G20 average of 28.7%.

By September this year, Eskom had slashed its R401-billion debt by R81.9-billion.\~Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan told reporters on Wednesday night that there was finance waiting for Eskom to tap into.""There's a lot of money that is waiting to be invested in renewables, some institutions tell us up to R120-billion can be invested, which can make a huge difference. And that is why, as we go to COP26, as a government and a country, Eskom plays an important part in designing the just component for workers and for the communities that are actually impacted and that will play an important part in attracting funding to South Africa as well,"" he said.\~COP26 is an opportunity for Eskom to secure further international grants and concessional finance aligned to climate mitigation conditions and its JET strategy. The utility will, however, be decarbonised in a phased manner, Rambharos said.""If you look at the just transition, let's say in Germany, for example, where they have all of those millions of euros, it still took them 18 years to transition. So from a South African perspective, given the dependency we do have from communities in areas where coal stations are, we're not going to transition overnight,"" she said.In the near term, Eskom will take off 22 gigawatts of coal-fired power from the grid by 2035.\~""We've got 46GW of installed capacity. So it does mean that we will still have coal in the system for a number of years to come. The newer stations, and the better-performing stations and units, will be kept running for a while to come as we transition,"" Rambharos said.The message to developed nations is that the cost of carbon abatement or ""offsetting"" - which is when a country reduces global emissions by mitigating elsewhere from its operations - is cheaper in South Africa than in their home countries.\~It is cheaper because South Africa is still working on its electricity sector's decarbonisation as opposed, for example, to European countries that are starting to decarbonise their transport sectors.\~""And you would have a bigger bang for your buck in terms of carbon abatement, you know, because carbon emissions can be abated anywhere, right? And it has a positive global impact,"" Rambharos said.\~To enable and accelerate Eskom's just energy transition, which has been endorsed by the cabinet, from coal to other forms of electricity generation, Eskom has proposed a multi-tranche, multiyear facility, funded by a multi-lender syndicate. Eskom hopes this will provide concessional funding to JET projects in the country on a ""pay-for-performance"" basis, with funds to be advanced as progress payments for different stages of various projects.Deputy Finance Minister David Masondo has HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/business/2021-08-08-is-listing-privatisation-the-answer-for-debt-ridden-eskom/aired his personal views HYPERLINK debt-for-climate swapsEskom's transaction plan, according to the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/centre-for-environmental-rights/Centre for Environmental RightsThe transaction ""does not include a plan to deal with the impacts of coal phase-out along the coal value chain - in particular, coal mine workers and coal-affected communities, and SMMEs in Mpumalanga.

And so the idea then is that we have gas on the system that provides that flexibility and standby capacity that you need on days when we may not have renewables on the system.\~""And we get a lot of criticism for the gas we have in the system.

Land use for crop and livestock production accounts for HYPERLINK 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and farms are vulnerable to droughts, floods and rising temperatures. Financing climate-smart agricultural entrepreneurs is essential for making our food systems more resilient. Here, too, off-grid renewable energy has become indispensable, providing power for irrigation, processing grains, and operating the cold rooms and coolers needed to store dairy products, fresh seafood, and fruits and vegetables. In India, HYPERLINK https://www.technoserve.org/blog/making-climate-smart-agriculture-profitable-for-smallholders/Technoserve is helping small farms to withstand and adapt to the climate crisis and raise their productivity without increasing emissions.As these examples show, when small businesses have the financing and support they need, they can drive economic growth, while mitigating emissions and supporting adaptation to climate change. That is because small businesses are more agile and adaptable - and respond to local needs much faster and more effectively - than large organisations. They also offer governments and policymakers an opportunity to test new ideas, revealing both pitfalls and best practices before initiatives are scaled regionally or nationally.Achieving the global goal of net-zero emissions requires policymakers, investors, banks and others to attend to SMEs' needs much more effectively than they have in the past. For starters, the world needs far more finance vehicles and instruments that are tailored to small businesses working in the green economy. That means a mix of lower-cost, long-term capital and blended finance, as well as easier access.The world also needs more business accelerators focused on adaptation to climate change. There are HYPERLINK https://www.andeglobal.org/publication/climate-entrepreneurship-in-developing-economies/only 25 such green accelerators located in non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.

The focus on revitalisation of democracies as well as climate change and sustainable development underscores the current approach on Africa, senior State Department official Ervin Massinga said.Massinga said Blinken also discussed boosting African capacities to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines \- a push in which Biden is hoping to draw a distinction with China, which has assertively promoted its own vaccines.Blinken\' s trip comes as the US steps up diplomacy over two nations where it earlier saw hope \- Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia has been a close US ally, but Washington has been dismayed by curbs on food delivery into the northern Tigray region where hundreds of thousands of people face famine-like conditions.Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\' s government has been locked in a year-long war with the Tigray People\' s Liberation Front, which has pushed south in recent months and has not ruled out a possible march on the capital Addis Ababa. This is not the Ethiopia that we thought we would see two years earlier when we were applauding this country as the fastest-growing economy in Africa, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas- Greenfield, said recently.Biden has moved to remove Ethiopia from the landmark African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which grants duty-free access for most exports, but has held off on sanctions on the Ethiopian government and rebels in hopes of encouraging a settlement.The US has separately suspended some $700 million (about R10.9 billion) in assistance to Sudan, where the military ousted the civilian leadership last month, halting a democratic transition that followed the toppling in 2019 of dictator Omar al-Bashir.Johnnie Carson, who was the top diplomat on Africa under former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said it would be a  missed opportunity if Blinken visited Kenya without inviting leaders from nearby countries to seek a regional solution. The Horn of Africa is enormously fragile, and the democratic transitions that we thought were going to move forward in Ethiopia and Sudan have been derailed, said Carson, now at the US Institute of Peace.Blinken could also face delicate discussions in Nigeria, where the US has halted the delivery of helicopters due to human rights concerns.Another issue Blinken was trade. The Agoa expires in 2025, and neither Biden nor Trump have been rushing for a replacement amid a souring in US public opinion on trade deals.The act\' s lapse would likely only fuel relationships with China, which has been eager to secure resources and makes no fuss about good governance. It is important to start thinking now and talking now with African leaders about what kind of trade agreement is going to be possible, Carson said. \l"

The latter is also the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and National Disability Rights Awareness Day.-Earlier this month, the Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, officially launched South Africa s Disability Rights Awareness Month 2021, under the theme: The Year of Charlotte Mannya Maxeke Create and realise an inclusive society upholding rights of persons with disabilities . The United Nations adopted the theme Leadership and participation of persons with disabilities toward an inclusive, accessible and sustainable post-Covid-19 world .-Andre Michau, Director of Afroteq Advisory, who himself has an immediate family member that is disabled, states that an estimated 15% of the global population, equating to more than one billion people, currently live with a disability. In South Africa, approximately 5 million (or 1 in ten) South Africans are disabled. As a nation, we need to look critically at our corporate and commercial spaces to make sure they accommodate the special needs of these citizens. It is our civic duty to remove any barriers to entry that might make it difficult or hard for them to contribute to the economy and compete fairly in the job market, he says.When it comes to the protection and rights of persons with disabilities, South Africa s overarching framework remains the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996), which states in the Bill of Rights that everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law. No person or body, including the State and private companies, may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against any person on one or more grounds including race, gender, colour, age or disability.The UN also states that employment and working conditions must be responsive to accessibility and inclusive to persons with disabilities. Employers and workplaces must provide user-friendly environments and reasonable workplace adjustments based on the individual needs of their employees with disabilities. Statistics pertaining to the employment of people with disabilities in South Africa, indicate that the country is falling far short of the national target and international benchmarks. The corporate and professional world still has a long way to go when it comes to levelling the playing field and creating an inclusive environment for people living with disabilities. Only recently we saw how Israel's Energy Minister, Karine Elharrar, was unable to participate in the United Nation's COP26 summit held in Glasgow due to the fact that the venue was not wheelchair accessible, and that the shuttle which transported delegates to the event was also not suited for a wheelchair. All of this highlights the need to become truly mindful about transforming places of work and public spaces so that they are truly accommodating to everybody s needs, Michau says.As specialist advisors to the built environment, Afroteq Advisory assists companies in transforming their workplaces into spaces that are accessible, safe and welcoming to differently abled employees and visitors. With their expert knowledge of workflow, strategic space planning and design and understanding of spatial needs, Afroteq Advisory conducts accessibility audits to evaluate companies universal access and compliance to legislation. An inaccessible built environment directly impacts on a person with disabilities ability to access healthcare and other much-needed services. This is particularly true if they are not able to use public transportation. Many buildings including healthcare facilities are not built with universal design principles in mind. Buildings that do not have ramps or grab rails, for example, generally pose significant challenges for persons with mobility impairments, Michau explains. There are several obstacles that could potentially be barriers for persons who have mobility, intellectual and visual impairments, which result in their increased vulnerability. These include uneven and rocky surfaces, things like steps, steep incl"

Over the past three days, about 6,000MW of generation capacity had been returned to the grid and Eskom would use the next day to build up its reserves to prevent load-shedding in the days after Friday.At 3pm on Wednesday, 6,080MW was still in breakdown and another 7,261MW was out on planned maintenance. However, a substantial amount of energy (5,050MW) was being lost through ""partial load losses"", which occur particularly when cooling towers are underperforming.Eskom's group executive responsible for distribution, Monde Bala, gave additional details on the failure of some municipalities to drop the full load required when they were requested to on Monday. This led to a sharp escalation from stage 2 to stage 4 load-shedding. Twenty-eight municipalities, including all the metros, have electricity distribution licences and do their own load-shedding on instruction from Eskom.On Monday, all but two of the 28 - the exceptions being eThekwini and Buffalo City - failed to fully comply with the instruction, said Bala. He added that 45% of industrial customers had also failed to fully comply, with some not complying at all. He did not name them.The failure to shed load when the system is overburdened can lead to a blackout, unless further load is dropped somewhere else in the system.City Power issued a statement saying that difficulty in parts of Joburg in returning after load-shedding was due to a go-slow by Eskom employees. Bala insisted that this industrial dispute had been resolved on October 29 and work was resumed the next day.Asked how much money Eskom required to restore its plant to full working order permanently, De Ruyter said while it needed R10bn-R12bn a year for maintenance, the bigger issue was that new generation capacity had to be built as its 40-year-old plants reached the end of their lives and were retired.""To use the analogy of a car: the question is not how much it will cost to fix, it is that we need to buy a new car. At a certain point it costs too much to fix the old car,"" he said.The R131bn financing secured by SA at COP26, the lion's share of which is expected to go to Eskom, would assist it to begin building new capacity, he said. This was urgent and Eskom was already in discussions with the funders over when the money would land.Minerals Council SA, a mining industry employers' organisation, on Wednesday added its voice to support De Ruyter, who is under pressure from trade unions and the Black Business Council to resign. This would worsen the crisis at Eskom, it said, when the strongest form of leadership was required.""It would be a complete disaster for Eskom. They cannot have changes in the leadership team now.

They now expect developed countries to show leadership and respond with a matching progression of effort,' the Ministerial Joint Statement said on Wednesday.The Minister of the Environment of Brazil reassured the country's full commitment to being part of the global response to tackle climate change by supporting the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use.South Africa had submitted an updated and significantly more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement ahead of COP26.'The updated NDC brings forward the peaking of South Africa\'b4s emissions by a decade and contains detailed information on adaptation, and the enabling means of implementation support required from the international community.'The NDC presents a target emission range from 398 - 614 MtCO2e in 2025 and 350 - 420 MtCO2e in 2030. From the upper end of the range of the first NDC, this represents a 17% reduction for 2025 and a 32% reduction for 2030,' the statement said.South Africa has progressed from an original target against Business as Usual, to a fixed target emission range.The lower end of the 2030 updated target emission range is consistent with a 1.5-degree pathway, while the upper end of the range is consistent with a 2-degree pathway.'While India is amongst the few countries whose NDCs are already compliant with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, announced further enhancements to India's Climate ambitions at the World Leaders' Summit at COP 26 in Glasgow. He called for a global mass movement for environmentally sustainable lifestyles and consumption,' the statement said.India announced five new and updated targets including (i) increasing non-fossil fuel installed electricity capacity to 500 Gigawatts by 2030; (ii) achieving 50% of cumulative electric power installed capacity from renewable energy by 2030; (iii) reducing total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tons of between now and 2030; (iv) reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030; and (v) achieving net zero emissions by 2070.China aims to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.For 2030, China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65% from the 2005 level and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25%.In addition, China will increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts. China emphasised the importance of upholding multilateral consensus, focus on concrete actions and accelerate the green transition.China is formulating and successively releasing the ""1+N"" policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality.

And in first place, ""just transition"" - which has come to symbolise the world's desire, and, indeed, urgent need to decarbonise its energy system in the face of catastrophic climate change induced by the greenhouse gases that have propelled the first three industrial eras.The fourth industrial revolution is supposed to herald the era of renewables, carbon-free, sort of, abundant and clearly now on cost parity with coal, oil and gas.The just transition has played out ironically over the past few months in SA with team SA, ably led by the Eskom Just Transition Office, scooping the flagship deal at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November, to assist our just transition.

The organisation\' s senior manager for climate and energy justice, Avena Jacklin, said to limit global warming, 2021 needed to mark the end of new investments in coal, oil and gas supply. More committed action is required if we are to reduce the devastating impacts of climate change on Africa which will be the hardest hit, and in particular its poor and coastal communities. She added:  This strain on water resources intensifies vulnerabilities such as displacement of communities.  It also works against water conservation and ecosystem strategies required to build climate resilience. Following the announcement of Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell\' s seismic blasting along the Wild Coast, two urgent interdicts were sought this past week to halt the activity.The first application was brought by four environmental groups and law firm Cullinan and Associates but was rejected by the Makhanda High Court on Friday.Acting Judge Avinash Govindjee said the applicants failed to convince him that there was a reasonable apprehension of  irreparable harm if the interdict were not granted.One of the applicants, Greenpeace Africa\' s senior climate energy and campaign manager Happy Khambule, said the decision to allow Shell to continue with its plans in the Wild Coast was disappointing. Not only will the blasting destroy precious biodiverse ecosystems, but it will also destroy the livelihoods of local communities, all in the name of profit, he said.He added:  We will continue to support the nationwide resistance against Shell and pursue the legal avenue to stop Shell. The Amadiba Crisis Committee also requested an urgent interdict against Shell on Friday. The application will be heard in the Makhanda High Court on Tuesday.Nonhle Mbuthuma from the Crisis Committee said they wanted to tell Shell that it must back off because what they were doing was bad for the environment and marine life. They must leave our environment alone. We cannot compromise our livelihood to make profits, she said.In 2019 a seismic testing and offshore drilling ban was passed by the US House of Representatives. In 2018, New Zealand banned all offshore oil exploration including seismic testing.Jacklin said Shell\' s seismic surveying was only the tip of the iceberg.

The finance is earmarked to help Eskom ultimately retire its coal power stations and assist it in building the renewable energy sector while preventing up to 1 to 1.5 gigatons of emissions over the next 20 years.Formby said while this would not solve Eskom\' s debt burden and capital structure, the deal was very positive news for South Africa.  As we once again struggle with load shedding, it\' s clear Eskom needs urgent help with accelerating the decommissioning of coal plants and replacing them with renewables, gas bridging and storage.He said the initial commitment of $8.5bn (R127.3bn) for the first phase of financing, could  crowd in up to a further R390bn of local and foreign private investor capital. Because of the fairly predictable cash flows, debt funding could be as much as 70 to 80 percent of total financing required.  Assuming 75 percent of debt and assuming the R130bn, 25 percent, comes in as grant money or can be back ranked to commercial lenders, this means that up to R390bn could be unlocked in the form of debt funding from South Africa\' s banking and savings industries.  It will be important that the terms of this $8.5bn enable this. This also assumes an appropriately capitalised and separate \' gridco\' which would give lenders confidence that the power produced would be paid for, without requiring further government guarantees, he said. Formby said infrastructure assets were an ideal long-term asset match for the liability profile of pension funds which need the yield to preserve wealth for pensioners.  This is why there are proposed changes to Regulation 28, which governs where pension funds can invest, to include an explicit infrastructure category to support the allocation to infrastructure assets, subject to the discretion of fiduciary asset managers, of course. The non-bank assets under management of the South African savings industry were approximately R11 trillion as at December 31, 2020, mostly invested in equities, so South Africa had the capacity to help unlock this transition, Formby said.Sawea board member Mark Tanton said:  We view our sector as a key implementer for the country to decarbonise its power sector and increase its energy availability.  Hence, we look to the various policy makers within the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environ- ment, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, and the Department of Public Enterprises to facilitate and lead this transition, which will no doubt be abetted by this financing deal. He said South Africa needed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as fast as possible, while drastically increasing its energy availability factor, so that the country could bring a halt to the ongoing and crippling load shedding. Meanwhile, the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (Sapvia) represents more than 540 members operating across the solar PV value chain, with a mix of local and international ownership. said yesterday that it welcomed the president\' s focus on energy for the forthcoming South Africa Investment conference.\l"

When he agreed last month to go carbon-neutral by 2050, the man who once brought a lump of coal into Parliament promised that his plan \- which was short on details and long on speculative technology \- would neither crimp coal exports nor cost miners their jobs.In the face of that apparent lack of urgency from government, protesters are increasingly taking matters into their own hands. A string of protests have disrupted the Port of Newcastle and surrounding railroads in the past two weeks, prompting police to establish a strike force to crack down on the high-profile stunts.The protesters, from an activist group called Blockade Australia, plan to converge on Sydney, the commercial capital, in June next year, bringing the city to a halt. This is us responding to the climate crisis. This is humans trying to survive, Doole said on Wednesday.  We are trying to induce the social tipping points, which will give us a chance at another generation, she remarked on camera, pausing to laugh ironically, before adding:  What a wild thing to want. Despite the progress made at the COP26 climate summit, optimism about the agreement hangs on whether countries will actually deliver on the promises made in Glasgow. Coal production in China, the world\' s largest consumer of coal, has surged to the highest levels in years as the country addresses power outages.Matt Kean, the environment minister for New South Wales state, speaking on Sydney radio 2GB yesterday, said police need to  throw the book at anti-coal activists, describing their dramatic stunts as  completely out of l"

Envoys for the US, France, Germany and the EU are also included. Three days of talks are scheduled with key cabinet ministers, business, labour and other stakeholders.The British high commission's head of climate and energy, John Wade-Smith, said the idea is to initiate a broad conversation about SA's transition to cleaner energy in a manner that is just and takes account not only of changing energy technologies but also the social impact on communities. ""There is quite a lot of opportunity in SA's energy transition. We want to better understand how we can support that in a manner that is consistent with what SA wants to achieve,"" he said.The lead ministry from the SA side is environment, forestry & fisheries. A spokesperson, Albi Modise, last week said the visit would ""assess opportunities for enhanced co-operation around a just energy transition ... The developed economies have a responsibility to fund the just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate-resilient society.""COP26 is expected, in terms of previous agreements, to mobilise $100bn a year until 2025 to support the energy transition in developing countries. As a country, SA is yet to develop a just energy transition plan, with work by the presidential climate commission still in an early stage to determine what this would entail and how much it would cost.In the interim, Eskom has proposed its own modest energy transition, which will entail a slightly accelerated decommissioning of Eskom power stations than that mapped out in the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), the government's long-term energy plan.In terms of the plan, eight power stations will be decommissioned (which would in fact amount to somewhat of an acceleration as the plan is lagging behind) and a ninth (Tutuka) would be decommissioned earlier than scheduled.In return, Eskom hopes to raise concessional climate change funding from international development funding institutions to make essential investments in the national grid. These are required to connect renewable energy and to build 7,400MW of its own renewable energy and battery storage.The head of Eskom's just energy transition office, Mandy Rambharos, said the utility has been talking to overseas development finance institutions for some time.""Our hope is that coming out of the envoys' visit funders will see that Eskom is committed to decarbonising, but that we also need financing to do that. Due to our debt situation we need highly concessional funding. We are hoping to get a little more of a financial commitment,"" she said.Wade-Smith said it is too early to anticipate the extent to which the Eskom proposal will be deemed attractive by the UK and its partners. The fact that Eskom does not have the power to change energy policy, which is the responsibility of the government, to enable swifter coal retirement, as well as Eskom's very large debt burden, which it is unable to service, make for a complicated environment.""Hopefully, we will become clearer [through the engagements] on where the partnerships can be taken. The fact that we are coming out to SA signals that there is intention and interest to recognise SA's potential in climate change. We want to explore within the complexities that exist what is viable and what makes sense,"" he said.The department of mineral resources & energy did not respond to a request for comment. Minister Gwede Mantashe has previously said it would be foolish for SA to retire its coal assets prematurely, because coal is one of its important strategic advantages.Business Unity SA CEO Cas Coovadia said business is committed to achieving a more sustainable energy mix in a way that minimises job losses and creates possibilities for new employment in new industries.""The meeting with the envoys comes just over a month before the COP meeting, where we will be pushing for developed countries to make good on their commitment in the COP16 Accord to mobilise $100bn a year to address the needs of developing countries in their adaptation and mitigation efforts,"" he said.patonc@businesslive.co.za$100bnis what previous accords aimed to mobilise each year to support developing countries5envoys will be in SA to explore the potential to fund a coal retirement plan\l"

Finite energy resources, like coal and oil, can cause almost infinite damage to the world's ecology, threatening livelihoods and even survival. Until now, with the internal combustion engine as its totem, the industrial revolution that has shaped the world we live in has been powered by oil.That this is having a disastrous and permanent effect on our climate is beyond dispute, regardless of the vested interests that sponsor a vocal ""doubt"" industry, operating under the cover of free speech. In extreme weather, in the lived experiences of farmers and fishermen who have seen their surrounds change before their eyes and in their lifetimes, and even vanish, none but the most obstinate fail to accept the truth.Like all big technological changes, the shift to renewable energy away from fossil fuels will have winners and losers. In SA, billed as the world's 12th-largest emitter of harmful gases, entire communities are built around the fossil-fuel value chain, from mining to burning the coal to produce the steam to power the turbines that keep our lights on. How will they be assisted to transition to this brave new world? Will the political and economic interests at the heart of the mining-energy complex that has shaped public policy to its benefit for so many decades have to be confronted head-on? Will SA necessarily have to sacrifice growth to meet its new greenhouse gas emission targets? Or is green the new gold?This week it was announced that SA had adopted significantly stricter targets to be submitted in the build-up to the UN's climate conference in Glasgow. It relies on ""a very ambitious power sector investment plan"" and the implementation of a green transport strategy, energy efficiency programmes and a carbon tax to meet the goal.The more onerous targets set by President Cyril Ramaphosa's government may well be interpreted as a pre-emptive warning to the vested coal interests that change is coming and is unavoidable.

"COP26","South.Africa","COP26_South.Africa422","Pursuit of more fossil fuels is pure folly","December 11, 2021","The Independent on Saturday (South Africa)","AS A professor of geophysics, I have spent 36 years training young geologists destined to work in the fossil fuel industry how to look for oil and gas. But now I believe it\' s time to stop fossil-fuel exploration and halt the development of all new oil and gas fields. We cannot safely set fire to all the fuel we\' ve already found, so why look for more?My calculations, based on the typical carbon contents of these fuels and the expected effects of emissions on temperatures, suggest that emissions from using those barrels of oil alone would raise global temperatures by almost 0.6\'b0C. Using the natural gas would add another 0.2\'b0C. As for the coal, burning it all would raise temperatures by a further 2\'b0C.The conclusion seems clear: if we are serious about limiting global warming (already at 1.1\'b0C above pre-industrial levels) to  well below 2\'b0C \- as specified by the Paris Agreement on climate change \- we can only burn a small fraction of our known fossil fuel reserves.Others have arrived at the same realisation. A recent, more detailed analysis in Nature similarly concluded that to reach global climate targets, most planned fossil fuel extraction projects can\' t go ahead. Some countries are taking this idea seriously. Countries like France, Ireland, New Zealand, Costa Rica and Denmark have already placed partial or complete bans on fossil fuel exploration within their jurisdictions.Denmark and Costa Rica have gone further, also launching the Beyond Oil and Gas alliance at the UN climate conference to encourage more nations to implement similar bans. Surprisingly, an end to new oil and gas fields could be in the financial interests of fossil fuel companies. Exploring for and developing a new field costs billions: money that could be saved by not investing in fields that, because of climate concerns, may never be used. Limiting supply also helps to maintain oil and gas prices, and therefore the value of existing oil and gas fields.In contrast, continually adding new capacity to extract fossil fuels will lead to a price collapse when actions to combat climate change hopefully lead to greatly reduced fossil fuel demand. Such price falls would not only hurt oil company profits, but would also encourage additional fossil fuel usage and make climate targets even harder to meet.An end to new oil and gas fields may also be in the interest of countries that are financially dependent on exporting fossil fuels. The IEA has pointed out that if we stopped field developments now, most of our oil and gas would still end up coming from oil-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.However, this message isn\' t being listened to by most in the fossil fuel industry. Although I think the oil industry is preparing for a low- carbon future much faster than most environmentalists give it credit for, plans for this  energy transition towards renewable energy still include exploration and development of new fields.One justification for continuing exploration is that carbon capture and storage techniques (CCS), where carbon dioxide is captured and buried safely underground, can help to reduce emissions from fossil fuel burning.However, CCS is unlikely to become widespread enough to discount the fact that we have far more fossil fuel reserves than we can safely burn.Plans for keeping climate change to 1.5\'b0C targets generally include CCS, but none envisage it as more than a small part of a large mix of approaches. For example, the IEA\' s scheme to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 involves capturing and burying carbon dioxide at a relatively ambitious rate of 7.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year. But achieving this would still only allow us to consume an extra 1% of existing oil reserves each year.Further exploration and development are also justified by suggesting that less climate-friendly fields could be closed to build newer, more efficient ones that produce fewer emissions for each barrel of fuel extracted. But this is unconvincing.We\' re already seeing owners of prematurely closed coal-fired power stations demanding compensation for lost earnings, making such closure plans expensive to implement and complex to negotiate. Compensating oil-field investors will be even harder and more expensive.It would be much better for people and planet if there were no further investments in the first place.

Unplanned losses are not coming down and have risen to 23.1% against a target of 18% for the financial year.Against a full-year budget target of R4.1bn, Eskom has so far spent R2.44bn to run its diesel generators, which have had to run harder and more frequently than anticipated.The Duvha, Kendal and Tutuka power plants have been the worst performing of Eskom's ageing plants, Oberholzer said, noting much of that related to a legacy of poor maintenance.Ultimately, SA required an additional 4,000-6,000MW of generation capacity, Ober-holzer said.Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) which begins on Sunday, Eskom has proposed a green deal to attract funding to expand its generation capacity in return for an accelerated decommissioning of its power stations.Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 De Ruyter was not present at Monday's system briefing as he is travelling to Europe to attend the conference.steynl@businesslive.co.zaSteamy sunrise: Eskom has apologised for this week's power cuts and emphasised that load-shedding was implemented 'only when absolutely necessary'.

The year also marked a historic year for Afghanistan as the Taliban celebrated a victory when the last of the US troops departed after a 20-year occupation. Taliban officials said the war was finally over and that the country was a  free and sovereign nation .Despite this, the people of Afghanistan faced the daunting task of rebuilding the nation amid the pandemic and a food crisis.While many were not eager to immediately assist the new Afghan government because of the Taliban\' s reputation, nations such as China and bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN World Food Programme stepped up to the plate.In one of the biggest offshore data leaks in history, the Pandora Papers leak revealed the secret wealth of some of the world\' s richest and most powerful people. The files, which were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), were sifted through by more than 650 investigating journalists from selected media partners, including The Washington Post, The Guardian and the BBC.The leak came five years after the Panama Papers leak on April 3, 2016, which exposed political corruption across the globe. According to the ICIJ, the initial data leak was around 11.9 million files that include images, emails, spreadsheets and other forms of documents.Former British prime minister Tony Blair, members of Russian President Vladimir Putin\' s inner circle, a number of leaders in the Middle East as well as Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Congo military leader Denis Sassou-Nguesso were some of the leaders and politicians who were exposed in the leak.In the US, the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president was a major event this year, along that of Kamala Harris, who was sworn in as the first woman vice-president in the US.Harris became the first black person and South Asian American to become vice-president, as the duo set out to overcome a number of challenges after taking the reins from former president Donald Trump. One of those challenges was the ongoing tension between China and the US. The first signs of co-operation between the two superpowers came at the two-week Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. In a joint statement, they agreed to strengthen co-operation and work together in fighting climate change and to accelerate the transition to a global net-zero economy. This COP agreement was followed up with a virtual meeting between Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, with the leaders accompanied by senior officials from both sides.The leaders highlighted that better communication was needed between the two nations in order to avoid future conflict and that the world\' s two largest economies should shoulder their share of international responsibility.However, the easing of tensions was short-lived as US officials said they had a duty to defend Taiwan if any nation, including China, were to make an advance against them. Tensions worsened when the US decided to boycott the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games, saying it would not send an official delegation due to China\' s alleged human rights abuses. They also imposed human rights- related sanctions on China, Myanmar, and North Korea and later passed a bill that required companies such as Nike, Apple and Coca-Cola, who imported goods from China, to prove the goods were not produced in China\' s Xinjiang region.China warned it would  strike back if the US did not withdraw sanctions placed on Chinese entities and individuals and urged the US to withdraw its decisions and to stop interfering in China\' s internal affairs.With the rise in global internet activity due to the pandemic and various lockdown restrictions, China took a stance on clamping down on youth  internet addiction and gaming.Officials added time limits to its Chinese version of TikTok, known as Douyin, which limits children under the age of 14 to 40 minutes a day with access to the app between the times of 6am and 10pm.Meanwhile, in the booming gaming market, restrictions were put in place that limit under-18s to three hours of game time a week between the hours of 8pm and 9pm from Fridays to Sundays.China also passed an education law to reduce homework and private tutoring in a bid to reduce stress and promote children\' s moral, intellectual development.In the social media sphere, Chinese- owned platform TikTok reached more than a billion global users and has been identified as a key growth market in Africa with its young population and use among Gen Z.Also, in the technology space, Elon Musk registered his Starlink Internet Services business in India with the goal of providing the country with broadband and satellite-based communication services.Starlink is the satellite division of Musk\' s SpaceX company and is known for using advanced satellites in low orbit that provide high-speed internet services.The year was monumental also for ordinary citizens who took their seats on different spacecraft.The SpaceX mission, dubbed  Inspiration4 , was occupied by non- astronauts on a three-day journey while Jeff Bezos\' Blue Origin and Richard Branson\' s Virgin Galactic successfully landed their commercial space flights as well.Meanwhile, Nasa launched its first planetary defence test in an attempt to intentionally cause a spacecraft and an asteroid called Dimorphos to collide.Nasa also made history on Mars after landing the Perseverance rover on the surface of the planet and piloted the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, which was controlled from Earth.With regards to Covid-19, while countries had curbed the spread of the virus, and especially the spread of the Delta variant which was detected in India in late 2020, a new variant called Omicron took the world by surprise. This forced many nations to reimpose lockdowns and travel restrictions.While Omicron was said to be highly transmissible, the symptoms are not as severe as the Delta variant\' s. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration authorised its first Covid-19 pill, Paxlovid, for emergency use to treat mild-to-moderate symptoms, with data from Pfizer suggesting the drug would retain its effectiveness against Omicron.In other pandemic, UNAids, the WHO and partners gathered at a special event in Geneva, Switzerland, on World Aids Day to highlight the urgent need to end the economic, social, cultural and legal inequalities that drive the Aids pandemic.Japan also successfully hosted the Tokyo Olympic Games after these were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. Pulling together the Games was not an easy task as officials faced countless controversies \- locals called for the Games to be cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak, various protests took place, and the head of the organising committee, Yoshiro Mori, resigned after making  inappropriate remarks about women. \l"

Operation Phakisa is pushing ever harder to get its hands on a local supply of gas.""More than 37,000 people have signed Oceans Not Oil's petition calling on minister of forestry, fisheries & the environment Barbara Creecy to withdraw approval of Shell's application.Judy Mann of the South African Association for Marine Biological Research warned that no marine life is designed to handle the loud noise that is likely to come from the exploration.""We definitely know that it has an impact on whales and dolphins. The people doing the seismic survey will say they will send off a couple of little bangs to scare them away. It doesn't really matter how they mitigate this, there is going to be impact to cetaceans like the whales and dolphins. We have some incredible ecosystems that we have discovered in that region. The potential impact is enormous.""Ntsindiso Nongcavu, chair of Coastal Links SA in the Eastern Cape - which protects the rights of small-scale fishermen - said Shell's plans have caused concern and anger.""Our fear is that when a blast is done, some of the marine life will move away from the area. We normally catch crayfish, rock lobster, prawns, catfish and mussels.""Shell told the Sunday Times it had followed the consultation process, including a series of face-to-face engagements with interested and affected groups, as well as meetings with provincial environmental authorities and traditional authorities. It said environmental authorisation from the government was obtained in 2014.""An environmental compliance audit was undertaken in 2020 by independent specialists to confirm that the controls and mitigation measures ... were still sufficient and valid,"" the company said. Shell said it adopted stringent controls and followed international best practice from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee guidel"

Just look at the glow on the faces of fans now that they have returned to the terraces, with the EPL even experimenting with standing spectators from January next year.The financial impact of Messi\' s departure will continue to haunt Barca\' s board for years to come.That Barca, like Real Madrid, are heavily indebted is an understatement. If the finances of clubs such as Barca are in trouble, what does it say about the financial governance of these clubs? The financial woes cannot be all blamed on Covid-19. They have been festering for years. To what extent will this pressure on revenue growth revitalise initiatives such as the failed European Super League (ESL) idea?Alexey Kobylyanskiy, an associate director at Fitch Ratings, agrees that  there was some increase in debt before the pandemic, but the reasons varied between the clubs. The pandemic created a significant revenue shortfall (mostly match-day revenue due to closed stadiums) for the whole industry, pushing clubs to cover the gap with capital injections from shareholders, new borrowings and refinancing of pre-Covid debts in order to relieve refinancing financial pressure. Messi\' s four-year contract with Barca ending in Summer 2021 was worth $675m. Given the club\' s current financial woes, including outstanding debt increasing to \€ 845m and an investigation into the club\' s finances by the Spanish tax authorities, has Messi been  value for money for Barca? In our rating forecast, said Kobylyanskiy,  we assume conservative growth of media rights, sponsor and marketing revenues (although higher than inflation given the club\' s strong franchise). The club\' s financial sustainability will mostly depend on management\' s ability to cut and control costs (wages and transfer market). The current wage-to-revenue structure is significant, but under our rating case we expect new management\' s tighter control over wage costs to rein in and allow deleveraging. Still, we see significant execution risk with regard to the new management team\' s strategy to lower player wages to ensure financial stability. Fitch assigned an ESG relevance score of  4 for Management Strategy due to volatile and unsustainable financial management of the club under the previous management team, including the tax investigation. Regarding limited strictness of financial fair play (FFP) rules, Kobylyanskiy still sees the positive effect of these rules and expects La Liga and Uefa to incentivise management to control wage expenses more efficiently.For an improvement in the ESG score, says Kobylyanskiy,  we need to see actual execution of the management\' s strategy and a stable actual decrease in wage ratio to the level we assume in our rating case. We do not see upward pressure on the rating until we see evidence of such execution. To him, loans from owners and shareholders have very low relevance from the point of credit analysis, given that shareholder loans in most cases are quasi-equity instruments and junior to any other third-party debt.\l"

The CFA is part of the UK Government's efforts to help South Africa tackle climate change and support a just transition.-Projects in the CFA cohort come from a range of sectors including waste management, energy and transport. Some of them will increase sustainable mobility alternatives in cities while reducing emissions, whilst others support the growth of renewable energies in South Africa. To ensure the selected projects are in the best position to attract investment from South African and international financiers, the projects will receive capacity building support in areas such as low-carbon technologies, blending finance from public and private sources, as well as advice on enhancing gender, equality and social inclusion. If they secure funding, the projects will benefit communities across South Africa through pollution abatement, employment opportunities, access to energy, water conservation, improved food safety, and by supporting gender equality and social inclusion efforts. The CFA is funded by the UK government s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). By bringing together stakeholders who can develop and finance climate projects at scale the CFA will support South Africa s efforts to meet the priorities set out in its Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. Acting British High Commissioner to South Africa, Adam Bye, said: South Africa's Cabinet recently approved a new more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution ahead of COP26. To help deliver this level of ambition by 2030 and net zero by mid-century, every sector of the economy will need to develop low-carbon alternatives. I am therefore delighted to see the projects the Climate Finance Accelerator is supporting in its first cohort, including in key sectors like water, sustainable agriculture, waste management and green transport. The CFA s support is all about helping unlock the finance that these and other innovative projects will need as part of delivering green growth and transition. NBI CEO, Joanne Yawitch, a commissioner on the South African Presidential Climate Change Commission (PCCC), said: | SA s climate commitments to the UNFCCC in the lead up to COP26 show an enhanced level of ambition, which the private sector can help deliver through the activation of domestic and international finance. This will enable the realisation of investment potential in SA through the active support of climate projects and SMMEs, thereby ensuring our transition is just, inclusive and economically competitive. GreenCape Energy and Climate Finance Programme Manager, Jack Radmore, said: The South African ecosystem is perfectly primed for an intervention that supports the country s efforts to implement its Nationally Determined Contribution by bringing together stakeholders that can develop and finance climate projects at scale. If this reorganisation can be done in a 'just' way, an opportunity arises to address many of the existing social ills through increased investment, new jobs and new skills. This is particularly true when investing in long-term infrastructure projects which will have lasting economic, environmental and socio-economic impacts. The projects have been receiving tailored support ahead of a four-day event at the end of October. The support so far has included individual needs assessment discussions and analysis of each of the projects from financial and technical perspectives. The October event will allow project proponents to further refine their financial structuring through tailored discussions with interested financial institutions. The event will also provide an opportunity for all participants to network and for policymakers and other initiatives in the climate finance space to learn from the landscape mapping findings and recommendations. The CFA projects include: - Black Soldier Flies Breeding South Africa - Providing black soldier fly larvae that can be grown by anybody and used to produce products such as protein meal, insect oil, biodiesel, and soil enhancer. - Go-Lectric - Providing electric scooters to middle and low-income urban commuters as well as the growing short-distance delivery market. Also developing solar powered battery charging infrastructure. - The Green Cab - Setting up a Cab Division where women owner-drivers will operate electric vehicles on a national e-hailing app under The Green Cab brand plugged into corporate services.- Greenl"

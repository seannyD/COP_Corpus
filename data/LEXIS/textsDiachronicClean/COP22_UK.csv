"COP22","UK","COP22_UK3","AfDB Helps Morocco Prepare for COP22","October 21, 2016 Friday 12:00 AM GMT","MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)","With extensive experiences in climate adaptation, mitigation, climate finance, environment, capacity building, technology transfer, and project pipeline development, these experts are expected to provide day-to-day support to the COP 22 Task Team and advise the Moroccan Government on other relevant COP 22 issues.  By providing technical assistance, the AfDB hopes to help Morocco, and other African governments better articulate their position in the UN negotiation process in a way that delivers favorable outcomes to enable Africa adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, says Alex Rugamba, Director of the Energy, Environment and Climate Change Department and Chair of the AfDB Climate Change Coordination Committee. The elevation of adaptive capacities and the call to strengthen climate change resilience in the&nbsp;Paris Climate Change Agreement&nbsp;offers a unique opportunity for African countries to develop innovative climate-resilient development. With a recognition that climate change exerts a direct impact on livelihoods through water, AfDB experts will also be looking to identify and propose for funding projects linking water resource management and climate resilience.  The role of water security has moved to the fore since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, particularly with regards to adaptation to climate change. Water resources will come under increasing stress due to economic development, demographics, and climate change and successful efforts to enhance resilience and to adapt to climate change will have to take water security as a starting point, says Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the Water and Sanitation Department. The AfDB has considerable experience in supporting African countries at the COPs. The Bank is currently supporting the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), and the Committee of African Heads of States and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC). At COP21 last year, the Bank\' s support was instrumental in the adoption of the Paris Agreement, and for the design and launch of two major African solutions in Paris, namely the&nbsp;African Renewable Energy Initiative&nbsp;(AREI) and the African Adaptation and Loss and Damage Initiative. Funding for the experts is from various sources including the&nbsp;Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative&nbsp;(RWSSI), and the&nbsp;African Water Facility&nbsp;(AWF). Both water-related initiatives are looking to explore funding opportunities on projects linking climate adaptation and water and building a strong pipeline of projects. The African Development Bank has an active water portfolio of 2.6 billion Euro in 37 African countries, covering rural and urban water supply and sanitation as well as water resource management at both national and trans-boundary level. The city of Marrakesh in Morocco will host the annual UN Climate Change Summit from November 7-16, 2016. Thousands of delegates from governments, civil society, academics, and private sector are expected at the gathering to discuss further practical ways to implement the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement adopted at COP21 in December 2015. With the agreement entering into force on November 4, 2016, COP22 will also serve as the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1). \"

THEME: ""Moving from Commitment to Action with Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) and the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI)"" WHEN: 16 November 2016, at 10:00am WHO: The COP22 OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the Africa Day high level event is to provide a platform and opportunity to critically examine the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by African countries as part of the Paris Agreement, as well as the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI), and the implications for Africa's development. Specifically the high level event seek to achieve the following objectives: - Emphasize Africa's priorities for the means of implementation of the INDCs in the context of the Paris Agreement; - Review the implications and prospects for the implementation of the NDCs for Africa, including associated challenges and opportunities; - Discuss the alignment of the NDCs with national development strategies that are inclusive and aligned to climate-resilient and low carbon transition; - Have an open conversation on the rollout of the African Renewable Energy Initiative. The expected outcomes of the Africa Day high level event includes: - Good understanding of Africa's readiness regarding the implementation the NDCs and AREI; - Opportunities and challenges for the implementation of NDCs and AREI in Africa; - Better understanding of the implications and prospects of NDCs and AREI on Africa's development. Participants: The Africa Day high level event is expected to bring together African leaders, global leaders and African stakeholders participating at COP 22 , development partners and the donor community, African Group of Negotiators on climate change, Scientists, Experts, Civil Society Organizations, Private Sector entities, women, youth and the media. BACKGROUND: The COP21 Paris agreement in 2015 acknowledges the need for further negotiation and refinement. Consequently, COP 22 is significant as the place where the Paris framework will be further refined, and gaps in the existing agreement filled in order to ensure a safe future climate. Already, the SABSTA meetings in Bonn have started to discuss the provisions of the Paris agreement that require further elaboration. This on-going negotiation is particularly important for Africa, given that the continent continues to bear the brunt of climate change while contributing the least to the phenomenon. It is thus in Africa's interest to ensure that the Paris framework is consolidated into a binding and enforceable agreement which addresses the issues that concern the continent. In the lead up to Paris, these issues included the need to ensure balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation, limiting global warming to below 1.50C, ensuring adequate means of implementation, as well as maintaining the CBDR principle. The Paris framework does not conclusively address most of the continent's concerns, and it is recognized that COP 22 represents an opportunity to advance the development of the Paris framework.

""We shall be opening an Embassy beginning with Rwanda in the last quarter of this year and hopefully in Uganda the following year,"" said the Mr Mezouar Salaheddine, Moroccan foreign affairs Minister on Wednesday in Rabat. ""The region is very strategic for us and must have our presence to boost our diplomatic and economic ties. We have already started on the process of opening an embassy in Uganda,"" he added. Mr Salaheddine made the revelation in an interview with the Daily Monitor after addressing about 55 African journalists participating in a press trip in the run up to the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that will be held in Marrakech from November 7 to 18 with a focus on Africa. Once the two embassies are opened, Ugandans and Rwandans will no longer spend money on sending their passports to neighboring countries to acquire visas before visiting Morocco but rather in their countries. Currently, for one to travel to Morocco from Uganda, a visa can be acquired from the Ethiopian Capital Addis Ababa or Nairobi Kenya in a process that lasts more than seven days. Mr Salaheddine who doubles as the COP22 President also told journalists that the country is more than ready to receive about 20,000 delegates from 179 countries who will be participating in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh. The conference will include; Negotiators from the Civil society, the private Sector and State parties. ""The world has made a step forward but some issues are pending. COP22 is a conference of action where issues of financing, reducing carbon emissions and capacity building will be discussed,"" he said, adding that as country they want greenhouse gases reduced. He further emphasised that Africa needs a funding equation for food security. By 2050, Africa will only be able to feed 13 per cent of its population if climate change is not combated.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK7","New UN initiative aims to save lives and cut climate change by protecting peatlands","November 18, 2016 Friday","M2 PressWIRE","November 17, 2016 A new global initiative was launched today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 22 ) under way in Marrakech, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and save thousands of live by protecting peatlands - the largest terrestrial organic soil carbon stock. According to the UN environment Programme (UNEP), the Global Peatlands Initiative seeks mobilize governments, international organizations and academia in an effort to protect peatlands, which contain almost 100 times more carbon than tropical forests. If global temperatures continue to rise, this could lead to thawing permafrost, switching boreal and Arctic peatlands from carbon sinks to sources, resulting in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and potentially causing climate change to spiral out of control. Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment stressed that despite the Paris Agreement, global temperatures will rise over 3 degrees Celsius this century. ""This will cause misery and chaos for millions of vulnerable people, so we cannot afford to let any opportunity to reduce emissions slip by,"" he added. Mr. Solheim also urged taking action through the Global Peatlands Initiative, as it is ""critical we do not reach the tipping point that will see peatlands stop sinking carbon and start spewing it into the atmosphere, destroying any hope we have of controlling climate change."" UNEP said that peatlands are coming under increased threat from conversion for palm oil and pulp wood production, which may result in environmental problems such as enormous fires in Indonesia and Russia in recent years. In recent years, Indonesia has suffered from peat forest fires, resulting in greater emissions than the daily ones from the entire United States economy. However, emission is not the only negative impact of peatland degradation. The 2015 peat fires in Indonesia may have indirectly killed up to 100,000 people through the toxic haze, in addition to causing $ 16.1 billion in economic damage, according to recent studies. Therefore, with support from over a dozen partners, a UN Environment team launched the largest effort on peat so far, called the Global Peatlands Initiative, which aims to increase the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of peatlands in countries with significant peat deposits. The initiative was launched at the Global Landscapes Forum, the leading side event of the UN's COP22 climate change talks in Marrakech, Morocco. The Global Peatlands Initiative was founded by the governments of Indonesia, Peru, the Republic of Congo, UNEP, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, CIFOR, Wetlands International, UNEP-WCMC, GRID-Arendal, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, European Space Agency, WRI, Greifswald Mire Centre and StarVision/Sateligence. \"

The event marks a turning point in the global effort to reduce carbon emissions as the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement, agreed at COP21 last year, will enter into force during the conference. ABB Executive Committee member for the region Asia, Middle East and Africa, Frank Duggan, will join senior policymakers to champion energy efficiency as the most cost-effective way to reduce the environmental impact of development. As a key member of the United Nations Environment Programme\' s (UNEP) global action on improving appliance and equipment efficiency, ABB is helping to improve energy efficiency standards for electric motors and transformers, which accelerate energy savings. Duggan will also highlight the potential of renewables and microgrids in Africa.  On a continent where almost 600 million people lack access to electricity, energy will be the lifeblood for its ongoing development, he said.  In the past, only minerals and oil and gas were seen as \' treasures\' in Africa. Today, the continent understands that solar power, wind power, geothermal power, and large scale hydro power are essential in helping drive it towards a robust electrically powered future.  At ABB, we have available today the technology to help remote or isolated areas connect to a reliable and clean electricity supply. A good example is a microgrid solution we are providing for the Nairobi logistics hub of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Duggan added. The ICRC microgrid solution incorporates both solar power and diesel to ensure a reliable power supply in a region where outages are common, and reduce carbon emissions. It is essential that the ICRC hub can rely on uninterrupted power, as it is responsible for delivering food, medicines and relief supplies across the African continent. At COP22 , ABB\' s head of microgrids, Maxine Ghavi, will discuss the expanding use of microgrid technology and integration of renewables with co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse, Bertrand Piccard, and ICRC Head of Delegation Pascal Mauchle. Ghavi and Piccard will offer insights into  running the world without consuming the earth using clean technology. ABB experts will be available at the company\' s booth with cutting-edge products like YuMi, the world\' s first truly collaborative dual-arm industrial robot, ABB\' s electric vehicle fast-charging infrastructure, and demonstrations of microgrid and wind technology. As a pioneering technology leader at the forefront of the Energy and Fourth Industrial Revolutions, ABB is uniquely positioned to help Africa build clean, low-carbon, safe and effective modern energy systems, as well as to help utilities, industry, and transport and infrastructure providers take advantage of the latest technologies to support the continent\' s development. \"

The International Symposium of the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the United Nations 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), held during COP 22 , discussed how to advance Sustainable Tourism in a Changing Climate. The Symposium aimed at increasing awareness on tourism and climate change-related issues and encourage the sector to engage in actions that reinforce national commitments to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. 'The tourism sector is both a vector and a victim of climate change and we are fully committed to contribute to reach the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. This event was essential to advance this agenda, especially the discussion on measurement and reporting requirements as a basis for identifying and prioritizing climate action in tourism', said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai. 'Sustainable tourism creates opportunities and assembles partners to help transform the industry towards low emissions and more efficient and less polluting operations. We must make tourism and every other industry contributor to our climate change action and a sustainable future', said Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, in her video address to the event. The event focused in particular in the need for partnerships with the private sector and the role of sustainable transportation to accelerate climate action in tourism. 'Climate change can only be addressed if actors from all parts of society - governments, businesses, NGOs and consumers - make a global and broad shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. Accounting for 10% of GDP, 7% of the world's exports and one in 11 jobs, tourism is one of the main economic sectors in the world, and as such has to be at the core of this essential transition,' said Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of the 10YFP Secretariat. The International Symposium was part of the 3-day COP22 Tourism Side Events organized by the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme and hosted by the Ministry of Tourism of Morocco. The Programme is a partnership led by UNWTO with the Governments of France, Morocco and the Republic of Korea as co-leads, with support of the 10YFP Secretariat at UN Environment, aimed at accelerating the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production.

Amid the impending election of probably the biggest international set back to any climate change deal, in the form of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, global nations spent two weeks in November trying to establish the best way forward for implementing the targets set out in the Paris Agreement. Towards the end of talks, Trump's election was confirmed and the climate change sceptic who has previously pledged to withdraw the US from the Agreement, was the focus of a document adopted by the conference to call on all nations to ""honour promises made in Paris and renew their attempts to stave off disaster"". Recent months have brought around a swell in the number of nations committed to the agreement made in Paris. Since September 88 nations, including 11 at the conference in Marrakech, have ratified the Paris Agreement. That number exceeds the 55 nations representing 55 per cent of global emissions needed for the agreement to become law. Although the Paris Agreement noted that voluntary national emissions targets would not be enough to meet global warming goals, the COP22 acknowledged that 2018 implementation of tougher carbon cuts was unlikely for governments, instead opting to put pressure on reinforcing existing plans. Many countries pledged to review ambitions by 2020. The 47-member Climate Vulnerable Forum, made up of developing countries declared a move towards green transition, with an ultimate aim of 100 per cent renewable. The conference also launched the NDC Partnership, a coalition of nations aimed at helping poorer nations meet their climate goals. Four countries, including the US, took the opportunity to publish their strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Germany is targeting 80-95 per cent cuts from 1990 levels, while Canada and the US plan for an 80 per cent reduction form 2005 levels. Mexico published a similar strategy. A 2050 pathways platform, championed by French envoy, Laurence Tubiana, was backed by 22 countries, 15 cities and almost 200 major businesses. Interestingly, the conference chose to defer defining the blurred lines between political decisions taken in the context of national sovereignty against global uniformity. Countries agreed that COP23 will take place in 2018 in Bonn, Germany, with Fiji as president of the negotiations. A spring and winter session in 2017 will be largely used for consultation between governments and preparation of the exact details outlined in Paris. Financial pledges during COP fell short of the $100 billion richer countries have pledged to mobilise by 2020. A roadmap to this investment, delivered by the UK and Australia was cautiously welcomed by developing countries and the UN, but it was noted that the UN did not endorse it. $50 million was pledged by the US, UK and Germany to improve carbon accounting in developing countries. A further (EURO)23 million was pledged for a clean technology expertise centre and Germany paid the bulk of $80 million requested from the Adaption Fund.

EI: education a key tool ""Teachers of the world, united under the EI banner, believe that education and teachers are the most powerful agents you can trust in the fight against climate change,"" stressed Sinyolo. He acknowledged that adequate training, tools, resources, and support from governments and society are necessary for teachers to successfully deliver effective education for sustainable development (ESD) and climate change education (CCE). New measures should be taken to adopt a model of sustainable development that meets the current needs of society without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, Sinyolo added. Implications of new economy EI believes that ""education is the fuel of the future"" and a key tool to achieve sustainable development and to raise global awareness on climate change, he added. Indeed, the education sector has a crucial role to play in the transition to a low carbon global economy, and a new type of economy has massive implications for workers and the education and training that will be needed to prepare young people for life and for work. Teachers and educators are crucial in the delivery of quality ESD and CCE, he said. Good practices on climate change education do exist, he emphasised, i.e. education institutions and teachers have made tremendous efforts in protecting the environment and fighting against climate change through greening schools, recycling programmes, or community awareness-raising campaigns.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK17","COP22 spotlights renewable energy","June 27, 2016","Investment Adviser","Can renewable energy projects deliver returns to investors? One of the most significant landmarks for the global renewable energy industry over the past six months was the signing of the historic Paris Climate Deal. A total of 174 countries plus the EU put pen to paper, pledging to take action to help mitigate the negative effects of climate change. Now, more than ever, governments cannot help but take more decisive action to lay the groundwork for new legislation and policies that will engineer a more positive investment environment into renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV), wind and energy storage projects. In the run-up to the Marrakesh COP22 conference in November this year, more can be done to ensure that the UK investment sector is fully engaged to join the fight against climate change, and to generate strong and impressive returns from renewable energy investments. A key trend hitting headlines during the past six months has been the widespread 'divestment' movement. Major pension funds across the globe, such as Washington DC's $6.4bn (GBP4.4bn) city government pension fund, have been openly divesting from fossil fuels in a bid to protect pensioners from their ever-increasing risk. Moreover, looking back to 2015, Norway's $890bn government pension fund announced its pledge to sell off many of its investments relating to coal. Divestment from fossil fuels and reinvestment into renewable energy is not just a good corporate social responsibility exercise. Investing in climate change solutions can generate strong, inflation-linked returns. As anticipation and expectation builds for the COP22 conference, the UK government, in collaboration with the energy and investment industries, can do more to educate the market on the resilient and low-risk returns that are to be had from climate change solutions - particularly renewable energy projects. Not a day seems to have gone by since the start of 2016 without oil's unpredictable price moves hitting the headlines Louise Ward, Low Carbon If all 174 countries involved in the signing of the Paris Climate Change agreement truly want to move to a low-carbon economy, increased levels of investment into low-carbon assets will be essential. Not a day seems to have gone by since the start of 2016 without oil's unpredictable price moves hitting the headlines. One moment, investors will read reports such as recent news that Brent oil prices have fallen for a fourth consecutive session due to a strong US dollar. The next, they will read that oil prices have hit a six-month high. One thing is for certain - investors in the UK might be forgiven for not knowing how to navigate their way through the patchwork of differing reports, global uncertainty and highly volatile prices in today's market. This is where renewables may present themselves as an attractive alternative. Renewable energy technologies have a proven, strong track record of improving the UK's overall energy mix while generating its electricity needs. Onshore wind, for example, is 20 years old and was recently described by the Department of Energy and Climate Change as ""the leading individual technology for the generation of electricity from renewable sources in 2014"". These are proven, credible energy sources. Finally, investment into climate change solutions can stand up to financial scrutiny. They are typically long term and inflation-linked. Most climate change solutions are infrastructure projects and are often incorrectly categorised as part of the private equity industry. Mercer, a global investment consultancy firm, recently conducted a study into the characteristics of future investors and how many will take on a climate-aware role. These investors will realise the potential of renewable energy to shape our future and that major financial markets will cease to be dominated by the giants of the oil and fossil fuel industries. Moreover, these investors will be more likely to be influenced by investment decisions they make at home: for example, those who can see the benefits of solar PV on their roof, may also see potential in solar PV projects at scale. 'Future-maker' investors are on the rise in France, with the government recently calling on institutional investors to disclose the carbon intensity of their investment portfolios. This level of engagement and awareness could be generated in the UK ahead of the COP22 conference. With the historic Paris agreement signed and the COP22 conference ahead of us, the next six months are certainly brimming with anticipation and promise for renewable energy. However, the lead-up will also be pivotal in educating the financial markets on the strong part they have to play in the fight against climate change, and in engineering the low carbon economy of the future. <span>Louise Ward is investment strategist at Low Carbon \"

STORY A HYPERLINK https://www.ceres.org/files/agriculture-statement-cop22 letter signed by the CEOs of 13 different food and beverage companies, including Unilever, Mars, Danone, Kellogg and Ben & Jerry s reads Unchecked, agricultural emissions will outstrip reductions from decarbonising the economy elsewhere, pushing us beyond the 2% limit. Agriculture-related emissions could take up the entire global greenhouse gas emissions budget by 2050. A food system already under pressure will become destabilised, placing livelihoods, farming communities, agricultural supply chains and consumers at risk. Food price shocks will increase as climate impact on yields become more acute. Trump Whilst the letter does not explicitly mention Donald Trump, it comes amid fears the president-elect will remove the US from HYPERLINK COP22 following statements that he believes climate change to be a Chinese conspiracy aimed at making US manufacturing ""non-competitive"". He has repeatedly referred to climate change as a hoax and spoken against the totalitarian tactics of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Commitments Besides calling on leaders to help meet the targets of the agreement, the companies restated pledges made last year to: halve food loss and waste in order to reduce carbon emissions and improve incomes; eliminate deforestation; improve soil management to cut carbon dioxide output and reclaim unused land to increase overall food production. In 2015 Danone released a company climate policy report stating its aim to reach zero net carbon emissions by 2050. A spokesperson told us:\~ Being a food company means we rely on nature, agriculture and the farmers to do our job. Therefore climate change is a particular concern for us, especially since this has a significant impact on the natural cycles which play a vital role in the food system "" The Mars company said it decided to attend the COP22 in order to join the dialogue and share best practices with our industry partners. At the same time, we used the opportunity to urge the business community and global leaders to take bold action to implement the targets agreed to last year in Paris for tackling climate change. Progress has been made, but there is much more to do.

Today nearly 200 countries have backed a proclamation declaring implementing them an ""urgent duty"". The European Parliament was present at the conference with a delegation composed of 12 MEPs. We asked delegation head Giovanni La Via, an Italian member of the EPP group, about the next steps and the Parliament's role. How was the COP22 conference in Marrakesh different from the COP21 one in Paris? COP21 was about the main objectives: the big principles on how to save the planet. COP22 is about implementing it, turning the climate commitments into action. What were the most important topics discussed in Marrakech? One of the most important topics was climate finance. Developing countries want to be sure - and rightly so - that the money needed for them to adapt to the consequences of climate change will be delivered. However, this cannot be only public money. What was the Parliament delegation pushing for in Marrakech? We were mainly there to ensure that people continued to have trust in the process. This is a trust-building exercise. We are therefore here to reaffirm that the EU will deliver on its commitments whatever happens. What is the main achievement of the COP22 ? I would say the Marrakesh Action Proclamation that reaffirms the willingness of all countries to fight against climate change and to support sustainable development. By 2020 countries should reveal their 2050 long-term commitments to address climate change. What is the Parliament already working on in order to implement the Paris agreement? We will already be delivering concrete policies next month when we vote on the reform of the EU's carbon market. We will soon start work on reducting emissions from individual EU countries. Tthis is the so-called effort sharing legislation and there is also a new legislative proposal on land-use, land-use change and forestry. What has the EU already done? How advanced are we in implementing the Paris agreement? We are on track to implement our initial 2030 commitments. We are also set to surpass our 2020 goal of a 20% cut in emissions and are now aiming even higher. What could be the biggest challenge for the EU during the implementation process of the Paris agreement? That could be consolidating the trust that allowed 197 countries to agree on a common declaration in Marrakesh. This is why it is so important that we reaffirm, in spite of the many political uncertainties we face, that the EU will deliver on its commitments. The target is decarbonisation. The question is only about how much the EU itself wants to lead this revolution and push other global actors to follow this path. \"

To achieve this, the trade union movement has demanded that governments: \'b7 Commit to a just transition for workers and their communities ""The objective is to contain the increase in average temperature below two degrees by 2020, and ensure a just transition to a carbon-free future for workers and communities,"" said Education International (EI) General Secretary Fred van Leeuwen. EI objectives According to EI, which is part of the trade union delegation comprising 150 representatives from 50 countries, education must be at the heart of national, regional, and global efforts to fight climate change. Firstly, while implementing the Paris Agreement, governments must ensure that climate change is included within education policies and curricula in their countries. Secondly, governments should adopt measures strengthening initial training and continuous professional development for education personnel. Education workers must be adequately equipped to provide quality education on education for sustainable development (ESD), including the challenges arising from climate change. Thirdly, EI believes that it is necessary to strengthen the Paris Agreement by providing adequate and predictable financial resources for education, training and research on climate change. Finally, overall consistency should be ensured between the Paris Agreement, the sustainable development goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 and the UNESCO global action programme for ESD. For EI, such an integrated governance will define a solid international framework aiming to curb climate change. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \"

They conveyed their appreciation to the Kingdom of Morocco for hosting the conference and for the warm hospitality. The Ministers reiterated their unwavering commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and noted the enduring relevance of the Convention\' s principles and provisions, such as equity and CBDR & RC to successfully tackling one of the most serious challenges of our times. The Convention and its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement provides the primary platform for inclusive and fair collective action by the international community to urgently address climate change, informed by the latest science. In this regard, the Ministers welcomed the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which represents the best contract possible in balancing the circumstances of all countries and thereby the best opportunity for the international community to reverse the disruption of the Earth\' s climate systems caused by human activities. This is the time for urgent action. The direction of travel from Paris is irreversible. There can be no backtracking on commitments by developed Parties, and no attempts to renegotiate the terms of the pact reached in Paris. Parties must live up to their responsibilities. Ministers vowed to continue and strengthen the leadership role their countries have demonstrated \- both in negotiations in the UNFCCC and in terms of concrete action on the ground, to reduce emissions, and to adapt to climate change impacts. The Ministers therefore stressed the urgency of enhancing pre-2020 action and ambition, and they emphasized the importance of the Doha Agreement entering into force without further delay and also the realization of the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020. The Marrakech Climate Change Conference is an implementation and action-oriented COP and has provided the BASIC countries and many others, with a useful platform for launching action initiatives. The Ministers expressed full confidence that a direct and legally sound way would be found at the Conference to progress with the technical work required to operationalize the Paris Agreement in a balanced and comprehensive manner, including anchoring the Adaptation Fund under the Paris Agreement and ensuring that all mandates are allocated to specific bodies. The BASIC Ministers will continue to advance the legitimate interests of all fellow developing countries, with emphasis on the needs of developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, but who are historically least responsible for causing it. In this context, the Ministers stressed that adequate means of implementation support, in the form of new and additional climate finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, for all developing countries that require it, is indispensable if we are to meet the temperature reduction goals and adaptation goal set out in the Paris Agreement.

Before the Conference wraps up on 18 November, State Parties hope to define the rules for the accord and to lay out a viable plan for providing at least $ 100 billion a year to developing countries to support climate action. Adopted by 196 States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) last December, the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It entered into force in record time on 4 November 2016. The Marrakech Conference includes a number of meetings and high-level events, including the high-level segment to be attended by dozens of heads of State and Government, on Tuesday 15 November. So we really hit the ground with this unexpected success in many ways of the entry into force of the Agreement much earlier than expected.

""The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) endorsed at our Assembly will be the very first global market-based measure to address CO2 emissions from any industry sector,"" President Aliu reported to the COP22 Plenary. He also confirmed that States representing more than 86.5 per cent of international air traffic had already volunteered to participate in the new global market-based measure (GMBM) from its earliest pilot phase. ""Importantly, the pragmatic consensus ICAO achieved on the CORSIA accommodates the diversity in levels of State-by-State socio-economic development, volumes of international air traffic, and many other contributing factors,"" he stressed. ""It will very helpfully complement the extensive basket of measures for environmental protection already being pursued by ICAO and its Member States since 2010."" The ICAO basket of measures includes the air transport sector's common pursuit of more innovative aircraft technologies, streamlined operational procedures to decrease aircraft noise and fuel burn, and wider use of sustainable alternative jet fuels. These priorities have been helping international aviation to surpass its aspirational goal for a recurring two per cent annual fuel efficiency improvement, as well as carbon neutral growth from 2020. In addition to its Member States' endorsement for the CORSIA, ICAO's 39th Assembly also welcomed the development of the world's very first CO2 emissions standard. It will become applicable to most classes of new commercial aircraft entering service as of 2020.

The fully electric fleet will shuttle delegates. More than 25,000 participants from 195 countries are expected to attend the annual climate summit Nov. 7 to 18. It marks the second time the United Nations will use a zero-emission shuttle fleet in support of public transport at one of its major conferences. The COP22 fleet will feature the Renault ZOE subcompact car, the Nissan LEAF compact car and the seven-seat Nissan e-NV200 van. The vehicles will be available to shuttle delegates 24 hours, seven days a week to key venues at the conference, as a complement to public transportation. The Alliance will also provide a network of more than 20 accelerated and standard charging stations at strategic locations. The accelerated charging stations will be able to charge the EVs from 0 to 80 percent in about one hour. The Renault-Nissan Alliance is the global leader in zero-emission vehicles. With six models, it has already sold more than 360,000 electric vehicles worldwide. Nissan LEAF, launched in 2010, remains the industry's best-selling EV. Renault ZOE is the best-performing EV in Europe. The Alliance has sold about half of the electric vehicles on the road globally today including the Renault Twizy two-seat, urban commuter vehicle, and the Nissan e-NV200 van, which has been on sale in Europe and Japan since 2014. In addition, the Renault-Nissan's Tangier, Morocco, plant is designed to move towards 'zero CO2' emissions through the use of renewable resources, for thermal energy produced on site, as well as its purchased electricity. The plant began operations in 2012, and its approach remains unique in the automobile industry In Morocco, Renault Group is the only major automaker to market a fully electric range of vehicles. Thanks to COP22 and the desire of the Kingdom to develop low-carbon energy, several companies have decided to bet on the 100 percent electric car by buying fleets. 'The Renault-Nissan Alliance is proud to contribute to COP22 by providing a fleet of 50 100 percent electric vehicles,' said Marc Nassif, managing director of Renault Morocco Group and Alliance COP22 leader. 'This technology, coupled with an increasingly decarbonized electric mix, is the solution for individual mobility to address the issue of global warming and enhance air quality in our cities.' Isao Sekiguchi, managing director of the North Africa Region and Egypt for Nissan Group, agreed. 'Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today,' said Sekiguchi. 'The Renault-Nissan Alliance was not only quick to recognize the import contribution the automotive industry could make to the collective effort to tackle emissions, but was also quick to act.' The Alliance was also an official partner of COP21. The fleet of 200 electric vehicles from the Alliance represented the world's largest EV fleet ever provided for an international conference. This fleet shuttled more than 8,000 delegates, media and negotiators during the two-week United Nations annual climate change conference in Paris last year. In doing so, it traveled at least 175,000 kilometers without emitting any CO2 tailpipe emissions and without using any petroleum, which saved nearly 182 barrels of oil and avoided 18 tons of CO2 being emitted. The Alliance will also participate in Solutions COP22 , an international exhibition on climate-change solutions, to be held in the Green Zone in Marrakech. The exhibition, which will take place Nov. 7- 18, will feature CO2 solutions from cities, businesses and other organizations around the world. In addition, the Alliance will have electric vehicles available for public test drives. For more information about COP22 , click here.

The COP21 Agreement was signed last year in Paris, France. Insufficient measures However, it is clear that the commitments by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are insufficient to reach the objective to limit temperature rise to 2\'b0C by 2020.

African angle At the conference opening, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, who chaired COP21, said that the COP22 must be the ""African COP"". Given that 36 of the 50 countries most affected by climate change are located in sub-Saharan Africa, Education International (EI) understands the urgency of significant financial resources being allocated to strengthen the national capacities of the countries hardest hit by these changes. For EI, a critical issue over the coming days will be to determine how many resources are needed and when they should be allocated. Centrality of education EI acknowledges that many of the medium- and long-term challenges raised by climate change require structural changes which must be taken into account by unions. The transition towards a global economy with low carbon emissions will have a significant impact on workers, as well as on education and training. That is why EI supports the demand for a ""just transition"" proposed by the trade union sector. \"

Nuclear techniques can be used to both mitigate and help adapt to the consequences of climate change. The 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), taking place from 7 to 18 November in Marrakech, provides a platform for countries to present their climate change strategies. 'Nuclear power has already made a significant contribution to avoiding carbon dioxide emissions and it will continue to do so,' said IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano on 4 November in a statement marking the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which was concluded last year. In order to assess the impact of climate change on the environment and ecosystems, a precise understanding of what is happening to species at an atomic scale is required. Nuclear science can enable Parties to the UNFCCC to evaluate changes in the carbon cycle and observe the impacts of ocean acidification caused by increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and other stressors on sensitive marine ecosystems and species. 'Nuclear and isotopic techniques make an important contribution to tackling serious environmental challenges such as desertification, soil erosion, pollution and deteriorating water quality,' Mr Amano said. At COP22 , the IAEA will participate with other United Nations Agencies in side events related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These will include 'Meeting the 2oC Challenge: Nexus of Innovation and Clean Energy' (focusing on SDG7 on affordable and clean energy), 'Science for informed mitigation and adaptation choices' (focusing on SDG17 on partnerships for the goals), and 'Oceans: Science based solutions for achieving adaptation and mitigation goals' (focusing on SDG14 on life below water).

He spoke at several other oceans events and was also in demand at activities organised by and for the youth, especially to call for their voices to be better heard in the climate change negotiations Mr Jumeau, Seychelles' Ambassador for Climate Change and Small Island Developing State Issues, delivered a report on the oceans and climate change to a High-Level Event on Accelerating Climate Action. Fellow rapporteurs to the plenary were the Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) who spoke for agriculture and food security, Norway's Minister for Climate and Environment on forests, and the President of the World Water Council who reported on water. Ambassador Jumeau was a constant and prominent speaker on ocean issues, including Seychelles' pioneering role in developing the concept of a blue economy, throughout the conference. He spoke at a press conference to promote the inclusion of marine ecosystems in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) organised by the world renowned Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Under the Paris Agreement on climate change that came into force three days before COP22 started, countries have to submit their plans (NDCs) to tackle climate change from 2020 onwards. There is a growing global push, especially by large ocean states like Seychelles, to include oceans, seas and coastal marine ecosystems in NDCs as a means to tackle, and especially adapt to, climate change. Ambassador Jumeau consequently championed Seychelles' debt-for-adaptation swap to turn 30 percent of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) into marine protected areas, marine spatial plan (MSP) and development of a blue economy at a side event on Making Adaptation (to climate change) Effective through Ecosystem based Approaches. His presentation led to calls from the organisers of the event, including IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world's largest environmental network) for Mr Jumeau to be an ambassador for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to climate change. EbA is the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of natural ecosystems to help people and communities adapt to climate change. This includes oceans, seas, coastal habitats, coral reefs, wetlands and mangroves, etc, in the marine sector. Mr Jumeau was also a keynote speaker at a side event on Building Resilience for Climate Change Adaptation in Archipelagic and Small Island Developing States where he championed Seychelles' groundbreaking work to find innovative solutions and financing to tackle climate change. The event was organised by Indonesia, the world's largest island state with more than 17,000 islands. It was the ambassador's presentation at Ocean Action Day, which after many years of trying was for the first time held in the Blue Zone of the conference venue reserved for the official climate negotiations between governments, that led to him being chosen to report on oceans to the high-level plenary. He spoke on Oceans and Climate: Solutions to the Core Issues (Food Security, Mitigation, Adaptation, and Building Resilience). Mr Jumeau was also in demand to speak at youth events from the first day of the conference. These included taking part in a panel discussion on Partnerships for Enhancing High Ambition: Youth as a Catalyst for Climate Action organized by YOUNGO (Youth Non-Governmental Organisations). He also spoke at a Commonwealth intergenerational climate dialogue entitled Walk the Talk, and a panel discussion on Intergenerational Equity and Youth Empowerment: Opportunities of Cooperation between Youth and (UNFCCC) Parties. Fellow speakers at some of these events were from the Mauritius-based SIDS Youth AIMS Hub (SYAH) which has a very active branch in Seychelles.

Combatting climate change must translate into concrete actions by all actors including through the greater involvement of non-state actors. This is why the Marrakech Conference will seek to link up and mobilise state officials, CEOs, presidents of associations and representatives of cities from all over the world to ensure greater commitment from both public and private institutions. That said, there are still challenges to overcome such as the issue of financing and irreversible losses and damages. There is a need for an international mechanism to help and support most-vulnerable countries through technical assistance, capacity building and training. The issue of financing is also at stake since the roadmap of the $100bn pre-2020 needs further negotiations and clarity. Greater commitment is required in this crucial area. How can the development of capacity building in the Southern countries be ensured? MEZOUAR: Southern countries are the most exposed to the consequences of climate change, even though they have not contributed to the global rise of temperatures. The least developed countries, along with the Small Island Developing States, are among the most vulnerable. Approximately 60m people have already been displaced by climate change, which is also undermining long-term growth. Therefore, there is a need to develop strong capacities in terms of training, capacity building and technology transfer. This will have to be channelled by funding from the North and the development of technology transfer mechanisms as well as through South-South or triangular cooperation mechanisms. Nevertheless, concrete actions are not easy to take. Up to now, too little financial support had been channelled to sub-Saharan countries, particularly for adaptation. This is what motivated Morocco to launch the Adaptation of African Agriculture Initiative (AAA), which aims at ensuring food security by reducing the vulnerability of African countries' agriculture to climate change as well as to support capacity building in this key sector of Africa's economy. Furthermore, Morocco stands ready to share, through South-South cooperation and triangular partnerships, its rich experience stemming from its national ""climate revolution"" and energy transition, initiated over a decade ago under the leadership of His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, which set very ambitious goals of achieving 52% of the country's electrical production capacity from renewable sources by 2030 as well as hosting the largest solar plant in the world. Increased solidarity is required to ensure that collectively we can mitigate the impact of climate change and support each other, particularly the most vulnerable countries. \"

""The transport sector is very uniquely positioned to deliver both on decarbonisation as well as on human well-being. (...) Countries are stepping out to it"", underscored Paula Caballero, Global Director, Climate Program of the World Resources Institute, at a press conference on Saturday. She said that the New Urban Agenda adopted at Habitat III, the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, in Quito, in October 2016, ""very clearly encapsulates that"". ""Habitat III was just one month ago and clearly the transformation that is needed in the urban sector, that is needed in our cities, can be driven by transport"", Ms. Caballero added. ""It is about ensuring that there is infrastructure for cycling and much better public sector transportation"". Transport counts for 24 percent of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Without disruptive action, transport emissions can be expected to grow from 7.7 gigatonnes to around 15 gigatonnes by 2050. For 45 percent of countries, transport is the largest source of energy related emissions. The transport sector is very uniquely positioned to deliver both on decarbonisation as well as on human well-being At Marrakech Climate Conference, transport experts and leaders took stock of progress made on transport initiatives since the previous UN Climate Conference in Paris (COP 21) last year. Over the last 12 months, the MobiliseYourCity initiative secured 35 million euros in funding and announced the start of developing Sustainable Urban Mobility plans in Morocco and Cameroon. The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) is supporting an additional 40 countries to realize the financial, and CO2 benefits of improved vehicle fuel economy. And Airport Carbon Accreditation Scheme now has 173 certified airports worldwide, including 26 carbon neutral airports. The Partnership for Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) launched a global roadmap for decarbonisation of the transport sector at COP 22 . SLoCaT is a partnership between international organizations, business sector and NGOs, seeking to promote sustainable transport and focusing on land transport in developing countries. ""We are fully on board as the transport sector. We think we are increasingly well organized, we think we have increasing political support and that we have the right ideas"", said the Secretary General of SLoCaT, Cornie Huizenga, at the press conference. The Morrocan Minister in charge of Environment and 'Climate Champion', Hakima El Haite, expressed her optimism for the future. ""Transport can be revolutionary tomorrow. We will have solar roads and maybe we will have solar vehicles"", she said at the press conference. ""The transport initiatives, by creating a new reality on the ground, increase popular understanding and support for climate action which, in turn, drives up Governments ambition to tackle climate change"", she added.

Several events were held throughout this Water Action Day, including a high level panel organized by the host country of this global summit on climate change in the United Nations blue zone. The African Development Bank (AfDB) was represented by its Director for Water Supply and Sanitation, Mohamed El Azizi in the discussions panel. The Moroccan Junior Minister for Water, Charafat Afilal; Water Ministers Barmou Salifou, Niouga Ambroise Ouedraogo and Sidick Abdelkerim Haggar from Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, respectively, as well as the Director of the Moroccan Office of Electricity and Potable Water (ONEE), Ali Fassi El Fihri, took part in this roundtable's lively discussions. Water mentioned in 85% of INDCs Water is at the heart of many challenges posed by climate change, and calls for as many solutions. Even a slight increase in the earth's temperature will have serious consequences: climate variability is increasing and its impacts are more numerous, more serious and longer lasting, particularly extreme climate events (floods and droughts, for example). Such phenomena lead to increased water pollution, higher incidence of malnutrition, more migration and more significant losses, particularly in infrastructure and agricultural production. More than 85% of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) presented by countries participating in the Paris Agreement cite water as a key adaptation issue, the UNFCCC noted during COP22 . During their presentations, the panellists addressed the entire range of issues and challenges related to water that affect African countries: access to potable water and sanitation services, irrigation, agriculture and food security, health issues, lack of water infrastructure, as well as medium and long term perspectives on climate change. 'Water insecurity leads to heightened conflicts, tension among populations, and causes migrations that threaten global stability,' stated Minister Charafat Afilal. 'Africa is the continent that is most vulnerable to climate change,' said Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the AfDB's Water Supply and Sanitation Department. He added, 'It's about providing justice, in the context of climate financing, to this continent, which has suffered the consequences of climate change without having been responsible for it. African countries are concerned with the complex and difficult access to climate financing, particularly for fragile countries.' Large water adaptation projects financed by AfDB in Morocco The Bank has financed large projects for climate change adaptation in Morocco. Among these are the water transfer project between the Rabat and Casablanca watersheds that impacts the daily lives of 5 million people, the Marrakech region water supply project, benefitting 2 million people, and the Tetouan region potable water supply security project via the transfer of water from the Tangier Med port facilities to the Moulay El Hassan Bel Mehdi dam. 'I would like to congratulate the Bank for its ability to react, responding quickly to our financing needs for this project,' stated ONEE Director Ali Fassi Fihri. '[It] has ensured service continuity for potable water in the area, because without supplementary service prior to the end of 2016, the entire Tetouan area would be confronted with a catastrophic water shortage.' On the Water Action Day, Morocco used the opportunity to officially launch a new initiative, 'Water for Africa '. This initiative began prior to COP22 , in July 2016 in Rabat, during the International Conference on Water and Climate, organized by the country in partnership with the World Water Council. The goal is to mobilise the international community to develop an emergency action plan on water to confront climate change in Africa and thereby mobilise the necessary financial resources. The Blue Book on Water and Climate was also released today, the result of reports and recommendations formulated during the conference held in Rabat last July.

The move has been triggered by the fund's interest to be in line with the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference (COP21) Paris Agreement. After an evaluation of the fund's portfolio, the scheme switched its largest core investment fund""""the VBV Passive World Equities Fund""""to low carbon investments, disclosed a VBV statement. ""As market leader, we believe that the carbon footprint of investments and appropriate decarbonisation strategies for capital investments are landmark issues that reach far beyond the pension fund sector,"" stated Head of Investments G\'fcnther Schiendl in the release. ""In the interest of our customers and with our responsibility to keep the environment in mind, we have decided to send out a signal and hope there will be a knock-on effect among the companies we share the market with,"" Schiendl elaborated. He could not be reached for further comment by press time. The fund's passive equity fund makes up around 40% of the scheme's overall assets, worth approximately EUR850 million, and invests in around 1,600 stocks. Following VBV's new low carbon investment approach, the investment fund now solely allocates to companies that have minimised their carbon emission to 100 tons of CO2 from 221 tons of CO2. This equates to a reduction of 55% of the fund's carbon intensity, or 100,000 tons of CO2 per annum. The significant reduction of the fund's portfolio was possible by switching to the MSCI Low Carbon indices. The indices reduce the weighting of individual equities from the energy-intensive sectors energy, raw materials and suppliers, and consequently reduce the carbon intensity of the respective portfolio, the release added. State Street Global Advisors acted as advisor. As part of its low-carbon approach, VBV is planning to roll out an environmental management system across all areas this year, the statement disclosed. No further details could be ascertained by press time. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK40","Egypt steps up travel bans on rights defenders with ""chilling effect"", UN expert warns","November 24, 2016 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","November 24, 2016 A United Nations rights expert has criticised Egypt's increasing use of travel bans on human rights defenders, warning that the measures are hindering their legitimate work and infringing their fundamental rights. ""Restrictions imposed on defenders' freedom of movement have regrettably become routine in what is seen as a broader crackdown against Egyptian civil society that has continued unabated since 2011,"" said the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Michel Forst. Mr. Forst has received the cases of more than 15 Egyptian human rights defenders, who were prevented from travelling abroad in 2016 for regional and international events. The restrictions are often based on investigations relating to a controversial foreign funding case, also known as Case No. 173, which reportedly led to the leaders and staff of at least 37 Egyptian rights organisations being charged with receiving 'illegal foreign funding' and 'working without permission'. ""It is seriously concerning to observe that travel bans, along with other restrictions on fundamental freedoms to free speech, association and assembly, seem to have become politically motivated means to stifle civil society movement in the country, and to choke legitimate and democratic debate, both within and outside Egypt,"" said the UN expert. ""The growing use of travel bans as a method of preventing the legitimate exercise of rights has a chilling effect on human rights defenders and general society."" Mr. Forst also warned that stopping people participating in rights activities abroad could violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and breach the spirit of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which gives people the right to promote human rights ""at the national and international levels"". Despite reassurances by the Government that the travel bans are in line with the principle of criminal justice, Mr. Forst highlighted a series of procedural concerns. For example, he said, the activists were not being notified of the bans before they attempted to travel, and were often not told the legal basis or how to appeal, resulting in their inability to challenge the decision. ""I strongly advise the Egyptian State to repeal the existing travel bans and refrain from imposing further restrictions against human rights defenders, to ensure that it does not contravene international human rights norms and standards,"" said Mr. Forst. ""The Government should consider dedicating its legal, administrative and financial resources to empowering civil society, rather than obstructing its activities and undermining fundamental freedoms, which the State is charged to respect and protect."" Recent cases have included Mozn Hassan, a prominent women's rights defender and executive director of Nazra for Feminist Studies, whose travel has been repeatedly hindered, including a planned visit to Sweden earlier on 25 November to receive a human rights award. Another defender, Azza Soliman, was prevented from travelling to a training event on women's rights in Jordan on 19 November. Four days before that, Ahmed Ragheb, founder of the National Community for Human Rights and Law, was not permitted to fly to Morocco for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ). Mr. Forst's statement has been endorsed by David Kaye, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and Maina Kiai, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK41","-COP22: Water takes centre stage as AfDB showcases success stories","November 11, 2016 Friday","ENP Newswire","Deliberations at the ongoing COP22 climate conference in Marrakech took a different turn on Wednesday as delegates shifted focus to the nexus between water and climate change in celebration of the first Water Day at the COP. Organized for the first time in the history of UN Climate Change Conferences, the Action Day for Water at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ) created through the Global Climate Action Agenda calls for more attention to water as a way of providing solutions to help implement the Paris Agreement. The action day which is dedicated to discussing the relationship between water issues and climate change-positioning and to raise its profile in the relevant negotiations, attracted large number of participants from Government delegations, international organisations, civil society and media. At the first session which centred on the 'Water for Africa' initiative, panellists included Water and Sanitation Ministers from Morocco, Burkina Faso and Niger as well as the Water and Sanitation Director of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Mohammed El Azizi. The speakers identified water as a critical element for successful climate change mitigation, as many efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depend on reliable access to water resources. Highlighting Africa's water-related challenges within the climate context, Niouga Ambroise Ouedraogo, Burkina Faso's Water and Sanitation Minister, regretted that as much as most impacts of climate change in Africa are linked to droughts, floods and sea level rise, many African states still have problems accessing multilateral funds with no capacity to prepare proposals for bankable projects. Reiterating AfDB's commitment to boosting the capacity of African states to access predictable and fast-tracked financing mechanism to cope with climate-induced water stress, El Azizi highlighted the Bank's constant focus on integrated water resources management, improved transboundary integration and planning, and proactive innovative approaches and projects that are assisting African states to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Some of such projects which cut across all African sub-regions, according to El Azizi, are the Thwake multi-purpose water resources development project in Kenya, which mainstreams climate resilience by improving water security through the construction of dam, irrigation schemes and water supply, the Yaounde urban drainage project in Central Africa, and the Niger Basin HYCOS Project, which promotes effective management of water resources through quality hydrological data and information in West African states. Others according to the AfDB Water Chief, who also oversees the African Water Facility (AWF), are the detailed plan of the Songwe River Basin Development Programme in Southern Africa, which envisions a conducive environment for transboundary water resources through flood control planning and climate proofing in the Songwe River Basin between Malawi and Tanzania, and the Rabat-Casablanca and Marrakech region projects, which involve water transfer from surplus basins to deficit basins in the north African country of Morocco. At the Global Climate Action Dialogue on Water, which rounded off the Water Day celebration, Parties and the non-Parties explored sustainable initiatives on water and socio-economic development, financing mechanism to increase ambitions related to adaptation and mitigation of water field, and improving knowledge, cooperation and capacity-building. Experts from the World Water Council, World Bank, European Investment Bank, AfDB and the Stockholm International Water Institute prescribed inclusion of water sector projects in every climate action plan, extensive development of the multilateral development banks' expertise in water, application of climate safeguards system as well mainstreaming climate resilience into water projects.

I wish to thank you, your Majesty the King for inviting the African Development Bank to this Summit and for hosting the COP22 here in beautiful city of Marrakech. Today, your Excellencies, there is a matter we need your voice to solve: how to support climate finance for Africa to adapt to climate change. These are tough times in Africa. The decline in commodity prices is taking a toll on several countries, constricting their fiscal space. Therefore, Africa has very limited scope to adjust to and cope with more exogenous shocks. That is why we must pay close attention to the recent effects of climate change that are further worsening the fiscal environment for African countries. Climate change is causing major displacements of public expenditures in Africa. Monies that should be used to boost investment in growth enhancing infrastructure and energy or education and job creation for the youths, are now being diverted to cope with effects of climate change. Sub-Saharan Africa will need $ 14-17 billion per year for adaptation for the period 2010 through 2050. African countries need help quickly to address climate change. Urgent measures are needed to reverse and avoid rising climate-induced public expenditure displacements in Africa. Africa alone cannot carry the burden of adapting to climate change. There must be global climate justice for Africa. Africa has developed an effective mechanism - the African Risk Capacity Insurance - to help countries cope with extreme weather events, through insurance for catastrophic events. But the insurance premiums are not cheap and this has continued to discourage African countries from insuring themselves against the rising catastrophic risks. What is needed now is support to assist African countries in meeting the insurance premium costs. Here is the solution: I call on the global climate finance facilities, the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environmental Facility to pay the insurance premiums for African countries, to the African Risk Capacity agency. This bold action will insure Africa. It will reduce climate-induced displacements of public expenditures in Africa. Words of comfort are not enough to pay Africa's rising bills for adapting to climate change. I urge you, our Presidents, to support this action for Africa.

The NDC Partnership is a coalition of developing and developed countries and international institutions working together to ensure countries receive the technical and financial support they need to achieve climate and sustainable development goals as fast and effectively as possible. The NDCs were the Nationally Determined Contributions of individual countries, the pledges on climate change that they made as they signed up to the Paris Agreement. The NDC Partnership was launched on 15 November during the United Nations COP22 climate conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, the follow-up meeting to the 2015 event which delivered the Paris accord. 'This is a key step in translating the Paris Agreement into action and results on the ground. Through its Green Economy Transition approach the EBRD will contribute its technical, policy and financing capacity to help its countries of operations develop and achieve their NDCs,' said Josue Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change. Much of the discussion in Marrakesh - dubbed the Implementation COP - has centred on ways of putting into practice the Paris vision of a sustained worldwide effort to tackle global warming. As its contribution to the Paris Agreement, the EBRD unveiled a Green Economy Transition approach which aims to increase the share of the EBRD's annual investments to 40 per cent by 2020. This will accelerate the pace of climate finance provided by the EBRD, which over the last 10 years has invested over EUR21 billion in some 1,160 green energy projects worth a total of more than EUR112 billion. The EBRD is a leading player in the renewable and energy efficiency field, working primarily with the private sector and helping to inject private finance and expertise into the global climate response. Through its Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities (SEFFs) the Bank delivers green energy projects via the banking systems of some 24 EBRD countries of operations. In addition, through its FINTECC (Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change) programme, the EBRD helps to promote the transfer of climate technology to developing countries and countries in transition, providing both finance and technical support.

""This conference comes within a climate of hope and of legitimate aspirations for all of humanity,"" said the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, Salaheddine Mezouar, who was elected today by acclamation as President of COP 22 , formally the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""The unprecedented mobilization of the international community and its political will, expressed at the highest levels, have been crowned by the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement. This is unrivaled progress [...] and now we must build on this momentum, give tangible meaning to this major step forward through decisions geared towards implementation,"" he stated. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on 15 November. Before the meeting wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. In his remarks today, Mr. Mezouar urged participants ""to be more ambitious,"" and stressed that ""the eyes of the world are on us"" [...] ""We have a huge responsibility before humanity and we must join forces in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations. We must provide them with the resources to adapt to the disastrous consequences of climate change."" Meanwhile, in her remarks, Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, told the opening of the Conference that the rapid entry into force of the Paris accord ""is a clear cause for celebration, but it is also a timely reminder of the high expectations that are now placed upon us all"" ""Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given"", she continued, underscoring that: ""Marrakech is our moment to take forward climate action at the international and national levels as a central pillar of the successful realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is our opportunity to take the next steps towards an inclusive, sustainable path for every man, woman and child."" Ms. Espinosa underlined key areas in which work needs to be taken forward. She stressed that finance is flowing, but it is not enough. Moreover, nationally determined contributions now need to be integrated into national policies and investment plans. She said support for adaptation needs to be given higher priority, and progress on the loss and damage mechanism has to be ensured to safeguard development gains in the most vulnerable communities. The President of COP 21, which agreed the Paris accord last year, Segolene Royal, French Minister of Environment, Energy and the Sea, who has passed the baton to Mr. Mezouar, welcomed the ratification of the Paris Agreement by 100 countries as of this past Sunday. ""It's an historic event,"" she said at a press conference just before the official opening of the COP 22 , where she urged all countries that have not ratified the Paris Agreement to do so, if possible, during the Marrakech Conference ""and beyond that, by the end of this year."" Ms. Royal said that the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in December 1997 and aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, took seven years to enter into force. ""[The clock is ticking] because the year that just ended was the warmest, because the melting of glaciers is accelerating, because desertification is devastating, because the massive urban concentrations call for a new model urban development,"" she continued. Ms. Royal stressed the importance of climate justice, particularly for Africa. ""Africa is the great challenge of [this Conference]. COP 22 is an African COP, and that is where the priority and hope are,"" she said. ""In Africa, climate change is cruel and unfair. The continent suffers the most through no fault of its own. Among the 50 countries which are the most [affected] by global warming, 36 are located in sub-Saharan Africa.""

According to an official announcement, the fund's management and supervisory committees have decided that a divestment or a reduced investment""""which would entail an exclusion list""""should go ahead this year. CO2-intensive plants from the field of fossil energy production are the first and only investments on this exclusion list since this business model is considered outdated and the corresponding investments are becoming less valuable, the official explained. The scheme has decided to adopt ""a positive constructive and holistic approach to the implementation of sustainability in its capital investment"" and this has been taken into account throughout the investment process reo (Responsibility Engagement Overlay), the official continued. This assessment is also based on the results of the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris at the end of 2015. There, binding climate conditions were agreed for all 195 member states of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It was decided that heating the world should be limited to less than 2C. As a first step, shares of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from coal mining or their generation capacity of more than 25% on coal, are now excluded from BAV's investment portfolio. These divestments comprise a portfolio of 40 companies or approximately 1% of BAV's total shareholdings, ""which is a rather small share of the total stock,"" the official disclosed. The fund's equity investments are indirectly made, investing in external managers' investments funds, the official stated. ""In doing so, the widest possible diversification within the funds is ensured from risk aspects. As a result, the number of CO2-intensive companies in the fossil energy sector is rather small because these sectors or business models have never been a focus or investment focus,"" he continued. Equity analysis will continue to take place regularly in order to be able to identify other investment opportunities, the official said. The fund uses incumbent BMO Global Asset Management in order to make the most appropriate decision regarding possible divestments, he added. \"

The death of Mouhcine Fikri, a 31-year-old fish wholesaler, in the back a of rubbish truck on Friday night in the port city of Hoceima sent tens of thousands of demonstrators out to the streets in some of the some of the country's most serious protests since the Arab spring in 2011 and prompted the intervention of King Mohammed VI. Related: Moroccan police question witnesses to death that sparked widespread protests The decision by prosecutors to act so swiftly, which means the 11 will be brought before a magistrate on allegations of involuntary homicide, came as demonstrations continued for a fourth day and signalled the wish of the Moroccan authorities to defuse the situation. Fikri's death was filmed on a phone and widely shared on social media. He had been stopped by police with 500kg of swordfish - caught illegally out of season - and had been trying to rescue his merchandise from the lorry when he was caught in the crusher. There have been accusations that a police officer had ordered the machinery to be turned on. The Moroccan government was quick to condemn the incident, promising a swift investigation to ""determine the exact circumstances of the tragedy and punish those responsible"". ""No one had the right to treat him like this... We cannot accept officials acting in haste, anger or in conditions that do not respect people's rights,"" the interior minister, Mohamed Hassad, said. A statement issued by investigators suggested there was no evidence that any order to commit violence against Fikri had been given by any of those involved in the incident. Protesters in Hoceima, in Morocco's Rif region, and in other cities including Casablanca, Fez and the capital, Rabat, had taken up the Fikri case as emblematic of official abuses - known as ""hogra"" - that led some people to blame royal institutions. The protests have erupted at a sensitive moment as the kingdom prepares to host Cop 22 , the 2016 United Nations climate change conference , in November and the prime minister begins to form a coalition government after elections this month. Smaller protests also took place on Monday evening in Rabat, the eastern city of Oujda and the central town of Settat. \"

A year on from the Paris Agreement, the global community gathered in Marrakech last week to push for bold measures as the world contends with the critical issue of climate change. Scientific evidence is clear: the earth's climate is changing. Mars is taking a proactive stance on climate change. As a business with agriculture at our very core, our ability to source our ingredients is at risk in the face of climate change. And, beyond that, we have an obligation to protect our planet. It is the right thing to do. At last week's United Nations Climate Conference in Marrakech - known as COP22 - Mars joined business and political leaders in calling action to implement the targets agreed last year in Paris. Our sustainability leaders joined many other subject matter experts in Marrakech, and these experts shared a mutual goal of combatting climate change. At the CDP Global Water Forum, Kevin Rabinovitch, Global Sustainability Director at Mars asked 'How Thirsty Are Your Low Carbon Ambitions?' - posing the question to businesses as to whether water commitments go far enough. Barry Parkin, Chief Sustainability Officer at Mars and Unilever's Chief Sustainability Officer, Jeff Seabright, had a one-to-one conversation, hosted by the U.S. Agency for International Development, to uncover how Chief Sustainability Officers can drive companies to create positive change. As a founding investor of Livelihoods Fund for Family Farming (L3F), Barry spoke at the Livelihoods Funds Agriculture Adaptation Africa Initiative event, reasserting the importance of the fund as an innovative way to help farmers and their communities thrive. And at a Climate Group Renewable Energy (RE)100 event Kevin shared the story of how we are moving to 100% renewable energy. Here, we shared plans for a new wind farm in Mexico, following on from similar previous wind projects in Texas and Scotland. And we announced our next short-term target of a 40% Green House Gases reduction from 2007 in our operations - building on our delivery of our 2015 target of a 25% reduction. These interim targets will help us deliver our long-term goal of phasing out fossil fuels from our operations by 2040. As a global business, we know we have a strong voice and we want to use it for the good of our people and our planet, Alongside more than 360 other businesses and investors, we signed a letter to the elected leaders of the United States, asking them not to abandon the Paris pledges and to invest in a low-carbon future for the sake of our economy. In an interview with the New York Times, Kevin made clear that politics could never sway our resolve to meet the ambitious science-based targets we set to reduce the emissions in our own operations: 'This doesn't change our commitments. We're doing this because we see a real business risk. We see a real business problem.' Speaking to CNBC, Barry added: 'It is vital that the business community demonstrates its ongoing commitment to tackling climate change. This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society. It is imperative that global businesses, like Mars, do their part to face down those threats.' The letter, which made headlines across the world, will have been seen by decision makers globally who we hope will join our efforts in tackling this global threat after reading it. It is only through decisive action and collaboration that this can happen. Mars will continue to take action as a business and to work with government, industry, Non-Governmental Organizations and individuals to make progress on the clear, measurable and enforceable targets for carbon emissions reductions that were agreed in Paris in 2015.

In the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development,"" State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), affirmed their ""commitment"" to the ""full implementation"" of the Paris Agreement. They welcomed the ""extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide."" As of Friday 18 November, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. ""This momentum is irreversible - it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels,"" adds the Proclamation. ""Our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."" Negotiations between State-Parties were continuing on Friday afternoon on aspects of the implementation of the Agreement. ""We continue to negotiate on a number of things"", said the President of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, at a press conference. Welcoming the outcome of the Conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, he noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In a statement issued by his spokesperson in New York, Mr. Ban applauded the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. ""As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" said the statement, adding that the UN chief also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $ 100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. The Marrakech Proclamation calls for ""the highest political commitment to combat climate change"" and calls for ""strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,"" underscoring the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability. State-Parties also call ""for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement"" and ""for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries."" In the Marrakech Proclamation, developed country reaffirmed their $ 100 billion mobilization goal per year by 2020 to support climate action by developing countries. All countries also called on all non-state actors to join them ""for immediate and ambitious action and mobilization, building on their important achievements."" Alongside the negotiations, the two-week Marrakech Conference focused on various actions and initiatives taken by Governments and non-state actors to address climate change.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK52","MARRAKECH: Cities are striving to play key role in implementing Paris climate accord","November 11, 2016 Friday","M2 PressWIRE","November 10, 2016 The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP 22 ), put its spotlight today on cities, towns and regions around the world that are striving to play a key role in implementing the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November, including by reducing their carbon emissions. ""Climate action in and by cities, towns and regions will be instrumental in ensuring that we stay on a 2 degrees Celsius pathway, aiming for 1.5 degree Celsius,"" said the Secretary General of ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, Gino Van Begin, at a press conference on the Conference's ""action day"" for cities and human settlements. ICLEI is the global network of over 1,500 cities, towns and regions committed to building a sustainable future. The Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved in December 2015 at the previous Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known by the shorthand COP 21, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As an example of cities being active on climate issues, Mr. Van Begin pointed out the establishment of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy from a merger between the European Covenant of Mayors and the Global Compact of Mayors. ""Cities can help reduce emissions,"" said the Chief Scientist at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Jacqueline McGlade, at the press conference. ""The leverage is enormous."" The Global Climate Action day on Cities and Human Settlements at COP 22 showcased the potential of local action, focusing on resilience and building efficiency. A new tool was launched to help cities assess their adaptation commitments. Urban areas are at the center of converging global frameworks, not only the Paris Agreement on climate change, but also the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September 2015, and the New Urban Agenda, adopted last month in Quito, Ecuador, at the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development - or Habitat III. Urban areas represent an estimated 70 per cent of energy-related global emissions. Many actions to adapt urban areas to climate change also have positive mitigation impacts, including renovation of old and construction of new low-energy and energy-efficient buildings. ""It is important to see development in cities in a totally different manner,"" said 'Climate Champion' Laurence Tubiana, at the press conference. ""We have to cut the building energy consumption by 50 percent by 2050. It's a big challenge."" ""Cities can help government implement their NDC (nationally determined contribution) much better and really aim much higher,"" she added. Ms. Tubiana, the French Ambassador on climate change, and Hakima El Haite, the Moroccan Minister in charge of Environment, were appointed Climate Champions by COP 21. Speaking to the UN News Centre, Jacqueline McGlade, said that ""every new building, if it was essentially designed around passive heating, could reduce the load on the power supply by 30 to 40 per cent. The problem with some of those is that they cost more in the first stages."" Developing efficient transportation networks in cities is also important, she said. ""We see that young people today view cities in a very different way than we did in the last 20 [or] 30 years. They see them as small villages, where their social networks actually imply that they can walk everywhere, they can meet and they can do their daily business without a need for actual heavy duty fossil-fueled cars and transport,"" she added. Ms. McGlade also underscored the importance of vernacular architecture to reduce energy consumption, including through ""passive forms of air conditioning."" ""There is a movement, particularly in developing countries, where the very best of materials, whether it is bamboo or mud or local materials, are actually used in place of cement and some of the more what I would call 'exotic materials' imported from elsewhere,"" she explained. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK54","Smallscale farmers need the spotlight now: Africa Food Prize winner Kanayo Nwanze speaks out at ","November 19, 2016 Saturday 6:30 AM GMT","The Guardian","At vast global gatherings like the COP22 UN climate conference, which has just concluded in Marrakech, the seductive grandeur of the occasion frequently strips attention from the people, in faraway places, who climate change threatens the most. But on Wednesday at the COP, during a panel discussion on how agriculture can support the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for zero hunger, Kanayo F. Nwanze brought these forgotten people into the spotlight with an impassioned plea. To achieve food security in a changing climate, we need to focus on the world's smallscale farmers-who are not only responsible for the bulk of food production in developing countries, but ironically face some of the worst threats to their own food security, Nwanze said. As the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), an organisation that invests in smallscale agriculture in rural environments around the world, Nwanze's work to highlight the importance of these farmers on the global agriculture scene won him the inaugural Africa Food Prize in 2016. Now, on the heels of the climate conference, what does COP22 mean to Nwanze-who has in the past boldly proclaimed that ' declarations don't feed people '? He ponders whether COP can deliver real change, and why smallscale farmers deserve our global attention. At COP22 you called for a greater focus on smallscale producers. Why should the global community be compelled to listen? Where do the poorest and hungriest live? In developing countries. Which areas are the most abundant agriculturally? Rural areas. What is their main activity? Smallscale agriculture. We are looking at about 500 million small farms [worldwide] catering for up to 3 billion people on our planet. So, if you want to achieve zero hunger you must focus: these people are our clients. They are also often neglected and forgotten. What does IFAD want to achieve on the ground? Our mission is to invest in rural people. The reality is that 80% of the food that is consumed in the developing world is produced by smallscale farmers, yet the paradox is that this is where you find hunger and poverty. When you fight a war do you wait for the enemy to come to your doorstep, or do you go to the enemy's camp? The enemy in this case-hunger, and poverty-runs deepest in rural areas. So how do we fix things there? With rural finance, in order to help them manage risks. You've raised the case for smallscalle agriculture as a business. Why is it so important to see it this way? In the last five years we have been saying that agriculture, irrespective of the scale or the size, is a business. Recently the Word Bank has even adopted the language that in the agricultural sector, the largest private sector group are small producers: they invest more into the agricultural landscape than governments and overseas development assistance. It's very interesting. What's the role of smallscale farmers in safeguarding land against the effects of climate change? Insofar as smallholder farmers are managers of agricultural landscapes, their choices have widespread impacts on the integrity of ecosystems. Since they're often located in marginal or degraded landscapes, involving them in adaptation solutions can make a crucial difference in restoring biological diversity, and in some cases bringing these areas under sustainable agricultural production. Many climate smart agricultural practices are taking root too, and these often build on traditional knowledge that's been enhanced by agricultural research and innovation. Do you expect COP22 will bring about benefits for smallscale agriculture? I believe a conference like the COP has a specific purpose. It generates global awareness. 110 countries have signed onto the Paris agreement so far, and the question everyone is asking now is about implementation. I think that's the next step, and it has value. But I'm not so sure these large conferences-where we end up with declarations, statements, best commitments-are really going to bring about change. Change begins from within; developing countries forget that fact. As far as I am aware, there is no developing country in existence that transformed itself from a developing to emerging country through development assistance. If you look at developed countries and emerging economies, they all went via the pathway of agriculture and rural transformation to get where they are. A nation that is unable to feed its people cannot expect to leapfrog to the 21st century. So what is the value of development aid in this equation? We need government assistance to help us achieve this. But you have to fit yourself into our plan. Otherwise, you just end up with countries pursuing a hundred different development projects, but in the end not much is achieved. If you want to move someone out of poverty, you want them to be able to sustain their own lives and livelihoods, not depend on aid. What successes have you seen on the ground so far? The best part of my job as president is travelling to see projects that we support. I met a woman in Ethiopia who sent all five children to university herself, through her own vegetable farming. There's another project in Kenya, where we trained 20,000 livestock producers. Today, 90% of the milk in the Kenyan market comes from two million smallscale livestock breeders. Nairobi's dairy industry has become a model. IFAD's parting shot? What we're saying at IFAD is that until we address the rural population, we cannot achieve zero hunger by 2030. This is why it's so important for the world. Emma Bryce reported this story from Marrakech on a fellowship from the International Reporting Project. \"

Leo, is being hosted by Royal Air Maroc, Moroccos national carrier. Leo will be on display in the main COP22 convention centre in Bab Ighli from 7-16 November before moving to Marrakech Manara Airport and Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport this week where the robot will assist delegates flying Royal Air Maroc to check-in their bags. SITAs baggage robot will remain in Morocco until November 27 where the national airline will conduct numerous airport trials using Leo. Abdelhamid Addou, Chairman & CEO of Royal Air Maroc, said: The smart use of new technologies is undoubtedly the key to improving the passenger experience while helping airlines better manage a growing number of travelers in a more sustainable way. This requires out-of-the-box thinking and Leo is exactly the sort of innovative exploration that will help airlines and airports manage the new challenges we as an industry will face in the next decade. Leo is a fully autonomous, self-propelling baggage robot that has the capacity to check in, print bag tags and transport up to two suitcases with a maximum weight of 32kg. It also has an obstacle avoidance capability and can navigate in a high-traffic environment such as an airport. Leo provides a glimpse into the future of baggage handling being explored by SITA Lab and is the first step to automating the baggage process from the moment passengers drop their bags to when they collect them. Using robotics and artificial intelligence, bags will be collected, checked in, transported and loaded onto the correct flight without ever having to enter the terminal building or be directly handled by anyone other than by the passengers themselves. Hani El-Assaad, SITA President, Middle East, India and Africa said: Through the innovative work of the SITA Lab we are able to tackle some of the key challenges that face airlines and airports today. Leo demonstrates that technologies such as robotics can help the air transport industry manage the growth in traffic in a more sustainable way while offering passengers an unencumbered journey through the airport and onto the aircraft. Leo comes to the assistance of passengers as they approach the terminal building. Touching Leos Scan&Fly bag drop interface opens the baggage compartment doors to allow passengers to place their bags inside. After the passengers have scanned their boarding passes, the tags are printed and can be attached to the bag. With the bags loaded and tagged, the compartment door closes and Leo displays the boarding gate and departure time. Leo then takes the bags directly to the baggage handling area where they are sorted and connected to the correct flight.

One day after visiting the Franz Josef Land archipelago in the Arctic, the Russian President claimed icebergs had been melting for decades and that global warming was not mankind's fault. The apparent reversal in Mr Putin's attitude to climate changecameshortly after White House spokesman Sean Spicer announced that Donald Trump would decide by May whether the US will remain in the Paris Agreement.

""That's when there were no such anthropological factors, such emissions, and the warming had already started. ""The issue is not stopping it... because that's impossiblesince it could be tied to some global cycles on Earth or even of planetary significance. The issue is to somehow adapt to it."" Mr Putin reportedly quoted an Austrian explorer, who had ""a photographic memory"" andvisited the archipelago in the 1930s. Twenty years later the explorer was shown photographs from another expedition there and concluded that ""there were fewer icebergs there"", Mr Putin reportedly said. While Finnish President Sauli Niinisto told the forum climate change was a ""serious threat"" tothe Arctic, Mr Putin said it could bring ""more favourableconditions for using this region for economic ends"". Read more China accuses Trump of 'selfishness' over climate change Earlier in the day, Mr Putin was shown a video of an ice-breaking tanker docking for the first time at Russia's Arctic port of Sabetta to test a new route forships carrying oil and liquefied gas, according to CBS News. Energy firms are eager for the route to open in order to extract resources such as oil and gas. Mr Putin's comments contrast with a speech he gave at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015, whenhe said ""climate change has become one of the most serious challenges facing humanity"". ""Global warming iscausing more and more hurricanes, floods, drought, other abnormal phenomena and is also causing tangible economic damage, destroying, established human habitat,"" he said at the time. ""The quality of life of all people on the planet depends on solving the climate problem. ""Russia's efforts have slowed global warming by almost a year. We were able to nearly double our country's GDP over the same period."" Previously, Mr Putinhassaid global warming was good for exposing natural resources and that warming by ""two or three degrees"" could mean Russians would no longer need fur coats. During his visit to the Arctic, the Russian President also wished good luck to the new chief of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scot Pruitt, whose appointment was highly controversial given his track record of denying climate science. Last year, a report from theEnvironment Ministry found that Russia is warming twice as fast as the average for the rest of the world and warned aboutthe rise of floods and wildfires across the country. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK58","Morocco lights the way for Africa on renewable energy; COP22 host leads by example in the fight against climate change with 52% green energy target by 2020 and ....","November 17, 2016 Thursday 12:34 PM GMT","The Guardian","As the host of this year's COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco has been keen to demonstrate its green credentials and make this COP the ""African COP"". In the past year, Morocco has banned the use of plastic bags, launched new plans for extending the urban tram networks in Casablanca and Rabat, started the process of replacing its dirty old fleet of buses and taxis, launched Africa's first city bicycle hire scheme, and launched a new initiative - the "" Adaptation of African Agriculture "" - to help the continent's farmers adjust to climate change. Related: COP22 But by far the most attention has been on the development of ""mega"" infrastructure projects in an ambitious plan to transform the country's energy mix. Morocco has no fossil fuel reserves so is almost entirely reliant on imports. In 2015 King Mohammed VI committed the country to increasing its share of renewable electricity generation to 52% by 2030, aiming for the installation of around 10 gigawatts (GW). Of that, 14% is expected to come from solar, with plans to install 2GW of new capacity by 2020, as well as increases in wind power and hydraulic dams. Morocco has even opened the door to exchanging electricity produced from renewable sources with Europe. Morocco's INDC ( Intended Nationally Determined Contribution ) plan submitted to the UNFCCC is equally ambitious and commits the country to cutting greenhouse gas emissions - particularly in agriculture - by 32% by 2030, compared to business as usual. Morocco has also committed to planting 200,000 hectares of forest (pdf) and greatly increasing in irrigation. The commitment is dependent on accessing climate financing, but translates to a cumulative reduction of 401 megatonnes of C02 over the period 2020-30. In 2015 Morocco completely removed subsidies on petroleum products. The first phase of the giant Noor solar complex near Morocco's southern desert town of Ouarzazate is the 160MW Noor One plant, which was opened by the king in February. Instead of PV (photovoltaic) solar panels, Noor uses CSP (concentrated solar power) technology - giant mirrors to reflect the sun's rays on to tubes containing liquid which is super-heated to drive turbines. CSP offers storage of electricity for up to three hours after the sun has set, which covers peak demand times. Close to the site of Noor One, Noor two, currently under construction, will use the same CSP technology, but on a bigger scale with the hope of storing electricity for seven hours. Noor Three however will use a new variant on CSP technology - the solar tower, where the mirrors are directed at a central point. Between them they will add another 350MW to the national grid, and are expected to be completed by 2017/18. Noor Four will be constructed near the High Atlas town of Midelt and Morocco's renewables agency, Masen, announced this week at COP22 that it would open the bidding for two 400MW combined PV and CSP plants in early 2017. Morocco is also investing in wind. A consortium of Enel Green Power, Nareva (owned by King Mohammed VI's investment company) and Siemens won a bid in March to build five new wind farms at different sites across Morocco - Midelt, Tangier, Jbel Lahdid, and Tiskrid and Boujdour in the disputed Western Sahara territory. Their combined capacity will be 850MW, a huge increase taking Morocco closer to its aim of producing 14% of electricity from wind by 2020. The unit cost in the tender documents was one of the lowest in the world, at just $0.03 per kWh. But while developing renewable power sounds good on paper, cost will be a big factor. The launch of the Noor CSP project has helped the price of electricity produced by CSP to come down to around $0.16 per kWh, but that looks expensive compared to solar PV which has fallen as low as $0.03 per kWh. It remains to be seen whether the costs of CSP will fall low enough to be globally commercially competitive, and deliver cost-effective renewable power for Moroccan consumers. CSP also uses large amounts of water to keep the mirrors clean - a real problem in water-stressed Morocco. At the same time, Morocco has not totally kicked the fossil fuel habit - coal still makes up the biggest part of energy production today (35%) and is set to be expanded over the next five years. The new energy mix will include at least 3,900MW of energy from natural gas, and the search for hydrocarbon deposits on Moroccan soil continues. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK59","-Imperial College London - Imperial experts join global effort to measure climate change's effect on health","November 18, 2016 Friday","ENP Newswire","A new initiative has launched today to understand what it calls the 'catastrophic risk to human health' caused by climate change. Academics from 16 organisations including Imperial College London will establish a range of measures that allow them to track how climate change is affecting human health, and how the responses can have mutual benefits for health and the climate. The initiative The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change proposes over 30 indicators, for example tracking the spread of infectious diseases, deaths or illness resulting from heatwaves or droughts, and health problems caused by air pollution. The initiative will also identify policies that provide win-win solutions for health and climate. The initiative was announced on Monday at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP22 ) taking place in Marrakech, Morocco. Researchers Dr Kris Murray at the Grantham Institute and Professor Paolo Vineis at Imperial's School of Public Health are contributing to the development of the Lancet Countdown. Dr Murray is working on developing indicators to track climate change impacts on health from infectious diseases, such as the changing distributions of mosquitos that carry dangerous infectious diseases like dengue. Professor Vineis is working to determine the effect of policies that aim to cut emissions and improve health, such as promoting healthy, sustainable diets, such as reducing high meat consumption in the developed world. With the aim of ensuring the case for action on health and climate change is more widely evidenced and understood, the Lancet Countdown is designed to inform decision-making and drive an accelerated policy response to climate change. It will complement other initiatives, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its achievements for climate science. LINKING CLIMATE AND HEALTH Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, an eminent expert in meteorology and climate change and chair of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College London, said: 'We know climate change will lead to a rise in average global temperatures over the twenty-first century. However, it is important to note that an average rise of two degrees Celsius will mean melting ice and permafrost in polar regions but also the hottest regions of the Earth warming to a climate not seen on Earth while humans have inhabited the planet. 'Populous coastal regions can expect to see more flooding with sea levels rising by perhaps half a meter, with all the problems that entails for health and sanitation. The weather will change for entire regions, leading to problems for people, agriculture and livelihoods that may be caused by, for example, heavier rain storms and increased water shortages.' Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, welcomed the Lancet Countdown launch: 'The health impacts of climate change are already being felt and affecting some of the most vulnerable on our planet. No one is immune or out of reach. 'Climate action, spearheaded by governments and supported by business, cities, investors and citizens - including health care professionals - goes hand-in-hand with delivering a better quality of life in its own right and as a key pillar of the Sustainable Development Goals.' The Lancet Countdown will be the subject of a lecture tonight at UCL by former UN chief climate diplomat Ms Christiana Figueres THE NEED FOR DECISIVE ACTION The Lancet Countdown builds on the findings of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, which concluded that targeted action on reducing the magnitude and impacts of climate change is the greatest opportunity to improve global health in the twenty-first century. Dr Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet said: 'One challenge of the ongoing global climate crisis is to convey the urgency of our collective predicament and the need for decisive action. The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change is being launched today to amass the evidence needed to hold policy makers accountable for their promises and commitments. The research community can make an important contribution to heightening political awareness and accelerating progress to a healthier, low-carbon world. These are the goals of our Countdown on Health and Climate Change.' Imperial College London and the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, one of Imperial's Global Challenge Institutes, is working alongside The Lancet Countdown partners including UCL, Tsinghua University, China, and the Washington-based policy institute, Centre for Climate & Security. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and World Health Organization (WHO) will aid the collaboration in making best use out of national data sources, and ensure strong engagement with ministries of health.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK60","-AfDB-COP22: 'Global finance mechanisms must pay for Africa's rising climate bill,' Adesina tells Marrakech Conference","November 21, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","Global finance mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environmental Facility must support Africa to adapt to climate change and stop the displacement of public spending caused by climate change, African Development Bank Group President, Akinwumi Adesina, told the United Nations climate conference, which ended on November 18. 'Words of comfort are not enough to pay Africa's rising bills for adapting to climate change,' said Adesina, who was addressing the African Heads of State and dignitaries attending the Africa Action Summit hosted by the King of Morocco on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakech. The Africa Action Summit brought together 50 Heads of State and Government, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as well as representatives of international organizations. Addressing the Summit, Adesina specifically called on global finance mechanisms to pay for the premiums of African countries to the African Risk Capacity, the mechanism developed by African countries to help them cope with extreme weather events, through insurance for catastrophic events. He observed that 'the insurance premiums are not cheap and this has continued to discourage African countries from insuring themselves against the rising catastrophic risks.' A balanced energy mix for industrialization Adesina stressed the urgency of the situation to African Leaders. The decline in commodity prices is already taking a toll on several countries, constricting their fiscal space. Economic growth is projected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2016 from 3.6 percent in 2015. 'Africa has a very limited scope to adjust to and cope with more exogenous shocks,' he said. The recent effects of climate change are further worsening the fiscal environment for African countries. Unless urgent action is taken, governments run the risk of diverting more of the resources needed to boost growth to deal with climate risks. Africa receives only 4% of all global finance funds. Only about 14% of global climate finance goes into adaptation. Looking ahead, Adesina said that Africa must 'power up' itself to £dd value to what it produces, speed up industrialization and move to the top of global value chains.' He observed that this must start with unlocking the huge amounts of energy potential on the continent. 'Potential is important, yes, but potential alone cannot light up homes or power industries,' he told the Opening Panel of Africa Day. 'We must ensure that Africa develops a balanced energy mix that will allow it to industrialize. Grid, mini-grid and off-grid systems will play a major role,' Adesina reiterated. The event was attended by several African leaders, including Alpha Conde, President of Guinea and African Union Coordinator for Renewable Energy; Faure Gnassingbe, President of Togo; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia; and Seretse Khama Ian Khama, President of Botswana. The African Development Bank has committed itself to invest US $ 12 billion in support of accelerating electricity supply in Africa to fast-track universal access to electricity in the next 10 years. The Bank's investment is expected to leverage between US $ 45-50 billion from the private sector. Fulfilling Paris pledges Meanwhile, the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, set up by the African Union, is moving forward. The Independent Delivery Unit - hosted within the Bank - is fully operational. French President Francois Hollande welcomed the work of the Bank and announced that France will provide EUR2 billion over the next five years. France has already paid EUR6 million to support the Independent Delivery Unit. Germany has also committed to providing EUR2 million. The European Union has also pledged its support for the initiative. To maintain the momentum, Adesina also called for fulfillment of the full pledge of the G7 to provide US $ 10 billion to the initiative. 'The sooner this is made available, the faster we will all make progress in achieving the goal of universal access to electricity and acceleration of the growth of renewables in Africa's energy mix,' he said. The Marrakech Conference ended with a call for £ shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development.' The Marrakech Proclamation adopted on November 17, 2016 stresses the need for the highest political commitment in the fight against climate change. 'We call for strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and underscore the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability,' the document reads.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK61","GSIA: Sustainable Investments Hit Record Highs","April 2017","Global Money Management","Driven by client demand and international efforts to save the environment, global assets in socially responsible investment (SRI) strategies have grown by 25% over the past two years, according to new research from Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA). Investments in SRI strategies are hitting record highs around the world as client demand continues to strengthen and green finance receives growing interest following an international pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thre research has found. At the start of 2016, global SRI assets reached USD22.9 trillion, a 25% increase from 2014. Europe continues to represent the largest market, accounting for 53% of total assets, while the US trails just behind at 38%. Of the six major regions studied in GSIA's biennial Global Sustainable Investment Review, Japan was the fastest-growing market. ""In all but one region we studied, the market share of sustainable investing has grown in both absolute terms and in relation to the overall pool,"" said Meg Voorhes, research director at the US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (US SIF). All SRI strategies experienced growth between 2014 and 2016, with impact/community investing and sustainability-themed investing growing the fastest at 146% and 140%, respectively, even though they hold the least assets in absolute-dollar terms. At USD15 trillion, negative/exclusionary screening remains the dominant strategy, followed by ESG integration, and corporate and shareholder action, the GSIA report noted. Investor Demand Another notable finding is the rising shift in the source of demand for SRI investments. Institutional investors, in particular pension funds, have been the traditional heavyweights in this space. Although they still hold a majority of the assets, retail investors are showing rising interest in allocating more funds to SRI. As of 2016, the relative proportion of retail SRI investments in Canada, Europe and the US doubled to 26% from 13% at the start of 2014. Indeed, client demand represents one of the key growth drivers for sustainable investing across all markets. Specifically, investors are seeking greater disclosure from companies and consideration of environmental an social governance (ESG) issues such as climate change. SRI investments make up approximately half of total managed assets in both Europe and Australia/New Zealand. In Canada, the ratio is close to 40%. Voorhes believes managers are still on a learning curve to figure out which factors are material. Research is done in house by investment firms to test out their models and the industry should see increasing levels of engagement, she explained. Of the USD4.7 trillion in ESG assets, more than half (USD2.8 trillion) are strategies that restrict investments in companies operating in conflict-ridden regions, such as Sudan and Iraq. Immediately following are investments that help curb climate change and carbon emissions, which attracted USD2.2 trillion as of 2016, the research showed. ""Institutional asset owners are making it increasingly clear that they are interested in this approach,"" said Voorhes, ""and they expect their managers to all have some expertise in ESG investments."" Green Bonds In particular, green finance in the form 'climate-aligned bonds' is receiving mounting attention following the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), where 195 countries pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and taper environmental damage. As of mid-2016, climate-aligned bonds held USD694 billion in assets, according to the non-profit Climate Bonds Initiative, which tracks such data across countries and maintains a public list of so-called green bonds. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK62","Climate change not just hot heir; PRINCE'S NEW ECO BOOK Says ALEX SALMOND","January 25, 2017 Wednesday","The Sun (England)","PRINCE Charles has penned a new Ladybird book on climate change which is due to hit the shelves tomorrow. Here former First Minister Alex Salmond gives his verdict - and backs the Royal's work to flag up a subject close to his heart. h l it PRINCE Charles is not afraid to make his voice known on subjects he has a passion for. He's also authored or co-authored some three dozen books over the years. These range from a guide to the gardens of his Highgrove residence in Gloucestershire to the charming children's story, The Old Man of Lochnagar. But his latest foray into publishing is no bedtime story. His Ladybird Expert volume on climate change might be the smallest by size. Yet it is on what Charles would think the biggest subject of all. There looms a very real risk to our entire planet from man-made climate change. This project was conceived in the optimistic aftermath of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of December 2015. The Paris summit - opened by the Prince - was an unexpected and comprehensive success. Charles turned to his former co-author Tony Juniper, and to Emily Shuckburgh of the Antarctic Survey, to help him write this new book. And together they have done a first-rate job. Its tiny compact form and 50 pages would be lost even on the smallest coffee table. But it is unlikely to feature on Jackanory - as the Old Man of Lochnagar once did. For all that, it achieves a great purpose. It is designed to get the key facts on complex subjects like climate change in an accessible form to a predominantly adult audience. Other titles in this Ladybird series, for example, include Quantum Mechanics and Evolution. And it is incredibly timely. Paris was a success but since then the world has turned darker as well as warmer. In Donald Trump, a climate change denier has entered the White House. Now the world's greatest carbon polluter is in unsafe hands, President Trump is both powerful enough and dumb enough to reduce the US renewable programme quicker than the Antarctic ice sheets. And I fear he is more likely to publish his tax returns than to obey the Paris agreements. The world is getting warmer, there is more carbon in the atmosphere than at any time in our recorded history. This is man-made change that it is impacting already on the climate of the planet. So, unless we step up our affirmative action now, we will leave future generations with a chaotic legacy. That movement will take heart from the strength of the facts in this book. It has been painstakingly proofed by eminent academics under the patronage of the Royal Meteorological Society. Indeed their poison pens have already been dripping venom and poised to strike. And he is right. The agreement in Paris put it beyond party rivalry among sensible folk - at least on this side of the pond. And why should the heir to the throne restrict his publications to gardens and good works? Charles clearly cares deeply about the subject. The Prince has a voice and on this subject he should be listened to. 'A very real risk to entire planet' \"

It will benefit the UK while we implement our industrial strategy to deliver the economy that works for all.""Nick Hurd MP, Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry, who has been negotiating for the UK and promoting British business at the 22nd UN climate change Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh said:""The UK is ratifying the historic Paris Agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all."" COP22 in Marrakesh is an important milestone which marks the shift from aspiration to implementation. We are going to use this positive momentum to grow the UK low-carbon sector, which is already worth over \'c2\£346 billion, as we continue to provide secure, affordable and clean energy to our families and businesses.""The Paris Agreement provides a framework for governments as well as business and investors to keep global warming well below 2\'c2\'b0C, pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'c2\'b0C.Paris negotiations have set us on an irreversible route towards low-carbon growth. The Marrakesh talks, which conclude today, focused on bringing the Paris Agreement into reality. They provided the opportunity for countries to develop detailed plans of action as the world aims to achieve carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.During COP22 in Marrakesh, the government has supported several key initiatives that will enable the Agreement to be implemented more effectively. These include improving national carbon reduction strategies, advancing innovation to drive forward clean energy on a global scale, increasing transparency of actions and scaling up ambitious climate finance from a range of public and private sources to avoid the most devastating effects of global warming.The UK played a significant role in driving forward COP22 negotiations and our announcement of ratification of the Paris Agreement was welcomed. The key focus of the final stage of negotiation at COP22 has been on turning the Paris Agreement into action and delivery. COP22 made progress on the Paris rulebook and agreed to accelerate further work, setting a clear deadline of 2018 for its finalisation. \"

Barack Obama can claim a great deal of credit for bringing the world together in support of the Paris Agreement to limit climate change at last year's summit, and ""Team America"" has led from the front in climate action for 20 years. But the US President-elect has threatened to cancelthe Paris accord, scrap all American contributions to UN climate programmes and denounced the very concept of man-made climate change as a Chinese hoax. One theme emerging from the COP22 summit is the idea that shifting to a greener planet is not a matter of sinking money into an endless budget for ""aid"", but a business opportunity. Read more Trump must not make 'irrevocable choices' on climate change says Kerry And if Mr Trump can't be convinced of that, there is no shortage of other world powers willing to step into America's shoes. The gloom in the wake of the Trump victory has focused on the US's role as the world's second-greatest polluter, responsible for 13 per cent of global emissions. But Chinese representatives here point out the ""gigantic size"" of its own emissions -Chinese real estate alone accounts for 8per cent of global emissions, similar to the total emissions of the EU. One part of China's plan involves phasing out steel and cement emissions by 2050 - ascheme which, on its own, would cut as much pollution as the entire emissions of the UK (twice over). Riffing on Mr Trump's own claims to deal with what he sees as the problem of Mexico, a representative of one Chinese NGO joked that China would be willing to cut the equivalent of all US emissions -""particularly if President-elect Trump gets his way"" -adding that ""we would get the US to pay for it"". Read more Donald Trump means 'game over for the planet', claims Labour World economy to be $12 trillion smaller without climate change action China dismisses Donald Trump climate change 'hoax' claim Donald Trump will cause 'global trauma' if he imposes tariffs on China Hit US with carbon tax if it pulls out of climate pact, Sarkozy says Donald Trump is seeking quick ways out of the Paris climate agreement China sees the scope for international infrastructure projects and efficiency savings that climate action entails -and when it comes to reaping the benefits, the joke is on the US. Europe is also eyeing up the opportunities here, and the chance to look for a partner to the east instead of the west, particularly on a subnational level. At a side event organised by the China-Europe Forum, delegates discussed how the landscape of global climate action is shifting,and where the impetus for making a changenow falls. Michel Lebrun, the former president of the European Committee of the Regions and the man representing the EU at the China-Europe event, said it was up to local actors to step into the breach as Trump's election highlighted the hazards of relying on heads of state for answers. ""Local governments, business and civil society play a key role in the adaptation and mitigation process [of fighting climate change],"" he said. The suggestion is that the major cities and regions of Europe -as the cradle of Western civilisation -can lead the way to a kind of climate enlightenment. ""During this COP22 Others feel that it will fall to the world's biggest businesses to pave the way on climate action, driven by both the dispassionate economic arguments behind green innovation and strong leadership that does not rely on public opinion for its authority. Dr Nathaniel Keohane, vice president of the Environmental Defence Fund (EDF), named Walmart as an example of a huge company making voluntary, positive steps in this field thanks largely to the ""personal interest"" of its CEO, Carl Douglas McMillon. But not everyone believes there is a simple solution to the question of who will take over from the US if Mr Trump takes his country out of the global movement to stop climate change. In his keynote speech at the summit on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the ""overwhelming majority""of Americans know that climate change is happening, and that if the worldfails to act it would be a ""moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequences"". Avipsa Mahapatra, from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) campaign group, says that is ""one of the messages we can take away [from the Trump victory]... that it is not about any single country."" ""Given there is very little time left if we want to stand a chance of staying below 2C [of warming] -and there is really no point in talking about 1.5C at this point -it has to be about all stakeholders, all citizens, all countries giving it all their efforts,plus some more."" \"

To achieve this goal, the countries voluntarily published their commitments to combating climate change (NDCs, in UN jargon); according to the International Energy Agency, the aggregate of the NDCs will bring us close to a 2.7&ordm;C increase in temperature. At the Marrakech climate summit ( COP22 ), to be held from 7 to 18 November, governments, NGOs, companies and civil society will debate issues relating to energy, water, the oceans, forests, cities, transport, gender, agriculture and food security. COP22 faces the challenge of specifying many of the issues raised in the Paris Agreement with regard to such matters as finance, transparency and market mechanisms such as carbon pricing. ACCIONA played an active role in COP21, and it announced a commitment to be carbon neutral in 2016. That commitment came after ACCIONA concluded a 5-year Sustainability Master Plan, in which it achieved such goals as a 46% reduction in CO2 emissions and avoided 85.7 million tons of CO2 (since 2009) due broadly to renewable energy generation. The Company exceeded its objectives and enters a new phase with the strategic priority of mitigating climate change under a new Plan running to 2020. ACCIONA was present at the Paris Agreement signing ceremony at the United Nations headquarters in April 2016 and it will also participate in COP22 . \"

Marrakesh, Morocco is hosting the COP22 from November 7 to 18, where international climate leaders will come together to focus on the urgent actions needed to ensure the Paris Agreement is implemented. 'We need a global financial system that's fit for purpose to factor in climate risks and opportunities,' said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. 'Developing a green bond market is key to mobilizing the private capital flows needed to address climate change. We were delighted to collaborate with the Central Bank of Morocco on this important initiative.' 'Having become increasingly aware of the effects of climate change, at the COP 22 in Marrakesh, countries are now specifying how to achieve commitments made in Paris. Bank Al-Maghrib's investment in World Bank Green Bonds has been made in that context. The investment will support sustainable development projects financed by the World Bank, including in countries in Africa,' said Mr. Abdellatif Jouahri, Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib. The 3-year US$ 100 million bonds mature on December 15, 2019, and have a semi-annual fixed rate coupon payment. The sole lead manager is Credit Agricole CIB. 'This investment sends a powerful message to the global investor and climate policy community about Morocco's commitment to climate finance,' said World Bank Vice President and Treasurer, Arunma Oteh. 'Morocco is one of the countries that has benefitted from the World Bank's green bond program to support its transition to a low carbon economy and is now making an investment in the global transition to a greener planet. The World Bank Treasury is grateful to have partnered with Bank Al-Maghrib at the time of the COP22 in Marrakech, for this transaction.' Since the World Bank's first green bond launched in 2008, the World Bank has issued 128 green bonds in 18 currencies, totaling approximately USD 9.7 billion equivalent. World Bank green bonds offer investors an opportunity to support environmental solutions through a bond product that benefits from the triple-A credit strength of the World Bank. World Bank green bonds support the financing of projects in member countries that meet specific criteria for low carbon and climate resilient growth, seeking to mitigate climate change or help affected people adapt to it. The types of eligible projects include renewable energy installations, energy efficiency projects, and new technologies in waste management and agriculture that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help finance the transition to a low carbon economy. They also include financing for forest and watershed management and infrastructure to prevent climate-related flood damage and build climate resilience.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK71","COP22 host Morocco launches action plan to fight devastating climate change; As UN climate talks start in Marrakech, Morocco calls on world leaders to put the f....","November 7, 2016 Monday 12:26 PM GMT","The Guardian","""Last December we had temperatures of 25C. Normally it is 1 or 2C at that time of year,"" says Mohammed Ibrahimi, a farmer with one hectare of apple trees in Boumia, a village near Midelt in Morocco. ""These trees need at least 1,200 hours of near-freezing temperatures in the winter to help them to regenerate. This year they flowered very late; the harvest was a month late and I harvested just 20 tonnes when I'd expected 40 tonnes."" Related: Southern Africa appeals for billions to cope with El Ni\'f1o devastation The town of Midelt sits 1,600m above sea level on a vast barren plain sandwiched between the Middle Atlas mountain range to the north and the High Atlas to the south. One of the highest mountains in north Africa, Jbel Ayachi, looms snow-clad over the town. Due to its altitude, Midelt is well-suited to apples, and plantations are scattered all over the plains. But farmers are already abandoning their orchards. ""When we were kids the mountains had snow on them until at least June, sometimes even all year. We had ample underground water sources. We used to have to dig about 4m down to find water - now it can be [many times deeper]. How can we irrigate our crops with that?"" says Ibrahimi. Like most African countries, Morocco - where 40% of the population still works the land - is already feeling the impacts of climate change on its agricultural production. Last year, during the exceptional season Ibrahimi describes - caused in large part by the regular El Ni\'f1o weather pattern - Morocco went without rain for more than two months. Overall it received 42.7% less rain during its main planting season than in an average year. The impact on the harvest was catastrophic, particularly on the ""zone bour"" (dry zone) areas where crops such as wheat, barley and maize are planted. Ministry of Agriculture estimates predicted total output falling 70% on the 2015 season. ""Starting from the early 1990s, we've seen on average 15% to 20% less rain annually than previously,"" says Mohamed Ait Kadi, president of Morocco's General Council of Agricultural Development. ""The rain now comes in showers instead of sustained downpours, and we see arid areas spreading."" As the host country for the COP22 climate change talks, which open in Marrakech on Monday, Morocco is determined to make this meeting the ""African COP"". Explaining its own experience and acting as an advocate for other African countries, Morocco wants to put the impacts of erratic weather patterns on agriculture at the heart of the discussions. No-one is underestimating the challenges. Water stress, land degradation, rising temperatures and deforestation are all playing a role. Areas such as the Sahel - including Chad, Niger and Mali - have experienced recurring droughts every few years since the 1980s, devastating harvests, economies and traditional farming ecosystems. In 2010 at least 7 million people across the Sahel were threatened with severe hunger and needed emergency food aid from humanitarian organisations. According to the journal Nature, the viability of all crops in the Sahel belt will become questionable, with maize being the worst affected. By 2090 some 60% of land available for bean production will become unsuitable. Southern and eastern Africa have all suffered catastrophic droughts over the last few years. Morocco is using the COP22 conference to formally launch its "" Adaptation of African Agriculture "" (AAA) initiative. As food security becomes increasingly challenged by erratic weather patterns, the initiative proposes measures such as improved soil management, water and irrigation management and better weather forecasting and insurance programmes for farmers affected by drought. Although the initiative has received some criticism as some of its focus appears to replicate the work already being done by other pan-African agriculture programmes, Morocco believes its main contribution can be to persuade world leaders to sign up to a concrete plan of how to divide up the $100bn (\£381bn) promised to support adaptation and mitigation projects in developing countries. Related: Drought and rising temperatures 'leaves 36m people across Africa facing hunger' ""We have to translate the big ideas written in western offices about responses to climate change into something that actually changes the lives of small farmers,"" said Morocco's minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akannouch, at a recent conference launching the AAA. ""It's about pragmatic responses - things like irrigation projects, developing oases, improving access to fertilisers and credit."" For Bruce Campbell, director of the global programme on climate change, agriculture and food security, better management of water sources will be crucial. Just 3.3% of arable land (approx 6 million hectares) in sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated, compared to 37% in Asia. In Morocco too, despite huge gains in increasing commercial agricultural outputs through mechanisation and improved use of fertilisers, an estimated 85% of agricultural land is still dependent on the skies. ""One of the things which could really make a difference for small-scale farmers is better weather forecasting information in local languages,"" says Campbell. ""All farmers should have known that an El Ni\'f1o event was expected in 2015-16, and they could have saved their seeds and inputs for a better year."" Back in Boumia, as we warm up with a mint tea and msmen - a traditional Moroccan flatbread served with honey - after a bracing walk in the fields, the apple farmers chew over what all this can mean for them. ""I don't think we'll ever return to how it was before,"" says Ibrahimi, ""but it's not too late. The most important thing is to stop any further damage immediately. And then we need developed countries to take responsibility for the damage they have done."" \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK72","What's in store at the Marrakech climate talks - and will Australia still back coal?; The US presidential race is guaranteed to prove a distraction at the Moroc....","November 5, 2016 Saturday 1:06 AM GMT","The Guardian","The Australian government takes a delegation to the United Nations climate change talks in Morocco starting Monday - two weeks that are sure to be dominated by, well, who knows? Because, during the first week, the United States will go to the polls to pick a new president - an event that will act like a giant weapon of mass distraction in Marrakech. The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has pledged to pull the US out of the UN process on climate change and cancel the global deal agreed at the last talks in Paris. Related: Australia being 'left behind' by global momentum on climate change Like other high-profile Republicans, Trump is not even convinced that humans cause climate change in the first place. Let's just say he's wrong. But whether a Trump administration could follow through with the threat to ""cancel"" the agreement is questionable. Todd Stern, who was the lead negotiator for the US delegation in Paris, has written that Trump has no power to cancel the deal because more than 190 other countries signed it. A withdrawal from Paris, Stern has written, would attract ""almost universal condemnation"" from other nations. China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US, launched a sort of pre-emptive strike this week with public comments criticising Trump's climate stance. But aside from the distraction of US politics, what else for Marrakech - a meeting known as COP22 (so called, if you must ask, because this is the 22nd meeting of the conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change)? And what about Australia's position? Since the Paris agreement was gavelled last December, the process to ratify the deal has been ongoing. This process, known as ""entry into force"", required at least 55 ""parties"" representing about 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to ratify the agreement. This threshold was met on 5 October and the deal will enter into force right about ... now! This rapid entry into force (the Kyoto protocol took almost eight years) is another reason why, from the outside at least, the focus of the Marrakech talks feels unusually fluid. But the first meeting under the new Paris agreement (known as CMA1 - yeah, I know) will be looking to tie down some of the rules about transparency - that is, how and what each party needs to disclose to the convention. Related: Paris climate change agreement enters into force Australia has still not ratified the Paris agreement but there are reports this could happen before the talks close on 18 November. Before the Paris talks, countries around the world submitted their plans to cut emissions - these were known as intended nationally determined contributions (you gotta love the UN's gift for language). They're now just NDCs (because they were all accepted as part of the Paris agreement). Australia pledged that by 2030, it would cut emissions between 26% and 28% below where they were in 2005. While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stands by the target as being ambitious and fair, there are many critics who say it's anything but. On this, one diary point in Morocco will be the middle Saturday, when developed countries get to publicly question each other about their plans and ambitions. Close watchers of the UN climate processes are characterising the Marrakech talks as the ""action and implementation COP"" because it's seen as the chance to start acting on the promises made in Paris. Related: Hazelwood's closure was inevitable. So where was the transition plan? | Gay Alcorn A big push from campaign groups will be to pressure the talks to get on with a fair and just transition away from a world mostly powered by fossil fuels (the decision by the French company Engie to close Australia's dirtiest coal power station, Hazelwood, is such an example of this transition in action, and the need to plan for it ). Perhaps the most important element of the talks, though, will be about a part of the Paris deal known as the ambition - or ratchet - mechanism. When scientists have analysed all the targets that countries have put on the table, they have found they are not even close to achieving the agreed aim of keeping global warming ""well below 2C"".\~Without further ambition, we could see warming of 3C or more. The ratchet mechanism is designed to push countries to become more ambitious over time, setting in place stocktakes, reviews and deadlines for new targets. How this will all work in practice will be a key part of COP22 . Australia remains an influential country in the talks, owing in part to its position as chair of the umbrella group of countries - one of many negotiating groups. As yet there has been no formal announcement from the Australian government on who will attend, but there is an expectation among some that the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, will be there for the ""high-level segment"" that starts in week two. The Australian delegation will also have a new diplomat in charge. Replacing Peter Woolcott as climate change ambassador is Peter Suckling, who took over the role in February after serving as Australia's high commissioner in India. During his time in New Delhi Suckling made several statements supporting the controversial Carmichael mega-coalmine project in Queensland, being proposed by Indian company Adani. ""This project will drive economic growth and create more than 6,000 jobs in Australia,""\~he\~ said in 2014. ""It will also boost India's development by providing electricity to 100 million Indians.""\~ Related: We should be putting the brake on the Carmichael coalmine, not hitting the accelerator | Graham Readfearn In one report in the Economic Times, Suckling was quoted as saying the Australian government was trying to tighten legal rules around who could and could not challenge coalmines through the courts (a theme that has re-emerged in recent weeks ). ""We are actively thinking of possible ways to limit the scope of litigation to only those with a real standing in a project,"" he was quoted as saying. Language like this tends not to go down well with the army of NGOs, campaigners and civil society groups who attend the climate talks and have given Australia more then a fair share of ""fossil"" awards over the years. The perception among many has been that Australia has sought to defend the coal industry too many times at UN meetings. Will Australia stake its reputation on coal again? \"

The gathering, which opened in Edinburgh today, voted in favour of extending a law passed last May that permits ministers to be in same-sex civil partnerships. The outcome follows years of deliberation on the issue within the Church. The decision means the Kirk adopts a position which maintains a traditional view of marriage between a man and woman, but allows individual congregations to ''opt out'' if they wish to appoint a minister or a deacon in a same-sex marriage or a civil partnership. Any wider consideration of the theological understanding of same-sex marriage will not take place until the Theological Forum presents its report to the Kirk next year.

Driss El Yazami stated that ""the goal of the pilot committee of COP22 is to mobilise all the parties to seize the opportunity that has been given by the Paris Agreement, and to raise awareness among Moroccans and indeed everybody on sustainable development and climate change"". For his part, Nizar Baraka stated that ""Morocco, upon receiving the official presidency of the Conference of Parties, set about its mission with a new rational, namely to involve governmental and non-governmental parties. ""We need to change the paradigm and our daily habits as citizens, states, institutions, journalists, organisations, individuals and groups in relation to nature"", she said, adding that, the media needs to clarify and simplify this new logic to citizens and to relay experiences and successful initiatives in the fight against climate change"".

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK76","-AfDB reaffirms supporting climate resilient and low-carbon development in Africa","May 30, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","The African Development Bank has reaffirmed its commitment to mobilize resources to help African countries adopt and mitigate climate change. This commitment underpins its 2013-2022 Strategy promoting inclusive and green growth in Africa. Almost US $ 7 billion has been committed to projects in support of climate resilient and low-carbon development in the past four years. However, ahead of the upcoming UN climate talks, COP22 , which will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from November 7 to 18, 2016, the Bank is calling for implementation of the Paris Agreement, especially ensuring that climate financing is urgently delivered for African countries which are most vulnerable to climate change shocks. Last year, the Bank's support contributed significantly to ensuring that Africa's concerns were addressed in the Paris Agreement at COP21. The Bank has also committed to triple its climate change finance to about US $ 5 billion per year and to provide US $ 12 billion on renewable energy investments by 2020. In keeping with the Bank's New Deal on Energy for Africa, that provides a good entry point for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and given that COP22 is a key milestone for the implementation of that agreement, it is important that Africa is fully on board, while ensuring linkages with the Bank's High 5 priorities. According to Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group, the current climate financing architecture is not providing the finance Africa needs. 'Much more needs to be done to increase Africa's access to climate finance,' Adesina said Friday, May 27, 2016, during a high-level panel on climate change, 'Towards COP22 in Marrakech : What are the issues at stake?', on the last day of the Bank's 2016 Annual Meetings. Adesina pointed out that Africa, which contributes less than 3 per cent of the global greenhouse emissions, is suffering from the effects of El Nino, which has caused severe drought in 14countries with 13 located in East and Southern Africa. Citing Kenya and Rwanda, which have had devastating floods, with over 8.4 million people facing food insecurity in Malawi and 15 million in Ethiopia, as well as vast areas of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Botswana, Adesina pointed out that the continent is already feeling the shocks of climate change. To support these countries, AfDB has allocated funds to the tune of US $ 549 million. Adesina demanded for 'climate justice' for Africa, calling on the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility to 'pay for the insurance premium of African countries to the Africa Risk Capacity Agency.' 'This will allow them to cope with extreme climate events ... like Senegal which received US $ 17 million payout to mitigate the impacts of drought. AfDB will lead the way and triple its climate finance to US $ 5 billion per year by 2020,' Adesina said. For his part, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Chairman of COP22 Steering Committee, Salaheddine Mezouar, pledged that the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) will be an event of action and an occasion to implement the Paris agreement. 'Africa has to move very first,' he said, calling for action. Panelists, including Segolene Royal, French Environment Minister and COP21 President; Karl Hermann Gustav Schlettwein, Minister of Finance, Namibia; Peter Craig-McQuaide, Head of Unit European Commission, International Cooperation and Development, DEVCO/C/6 - Sustainable Energy and Climate Change; and Mohamed Beavogui, Director General, Africa Risk Capacity, all underscored need for action and implementation of the Paris agreement. Segolene Royal, French Minister of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs, responsible for International Climate Relations, emphasized the need to bring forward projects for access to renewable energy and speed up the deployment of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative aimed at increasing Africa's installed renewable energy capacity by 10 GW by 2020 and by 300 GW by 2030. Royal pointed out that Africa suffers from the impacts of climate change, including droughts, soil degradation, land salination, coastal erosion, deforestation and climate migration. While Africa is not responsible for these disasters, it is a victim of them. Climate justice, therefore, requires a determined, effective implementation of the actions decided during the summit of African leaders during COP21, she argued. The AfDB continues to demonstrate leadership in promoting low carbon development. Between 2011-2014, on average 26 per cent of the AfDB annual investments were flagged as climate-smart projects. In 2014, the AfDB mobilized US $ 1,916 billion for climate-smart projects including US $ 1,156 billion for mitigation and US $ 756 million for adaptation. This amount is up by 59 per cent compared to 2013. COP20 in Lima was tagged the COP of negotiations of a universal climate change agreement; COP21 in Paris last year was considered a COP of Agreement; while COP22 in Morocco is tagged the COP of Implementation.

At UN headquarters in New York, meanwhile, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed confidence that US president-elect Trump will come to understand the ""seriousness and urgency"" of the deal. The news that an avowed climate change denier had captured the US White House stunned participants arriving Wednesday at the 12-day talks in Marrakesh, which run from November 7 to 18. ""There are two types of reaction: worry and determination to forge ahead,"" said Segolene Royal, France's foreign minister. Delegates from several countries have taken a ""wait-and-see"" attitude after the victory by the New York real estate developer, who has said that climate change is a hoaxperpetrated by the Chinese. ""We need to assess the situation when the new government comes into office,"" in January 2017, said Chen Zhihua, a delegate from China's National Development and Reform Commission. ""There are too many uncertainties ahead."" Shigeru Ushio, a negotiator from Japan's foreign ministry, also said his country would ""wait and see"" whether Trump's climate policies will differ from his campaign rhetoric. But if the US reneges on a commitment to give poor countries $2.5 billion (\£32 billion) to help them cope with climate impacts, he added, ""that would cause difficulties."" Under the Paris pact, rich countries have pledged at least $100 billion a year starting in 2020. In an annex to the treaty, nations have also submitted voluntary pledges to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that cause dangerous global warming. The agreement commits nations to collectively capping Earth's average temperature increase at under two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). With 1.0C (1.8F) of warming to date, the world has already seen an uptick in deadly storms, droughts, heatwaves and flooding. Mr Mezouar has not yet reached out to Mr Trump or his team, he told AFP. ""As the president of COP22 "" - the acronym for the 22nd meeting of the Conference of the Parties - ""I am waiting with impatience to encounter the new American administration,"" he told AFP. Climate change: It's ""game over"" for planet earth Experts and diplomats here insist that the global market-based transition from a fossil fuels to clean energy is too far advanced to peel back. But Trump's ascension has shaken hard-won political unity at the UN forum. This uncertainty makes Mr Mezouar's role even more crucial, said Liz Gallagher, an analyst at London-based thinktank E3G. Read more 'Emergency' campaign to persuade Trump climate change is real ""The Moroccans need to be more proactive in driving the process, using all the diplomatic tools at their disposal, to make sure we get a clear outcome,"" she told AFP.

""Our commitment to be climate leaders remains steadfast, as is our commitment to work with the whole international community, including the United States,"" they said. National carbon-cutting plans submitted under the Paris Agreement go into effect in 2020. Some ministers arriving next week for a high-level session will announce more ambitious pledges, which still fall far short of what is needed to stave off devastating climate impacts. AFP \"

""I believe that's why we can't break away from reliance on exporting our raw materials - new industries will only go to where there's power."" He is speaking on the sidelines of the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, which ends on Friday. Related: Morocco lights the way for Africa on renewable energy Adesina and colleagues from the bank have been using the conference to highlight its new initiatives on energy, including the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which will see $12bn (\£39.7bn) invested in the sector over the next five years. ""Africa is tired of being in the dark,"" he says. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has also created the role of vice-president on power, and been a major player in setting up the African Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to generate 10GW of power from renewable sources by 2020 and up to 300GW by 2030. ""This initiative was the major outcome for Africa of the Paris COP21 meeting last year, where G7 countries contributed $10bn towards it,"" says Adesina. Adesina says he is particularly impressed by the strides Morocco has taken to develop its capacity for solar energy. The AfDB was a major investor in the 160MW Noor solar plant at Ouarzazate, which was opened this year. The complex, which uses giant mirrors to reflect the sun's heat on to liquid that then turns turbines, is being expanded to produce more than 500MW by 2018. Morocco has also recently signed a deal to build 1720MW in new wind farm capacity. ""Africa should use what it has and not what it doesn't have. We have limitless sunshine and great potential for wind, hydro and geothermal,"" he says. However, he still believes there is a role for non-renewable sources of energy in Africa. ""We need a balanced energy mix. Some African countries have gas and coal, which can be used in a clean way, and they should use it."" Another major challenge is to increase the amount of money spent on climate change adaptation - or helping countries to rebuild systems when they are destroyed by the impacts of climate change. In Africa, for example, governments are coping with floods, extreme temperatures and major droughts in east and southern Africa and the Sahel. Wealthy countries have committed $100bn towards helping poorer states cope with climate change, but one of the major topics on the agenda in Marrakech has been how that money should be divided between adaptation and mitigation. Until now, only 14% of climate funds have gone to adaptation, and Africa, the continent most deeply affected by climate change, has received only 4% of the total green climate funds. ""We've been short-changed by climate change and we should not be short-changed in financing,"" says Adesina. ""South Africa has spent $700m this year dealing with the impacts of the drought last year; Mozambique $200m; Namibia $13m. These emergency costs are continuously displacing public expenditure which should be going to health, education and infrastructure development, and endangering macro-economic stability. My view is that we need to increase the amount to be spent on adaptation so that we can spend money on development."" The AfDB is trying to garner support for an African insurance fund. An initiative called the African Risk Capacity Insurance has been launched, but of 32 countries that signed up, only seven have been able to pay the premiums. Adesina says the idea for the insurance fund was welcomed on Wednesday at an African heads of state meeting chaired by Morocco's King Mohammed VI, and that one way in which climate finance can be better targeted to help African countries is for green climate funds such as the GEF (Global Environment Facility) to start paying the premiums for the African countries. He hopes that this could pave the way for action. ""Whenever these drastic climate events like drought, flood or extreme temperature happen, the world has words of comfort for Africa,"" says Adesina. ""But words of comfort cannot pay the bills and rebuild when problems start."" \"

Xie Ji, deputy chief of Chinese delegation to COP22 in Marrakech of Morocco, made the remarks and expected all the parties could reach a consensus for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. As the first UN climate change conference after the Paris Agreement which took effects three days ago, the COP22 kicked off on Monday morning, and around 20,000 participants from the globe will discuss in the next 11 days on the details related to execution of the Paris Agreement. While negotiating on some technique and procedure issues, Xie said developed countries and developing ones show different attitudes and positions, underlining that only insisting the principle of ""common interest and different responsibility"" could cover the interests of all the parties. As the biggest developing country, China is playing a model role on the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, he stressed. China makes great positive efforts to reduce its emission and initializes the green and carbon-low development mode. The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued last Friday a five-year plan to reduce greenhouse gas emission and showed its ambition by targeting the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18 per cent compared with that in 2015 by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, China would continue to help developing countries to cut their greenhouse gas emission and improve their abilities of handling climate changes, especially climate disasters. ""We have a concrete programme to help our developing partners. We will help build up ten carbon-low demonstration zones, launch 100 projects to cope with climate changes and reduce greenhouse gas emission, and offer over 1,000 training places in China,"" said Xie, adding that the main objective of China is to make its contribution, as a country of responsibility, to deal with the human's challenge. According to a report published by World Bank, 57 per cent of the energy savings achieved between 1990 and 2010 were contributed by China. ""That's a fair comment on China's efforts,"" said Xie.

It is the most aggressive policy line Morocco has taken on the issue since the 1990s. While Morocco claims it is not re-entering the AU to remove the SADR from the organisation, once it rejoins - and it is highly likely that it will - it will be able to prevent the AU from passing measures directly in support of the organisation. Morocco is already highly invested across West Africa and the Sahel region - by visiting East Africa the government can extend further economic influence to bring powerful voices within the AU onside. Morocco has highly ambitious renewable energy generation targets - 50% of the energy mix by 2030 - and requires continuing inward investment to achieve this. Currently it is able to attract investors to the major solar power developments at Ouarzazate, but this interest may wane over time - particularly if other countries offer better tariff arrangements. For the moment, Morocco is using its expertise in the field to market products to regional neighbours - anticipating continuing interest in energy efficiency and renewable generation in African markets in the medium term. Mohammed VI took international credit for managing to avoid major instability around the Arab Spring demonstrations in 2011 by instituting a snap election and constitutional reform. However, many of the grievances that protestors had then remain. Morocco's security forces are reportedly highly efficient but allegedly have a poor track record of violence and police brutality. Mohammed VI directly intervening in the Fikri protests is a signal to the nation that the government takes the issue seriously. FOOTNOTES \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK87","Investors driving positive change","December 13, 2016","Investment Adviser","One of the most significant landmarks for the renewable energy industry in the past year was the Paris conference on climate change. A year on, and the outlook on paper at least seems less optimistic. The COP22 conference in Marrakech on November 7-18, was shrouded in uncertainty in light of recent political developments in the UK and the US. The energy industry waits with baited breath what will the future hold for a progressive, healthy energy mix across the globe? >It is hoped that COP22 can inspire and educate more investors to be more climate aware as they diversify their investment portfolios But while many discussions have focused on the future of the US s commitment to the Paris agreement, it needn t all be doom and gloom. In fact, many of the talks at the COP22 conference looked at how wealthier nations can support developing nations with financial aid in the adoption of renewable energy alternatives putting climate finance firmly on the global agenda. This is key. Raising awareness about the importance of stronger investment into climate change solutions will be paramount in the global fight against climate change. In 2014, the Australian government announced the delivery of AU$200m (\£3117m) to the UN s Green Bank. Such a move sent a clear signal of the country s commitment to support a greener economy. Moves like this can help create a positive investment climate for those looking to invest in climate change solutions such as solar photovoltaics, onshore wind and commercial energy storage. Investors have the power to drive positive change by divesting from fossil fuels, and reinvesting into renewable energy sources. This doesn t just help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, but can also present strong returns. Such investments are typically long term and inflation-linked. A vast amount of climate change solutions are infrastructure projects and often wrongly placed as part of the private equity industry. Finally, and most importantly, such investments are proven and credible. Wind and solar power, for example, have been around for at least 20 years, generating electricity to power thousands of local homes and communities. AU$200m In 2014, the Australian government announced the delivery of this amount to the UN's Green Bank It is hoped that COP22 can inspire and educate more investors to be more climate aware as they diversify their investment portfolios. The climate-savvy investor of the future will realise the true potential of alternative energy sources to shape our future for the better, and make sure that the financial markets will cease to be dominated by the oligarchs of oil and fossil fuels. Such investors are also far more likely to be influenced by the investment decisions they make at home. For example, if they can see the savings made by having solar panels at home, they may be more incentivised to invest in energy storage at scale, for example. While investors can help the fight against climate change, they cannot do it alone. Now more than ever, strong leadership and collaboration is needed to keep the promise of Paris s COP21 alive. As one of the most competitive financial centres in the world, London is poised to become one of the leading capitals for climate finance but more must be done. Take the Montr\'e9al Carbon Pledge. In 2014, this pledge a commitment from the UN s Principles for Responsible Investment to measure and disclose the carbon intensity of the whole investment portfolio of global members was launched after pressure from major pension funds and institutional investors such as the Rowntree Charitable Trust. It is evident, then, that the investment community has the power to effect change and even change policy. Looking ahead, COP22 s legacy may be dampened by recent political shifts in the West, but the renewable energy industry must find ways to clearly and confidently weather the policy uncertainty that is to come. The private sector, including the climate-savvy investors, can lead the charge in driving investment into renewable energy sources, while also enjoying the robust returns that come with them. The road ahead must be one of collaboration, with investors and policymakers working together to create a positive investment climate, which will in turn help to tackle the global issue of climate change. <strong>Juan Martin Alfonso is chief financial officer at Low Carbon</strong> \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK88","Soil degradation remains problem for government","June 10, 2016","Horticulture Week","The government's goal for all soils to be managed sustainably is unlikely to be met given current practices, according to a forthright report published this month by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee. Committee chair, the Labour MP Mary Creagh, said: 'Soil degradation could mean that some of our most productive agricultural land becomes unprofitable within a generation. The government wants to see all soils managed sustainably by 2030, but their current actions will not be enough to reach that goal.' The report says the UK's soils 'have seen a worrying decline in carbon levels since 1978', warning that such degradation 'leads to increased carbon emissions and contributes to climate change'. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference the Government signed up to a scheme to increase soil carbon levels by 0.4 per cent a year, but according to the committee: 'Methods to increase soil carbon are well understood but not implemented to their full potential. The government must set out specific, measureable and time-limited plans to meet the goal to increase soil carbon.' It said part of the failure to meet this commitment came from weaknesses in cross-compliance rules tying farm payments to soil health, pointing out: 'Crucial elements of soil health, such as structure and biology, are not assessed at all. The rules are accompanied by a minimalistic inspection regime which Defra aims to reduce further.' It urged the government to 'increase the scope, force and ambition' of the scheme. It also called for an end the 'double subsidy' of maize growing for anaerobic digestion, saying: 'Revisions should either exclude maize from the (renewable energy) subsidy altogether or impose strict conditions on subsidised maize production to avoid practices in high-risk locations which lead to soil damage.' And it called for Defra's upcoming 25-year environment plan to 'place soil protection at the heart of environmental policy', saying: 'We must move away from viewing soil merely as a growth medium and treat it as an ecosystem in its own right.' The Soil Association said it was 'delighted' by the report, which it said endorsed its calls for a clear target for increasing soil organic matter, protecting lowland peat, and ending what it called the 'destructive effects' of maize growing. -------------------- Did you find this article useful?

The assembly, which opens in Edinburgh today, is to vote on extending a law passed last May that permits ministers to be in same-sex civil partnerships. The issue of also allowing same-sex marriage ministers was sent to presbyteries for further discussion at last year's event, deferring a decision on the matter until this year. The 2015 assembly was told that the measure would not change the Church's traditional stance on marriage, or amount to a recognition of the validity of same-sex marriage. The outcome of last year's vote on civil partnerships followed years of deliberation within the Church. The decision meant the Kirk adopted a position which maintains a traditional view of marriage between a man and woman, but allows individual congregations to ''opt out'' if they wish to appoint a minister or a deacon in a civil partnership. But because that debate pre-dated the legalisation of gay marriage, the change related only to civil partnerships, not same-sex marriages. More than 850 commissioners from across Scotland, the rest of the UK, Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean have registered to attend this year's assembly, which began with a formal ceremony attended by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.

In a speech to the UN in April, Mike McGavick, chairman of the Geneva Association, and CEO of XL Group, highlighted the role the re/insurance industry can play in mitigating risks posed by climate change.  The job of anticipating and modelling risks is in the wheelhouse of the insurance industry and risk modelling is the gateway to resilience, said McGavick.  To absorb these risks we can contribute our expertise in creating useful risk transfer and sharing programs and further microinsurance efforts.

The teaser includes a clip of President-elect Donald Trump saying that he is ``not a big believer in man-made climate change'', followed by Cher asking how one can ``not notice all the things that are changing''. He says: ``It's perfectly clear that the world is warming up. It is perfectly clear that the human race in numbers is increasing at an alarming rate. ``In the short time that I have been making television programmes, the population of the world has tripled.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK95","Trump election casts shadow over COP 22 climate change talks","FT.com"," ","Donald Trump\' s victory in the US presidential election reverberated around the world this week, not least in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh that is hosting the first major UN talks on global warming since last year\' s landmark Paris climate deal was struck. Mr Trump has vowed to  cancel the Paris accord and sweep aside many of the commitments to cut fossil fuel emissions that the US had pledged as part of the agreement. No single country can abolish the Paris deal and it is still too early to know exactly what a Trump presidency will mean for an accord that caps more than 20 years of international negotiations on curbing climate change. What is clear, however, is that Mr Trump\' s election brings to an abrupt halt the excitement surrounding the lead-up to the Marrakesh COP 22 meeting, which had been marked by a rare high point of global co-operation on climate action. First, so many countries rushed to ratify or join the HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris climate accord Then, on October 6, governments struck the first global climate deal foraviation, a fast-growing source of emissions long deemed too hard to include in UN accords such as Paris and Kyoto. Finally, in the early hours of October 15 in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, another global deal was sealed  to phase outhydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. These planet-warming chemicals are used in millions of air conditioners and refrigerators and it is estimated that the Kigali agreement could help avoid as much as 0.5C of future global warming. It is hard to think of another period when so much international action occurred in such a short time. Patricia Espinosa, the veteran Mexican diplomat recently appointed the UN\' s top climate official, had seen nothing like it before.  I have spent a good part of my career in multilateral affairs and I can tell you it is really unprecedented, she said, shortly before the US election. Even before Mr Trump\' s victory, large questions remained about whether it would be possible to meet the Paris agreement\' s central aim of avoiding dangerous global warming. Some of the answers will come at the two-week Marrakesh meeting on November 7-18. Because the Paris agreement came into force sooner that expected, every country ratifying the pact is now legally bound by its terms  including the US for the moment. That has thrown the spotlight on the HYPERLINK http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx climate action plans Countries are not legally obliged to meet any emissions targets in their plans but they do have to update them every five years so that, ultimately, global temperature rises are kept  well below 2C compared to pre-industrial revolution levels, and 1.5C if possible. Many decisions still have to be made about the rules guiding exactly what is in these updated plans. The first batch, made ahead of the COP21 meeting in Paris, would still put the world on course for at least 2.9C of warming this century, the UN said last week. Collectively, these plans amount to a hotchpotch of pledges, from building wind farms to planting trees, with an array of different targets for bringing down emissions. The US, for instance, has proposed an emissions cut of up to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2025, while the EU is planning a 40 per cent cut from 1990 levels by 2030. China has no goal for an outright cut at all, but instead says its emissions will peak by 2030. The Paris accord stipulates that a new governing body for the agreement should decide  at its first session on rules for common timeframes in climate plans and other measures making it easier to compare each country\' s actions. That includes more common standards for reporting greenhouse gas emissions in a timely and accurate fashion, which is far from the case at present. The EU, the US and other developed countries have generally submitted emissions data to the UN for at least the year 2013. But some of China\' s latest figures date back to 2005 while those of other countries are from the 1990s. Poorer countries also want to see more transparent reporting of the financing commitments wealthier nations have pledged to deliver to help tackle global warming. Because the agreement is coming into force unexpectedly early, its new governing body can technically hold its first session in Marrakesh. But dozens of countries have yet to formally ratify the deal, meaning they cannot take part in the early shaping of any decisions. As a result, it had been expected that the new body would convene and then be suspended, leaving time for more countries to join. At a minimum, many governments want the Marrakesh meeting to set a deadline of 2018 for agreeing on the  rule book needed for the Paris accord. That still makes the meeting important for investors, says Zoe Knight, managing director for climate change at HSBC.  More clarity on how the aims set out in country plans will be measured and monitored allows a more effective climate risk assessment, she says. More than 600 companies have already said they expect to change their strategy as a result of the Paris agreement\' s adoption, says Paul Simpson, chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project, a non-profit body that compiles company environmental data for hundreds of investors. Some plan to adopt an internal carbon price; others say they will use more renewable energy. But corporations will still be watching closely to see how countries implement the agreement\' s rules, as will climate scientists. Temperatures have already risen nearly 1C since the industrial revolution, following a fossil-fuelled boom in carbon dioxide emissions, and some scientists think the goal of limiting the rise to 2C will be hard to meet, let alone 1.5C. Average global CO2 levels in the atmosphere reached 400 parts per million in 2015 and surged to HYPERLINK http://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/globally-averaged-co2-levels-reach-400-parts-million-2015 new records this year on the back of a powerful El Ni\'f1o weather system that is likely to make 2016 the warmest year \~ HYPERLINK http://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-climate-breaks-new-records-january-june-2016 on record . Experts at Oxford university held a conference in September to consider the Paris agreement\' s 1.5C goal. Some attendees had sobering views.  The very first year at 1.5C could be in about 10 years time if we happen to get an extra warm year on top of the long-term warming trend, like we had with the recent El Ni\'f1o event, said Professor Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. While it may take more time for temperatures to stick at that level, it illustrates the challenges of meeting the Paris deal\' s targets. The good news is that there has been  remarkable progress in the growth of renewable energy alternatives to fossil fuels, says Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute research group in the US. The International Energy Agency recently reported a record-breaking number of installations of wind and solar power last year that has led to renewables overtaking coalto become the world\' s largest source of installed power capacity.  We\' ve got a lot to be enthusiastic about, Mr Steer says. But there is no room for complacency, he adds.  We are still a long, long way off from getting to where we need to get to. \"

Morocco has become the latest country to join UNWTO as partner of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development 2017. The commitment was delivered at the Moroccan Day of Sustainable and Responsible Tourism held on 20 March in Rabat. Morocco has become the latest partner of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development 2017. The commitment of the Kingdom of Morocco with the tourism sector is remarkable On the occasion of the Moroccan Day of Sustainable and Responsible Tourism on 20 March, the government of Morocco committed to support the International Year and advance the promotion of the first African Charter on Sustainable and Responsible Tourism. The African Charter on Sustainable and Responsible Tourism, signed last November in Marrakesh during the Ministerial Forum on Tourism and Climate in Africa, on the sidelines of the COP22 , aims at becoming an instrumental tool for the continent to engage in sustainable tourism best practices by reconciling social and economic growth, the preservation of the environment and the respect for the cultural diversity of each country. 'The commitment of the Kingdom of Morocco with the tourism sector is remarkable, not only by joining now the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, but also by other gestures done in the past such as partnering with the World Tourism Organization in promoting more responsible practices and leading the process of adoption of the African Charter' said UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai. The United Nations 70th General Assembly has designated 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. In the context of the universal 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the International Year aims to support a change in policies, business practices and consumer behavior towards a more sustainable tourism sector than can contribute to the SDGs. The IY2017 will promote tourism's role in the following five key areas: (1) Inclusive and sustainable economic growth; (2) Social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; (3) Resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; (4) Cultural values, diversity and heritage; and (5) Mutual understanding, peace and security.

Students from across the country joined the debate and represented countries such as Brazil, USA, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. The conference, run annually by Size of Wales in partnership with Welsh Centre for International Affairs, gives young people an opportunity to discuss the issue of climate change from the perspective of world leaders. Topics discussed ranged from clean energy, protecting rainforests, disaster management and how to finance these. ""The conference encourages young people to be more engaged with climate change and political issues"" said Janie Pridham, education officer at Size of Wales. ""It also helps them develop understanding of other nations and cultures and to consider the responsibility of Wales, both locally and globally."" She added: ""The standard of debate was extremely high this year. ""It was wonderful to see the students take on their roles in such a realistic way. ""Some delegates were quoting Trump and there was even a smear campaign between countries."" The aim of the day was for delegates to agree an international resolution on the issue of climate change, similar to the UN climate change COP22 talks that were held in Marrakesh in November. This year Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner, joined the event, acting as the secretary general and presiding over teams of three pupils representing 20 countries and organisations. ""The bright, engaged young people I met today not only understand the critical point we have reached in terms of tackling climate change but understand that it is they who will be experiencing the positive or negative impact of our actions today."" the Commissioner said. ""If we continue to give them a voice and an opportunity to influence, it gives me hope that there is a better future for everyone in Wales and that we will be a nation that makes a positive contribution to global wellbeing."" Size of Wales is a unique initiative which is helping to protect an area of rainforest twice the size of Wales as part of a national response to climate change.

Moroccan cities have witnessed the most serious protests since the Arab spring in recent days following an incident in which a fisherman died in an altercation with police. Mouhcine Fikri was crushed to death in a rubbish truck trying to retrieve 500kg of fish allegedly caught out of season which had been confiscated. ""It could have happened to any one of us in Morocco"", said 29-year-old Iman, a young mother and student from Marrakech. ""We are not treated as humans by the police or anyone who has any sort of power,"" added Yugerten, a 28-year-old student activist, who has been coordinating protests in the city that were attended by thousands last week. Demonstrators want to maintain their actions to catch the eye of visiting delegations to the UN climate change talks that start on Monday. Yugerten said Facebook was the principal means of getting people together. Iman said one of the principal complaints was how much control the authorities have over ordinary people's lives. ""They can stop us getting a job, or scare our families but... even if you have a job, there is no law to protect you anyway. Look at what happened to Mouhcine."" When Fikri died, parallels were quickly drawn with Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian fruit seller who set himself on fire after the police confiscated his goods, triggering the Arab spring. But Yugerten explained that this is not a new movement, or one that is seeking to overthrow the government, but part of an ongoing fight for some semblance of democracy. The arrival of thousands of participants for the COP 22 summit is timely. Activist Nadir Bouhmouch, who also participated in the protests in Marrakech, told Democracy Now that people feel the ""state is using this conference to greenwash its abuses, to greenwash the economic, social and environmental injustices that the people of Morocco face"". Yugerten said he and his friends are against the climate talks because they legitimise the tight grip the country holds its citizens in. And last week there was a virtual protest to warn visitors that even if they are able to use WhatsApp calls and Skype, after they leave Moroccans will again be banned from using the services.

On Tuesday 11 people were arrested in connection with Fikri's death, but analysts see this as a knee-jerk attempt to be seen to be doing something. Both Iman and Yugerten are educated millennials, but say people from all walks of life have taken to the streets, from traders to taxi drivers and elderly women. Yugerten said he had been encouraged to see ""new faces"" in Marrakech this week too. The authorities are believed to be mounting their own social media campaign to dissuade people from turning out. A message has been doing the rounds on Facebook and WhatsApp accusing the protesters of being un-Islamic and trying to turn Morocco into Syria. Some names have been changed \"

This fourth facility of the NOORo (NOOR Ouarzazate) solar complex will employ PV, and is the first photovoltaic installation at the site. NOORo I, II and III use CSP technology. The PV capacity will be built up in stages, starting with an initial phase of 72 MW. Construction of this first PV phase started in April, with completion expected in one year. The ground breaking ceremony follows the agreement that was signed in November 2016 at COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco, by a consortium led by water and power developer, ACWA Power, to develop and operate the plant. The total cost of the 72 MW PV project is put at US $ 220 million. ACWA Power was selected through an international tender and will, in collaboration with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen) and the Chint Group, be responsible for the development, construction and long term operation of the PV plant under a BOOT (Build, Operate, Own and Transfer) scheme. The levelised electricity tariff of USD 4.797 cents/kWh (MAD 0.46/kWh) at which the contract has been placed is one of the most competitive yet awarded says ACWA Power, ""taking into account equalising factors such as terms of contract and location and country specific factors"". A consortium of Sterling & Wilson, Shapoorji Pallonji and Chint Solar will undertake the delivery of the facilities under a ""delivery, procurement and construction"" contract, on behalf of the sponsors. In addition to its role as off-taker of the generated electricity and one of three shareholders in the project owning company, Masen is acting as the sole lender to the project owning company. NOORo I (160 MW, parabolic trough CSP, with 3h of molten salt thermal storage) is already in commercial operation, while NOORo II (200 MW, also parabolic trough CSP, with 7.2h of molten salt thermal storage) and NOORo III (150 MW, CSP with central receiver tower, 8h of molten salt thermal storage) are under construction, both due to enter service in Q4 2017. NOORo II, the largest parabolic trough CSP installation to date, uses SENERtrough-2 technology - a second-generation version of SENER's parabolic trough system that is said to ""increase the capture capacity of each module by 30%"". The NOORo III tower-based facility is of a similar configuration to that deployed by SENER at Gemasolar, in Seville, Spain. \"

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) welcomed a new era in the global battle against climate change today as the historic Paris climate agreement came into force. The accord became operational on 4 November just days before the start of the COP22 international climate talks in Marrakesh where the implementation of the Paris Agreement will be a major focus. 'This is a very important development. The international support for the Paris Agreement - and the momentum that has made it effective even earlier than expected - shows that the world is now firmly on a path to taking a determined stand against climate change,' said EBRD President Sir Suma Chakrabarti. However, he warned that the real work was now only just beginning. 'We have all made pledges on how to deal with climate change. Now we have to deliver.' The EBRD will host a series of high-profile events at COP22 in Marrakesh. Senior EBRD representatives will also participate in other events during the 7-18 November conference, sharing the experiences of the Bank as a major provider of climate finance and climate expertise across 36 countries in three continents. The EBRD is participating in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP22 , which takes place in Marrakesh, Morocco. MORE VIDEOS The EBRD's sessions will include a discussion of the legal requirements that will help the planet move towards a low-carbon future. There will also be a debate on how to bring private finance to the challenge of combating climate change in the agricultural sector. With the 2016 climate talks taking place in Africa, there will be a focus on the EBRD's southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, which includes Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. The Bank will present its programme to develop private renewable energy markets in these SEMED countries. The EBRD's particular strength is engaging with the private sector - including the private financial sector - to address the global challenge of climate change. Other sessions in Marrakesh will include discussions on climate finance and carbon market policies and on the implementation of low-carbon solutions in cities across the EBRD's region of operations. The EBRD has long placed a high priority on delivering climate finance, having already invested over EUR20 billion in some 1,160 green energy projects worth a total of more than EUR112 billion since 2006. As its contribution to the Paris Agreement, the EBRD joined other multilateral development institutions in pledging to scale up its green financing. Under the Bank's new Green Economy Transition approach, approved in 2015, it aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its total annual investments to green finance by 2020, compared with an average of around 24 per cent in recent years. Since the EBRD began working in the SEMED region in 2012, it has invested more than EUR1 billion there in around 45 green projects. Most recently the Bank provided financing for the construction of a new wind power plant in southern Jordan. The EBRD has been supporting Jordan's renewable energy programme since 2012, including the development of solar photovoltaic power plants.

It was fittingly voiced by the summit's next hosts, Fiji, where rising sea levels as a result of man-made global warming are already causing islands to vanish beneath the waves. As the imperilled nation was unveiled as hosts of COP23, the Fijian Prime Minister conjured up the image of America coming to the rescue as it did in the Second World War - a plea which, it is hoped, will appeal to Mr Trump's penchant for a grand gesture. ""We in the Pacific, in common with the whole world, look to America for its leadership and for its engagement and assistance on climate change,"" Frank Bainimarama said. ""Just as we looked at America during the dark days of World War II... I say to the American people 'you came to save us then, it is time for you to help to save us now'."" Even the US delegation here joined in the applause that followed. Read more With Donald Trump in the White House, who is left to save the world? So much of this year's summit has been given over to considering how best to deal with the looming threat of a climate change denier in the White House, when it was supposed under ""different circumstancesto have been about implementing last year's landmark Paris Agreement. But activists here say that only really tells half the story - and that in the background, big strides have been made towards combatting climate change. Mr Trump's election victory has been a wake-up call. It tells the global community it has been over-reliant on the good intentions and leadership of a single state or person. So this will be remembered as the COP where the most vulnerable states started to take control, instead of focussing on what deals they could get out of the richest nations. On the last day of the conference, a coalition of 48 developing states threatened in the near term by climate change - including the Marshall Islands, the Philippines and COP22 hosts Morocco - vowed to go beyond the commitments of the Paris Agreement and derive 100 per cent of their energy from renewables ""as rapidly as possible"".

There was good news too on one of the most difficult elements of the negotiations here and in Paris - how countries which are already suffering the impacts of climate change get compensated for the damage, and the measures they need to take to hold back the tide. These are the people - 40 million in Africa alone - who have to turn to charities like Oxfam when rising temperatures and record droughts destroy their livelihoods. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's lead climate expert, told The Independent : ""It looks like there will be a positive outcome [here] on the adaptation fund, and an \£380m funding goal was reached thanks to the support of Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Italy. ""But in saying that, I want to underline the fact that the establishment of funds doesn't deliver action. Money delivers action, and the amounts we are talking about are really small when compared to the amounts that are needed. ""Thankfully, I don't think Trump is going to be that interested in the adaptation fund."" The President-elect's shadow has loomed over every positive stride made at the summit - given Mr Trump's promise to ""cancel"" the US's involvement in the Paris Agreement. Climate change: It's ""game over"" for planet earth Earlier in the week, more than 360 US businesses including Kellogs, Mars and Starbucks signed a joint letter calling on President-elect Trump to join them in ""re-affirm[ing] our deep commitment to addressing climate change"". Representatives of individual US states attended the conference here to highlight their ability to push ahead with green initiatives - with or without the blessing of the federal government in Washington. And across the world, regions and cities are uniting in initiatives to share knowledge and represent the voices of progressive urban communities. Schemes like the EU-US Global Covenant of Mayors and the Under 2 MOU have members as disparate as Greater Manchester, Catalonia and Piedmont in Italy, and go beyond the state-level commitments of the Paris Agreement. Until the election of Mr Trump, the heads of every state except Nicaragua agreed to the terms of the Paris climate deal. But Wael Hmaidan, director of the Climate Action Network, told The Independent that the recent wave of populist political uprisings across the West showed just how those leaders had lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. He said the deal agreed here in Marrakech was ""rich"" with positive developments - and one of the most important was a recognition that climate activists have to get better at ""increasing awareness"". ""We are seeing in different elections around the world, that we are not engaging enough with various parts of the public,"" he said. ""We have our followers, we have those who understand climate change, but we don't engage the other side enough."" Not every measure taken here in these two weeks can be said to be entirely Trump-proof. The US is among the countries to have set out ambitious long-term goals to drastically cut their emissions by 2050 - a goal which only stands a chance if the new President can be brought on board. Read more Trump £wed' when Obama told him the realities of being president That's why appeals like Fiji's are still being made. In spite of everything, people here still believe that Mr Trump can be made to see the opportunities available in reimagining the world's energy consumption, and the risks if nothing is done. US climate veteran and director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, Alden Meyer, told The Independent the greatest achievement of the summit had been a world speaking as one ""with a loud and clear voice"". ""The rest of the world intends to proceed with Paris, with or without the US,"" he said. ""Not because they are doing a favour to the United States or President-elect Trump, but because Paris is in their own national interests. ""They see the impacts of climate change mounting on their populations, and they also see the benefits of decarbonising their economies and enjoying the fruits of the clean energy revolution. ""Not one country has said that if President Trump pulls the US out of Paris, they will follow,"" he said, adding to the repeated suggestions here that America will become a pariah if it reneges on its climate commitments. For all the measured arguments and cautious words over these two weeks, the climate activists here have a hard side - and when it comes to saving the planet, you are either with them, or against them. \"

The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, through its International Climate Initiative. ""Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport are expected to increase significantly in developing countries, as increased urbanization and the demand for personal mobility drives rapid increases in car use and road traffic levels,"" said Sujith Kollamthodi, Ricardo Energy & Environment sustainable transport practice director.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK106","Farming has big role to play in combating climate change","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Carmarthen Journal","THE Climate Change conference ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, is finishing this Friday and I'm glad that the role of agriculture in managing a changing climate has been discussed amongst world leaders. Farming has a big role to play in combating climate change and we are willing to step up to this challenge and help maintain the environment that so many people hold so dearly, but in order to succeed we must also have support from the government. The main agricultural discussions came on Farmers Day (November 9) during COP22 and on this same day the NFU launched its brochure entitled Delivering Britain's clean energy from the land available on the NFU Cymru website, under 'latest news'. Now legally binding, the international Paris Agreement on climate change signed in 2015 has opened the door to a wealth of opportunities for farmers to contribute to the low-carbon economy. Benefits to the farm enterprise like energy independence and improved business resilience run alongside benefits to the wider economy and to the environment. In India, renewable energy has been invaluable in helping to power irrigation in remote rural areas which are off-grid. In France approximately 20% of clean energy is produced by farmers and the French farmers association, FNSEA, and French forest organisations are working with their national authorities to develop national strategies on biomass and on the bio-economy. The farming industry here in Wales grows the raw ingredients for Wales' food and drink sector, worth \£36.1billion and provides jobs for 58,300 people all while using its natural resources to store carbon. The report showcases various members' ambitions to be on the frontline of tackling the impact of climate change and one of the case studies in the report is of NFU Cymru President, Stephen James' on-farm wind turbine. Farmers have embraced a diverse selection of technologies at different scales to meet the needs of their business and the country. They are keen to keep their businesses progressive and at the forefront of technology for present and future generations. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK107","Electric cars are on wrong road if they use dirty energy","November 7, 2016 Monday","The Times (London)","Numbers are important when it comes to global warming. So here are a few. Over the next ten days 25,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries will descend on Marrakesh to attend the annual UN climate change summit, otherwise known as COP22 . I will be among them. While we are there, we will be ferried around in a fleet of electric cars. If COP21 in Paris last year is any guide, we will travel 175,000 emissionfree miles and spare the planet from 18 tonnes of CO2. As my fellow participants are driven around, I hope they will stop to consider what really constitutes zeroemissions motoring. For an electric car can only truly be said to emit no CO2 from its tailpipe if the battery that powers it is charged by renewable electricity. This process is known as ""electrification"" and it is the key to increasing the sustainability of the energy sector. In the future, products and processes that were once powered by emission-producing fossil fuels will run on electricity derived from renewable sources. It is also the key to ensuring that the historic accord reached in Paris last year becomes a reality. We are making good progress. Last month the International Energy Agency revealed that renewables had overtaken coal as the world's largest source of power capacity thanks to huge investment. Four wind turbines are being installed every hour somewhere in the world. But, as we invest to decarbonise the electricity system, we need to make sure that we continue to provide a secure and affordable energy supply. That means increasing the competitiveness of renewable energy sources and adopting the smart networks required to integrate centralised and distributed energy sources more effectively and increase energy efficiency. It also means using technology in a cleverer way so that we can store the renewable energy that we produce for the days when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. Some may think we still need to wait to take full advantage of this model. But Iberdrola is living proof that this revolution is real. After 15 years of investments, we are the leading renewables producer among European utilities, with the lowest emissions in the sector. In total, two thirds of our global generating capacity - in the US, Mexico, Brazil, Spain and also in the UK through Scottish Power - is emission-free and we are about to meet our target of reducing our emissions by 30 per cent in 2020. We have also pledged to cut our emissions by a half by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050. Paris was important in setting the CO2 bar even higher and making it a legally binding requirement that all signatories set their own emissions reduction targets. It will be vital to maintain that momentum by ensuring that what was pledged in Paris is implemented in Marrakesh. That means agreeing ways to accelerate the emissions reduction efforts of governments and NGOs. It means improving access to the $100 billion a year of climate financing that Paris mandated through to 2020. And it means eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels. It also requires us to reform electricity prices in such a way that the energy industry's competitiveness is not hampered. That means ceasing to include in energy bills levies and social charges that have nothing directly to do with the business of generating, transmitting and supplying electricity. For our part, the energy industry must demonstrate that wealth creation and fighting global warming are not mutually exclusive. At Iberdrola, we are doing our bit through a \£320 billion investment budget, of which 80 per cent is earmarked for renewables and energy networks, including smart grids. We expect the UK to be the biggest recipient of this with Scottish Power spending almost \£38 billion to consolidate its leading position in onshore and offshore wind and modernise its electricity networks. Tackling climate change is good for business as well as humanity. That is the message we must take into Marrakesh if we want to get the most out of COP22 . Ignacio Gal\'e1n is chairman and chief executive of Iberdrola \"

Many attendees stayed up through the night to find out whether a man who has previously described ""the concept of global warming"" as being ""created by and for the Chinese"" will be named the most powerful leader in the world. Read more Donald Trump's election could mean 'planetary disaster' The Morocco summit has seen representatives from around the world gather to discuss how last year's groundbreaking Paris Agreement will be implemented in practice. But Mr Trump has previously stated that he wants to dismantle the accord, which aims to limit global warming to within 2C, suggesting the US should not waste ""financial resources"" on tacking the issue. What Trump has said about climate change The new US President has tweeted dozens of times about how he does not accept the overwhelming scientific evidence that man-made climate change is real. Asked about his views on ScienceDebate, he said: ""There is still much that needs to be investigated in the field of 'climate change. We must decide on how best to proceed so that we can make lives better, safer and more prosperous.""

Whether this gives hope to climate experts that Mr Trump could change his position, or concern that the new US President would say something evidently untrue on live TV, remains to be seen. How will President Trump impact the climate? Patricia Espinosa, the UN's top climate official, said last month that there was ""no plan B"" for the event of a Trump presidency. Speaking to Climate Home, she admitted the US election result would have serious ""implications"" for how the world tackles dangerous climate change. Follow the latest fallout from the US election live here But climate officials have also been bullish since the start of the COP22 summit, saying there is no going back on the Paris Agreement. ""I think everyone in the world is following the election process because of the implications, and we are vigilant, but it's important to bear in mind the Paris Agreement has an incredible amount of legitimacy,"" Ms Espinosa said.

""The evidence is overwhelming,"" said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""The new report from WMO is a clarion call for embracing and going beyond the goals of the Paris Agreement."" How possible that is, with Donald Trump as US President, remains to be seen. In May, he said he would ""cancel"" the agreement, which was ratified by Barack Obama and has since received ratification by 55 of the 197 parties to the UN's climate convention (UNFCCC), representing the required threshold of 55 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Trump could ""simply withdraw"" the US from the agreement, on the basis that Mr Obama acceded using an executive order, according to international relations associate professor Robert Falkner of the London School of Economics. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, though, he could only give notice three years after it came into force (last Friday). And it would then take a year for the withdrawal to complete. The US could also simply withdraw from the 1992 climate convention, which underpins the Paris Agreement, which would take a year from notice being given to the UN.

As the world's second-largest polluter, the US is responsible for a staggering 13 per cent of the world's emissions. The loss of its support would be a practical dent in efforts to curb climate change. But a Trump presidency also means the UN accord losing its most influential champion. Louise van Schaik, a Dutch expert in multilateral negotiations at the Clingendael Institute told AFP: ""I see the real danger of Trump being elected as jeopardising the enormous change in the psychology on climate change."" Last Thursday Khalid Pitts, national political director of the US environmental group the Sierra Club, said in a statement: ""World leaders change, but Donald Trump's total ignorance of science remains the same.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK110","'Green' shipping trend a boon for AkzoNobel marine coatings","September 29, 2016 Thursday","ICIS Chemical News","SINGAPORE (ICIS)--AkzoNobel's marine coatings business stands to benefit from the shipping industry's expected compliance to more environmentally-friendly or ""green"" regulations to improve operational efficiency, a senior executive of the specialty chemicals firm said. ""The shipping industry is under increasing pressure to increase its sustainability, improve operational efficiencies, and reduce its impact on the environment,"" Oscar Wezenbeek, managing director of AkzoNobel Marine Coatings, told ICIS. In September, the company launched Intersleek 1000, a new biocide-free fouling control coating that let users save on fuel and carbon dioxide (CO2). ""We have seen an increase in the uptake of premium hull coatings, such as our Intersleek range of products that improve operational and environmental efficiencies, reducing fuel consumption and associated costs and emissions,"" Wezenbeek said. The company has also developed a carbon credits methodology, in conjunction with the Gold Standard Foundation, which financially rewards ship owners and operators for investing in sustainable hull coatings. Shipping, along with other industries, is under significant pressure to minimise its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) after global warning targets of below 2 degrees were set at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December last year. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to make a decision in October this year on whether to implement a key part of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI regulation, which will require vessels to burn fuel oil with a sulphur limit of 0.5% from either 2020 or 2025, ""although the earlier date is more likely"", Wezenbeek said. Based on IMO's recent greenhouse gas emissions study, the shipping industry's CO2 emissions could increase by up to 250% by 2050 if the new ""green"" regulations were not implemented. ""Ship owners are also under pressure from charterers, and shippers to improve levels of sustainability within the supply chain - reducing fuel costs and emissions, as well as optimising operational performance. This means that ship owners with more efficient vessels are therefore more competitive in the eyes of their customers,"" Wezenbeek said. The AkzoNobel executive said that demand for marine coatings improved in 2015 last year as delivery of new ships had risen for the ""first time in several years"". ""However, we are now seeing signs of a slowdown in new build activity in Asia, due to declining contracting of new vessels as the shipping industry undergoes a correction of the oversupply of vessel capacity,"" he said. ""At the same time we see a slowdown in maintenance and repair as ship owners and charterers feel the pressure of low freight rates, which continue to depress their earnings,"" Wezenbeek added. Although marine/bunker fuel prices have dropped tracking crude oil, new environmental legislation has forced an increase in the use of more expensive distillate fuels in Emissions Control Areas (ECAs), according to Wezenbeek. ""For many years, sustained high fuel prices gave ship owners and operators cause to investigate and introduce measures to mitigate hull roughness in order to unlock heightened levels of operational efficiency,"" he said. AkzoNobel completed in May the expansion of phase one of its performance coatings plant in Cikarang, Indonesia. It invested \€ 2.5m to expand the facility's capacity by 40%, to serve growing demand for its International brand marine and protective coatings products in the southeast Asian country.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK111","Brazil promotes bio fuels at climate change conference","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Latin America - Political ","Text of report by leading Brazilian daily Folha de Sao Paulo website on 17 November On Wednesday (16) Brazil launched an initiative to try once again to promote biofuels. The announcement, made at the UN Climate Conference ( COP22 ), has 20 signatory countries and took place after two months of consultations with nations that would be interested in expanding investments in fuel production from biomass (such as sugar cane for the production of ethanol and soybeans for biodiesel). The solution is still received with concern by environmentalists and by countries that have chosen not to join the platform, such as Germany. On Tuesday (15), Barbara Hendricks, president of the Environment Committee of the German parliament, met at the COP22 with Brazilian ministers Blairo Maggi (Agriculture) and Sarney Filho (Environment) to hear about the Biofuturo platform proposal. According to what Folha found out from the Brazilian representatives, the conversation ended in a total disagreement. Germany - which takes the lead in solar energy investments and is shutting down its coal-run power plants - would not commit to energy sources that threaten food security. Since 2008, the biofuels debate has been marked by the controversy over the competition to use land for food production. At that time, Brazil was already recognized as a privileged country because it was able to produce biofuel on a large scale without undermining the prospects of food production - thanks to sugarcane and to the amount of land it has for agriculture. Now, instead of trying to put Brazil in the position of ethanol supplier to the world, the country wants to encourage others to produce biofuels, which would increase investments and create a market in which Brazil would take the lead. For international NGOs, producing biofuels to replace fossil fuels is still controversial. Last week, the European Union received from the NGOs at COP22 the ""Fossil of the Day"" trophy due to the biofuel plans announced by the bloc. In the Brazilian proposal, what would allow other countries to produce energy from biomass would be the so-called second-generation biofuel: a technology that allows production from crop residues, taking advantage of parts of production that would have been discarded in the past. Today, Brazil has the potential to produce five billion litres of second-generation biofuels annually (and 30bn ""conventional"" litres). To meet the goal of the Paris Agreement, the country needs to reach 50bn litres, raising the share of ethanol to 18 per cent in the composition of the energy grid. Arguing that the transport sector, one of the sectors that produces the most gas emissions, needs immediate solutions for the energy transition; the government seems to ignore a trend already in progress: that of electric cars. ""They already have an established technology and it is a matter of time for the price to become competitive in the market,"" says Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimate System of the Climate Observatory. According to him, today there already are one million electric cars circulating around the world and countries plan to electrify their entire fleet - Germany, for example, wants to eliminate the combustion engine by 2040. For Tasso, the trend is clear when one compares the transition to the flex engine (which allows alcohol and gasoline) in Brazil. ""In a decade, the flex fleet has gone from zero to represent 65 per cent of the country's fleet,"" says Tasso, estimating that in 15 years the same should happen with electric cars. On the other hand, a transportation sector that still does not have a low carbon solution is that of the civil aviation. The Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2017 is due to submit a plan to encourage the development of biodiesel for aircraft. The challenge is still the price, up to 30 per cent more expensive than conventional fuel.

Both documents pave the way for the implementation of sustainability and responsibility principles in the tourism sector in Africa. The meeting was held in Marrakech on 10 November 2016. The African continent has now a common reference framework to promote sustainability and responsibility in the tourism sector. The African Charter on Sustainable and Responsible Tourism, signed during the Ministerial Forum on Tourism and Climate in Africa, on the sidelines of the COP22 , aims at becoming an instrumental tool for the continent to engage in sustainable tourism best practices by reconciling social and economic growth, the preservation of the environment and the respect for the cultural diversity of each country. During the opening, H.E.M. Aziz Akhannouch, Minister of Tourism of Morocco, said 'the charter which is signed today is a commitment for the future in order to promote sustainable tourism for the benefit of Africa while showing respect to biodiversity and the heritage of each African country'. UNWTO was represented by its Marcio Favilla, Executive Director for Operational Programmes and Institutional Relations, who highlighted that the signature of this significant document 'is the result of the vision that African countries have for the future of their tourism sector: one that respects the environment, local communities, promotes gender equality, creates jobs for the youth and is a key driver for sustainable and economic growth.' In addition he recalled that 'the Charter constitutes also an open working platform for countries which provides global orientations to preserve, respect and benefit African destinations and African people'.

As a matter of fact, China's development provides an enormous opportunity for Europe and both sides benefit from strong and stable bilateral ties. The European Union is China's biggest trading partner, and China is the EU's second biggest, following a dramatic increase in trade in recent years. Data from Chinese customs show that bilateral trade reached 2.94 trillion yuan (423.34 billion US dollars) in the first 10 months of 2016, reaching a new high, and overcoming the global trade downturn. China's rapid economic growth has served as an opportunity for the European Union's own growth. With a fragile economy, the rising threat of protectionism and uncertainty in relations with other major world powers, Europe can benefit significantly from strong trade relations with China. China and Europe should also work closer together in global governance issues, with climate change as a primary example. China and the EU played key roles as brokers of the COP21 Climate Agreement in Paris, and were urged to work even more closely for COP22 in Marrakech. With the Paris Agreement having entered into force, China and the EU will need to trust each other more than ever to help ensure that these critical measures are being implemented fully and correctly. Global security is also a core principle of China-EU relations, with Chinese President Xi Jinping calling for a community of shared future, and China showing its commitment to this vision through its involvement in the Iran nuclear talks, mediation for national reconciliation in South Sudan, and the facilitation of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taleban, among others. In all global issues, China is a partner to the European Union, a sign of the friendship and mutual trust built over the 42 years since diplomatic relations were formally established in 1975. Strong bilateral ties need these twin guarantees to ensure that different political systems and different cultures can still find common ground. International relations are not a zero-sum game, as China has repeatedly shown in its partnerships with Europe. Through strong bilateral ties, China seeks a relationship with the European Union that promotes win-win development and mutually benefiting cooperation. Senior European politicians should be cautious about the statements they make, and safeguard the long-term and steady development of China-EU relations. Biased views will do no good for such development. Source: Xinhua news agency in English 2252 gmt 1 Feb 17 \"

Countries have identified water as a key to adaptation in 93% of their national climate action plans (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or ""INDCs""). As water is fundamental for food security, human health, energy production, industrial productivity, biodiversity, in addition to basic human needs and its availability, ensuring water security means ensuring security in all these domains. In addition, water is critical for successful climate change mitigation, as many efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depend on reliable access to water resources. Systematically addressing these challenges is, therefore, key to adapting to climate change and reducing the negative impacts of water-related disasters. On this occasion, the ""Blue Book on Water and Climate"" will be launched by the Moroccan Government and its partners as a concrete outcome of its interim International Conference on Water and Climate, hosted in Rabat in July 2016, in cooperation with the Government of France and the World Water Council. The publication collects the orientations and recommendations brought forth by the international water community to support the implementation of climate commitments and proposes a variety of concrete and applicable solutions related to adaptation and resilience through water management. ""This aligns perfectly with COP22 , which is striving to be a COP of action!"" said Mrs. Charafat AFAILAL, Minister Delegate in charge of Water of Morocco. ""Now, we need to realize what is at stake, since water insecurity leads to increased conflicts, tension between populations, and also provokes migration that threatens overall stability."" Climate justice is also a priority of the Water Action Day, as evidenced by the launching of the ""Water for Africa"" initiative, established by the Kingdom of Morocco and supported by the African Development Bank. This initiative aims to render justice to Africa through the adoption of a specific action plan that will mobilize different international political, financial and institutional partners to improve water and sanitation services and management in Africa, for those most affected by climate change. ""While humanity experiences increasing demographic and socioeconomic stresses, recent episodes of extreme climate around the world bring additional complexities in finding solutions to reduce these stresses. Water is one of the most impacted resources, but water also provides solutions to these challenges,"" said Benedito Braga, President of the World Water Council. In addition, the three alliances for basins, megacities and businesses, created at COP21 in Paris and strongly engaged in water and climate action, which today represent more than 450 organizations worldwide, signed a common commitment to mobilize jointly their partners, identify and disseminate good practices and support the development of new projects by actors on the ground engaged in adaptation and resilience of the water sector. These three Alliances reported, in particular, during the Water showcase event on the positive progress made with the Flagship Projects on water adaptation launched at COP21, such as the Hydrological information system of the transboundary Congo River, the integrated management of the Hai River in China, the strengthening of the new Mexico Metropolitan Organization for Urban flooding drainage or the ""Eco-cuencas"" Climate adapt cooperation project between European and Andean countries and on new adaptation projects announced at COP22 Water day, for example, the Sebou River management in Morocco, the creation of the Water Adapt Training Center in Brasilia or the future use of the SWOT satellite for Hydrological observations, inter alia"". ""Adaptation of water resources to climate change must be organized at the natural level of national or transboundary basin of Rivers, lakes and aquifers, where water is flowing from up-stream to down-stream, and mobilize all actors in the field, including local authorities, economic sectors and civil society to achieve, in concertation and in due time, a common vision to face the climate change challenges"", said Roberto Ramirez de la Parra, the President of the International Network of Basin Organizations. About Global Climate Action France and Morocco's global climate champions have set out their detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. Message from the climate champions Hakima El Hait\'e9 and Laurence Tubiana ""A year after COP 21, the great dynamic of climate action is now growing strong. As we all gather to Marrakech time has come to start to take stock of what has been achieved during the last year. To be consistent with the long-term goals, all actors will have to work together, not only to achieve the national targets of the national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions), but also to go further and bridge the gap of emissions. This sense of urgency should guide us all in accelerating immediate efforts and delivering ambitious action. We must identify what concrete policy options and what tools we will have to mobilize in the short term.

After years of deliberation on the issue within the Church, the Assembly voted in favour of allowing individual congregations to appoint ministers or deacons who are in same-sex marriages. Commissioners decided by 339 votes to 215 to update Church law to stay in tune with the civil law in Scotland. However, the decision does not overturn the Kirk's traditional view of marriage as a union between aman and awoman. Instead it allows individual congregations to ""opt out"" if they wish to appoint a minister or a deacon who is in a gay marriage. Read more The Queen 'did not approve of same-sex marriage', report claims Donald Trump would 'strongly consider' move to overturn same-sex marriage decision by Supreme Court if elected Catholic Church in Scotland takes to pulpit to resist same-sex unions Church of Scotland 'will collapse within 50 years unless it changes' Neither does itmean church ministers will be able to register same-sex civil partnerships or solemnise same-sex marriages themselves. Following the vote, the Very Rev John Chalmers, principal clerk to the General Assembly, said: ""Today's decision means it will be possible for kirk sessions and congregations to depart from the traditional understanding of marriage to call not only potentially a minister in a civil partnership but one who is in a same-sex marriage. ""In some ways we crossed the Rubicon last year when it was agreed that kirk sessions could call someone in a civil partnership and for many people what today was about was simply tidying up and making the law of the church consistent with Scots law."" Mr Chalmers said a report on the Christian understanding of marriage would be presented to the General Assembly next year. But he made clear it was not inevitable that commissioners would endorse same-sex marriage ceremonies being held in churches, saying each General Assembly was unique and hada mind of its own. After the vote, Mr Chalmers added: ""I hope we have now put this issue to one side and we can now get on with what I believe are important issues - developing our vision for the church, increasing membership and developing our work around mission."" Since 2008, 25 ministers have left because of discussions aboutministers in same-sex relationships. A report into whether gay marriage ceremonies should be allowed in the church has also been commissioned. The Assembly, which opened in Edinburgh on Saturday, was attended by more than 850 commissioners from across Scotland, the rest of the UK, Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK118","Tough action on pneumonia and diarrhoea can save more than one million lives annually - UNICEF","November 14, 2016 Monday","FinancialWire","According to the latest statistics from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), pneumonia and diarrhoea kill some 1.4 million children each year, mostly in middle and low-income countries, despite the fact that these illnesses are largely preventable through straightforward and cost-effective solutions. The findings are part of a report that was released today, One is Too Many: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea in Marrakech while world leaders meet for the UN climate conference known by the shorthand COP22 to discuss the ways in which environmental issues are negatively impacting children's health. ""We have seen clearly that air pollution linked to climate change is damaging the health and development of children by causing pneumonia and other respiratory infections,"" UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Fatoumata Ndiaye said in a news release. Roughly one child dies every 35 seconds from pneumonia, making it the leading infectious killer of children under the age of five. Nearly one million children were its victims in 2015 - more than malaria, tuberculosis, measles, and AIDS combined. According to Ms. Ndiaye, the high rates in part have to do with the fact that some two billion children are living in areas where air pollution exceeds international guidelines. As a result, she says, many are falling ill and dying. ""World leaders meeting at COP22 can help to save children's lives by committing to actions that will reduce air pollution linked to climate change and agreeing to investments in prevention and healthcare,"" she said. Rates of diarrhoea in children are also related to climate change: as precipitation declines in certain areas, the reduced availability of safe water means more children are at risk of contracting diarrhoeal diseases and suffering impaired physical and cognitive growth, if not death. Since 2000, nearly 34 million children have died from pneumonia and diarrhoea. UNICEF estimates that a further 24 million will die by 2030 if further investments are not made in key prevention and treatment options. ""These illnesses have such a disproportionately high impact on child mortality and are relatively inexpensive to treat,"" noted Ms. Ndiaye. ""Yet they continue to receive only a fraction of global health investment which makes absolutely zero sense. That's why we're calling for increased global funding for protective, preventive and treatment interventions that we know will work to save children's lives."" According to the report that was released today, 80 per cent of childhood deaths linked to pneumonia and 70 per cent of those linked to diarrhoea occur during the first two years of life. 62 per cent of children under the age of five live in low and middle income countries but account for 90 per cent of child pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths worldwide. UNICEF urges that funding be targeted towards children's general healthcare as well as for those groups who are particularly vulnerable to pneumonia and diarrhoea - i.e., those under the age of five and living in lower and middle income countries.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK119","-Alstom and Carbone 4 measured the carbon footprint of the tramway versus Bus Rapid Transit systems","November 7, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","Alstom and Carbone 4, a leading consulting company specialised in climate-resilient and low-carbon strategy presented today the results of a study demonstrating that tramways have a smaller footprint than Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems. This occurred in the lead up to COP22 that will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in which Alstom participates. With global urban transport emissions expected to double to nearly 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2025, favouring transport modes with the lowest carbon footprints is crucial. Rail can be a key contributor in the fight to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) and reach the target set at COP21 in 2015 to keep global warming below 2-degreeC. The tram, for example, has been identified as one of the greenest urban transport modes[1] due to its low environmental impact when in operation. The study conducted by Alstom and Carbone 4 compares the carbon footprint of tramways and BRT systems, enabling a better understanding of their comparative performance over the entire lifecycle including construction, operation and maintenance of the two systems. An analysis conducted on a typical 10 km line operated in Belgium demonstrated that for equivalent transport capacity, over a 30-year lifetime, a tramway system emits about half as much CO2 as a BRT system operated with diesel buses, and about 30% less CO2 than a BRT system operated with hybrid buses. Julien Blanc, associate director of Carbone 4, declared ' Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is both a key issue and an exciting challenge. It should be achieved through relevant urban planning, energy efficiency, clean energy and of course modal shift. Tramways are of course part of the solution and these infrastructures will benefit from all the improvements in ' cleaning ' the electricity mix. ' Cecile Texier, Sustainable Development Director at Alstom, said: 'At Alstom, we are constantly working to promote sustainable mobility, striving to reduce the operational cost from energy for the benefit of our customers and committed to reducing the carbon footprint of transport. The survey conducted with Carbone 4 illustrates that rail systems have a lower carbon footprint that other motorised modes. It also shows that optimised system like Attractis, an innovative integrated tramway system that is simpler to operate and cost-effective[2], can significantly reduce CO2 emissions from the construction phase.' Alstom contributes to the visibility of transportation issues and the promotion of sustainable transport in international negotiations on climate change through its support of the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC). Alstom will participate in the PPMC's Transport Day on 13 November at COP22 in Morocco where its Citadis trams have been adopted by Casablanca and Rabat since 2011. In Rabat, up to 120,000 people travel every day aboard the trams, a great success which has led the city to decide to extend the network. Studies[3] have shown that two tramway lines should lead to a CO2 emissions reduction of about 30,000 tonnes per year.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK120","Medina bikes: Africa's first cycle-share scheme launches in Marrakech; With the potential to curb urban congestion, could a successful trial scheme in Morocco act as a launchpad for borrowing bikes across the whole continent?","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 7:00 AM GMT","The Guardian","Moroccans claim you can identify someone as a true Marrakech local if they own a bicycle. The streets of this north African city were once full of ardent cyclists, but in recent decades they've been overtaken by scooters and cars that swarm the city's congested roads. Now, French bike company Smoove, is trying to revive Marrakech's biking culture - and boost sustainable transport - by launching Africa's first fully functioning bike share scheme in the city. The launch coincided with the start of the COP22 climate conference in the city. ""We have made sustainability a part of our constitution,"" says Hakima El Hait\'e9, COP22 host and delegate minister of the environment for the Moroccan government, which is supporting the scheme. ""So now we are implementing."" Along with Marrakech's new fleet of electric buses that were rolled out in July, the bike share is part of the wider scheme to implement green transport in Moroccan cities, she says. Smoove, which has also launched bike shares in Helsinki, Chicago, Moscow, and Vancouver, expanded to Marrakech after winning a tender from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation to start the project. Now its 300 bicycles-called Medina bikes after the city's ancient centre - will transport cyclists between 10 hubs, stationed at sites across the city like the iconic Koutoubia mosque, and the Jardin Majorelle. ""This is providing a modern way of using bicycles again,"" says Laurent Mercat, Smoove's CEO, who started the company in 2008. They're working with a local organisation called Estates Vision to maintain the scheme during its five-year contract, and hope the project will win the support of locals due to Marrakech's history of cycling. ""Forty years ago, there were a lot of people, especially women, cycling in the medina. We have some nice black and white photographs where you see that,"" says Damien Vander Heyden, Smoove's business development manager. But, he says, ""that has disappeared because traffic makes it impossible to cycle safely in some parts of Marrakech."" For the new bike share to survive this altered environment, the city's cycling infrastructure needs some improvement - like the provision of defined cycle lanes on its frequently chaotic roads, Vander Heyden says. ""I think it will work, but only if other public organisations help us create the conditions for this. It's not easy to cycle in Marrakech,"" he concedes. Another challenge is making the bicycles accessible to lower-income locals. Smoove is working to provide different payment options, like cash as well as the credit cards and smartphone apps typically used for bike share schemes, says Mercat. ""We don't want only the wealthy with credit cards to be able to access it,"" says Mercat. But will the price tag - 500 dirhams (\£3109) for an annual pass, 150 for a week, and 50 for a day - nevertheless deter local users? At roughly (EURO)40-45, the yearly fee is more expensive than the bike share system in France, Mercat says, because it's not buoyed by government subsidies. Still, Smoove sees the price as a helpful deterrent against potential vandalism and theft, Vander Heyden explains. And the interest shown by passers-by - who were witnessed routinely stopping to try out the bikes, take selfies, and pick up pamphlets - suggests the cost is not too severe a deterrent. Nezha Alami, a consultant who was at one of the bike stations near the conference venue, said she hoped the scheme would come to her home city of Casablanca in Morocco. ""I use [bike shares] in Paris, Lisbon, Barcelona; it's very practical,"" she says. ""Casablanca needs this kind of project. It's a big city, and it's difficult to travel by car. I think it would have big success there."" Indeed, the Marrakech scheme is the first step for expansion into more Moroccan cities, as well as other African locations, where bike shares could curb urban congestion. Globally, bike share schemes have a patchy record, peppered with theft problems, financial insecurity, and failed uptake. And in the African context the challenges will be unique. In Kenya for instance, where the University of Nairobi recently launched a small-scale pilot bike share on its campus, researchers noted that cycling is associated with poverty - which could be a barrier to adoption. But so far, Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, and Kenya have already expressed interest in Smoove, says Mercat, who will be meeting with African representatives during COP22 to talk about bringing the bikes to their cities. If the five-year trial works in Marrakech, it could be the launching pad for tailor-made schemes cycling across the continent. ""We hope that many African cities will start asking, could biking be adapted to Africa?"" he says.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) launched a joint programme today aimed at the development of private renewable energy markets in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. The SEMED Private Renewable Energy Framework (SPREF), a EUR227.5 million financing framework, was presented during the EU Energy Day at the COP22 international climate conference in Marrakesh. The programme will help the region reduce its heavy dependence on imports of hydrocarbons. It aims to mobilise additional investment from other parties, including the Climate Investment Funds' Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), of up to EUR834 million. Financing will be accompanied by targeted technical cooperation support for the implementation of renewable energy projects in the region that aim to avoid 780,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. SPREF falls under the umbrella of the UfM Regional Dialogue Platform on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, launched today with the aim of promoting the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures in energy generation, transmission, distribution and end use. This platform will foster sustainable socio-economic development, promote job creation, and help ensure that all consumers and industries in the region have access to secure, affordable and reliable energy services. It will also support energy efficient economies and mitigation and adaptation to climate change in Europe and the Mediterranean region. This initiative follows the launch earlier in 2016 of the UfM Regional Electricity Market Platform and the UfM Gas Platform. During the launch the UfM Secretary General, Fathallah Sijilmassi, commented: 'These two major Mediterranean initiatives illustrate UfM's active efforts to achieve deeper regional cooperation and economic integration incorporating a climate dimension, and based on a methodology that can turn our political mandate into concrete projects through multi-partner dialogue in the region.' EBRD Director of Power and Energy Utilities, Nandita Parshard, said: 'The EBRD has placed a priority on climate finance in the southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, where we have invested in 44 green projects worth over EUR1 billion since 2012. Green investments account for roughly one-third of the EBRD's total investments in the region, and we hope that will continue to grow.' The first project under the SPREF programme is the 120 MW Khalladi windfarm near Tangiers, in Morocco, one of the first private renewable energy projects in the country. In order to encourage other private businesses to use the SPREF financing mechanism, a conference will be held tomorrow together with COP22 's Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) committee, the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency Management (AMEE) and the Confederation Generale des entreprises du Maroc (CGEM).

The Kiwis picked up two Fossil of the Day awards from the Climate Action Network (CAN) for countries judged to have done their 'best' to block progress in the talks. CAN, a global network of more than 1,100 non-governmental organisations working to limit human-induced climate change, took New Zealand to task for 'talking a big game on fossil-fuel subsidies at COP22 but failing to live up to its own advice on the home front' and 'supporting dodgy carbon credits'. Other 'winners' over the 12-day event included Turkey, which was lambasted for demanding more funding for climate action under the Paris Agreement - which it has yet to ratify - while planning to open coal-fired plants in regions with water shortages and serious air pollution. Also hauled over the coals, so to speak, was Australia, which used the conference to lobby US energy minister Ernest Moniz to support developing the huge Carmichael coal mine in Queensland. 'Lobbying for coal expansion at the United Nations climate negotiations is an ugly, ugly thing to be doing,' said CAN. 'Shape up, Australia.' ENERGY ON THE SLOPES Waste-to-power incinerator plants are not generally known for the aesthetics of their architecture or the leisure facilities they provide. But a new plant under construction near Copenhagen in Denmark looks set to change that. Its dramatic sloping roof will feature a 440-metre artificial ski-run, one of the longest in the world, in a country noted neither for its hills nor its snowfall. Is wind power missing a trick here?

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK125","-EBRD conference highlights private sector role in tackling climate change in food industry","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","EBRD conference highlights private sector role in tackling climate change in food industry. At COP22 event, Nicholas Stern says agriculture and climate change 'inextricably linked' The private sector must play a key role in addressing climate challenges in the agricultural sector and in helping farmers reduce their own impact on the climate, a conference on the sidelines of the United Nations COP22 climate talks in Marrakesh heard today. At the event staged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) - Food and Climate Change: The Role of the Private Sector - leading climate specialist Nicholas Stern said agricuture and climate change were inextricably linked. He noted that food production methods were already changing as a result of the risks posed by climate change. The private sector was aware that continued profitability of the food and agricultural sector depended on the preservation of environmental resources that were vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The momentum generated by last year's Paris climate agreement and the new Sustainable Development Goals agreed in 2015 presented £ valuable opportunity for private sector agricultural and food actors to take an active role in finding solutions to the common challenges which lie ahead', he said. The EBRD's Managing Director for Economics, Policy and Governance, Mattia Romani, told the conference that the Bank's investments in agribusiness were all in the private sector, supporting the EBRD's drive to make food production more sustainable, improve resource efficiency and reduce waste. The EBRD had observed changes in the way agribusiness companies addressed the global challenge of climate change and environmental issues in general. Clients were seeking to increase competitiveness by being more efficient with water and energy, developing environmentally friendly land-management practices and the promotion of biofertilisers, bioenergy and other eco-products. Such developments could not happen in a political vacuum and support from the public sector was necessary, he said, pointing to remaining gaps in government legislation which had the potential to distort competition both within and between countries. 'Water and energy pricing are important, and so are public policies aimed at making sustainable use of resources, protecting vulnerable resources, creating infrastructure that facilitates adaptation to climate change, and developing appropriate financial mechanisms,' Dr Romani said. The EBRD has been supporting the development of market economies since its creation in 1991 and is now active in 36 countries across three continents - from Mongolia in Central Asia to Morocco on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, from Estonia on the Baltic to Egypt on the Mediterranean. In helping to promote efficient, robust and resilient economies, the EBRD has placed a high priority on ensuring food security and energy efficiency and combating climate change. It has financed close to 600 transactions in the agribusiness sector, exceeding EUR10 billion of cumulative investment. At the same time the Bank is firmly committed to increasing its climate finance. Under its Green Economy Transition approach the EBRD is aiming to scale up its green economy investments from 30 per cent of the total portfolio today to 40 per cent by 2020. 'Part of our success will depend on the private sector's willingness to undertake investments in this area, and agribusinesses are key,' Dr Romani told the conference.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK126","-African Development Bank to leverage climate finance for urban resilience in Africa","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","African Development Bank to leverage climate finance for urban resilience in Africa. Mahamat Assouyouti (AfDB), HE N'cho Vincent (Governor, Abidjan), Saliha Dobardzic (GEF), Alex Mulisa (Fonerwa, Rwanda), Kurt Lonsway (AfDB), Meggan Spires (ICLEI), James Kinyangi (ClimDev, AfDB), Robert Kehew (Un-Habitat) The UN climate talks entered their second week in Marrakech, with Ministers and delegates discussing the progress made since Paris. The African Development Bank and its partners are hosting the Africa Pavilion, which provides a space to address issues affecting the continent. Events kicked Monday with a discussion of urban resilience. The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on Monday, November 14 reiterated their commitment to support African cities, which are being impacted by the effects of climate change, and to build resilience. The two institutions delivered this message at a joint event on 'Leveraging climate finance for urban resilience in Africa' at COP22 in Marrakech. The two organisations pledged to redouble their efforts towards meeting the cost of climate change adaptation, which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) projects to be in the range of US $ 28-67 billion per year by 2030. The event took place at the Africa Pavilion - an area dedicated entirely to the continent where climate change issues specific to Africa will be showcased. The AfDB, the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the African Union and NEPAD are hosting the Africa Pavilion at COP22 . The Pavilion provides the space for the Bank and its partners to showcase innovative initiatives and actions aimed at achieving the objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement. The Pavilion also serves as the hub of African networking, through debate, information exchange, exhibitions and formal and informal meetings. . Amadou Hott, AfDB Vice-President, Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, said, 'The AfDB is committed to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and support African countries to access funding from all partners including the GEF to meet their ambitions set in the National Determined Contributions (NDCs).' He stressed that the Paris Agreement recognizes the major role that urban centres have to play in tackling change, adding that cities are now home to over half of the global population. Hott emphasised that, in Africa, urbanisation would increase exponentially over the coming decades, a development that has profound implications in the face of climate change, creating vulnerabilities to external shocks, including economic and climatic. He stressed that cities will need more capacity to absorb and recover from climatic shocks and stresses, but lamented that the expansion of cities is at the expense of forests and other natural environments or ecosystems, and comes with increase in pollution, and related diseases. He listed the Bank's 'High Five' priorities for Africa: Light up and power Africa; Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; Integrate Africa; and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. 'To deliver on these priorities, the AfDB is working with the global climate funds including the GEF to assist African countries effectively adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. The Bank has mobilised funds from GEF's Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) resources to address these increasing climatic threats, but this is only a small percentage of what is required. I am convinced that the GEF and AfDB partnership will deliver a new perspective of urban resilience in Africa.' 'The GEF commits to work more closely with African countries through the AfDB, our partner,' said Naoko Ishii, CEO of the GEF. According to Ishii, cities are important as they are a frontrunner in the fight against climate change. She pointed out that 80% of GDP is generated in cities, so it is important to assess how cities can best fight against climate change. GEF also supports the Sustainable City Programme, which the AfDB is implementing in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, said Ishii. Cities can be designed to be more compact, to reduce the impact of flooding for instance, she said, adding that cities' infrastructure can also be retrofitted to increase their resilience. 'What can institutions like the GEF and other international development institutions do? We can help by supporting policy and institutional reforms in cities, including building knowledge platforms of best practices, and enabling international cooperation,' Ishii observed. The GEF can also provide guarantees or other instruments designed to de-risk investment, and thereby help improve access to capital markets, and catalyse private investment for African cities. Moderated by Kurt Lonsway, AfDB Manager, Environment and Climate Change Division, the panel discussion session featured panelists addressing key questions related to urban adaptation and resilience, including securing financing and creating synergies between urban development objectives, innovative finance, partnerships and initiatives. The highlight of the Africa Pavilion will be Africa Day, the day when the continent will be in the spotlight at the COP22 meetings. Africa Day, which takes place on Wednesday, November 16, will be attended by Heads of State, African and global leaders, and a broad range of stakeholders and partners to give political momentum to Africa's needs to implement its commitments.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK127","All countries should see air pollution in Delhi as 'wake-up call' - UNICEF","November 11, 2016 Friday","M2 PressWIRE","November 10, 2016 Amid reports that air pollution in India's capital, Delhi, has hit record highs over the past week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has called on all countries to pay attention this emblematic case and take decisive actions to tackle the issue. ""With every breath, children in Delhi are suffering,"" said UNICEF in a news release today, pointing to reports that air pollution in one of its neighbourhoods hit 999 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter (compared to an average of between 150-350 in January 2016). ""Delhi is a wake-up call to the world on air pollution. It is a wake-up call to all countries and cities where air pollution levels have resulted in death and illness amongst children,"" it added, stressing: ""Unless decisive actions are taken to reduce air pollution, the events we are witnessing in Delhi over the past week are likely to be increasingly common."" According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), there is a close, quantitative relationship between exposure to high concentrations of small particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) and increased mortality or morbidity, both daily and over time. This type of pollution has health impacts even at very low concentrations and no threshold has been identified below which no damage to health is observed. On the air pollution in Delhi, UNICEF said that an estimated 4.41 million children in the city missed three days of school, earlier this week, following a decision to close its 5,798 schools to minimize the risk for children to be exposed to the polluted air. Air pollution challenge not unique to Delhi It further said that this is not just challenge in Indian capital, numerous other cities in the country, such as Varanasi and Lucknow, as well as elsewhere in the world such as London, Beijing, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Manila have exceeded international guidelines - in some cases by considerable margin. In Lagos, Nigeria, workers at a sawmill in Ebute-Metta district walk by burning garbage and sawdust that is later sold as charcoal. Photo: UNICEF/Tanya Bindra Recent analysis by the agency has shown that, globally, 300 million children live in areas with the most toxic levels of outdoor air pollution - exceeding six times international guidelines. Highlighting that air pollution is a major contributing factor to some of the most deadly diseases children face, such as pneumonia, UNICEF cautioned that the pollution also affects their overall health. Almost a million children under the age of five die from pneumonia per year - and about half of those cases are directly linked with air pollution. ""Studies show it is linked with and can exacerbate asthma, bronchitis, airway inflammation, coughing and wheezing. Illness associated with air pollution can affect children's ability to go to school,"" the agency said, adding: ""New research even points to the effects it can have on cognitive development amongst very young children."" Those without access to medical treatment, who are often the poorest, and those who have pre-existing respiratory conditions, are most at risk. Much can be done to improve the situation Further in its release today, UNICEF said that stronger measures to cut back on the sources of air pollution. ""Air pollution moves across borders, both national ones as well as subnational ones, and so we will need coherent government policies to address these transboundary risks,"" it noted. Also, providing children with access to good quality healthcare is a major part of protecting them from air pollution, and treatment and prevention programmes for pneumonia, as well as other respiratory conditions, can significantly reduce the chance a child falls sick or dies. UNICEF also called for better monitoring of air pollution at a global scale. ""When a child, a mother, a father or caregiver know how bad the air is on a real-time basis, they can begin to take actions to reduce exposure,"" it stressed and urging pregnant mothers, and others who are at especially high risk to do their best to avoid areas where air pollution is at its highest. Public knowledge on air pollution is a key first step to tackling it - it is key to supporting government policies to reduce it, the agency stressed. COP22 is an important platform for action Reminding that this week is also the first week of twenty-second Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), popularly known as COP 22 , UNICEF said: ""Actions that reduce air pollution can not only improve children's health, but can also go a long way to also reducing greenhouse gas emissions."" ""As such, the argument for reducing air pollution could not be clearer. And because we can - we must,"" underscored the agency. \"

""Saudi Arabia is quickly emerging as a regional leader in sustainability,"" said Yousef Al-Benyan, SABIC Vice Chairman and CEO, who is leading the company's delegation. ""At SABIC, we are proud that some of our most important initiatives have helped progress on this journey, including the Home of InnovationTM, which is promoting sustainable downstream development, and the world's largest CO2 utilization plant."" ""Examples such as these not only prove that Saudi Arabia places a great importance on sustainable development, but also that we have been working hard for many years to put practical solutions in place. This is 'Chemistry that MattersTM' to the long-term health of our society."" The SABIC delegation is attending Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Masdar City on ""Global Action Day"", January 16, and the ""World Future Energy Summit"" from January 17 to 19. ADSW is a global platform to address the interconnected challenges that affect the widespread acceleration and adoption of sustainable development and clean energy. The Saudi delegation is building on the Gulf Cooperation Council's highly successful participation in the United Nations' Conference of Parties ( COP22 ), held in Morocco in November. Saudi Arabia is a ""country of focus"" for the event because of its emerging regional sustainability leadership role as highlighted in the Saudi Vision 2030 and its advances in renewable energy. On January 17, Saudi delegates will highlight the country's major initiatives during two panel discussions. Fahad Al-Sherehy, Leader, SABIC T&I, will represent the company during the panel entitled ""Transforming the Energy Sector in Saudi Arabia to Enable Vision 2030."" Sustainable SABIC initiatives showcased at the event include the Home of InnovationTM, a project to foster downstream development through collaboration and innovation. The facility includes a demonstration house, designed to achieve net-zero energy in the demanding climatic conditions of Saudi Arabia. SABIC achieved this efficiency by integrating innovative solutions in collaboration with industry-leading partners. The home has over 200 advanced systems, materials, and products, including many that reduce energy and water use. If all homes in Saudi Arabia were as efficient as the Demonstration House it would reduce CO2 emissions by the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants. SABIC has also built the world's largest CO2 capture and utilization plant at its manufacturing affiliate United in Jubail. The plant is designed to capture up to 500,000 tons of CO2 from the production of ethylene glycol annually, before purifying and distributing it to a network of affiliates to produce valuable products such as fertilizers. The project reduces emissions while increasing efficiency and lowering costs. Featuring prominently at the conference are SABIC's qualified sustainability solutions, which create less CO2 emissions than traditional materials during production or save more in other lifecycle phases. They include a wide range of solutions for use in transportation, construction, medical devices, electrical and electronics, clean energy, packaging, and agri-nutrients. These solutions pass suitability benefits to customers by enabling the creation of productions that are lighter, stronger, thinner, more durable, better insulated, or more easily manufactured. Last year, SABIC's manufacturing operations utilized 3.3 million tons of CO2. The company is on target to meet ambitious targets to reduce green-house gas, energy, and water intensities by 25 percent, and material loss intensity by 50 percent by 2025-from levels in 2010. Al-Benyan said: ""Sustainability is helping SABIC to emerge as a global leader in the petrochemicals industry. Embedding sustainable practices in our global operations has resulted in many benefits such as energy savings, improved resource efficiency, technological innovation and cost savings.""

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK133","Past five years hottest on record, says UN weather agency","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","M2 PressWIRE","November 8, 2016 In a new detailed analysis of the global climate between 2011 and 2015 - the hottest 5-year period on record - the United Nations weather agency has found an increasingly visible human footprint on extreme weather and climate events with dangerous and costly impacts. The record temperatures were accompanied by rising sea levels and declines in Arctic sea-ice extent, continental glaciers and northern hemisphere snow cover, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in a news release today. ""This report confirms that the average temperature in 2015 had already reached the 1 degree-Celsius mark. We just had the hottest five-year period on record, with 2015 claiming the title of hottest individual year,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a news release announcing the report. ""Even that record is likely to be beaten in 2016,"" he added, recalling that the Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degree-Celsius. Even the 2015's record of hottest year likely to be beaten in 2016. WMO Secretary-General Taalas Further in the report, WMO, the UN system's authoritative voice on the state and behaviour of the Earth's atmosphere, also highlighted some of the high-impact climate events. These included the east African drought (2010-2012) that caused an estimated 258,000 deaths; the southern African drought (2013-2015); South-East Asia floods (2011) that killed 800 people and caused more than $ 40 billion in economic losses; heatwaves in India and Pakistan (2015) that claimed more than 4,100 lives; Hurricane Sandy (2012) which resulted $ 67 billion in economic losses in the United States; and Typhoon Haiyan (2013) which killed 7,800 people in the Philippines. According to the agency, the five-year timescale allows for a better understanding of multi-year warming trends and extreme events such as prolonged droughts and recurrent heatwaves than an annual report. The report further examined whether human-induced climate change was directly linked to individual extreme events. Many individual extreme weather and climate events recorded during 2011-2015 were made more likely as a result of human-induced climate change, WMO said. In the case of some extreme high temperatures, the probability increased by a factor of ten or more. The WMO report was submitted to the Twenty-second Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP 22 , meeting Marrakech. The agency added that will release its provisional assessment of the state of the climate in 2016 on 14 November to support the discussions at COP22 . Further in the news release, temperatures for the 2011-2015 period were 0.57 degree-Celsius (1.03 degree-Fahrenheit) above the average for the standard 1961-1990 reference period. The warmest year on record to date was 2015, with temperatures 0.76 degree-Celsius (1.37 degree-Fahrenheit) above the reference period. Additionally global ocean temperatures also rose at unprecedented levels and sea-surface temperatures for the period were above average in most of the world, except in some parts of the Antarctic Ocean and the eastern South Pacific Ocean. The period also saw a decline in the Arctic sea ice coverage. Averaged over 2011-2015, the mean Arctic sea-ice fell 28 per-cent below the 1981-2010 average. The minimum summer sea-ice extent of 3.39 million square-kilometres in 2012 was the lowest on record. By contrast, for much of the period 2011- 2015, the Antarctic sea-ice extent was above the 1981-2010 mean value, particularly for the winter maximum. Surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet also continued at above-average levels and mountain glaciers also continued their decline. Northern hemisphere snow cover extent was well below average in all five years and in all months from May to August, continuing a strong downward trend, said WMO. Rising sea levels Referring to studies, WMO said that the contribution of continental ice sheets, particularly in Greenland and west Antarctica, to sea-level rise is accelerating. It noted on satellite record (from 1993 to present), sea levels have risen approximately 3 mm per year, based on tide gauges, compared to the average 1900-2010 trend of 1.7 mm per year. ""As the oceans warm, they expand, resulting in both global and regional sea-level rise,"" the agency explained, adding that increased ocean heat content accounts for about 40 per cent of the observed global sea-level increase over the past 60 years. Extreme Weather The news release also mentions some examples of ""extreme weather"" which include record high seasonal and annual temperatures in the United States in 2012 and in Australia in 2013, hot summers in eastern Asia and western Europe in 2013, heatwaves in spring and autumn 2014 in Australia, record annual warmth in Europe in 2014, and a heatwave in Argentina in December 2013. Pointing to a study of a 2014 drought in south-eastern Brazil that found that similar rainfall deficits had occurred on three other occasions since 1940, the agency said that the impacts in 2014 were, however, exacerbated by a substantial increase in the demand for water, due to population growth. Such impacts show an increased link to human vulnerability, noted WMO. \"

For the first time, the Conference of Parties is being held in Africa and Morocco has positioned itself as an advocate for the continent, highlighting agriculture and farmers as a key topic. Farmers in low income countries around the world are among the least responsible for climate change but have been bearing the brunt of it, a key concern for Fairtrade. As delegates will know, many farmers are already at the sharp end of the impacts of climate change and time is running out. As the UN's climate summit approaches its final talks, Fairtrade urges the international community to act. Farmers in India are doing what they can to mitigate the effects of climate change but they can't do it alone, and they are still losing their crops. In this film, Farmer Benny Mathew, says: ""Climate change is the biggest problem faced by farmers in Kerala today. Farming in this region has been badly hit."" Fairtrade farmers' organisation Manucardu Social Service Society (MASS), has echoed Benny's concerns. Bijumon Kurian, president of MASS who represents these farmers, writes: ""In the western Ghats of Kerala, the hamlet of Keezhanthoor has been producing specialty Arabica coffee for the past 25 years. This beautiful hilltop is a biodiversity hotspot. There are around 200 farmers living in this village who depend on growing coffee and vegetables for their living. They work hard to make sure their coffee meets the organic and Fairtrade sustainability standards and in doing so have been able to get better prices and access to markets, as well as improving soil fertility, which mitigates in many ways against the impact of climate change. It has made them more aware of the harmful effects of deforestation, as previously they cut shade trees for fuel. Since becoming part of MASS, they have understood the need to protect the rainforest and followed training on organic farming. But still, on the edge of the forest many people outside of MASS continue to use dangerous chemicals. While methods like harvesting rain help to protect the environment, the lack of rain this year has been a significant problem. These villagers, who are entirely dependent on rain, haven't had any for the past three months. They have lost 30% of their coffee crops as the plants dry up or die. In addition, the vegetable crops that they grow for food are not ripening. And the crops that survived have been damaged by elephants who are venturing out of the forest in search of water. Related: Negotiation with workers bears fruit in Ghanaian banana-producing community In the past, the farmers cultivated paddy but because of climate change now this is not viable, as the process of cultivation takes 120 days and timely rain is critical. Also vegetable cultivation which thrived in the earlier cool climate has been affected. Vegetables and spices depend on seasonal October rain for blooming and pollination. If they don't receive rain, vegetables do not flower and in the cases of spices, the berries wither or yield immature berries. Farmers depend on coffee for their income. Now their livelihoods are threatened, and they have to spend what little money they have on buying food from the market because their vegetable crops have failed. There is not enough left to pay for their children's education. And education isn't easy to come by for many of our rural communities. Before Fairtrade was established four years ago in this village, they didn't have a primary school, and still the children have to travel to neighbouring towns for secondary education, which they can only afford because of the Fairtrade Premium that pays for their transport . The village also struggled to make a decent living from coffee back then, as traders took advantage and refused to pay competitive prices or even the market price. These traders monopolised the market by acting as loan sharks, advancing farmers so they could pay for their day-to-day needs but on high interest, which then forced the farmers to sell on terms they dictated. Farmers have worked hard to follow MASS training, adapting their techniques for organic methods, including water harvesting and multi-cropping. This has given them a better income and helps protect the biodiversity of their home. But nearby plantations use chemical farming methods, which is causing pollution at a time when they are struggling to cope with ongoing drought. They want more support for organic farming, even subsidies, and banning of chemicals from nearby farms. More needs to be done to reduce environmental pollution in general. World leaders should make a consistent and collective effort in tackling climate change by reducing carbon emissions through stringent laws. Environmental audits should be mandatory for all industries. They should nurture research on efficient bio-fuels, biofertilisers and biopesticides and thereby craft a green revolution."" It is time businesses scaled up their efforts to help smallholder farmers in supply chains access the finance they need to become more resilient and adapt their farming methods. For as the experiences of Indian farmers show, we need to invest more in sustainable agriculture and we need to do it now. Find out more about Fairtrade's Climate Standard.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK144","Taxing way to tackle climate change","November 1, 2016 Tuesday","Scotsman","Two famed Scots have informed an economic solution to the problem of how to prevent catastrophic climate change. Research published today suggests that a decades-old tax system would permit a balance to be struck between the conflicting needs of limiting the impact of man-made greenhouse gas emissions and supporting the economy. The idea re-emerges ahead of the COP22 climate change talks this week in Morocco, at which delegates will seek to enforce targets to limit global temperature rise to 2C. The study draws on the work of Scottish scientist James Croll and philosopher and economist Adam Smith. Croll was a 19th-century scientist from Perthshire and the first person to identify positive feedbacks in the earth system - explaining how ""in regard to ... climate, cause and effect mutually react so as to strengthen each other"". Fifer Adam Smith developed ideas on supply and demand and free trade. The research - incorporating Croll's feedbacks and Smith's economics - shows that without emphatic change to current climate-economic policies, temperatures are likely to continue to rise strongly this century.But an adjustment to the levy system, devised by English economist Arthur Pigou in the 1920s, offers a viable way forward. The key adjustment is for all revenues from a carbon tax to be recycled directly to households. Such a ""feebate""has been successful in British Columbia. Sellers respond either by lowering costs, or striving to improve production methods, so creating novel, cleaner tech. Buyers respond by reducing carbon consumption. Householders create growth in nascent economic sectors when spending their new carbon allowance. Society needs to counter climate change. Pigouvian economics would encourage change in behaviour of both people and companies.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK145","From biogas to carbon credits, Fairtrade helps farmers cope with climate change; Fairtrade's Climate Standard and Carbon Credits scheme help farmers reduce thei....","November 4, 2016 Friday 11:29 AM GMT","The Guardian","It is almost a year since the Paris agreement was made by world leaders to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial temperatures. With 2015 marking the hottest year since records began and disasters from floods, droughts, storms and pests occurring more frequently, this year's United Nations conference on climate change, COP22 , is likely to see campaigners pushing for further action and investment. This is particularly necessary for the millions of farmers around the world who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and who are among the worst affected. For example, over recent years coffee farmers have seen crops wiped out by pests and diseases caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon. And a recent report from the Climate Institute and Fairtrade Australia (pdf) warned that 50% of the world's current coffee producing land will disappear by 2050 as temperatures rise, affecting the quality and ultimately threatening the very survival of the plant. Many countries which depend on coffee exports as a main plank of the economy are also among the most vulnerable to climate risk. Prime coffee origins such as Honduras, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and Guatemala rank in the top 10 for climate-related damages since the 1990s. On top of this, because farmers continue to receive low prices for their coffee they are not able to invest in training, tools or other interventions to lessen the impacts of climate change. But by changing the way they farm there are ways to mitigate against some of these problems. Fairtrade has been working with farmers to reduce carbon emissions and become more resilient to the impacts of climate change, through projects run under its Fairtrade Climate Standard and Fairtrade Carbon Credits scheme, developed in partnership with the internationally recognised Gold Standard. These projects, which can be as simple as planting new trees or switching to renewable energy sources, are enabling communities to have a positive impact on the environment and helping them to withstand future shocks. By reducing their own emissions farmers can also generate ""carbon credits"" that can be sold to companies and raise further capital for investment in sustainable agriculture. One project to support farmers, with funding from the Big Lottery, has seen a Kenyan farming community benefit from ""green energy"" biogas cook stoves for their homes, which reduce people's exposure to smoke and the time they spend collecting firewood. It saves significant costs too, as it is powered by cow dung and creates byproducts which can be used as organic fertiliser on the farm. Zeddy Rotich, a coffee farmer who is benefiting from this project, said: ""I used to wake up early in the morning and fetch firewood first. So my children would get to school late, and I would also go to my coffee farm late, but now, with the use of the stove, my children get to school very early in the morning and I also go to my coffee farm very early in the morning, because the stove is very efficient. It is cost-free, it is hygienic, and it has got very many advantages over the other old method of cooking using firewood. ""Through Fairtrade we have received training on climate change and we are taking action. However, we still need more support on training, because we need to train other people who are not aware about climate change. We also need more tree nursery beds, so that we can plant more trees as a way of tackling climate change. We also need more biogas stoves, especially in the community, so that each and every member will be using stove. That one will help prevent cutting more trees and it will preserve the environment."" It is time businesses scaled up their efforts to help smallholder farmers in supply chains access the finance they need to become more resilient and adapt their farming methods - at Fairtrade we hope this year's COP22 in November provides the impetus to make this a reality.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK151","Coal power - High efficiency low emissions technology in China, Europe, Japan and the United States.","April 1, 2017","Modern Power System","The average efficiency of coal-fired power generation units in the major coal-using countries varies enormously, from under 30% to over 47% (LHV, net), which makes a huge difference to emissions of various pollutants and CO2/MWh. Efficiency is influenced by many factors, but the steam cycle conditions have a major impact on plant performance. There are also differences in the deployment of control technologies for major pollutants (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and particulate matter), and consequent emission levels. As well as pledging to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions following the United Nations climate change conference (COP21) in Paris (December 2015), many nations are tightening their other emission standards. Thus, coal-fired power plant fleets must continue to become more efficient and less carbon intensive. Deployment of high efficiency, low emissions (HELE) technologies reduces power plant CO2 intensity as indicated in Table 1. HELE plants operate at supercritical (SC) and ultrasupercritical (USC) conditions, although definitions of supercritical and ultrasupercritical conditions vary. The following temperature and steam ranges are used frequently: [s20]22.1 MPa and up to 560degsC for subcritical steam conditions; 22.1-25 MPa/540-580degsC for supercritical; and [s19]25 MPa/[s19]580degsC, for ultrasupercritical. Although supercritical and ultrasupercritical technologies have been available for a few decades, in 2011 only about 50% of new coal-fired power plants built were ultrasupercritical. Around 75% of operating units worldwide used subcritical non-HELE technology, and more than half of the capacity was over 25 years old and consisted of units smaller than 300 MW capacity. Obviously, all countries and regions have different histories, circumstances, economies and needs in terms of power generation and demand as well as different drivers and barriers for the implementation of technologies. Therefore, there are vast differences in countries' coal-fired fleets. China, Japan, the EU and the USA have the world's strictest emission limits for coal-fired power plants. Their coal-fired power fleets have been analysed by the IEA Clean Coal Centre in terms of deployed technology and pollution control systems. Emissions standards and other drivers and barriers impact on the deployment of high efficiency low emissions plant. China The Chinese energy sector has recently undergone a huge transformation. The coal-fired fleet has an average operational efficiency of 38.6% (LHV), higher than the average of that across the IEA member countries. China is an exporter of advanced technologies and continues to invest in research & development. For example, the double-reheat 1000 MW ultrasupercritical (USC) Guodian Taizhou II unit 3, in operation since September 2015, was domestically designed, manufactured and built. It has reached an efficiency of 47.82% (net, LHV), the highest globally for a double-reheat coal-fired power plant. Emissions are low: particulate matter (PM), 2.3 mg/m3; sulphur dioxide, 15 mg/m3; and nitrogen oxides, 31 mg/m3. Every Chinese power plant is equipped with particulates and SO2 control equipment, and almost all have NOx removal devices. By 2020, all coal-fired plants will have to be ultra-low emission. Strong policies, tight environmental and performance standards and their rapid implementation, combined with available finance for coal-fired projects as well as subsidies for power generated from ultra-low emission plants, are the main drivers for the implementation of advanced clean coal technologies in China. There are also several barriers to building new coal-fired units in China such as overcapacity, competition for limited water resources in some areas, localised pollution control, and the rapid development of renewable energy resources, which can reduce the profitability of coal-fired power plants. EU Across the EU, the prospects for coal-fired power generation vary greatly. Some countries, such as the UK and Germany, have pledged to reduce or phase out coal-fired power plants. Others, particularly Poland, will continue to rely on coal. A few new coal-fired plants are being planned and built. The average coal-fired power plant efficiency is 38% (LHV, net) and a significant proportion of the fleet is relatively old. One of the most advanced coal-fired plants is the 1100 MW USC Maasvlakte Power Plant 3 in the Netherlands. It has an efficiency of 47% (net, LHV), can cofire up to 30% biomass, is carbon capture ready and can supply district heat. Its average emission levels are: SO2, 5-25 mg/m3; NOx, 60-65 mg/m3; and PM, 1-2 mg/m3. In the EU, pollution control systems for NOx, SO2 and PM are widely deployed. The EU has ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 40% by 2030 and 80-95% by 2050 relative to 1990. This would require all coal-fired power plants wishing to operate after 2030 to have carbon capture and storage (CCS) in place. However, progress on CCS is slow, partly due to a low carbon price under the EU Emissions Trading System. The low price of carbon is a barrier to building new coal-fired plants with CCS. Japan The Japanese coal fleet is modern, relatively young and has the highest average efficiency (41.6% LHV, net) in the world. Most of the Japanese fleet are HELE plants. For example, Isogo unit 2 has average emissions in single digits for NOx and SO2 and [s20]5 mg/m3 for PM. It is considered to be the world's cleanest coal-fired power plant in terms of emissions intensity. Japan plans to build more HELE coal-fired power plant and supports the use of HELE technologies around the world, so that energy access and a secure supply can be ensured in developing countries. USA The USA coal fleet is dominated by relatively old units, both subcritical and supercritical, so its average efficiency is only around 37.4% (LHV, net). The most efficient coal-fired unit is the 665 MW John Turk Jr plant which achieves an efficiency of 42% net (LHV) and is the only USC unit in the USA. There are currently no new coal-fired power plants being planned or built. Regulations have been a clear driver for the implementation of advanced clean coal technologies and pollution control systems for NOx, SOx and PM are widely deployed. The USA leads the way in emission standards for toxics, especially mercury, and so has become the leader in mercury specific control technologies. The low price of natural gas and decreasing cost of renewables are the main barriers to building coal-fired plant and although the new administration has been vocal in its support of coal, it is not clear if or how this support would manifest as new coal-fired plant. There are various CCS projects under way and R&D on AUSC, hybrid coal and renewable systems as well as oxycombustion and chemical looping combustion. As coal is predicted to retain a significant place in the future energy mix of the USA (21% of power in 2030 and 18% in 2040) it is possible that once new technologies are demonstrated, old coal-fired units could be replaced with new systems. Additionally, with a market for CO2 in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), relevant R&D, tax incentives and federal support for carbon capture, utilisation and storage, the USA is currently a leader in these areas. Significant share There is uncertainty regarding the future of coal-fired plants across China, the EU, Japan and the USA. Although, the role of coal in their energy mixes is changing, coal is still predicted to have a significant share in the future, particularly in Asia. Coal-fired plants continue to become more efficient and less polluting and there is strong R&D in many regions ongoing on new technologies such as AUSC, coal and renewable hybrid system and CCS.

The conference, COP22 , is being held just days after the Paris Climate Agreement entered into force and aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change. The University forms part of the British presence, organised by the Department for International Trade (DIT), and will present in the UK Green is GREAT Pavilion at 10am on Monday 14 November. Former Deputy Prime Minster Lord John Prescott, European negotiator for the Kyoto climate change agreement and Fellow of the University's Logistics Institute, will join Professor Amar Ramudhin, Executive Director of the Institute, and David Wells, Business Development Manager (Energy and Environment), as part of the University delegation. Prof Ramudhin said: 'In the light of recent events such as Brexit and the US election, it is crucial that we commit to sharing our expertise in sustainable logistics and offshore wind energy, to help developing nations cut their emissions.' 'We are delighted that the Humber is leading the way in renewable energy. We have three of the world's largest wind farms on our doorstep and companies such as Centrica, Siemens, Res Offshore, E.ON and Dong Energy are already established in our region. Siemens is operating a blade assembly plant for wind turbines upwards of 6MW.' The Humber region has invested more than GBP7.6bn in off-shore wind energy and is fast-becoming a global leader in renewable energy. Providing expertise in research, development and innovation, the University of Hull has been collaborating with GreenPort Hull, Siemens and others, to train highly qualified professionals in the area and to undertake supply chain research to drive down the cost of renewable energy. The University, which has been also been working with Universiapolis, the International University of Agadir in Morocco or a year, will present on the collaboration for carbon reduction using renewable energy. The discussion at the conference will focus on how developed countries could work with emerging countries to help them develop a move away from a carbon intensive economy. The University will present on its research and partnerships at the conference which is attended by a high-profile audience of senior policy makers, government officials, businesses, scientists and academics - all focusing on global solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Morocco conference aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the temperature rise this century significantly below two degrees Celsius. David Wells said: 'Helping developing countries cut emissions is a focus of global concern. At the University, we are building on our existing research expertise and collaborating with academic colleagues around the world to tackle this important issue.' 'Morocco is already investing heavily in renewables. It has opened a solar farm, and like the Humber, is investing in wind technology. We have been working with the Universiapolis for more than a year addressing carbon emissions in agriculture. Our other work within the renewables sector includes our specialisation in offshore wind, impact assessment of large scale renewable energy developments and helping the industry develop health and safety standards.' 'Studying the feasibility of such systems and devising an incentive framework will position Morocco as a leader in this area and is in line with the government's strategy when it comes to renewable energy.' Dr Aziz Bouslikhane, President of Universiapolis, said: 'Our university has always tried to contribute proactively to the strategic initiatives of our country. Morocco has prioritised the environment in the development of a sustainable green economy. It is making its place in the international community as evidenced by the hosting the COP22 conference in Marrakesh. Our collaboration with the University of Hull is a step in this direction.' The Logistics Institute at the University of Hull is internationally recognised for research into supply chain operations, retail and management. In addition to its work on renewables, the Institute is working in conjunction with the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on the Future of Logistics and Supply Chains, to produce an innovative report on the impact of the Internet of Things(IoT). The University of Hull is ranked in the top 3% in the world by the Times Higher World University Rankings.

The higher quality the data, the more targeted and effective the action. These actions will be critical to meeting global climate commitments. With the successful ratification of the Paris Agreement, much of the discussion at COP22 in Marrakech, starting this week, will focus on implementation. The action will mostly take place within the energy sector, responsible for two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions and 80% of CO2 emissions. Thankfully promoting sustainable development and combating climate change have become integral aspects of energy planning, analysis and policy making within IEA member countries and beyond. Such policy actions must be based on accurate data. For years, the IEA has been working with countries around the world to improve their reporting of energy data resulting in more accurate estimations of CO2 emissions. The IEA\' s annual CO2 emissions from fuel combustion provides over forty years of data from more than 150 countries and regions worldwide \- the most comprehensive estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion across the world and across the sectors of the global economy. This information has allowed the IEA to show that global greenhouse gas emissions are starting to decouple from economic growth. In other words, while economies are growing and standards of living are improving, CO2 emissions are growing at a relatively slower pace. China and the United states, in particular, have seen reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases due to a variety of factors, including a switch from coal to natural gas for power generation and increasing energy efficiency. \"

But at the edge of the desert, giant nets are catching water droplets from the air, bringing drinking water to the people in an arid mountainous region in Morocco. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The project is the largest in the world using 'fog catcher' nets to harvest moisture, easing water pressure from intense droughts which have caused already limited stores of groundwater to dwindle. Scroll down for video By using 600 square metres (1,968 square feet) of netting in the mountains near Ait Baamrane, the project is providing drinking water to more than 400 people in five villages. Catching fog has proved successful in arid regions around the world for a number of years. In Chile, residents on the edge of the high altitude Atacama Desert - the driest place on Earth - have successfully used the system to irrigate their crops. More recently, a system of fog catchers has been installed in Limpopo province in South Africa, helping to bring drinking water to villagers. HARVESTING FOG\~ The project relies\~on the abundant fog which is carried into the mountains by ocean winds for six months of the year. As the fog hits the 600 sq metres (1,968 sq ft) of nets at an altitude of 1,225 metres (4,020 ft) above sea level, it condenses, with the water droplets collecting at the bottom of the net and flowing through piping. Filtered water is stored in reservoirs which can hold a total of 539,000 litres (118,563 gallons).\~ Since launching in March 2005, the fog-catcher system captures an average of 6,300 litres (1,660 gallons)\~per day.\~ While all of these arid regions are lacking in water, air currents can bring waves of condensed moisture to the surrounding mountains in the form of fog. The Moroccan project, set up by local non-governmental organisation Dar Si Hmad, has spent 10 years researching and developing the infrastructure and years of testing. Since launching in March 2005, the fog-catcher system captures an average of 6,300 litres (1,660 gallons) per day.

As the fog hits the nets at an altitude of 1,225 metres (4,020 ft) above sea level, it condenses, with the water droplets collecting at the bottom of the net and flowing through piping. CLIMATE CHANGE SUCCESS\~ The Moroccan project has been so successful that it has been awarded the UN's Momentum For Change award, which highlights efforts underway to tackle climate change and implement sustainable technologies. Dar Si Hmad has been presenting the project at the UN's climate change conference in Marrakesh this week, COP22 . \~ It then flows through thousands of metres of piping to villages, delivering clean drinking water into homes. According to Dar Si Hmad, the villages in the region are mainly made up of women and children, as men migrated to urban regions to find work.\~ Water pressure in the arid region has increased since the 1980s as waves of drought have hit the villagers. Speaking to CNN, director of\~Dar Si Hmad,\~Jamila Bargach, said: 'Before we installed the nets, [villagers] had to walk three hours a day to go to distant, depleted wells, which is what people still do every day in the region where we don't operate.'

Some 28 people, including University staff, pre-university students and members of Bedfordshire Climate Change Forum and the United Nations Association took part in the event at the Bedford campus. Model UN conferences are a role-play of UN meetings. Participants are assigned a UN Member State, research their country's position on a selected topic then come together and enact the meeting, based on agreed rules of procedure. A resolution is written, debated, negotiated and amended, in line with each country's interests. Delegates at Bedfordshire's World Climate Negotiation event were tasked to agree and commit to targets to reduce carbon emissions. Dr Diana Pritchard, from the University's Centre of Learning Excellence, said: 'Teaching climate change presents a huge challenge. It is a complex issue and can seem abstract and, because it is scary, makes people feel overwhelmed or hopeless. 'This sort of event is a fun and interactive approach to learning about the world climate system and it increases motivation to change, get involved and influence policy making. Students get to practise debating, team work and leadership skills.' Working in groups, participants were guided to formulate their negotiating strategy and talk to other teams to negotiate the best possible outcome that would keep global temperatures within the 2 deg C threshold (above pre-industrial levels). This temperature increase has been defined by nations as being an acceptable level beyond which the risks for catastrophic and irreversible impacts are too high, said Dr Pritchard. The University used state-of-the-art computer software developed by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to analyse the results of the mock negotiations. Dr Pritchard said: 'The software, which is based on current climate change science, is so good that it is used in many countries by decision makers and real official negotiators. It really brought home the dangers. 'The event was particularly special because of the rich mix of participants which meant we were able to harness a range of knowledge. We effectively had three generations represented with all the possibilities that creates to build understanding and support and to share experiences.' Recent school leaver Sarah Kerr said: 'This was the most I have ever had to think in my entire life.' And student Joana Andrade said: 'We all need to know about the reality of what is happening.' Dr Pritchard added: 'An integral part of developing education for sustainability, as we are doing at the University, is to find ways to promote understanding and skills about climate change.' Following the event's success, plans are underway to include it as part of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Ideas for involving students from schools and colleges will be developed.

Investors in Asia were far more likely to consider environmental concerns, particularly those in Indonesia and Thailand. Investors in China and India also ranked the importance of these issues highly. The findings were echoed across responses to a range questions on responsible investment, which included governance and social issues. Overall, Asian investors expressed most concern and Europeans were least likely to sway investment decisions because of these issues. The results, part of a wider Schroders Global Investor Study, contrast with the current geographical spread of the world's responsibly-invested assets, as measured by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. Its most recent figures, from 2014, show 64% of these assets were in Europe compared to 31% for the US or less than 1% for Asia. Jessica Ground, Global Head of Stewardship at Schroders, said: 'European countries have implemented significant amounts of environmental legislation and European investors are widely considered to be at the forefront of the responsible investment movement. But we have seen a rising and sustained interest in environmental and social issues from Asian and North American investors. 'What we could be seeing is a major change in attitudes around the globe in terms of concerns, and perhaps a difference in the way in which citizens around the world will invest in the future.' The publication of the data follows the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which concluded on 18 November. Respondents were asked to score out of ten how important they felt environmental, social and governance issues, or 'ESG', were when making investment decisions. The average ratings by region are shown in the table below. Level of importance when making investment decisions; average rating on the scale: 0=Not at all important - 10=Critical Europeans as a whole, scored below the global average in every category of issue. Investors in the Americas overall, however, scored above the average each time. The table below shows the highest and lowest scores on one of the issues - environmental concerns. The study found a high level of concern in the US, where climate change is a politically charged issue and evidence is frequently challenged. China, which is frequently criticised over its record on environmental issues and its reliance on fossil fuels, ranked third in the table, with investors giving an average score of 7.7 for the importance of environmental issues in investment selection. The US ranked ninth with a score of 7.2. Japan had the lowest score of 5.6 for environmental issues. Level of importance a positive impact on the environmental has when making investment decisions; average rating on the scale: 0=Not at all important - 10=Critical Overall scores Across the five questions asked (the league tables for each of these are at the foot of this article) Japanese investors were least concerned, (based on an average of all answers), just below the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. In contrast, investors in Indonesia, Brazil and Thailand were the most likely to consider these issues when investing. Millennials vs baby boomers The Schroders Global Investor Study also found millennial investors - defined as those aged 18 to 35 - were far more concerned with ESG issues than older generations, offering an average importance score of 7.3 out of 10. This compared with 6.6 for those aged 36 and over. Baby boomers and older investors offered the lowest scores, at 6.2 for those aged 55 to 64 and 5.8 for those aged 65-plus.

Discussing 'Access to means of Implementation-key concern for Africa post-COP21', Dr. Osman Elasha said there is no room for Africa to waste on capacity building while the rest of the world would be taking action. The panel discussion focused on the challenges that Africa faces and windows of opportunities that the continent could take advantage of, in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Seen as a historic Agreement and the fastest international treaty to enter into force, the Paris Agreement, which is anchored on the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), places obligations on all Parties to fulfil what is contained in their climate action plans. However, for Africa, several gaps have emerged, one of which is the vagueness of most African countries' NDCs. This, even before the bigger issue of means of implementation (finance and technology transfer) is brought into picture. 'The way forward is a major challenge for most developing countries - it's not just about getting the money, but also what to do with it to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement,' said Kurt Lonsway, Manager for the Bank's Climate and Environment portfolio. Lonsway, however, was quick to point out that the Bank stands by its commitment to support African States as they seek to rework their climate action plans to ensure that they benefit from available climate funding windows. And in keeping up with the African challenge theme, Seth Osafo, Advisor to the African Group of Negotiators, lamented the lack of in-country coordination among key climate players in most African countries. 'While it is collectively agreed that there is lack of capacity to develop bankable projects to access climate finance, another African tragedy is the lack of coordination within African countries,' said Osafo, adding that some country focal points wind up representing their countries at negotiations without sharing key decisions with other key players in their respective countries. Osafo, who is former legal advisor at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), observed the need to improve in-country linkages especially between the Ministries of Environment, which, in most African countries, carry the climate change portfolio, alongside Finance. 'For example, the Ministries of Finance are the key financial mobilization units of most governments, but their linkages with the environment is almost not existent on matters of climate change and resource mobilization and/or allocation,' he bemoaned. The Paris Agreement on climate change entered into force on the eve of COP22 , on November 4, 2016. The landmark agreement, reached at COP21 in Paris last year, aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 'well below 2-degreeC above pre-industrial levels' and to pursue efforts to 'limit the temperature increase to 1.5-degreeC above pre-industrial levels' in this century. However, while some African countries are among the Parties that have already ratified the Agreement, analysis by the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) revealed that most African NDCs are vague in their adaptation and mitigation aspirations. With the continent contributing approximately five percent to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and considered the most vulnerable to climate change vagaries, the overarching theme for Africa's participation at COP22 has been the way forward post-COP21, given the nuances surrounding the Agreement especially on means of implementation. 'There are contentious nuances of the Agreement that must be unpacked in the context of Africa's development priorities, particularly in regard to the means of implementation which were binding provisions of the Kyoto Protocol and currently only non-binding decisions in the Paris Agreement,' said James Murombedzi, Officer-in-Charge of the African Climate Policy Centre, highlighting the importance of focusing on what matters for Africa - climate finance.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK161","Marrakesh climate summit 'light on real progress', campaigners say","November 20, 2016 Sunday","The Independent - Daily Edition","Campaigners have expressed ""extreme disappointment"" at the outcome of the United Nations climate change summit in Marrakesh, saying the nations most vulnerable to the effects of a warming planet. The Paris conference last year was widely regarded as a success, but this was based largely on promises to tackle the problem. Marrakesh was seen as the event at which those pledges would be turned into action. The planet has already warmed by 1\'baC and at Paris it was agreed to try to limit this to as close to 1.5\'baC as possible to avoid ""severe, pervasive and irreversible"" impacts. Yet environmental campaigners said the Morocco summit was again heavy on rhetoric and light on real progress, with rich countries failing to do enough to help the developing world. The recent election of Donald Trump, who has previously called global warming a ""hoax"", has raised fears that the US's climate promises could be withdrawn. Isabel Kreisler, of Oxfam, said not enough money was being given to the world's poorest countries to help them adapt to changes that are already happening because of global warming. Climate change is affecting poor states in Africa and Asia much more than the developed world, which built its wealth on the fossil fuels that caused the problem. ""We saw a stubborn refusal from developed country ministers and negotiators to fill the adaptation finance gap and face the fact that the [Paris] Agreement doesn't fully protect lives that will suffer the most from climate change,"" Ms Kreisler said. ""Adaptation finance is not just an abstract numbers game. It's about providing women farmers in Africa with seeds to plant drought-resistant crops and feed their families; it's about building seawalls so millions who live in coastal areas survive rising sea levels."" Ms Kreisler called for developed countries to ""live up to their end of the bargain"". ""Millions of people facing extreme and erratic weather can't afford to keep waiting,"" she said. Lidy Nacpil, of the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, said: ""At the end of these two weeks we just want to express our extreme disappointment that no clear and concrete increases in climate finance pledges have been put forward by developed country governments. ""We've heard so much talk about leveraging private sector funds to address climate finance needs, but private sector involvement is not a substitute for public finance. ""Substantive amounts of public finance are urgently needed - this is especially true for adapting to climate change and addressing the impacts on communities. In Marrakech, all the developed countries did was try to evade and postpone their responsibilities, insisting on highly questionable methods for calculating their financial contributions to mask the paltry reality."" And Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: ""The outcome of the UN climate talks means that the world's poorest people in the most vulnerable countries will have to continue their wait for another two years before substantive decisions are made on how the Paris Agreement is put into action."" Mr Norton also reflected Oxfam's reservations about the ""disappointing"" progress on climate finance. ""The main obstacle is the lack of funding available to poor countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change,"" he said. ""It is vital that developed countries provide this finance to the poorest countries."" The election of Mr Trump cast a shadow over the summit. As one of the biggest producers of emissions and the most powerful nation on earth, US leadership was crucial to the success of the Paris Agreement. But the President-elect has signalled his intention to withdraw from the pact. However, there were also signs that much of the world remains committed to climate action. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 111 states, most recently the UK, and countries have overall been supportive - at least in rhetoric. And Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, hailed the progress at the Marrakech summit, known as COP22 . ""The strength, the support for and the robustness of the Paris Agreement was furthered underlined, with nine more ratifications received at the UN in New York and the promise of many more to come,"" she said. ""Nations reaffirmed that the agreement is in their national interests and a key catalyst to a better, more prosperous future for their citizens."" But young delegates to the event were left disappointed. Max Forshaw, 19, said: ""At COP22 , the lack of urgency has further condemned young people, future generations and the world's most vulnerable to food insecurity, water scarcity, extreme weather events and climate induced conflict. As young people, we will live with the consequences of these negotiations. ""This year's inaction brings us one step closer to a future with a climate that is incompatible with dignified life."" \"

This will require ambitious action across all sectors. A priority should be the decarbonisation of the electricity supply sector, using nuclear energy in harmony with other forms of low carbon generation. The next steps to achieving these goals will be taken at the COP 22 climate change conference Marrakech that starts on 7 November. Agneta Rising, Director General, World Nuclear Association said ' COP 22 needs to enable governments to take practical and meaningful progress towards meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This should include supporting the contribution nuclear can make to achieving a low carbon global electricity generation mix.' Today, the world's 450 nuclear power plants generate enough electricity to avoid the emissions of two and a half billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, compared to the coal-fired baseload generation that nuclear typically displaces. New nuclear plants that have started operation since COP 21 will save more than 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year. Countries and regions that have decarbonised have done so by including nuclear energy in harmony with other low carbon forms of electricity generation. France, Sweden, Switzerland and Ontario have made major cuts in the use of fossil fuels by using nuclear energy alongside other low carbon options, such as renewables. The world's nuclear industry has endorsed a goal of supplying 25% of the world's electricity with nuclear generation by 2050, a target that will require the construction of 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity. Currently, nuclear energy supplies around 11% of the world's electricity needs.

A consumer tax levy on fossil fuels could provide a means of lowering their use or encouraging the adoption of cleaner alternatives, the research suggests. Such a system - adopted from a tool devised by the economist Arthur Pigou in the 1920s - could help avert dangerously high global temperatures and sea level rises. Current economic policies for reducing the use of fossil fuels are unlikely to be as effective, the study finds. Global talks The results emerge ahead of the upcoming COP22 The proposed levy - known as a Pigouvian tax - would offer a way to balance the competing needs of supporting economies while at the same time limiting the impact of man-made greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. A key facet of the carbon levy is that all revenue would be recycled directly to households. The policy would likely encourage the development of green technologies, and reduce consumption. Such a system has been successfully introduced in British Columbia, Canada. Economic model Researchers at the University of Edinburgh, who carried out the study, designed a simple, readily understandable model of climate economics. They took into account the costs to society of climate change, the costs of adopting new technology, how the climate is likely to respond to change, and future changes in costs. They found that under existing economic policy conditions, global temperatures are likely to continue to rise strongly this century. This is the case even when future greenhouse gas emissions are moderated in the most cost-effective way possible, with strategies that seek to optimise reductions in the use of fossil fuels. The research, published in Anthropocene Review, also show that global temperatures exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels five months after the Paris Climate Agreement.

During the Ordinary Meeting of the National Council of Food Security and Nutrition, nearly forty stakeholders discussed on the current status of the Right to Adequate Food in the country in order to advise the government on the policies that need to be implemented to guarantee this right. This meeting, the first of the IX Legislative Term, was chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Environment, Gilberto Silva, and included FAO presentations on a Diagnosis of the food rights and laws in the country. Cabo Verde has ratified most of the international conventions and legal instruments related to the Right-to-Food which, yet, is implicitly recognized in several articles of the Constitution of the Republic of Cabo Verde. In addition, in the current legal system, several Decrees-law have been passed that protect the access to food in the country, in all dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. The Government has enabled the environment for the Right to Adequate Food, including it as a priority in the Political Programme of the current Legislative Term and adopting several national policies, including the National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition (ENSAN 2020). It is also aligned with the Strategy of the Portuguese Speaking Countries Community (CPLP), the National Action Plan for Food Security and Nutrition (PANSAN 2014-16), National Plan on Food and Nutrition (PNAN 2015-20) and the National Program of Schools Meals (PNAE 2012-20). Cabo Verde has not experienced severe famine since the 1950s and the economy has grown progressively until it graduated as Least Developed Countries (LDC) in 2008 and accessed the World Trade Organization. Nevertheless, food insecurity remains as a national issue affecting over 20% of the population and there are serious nutrition problems, particularly affecting children such as a high rate of iron deficiency anemia. The Diagnosis presentation highlighted the importance of strengthening the current legal instruments to protect the Right to Adequate Food and the effective operationalization, monitor and evaluation of the current policies to tackle food insecurity in the country. Likewise, it recommended to reinforce the information and education campaigns to make the population more aware of the right to food, as well as the engagement of Civil Society Organizations and Non-State Actors, enabling the conditions for their participation in regular consultations with the government specialized agencies. A law proposal, elaborated with FAO support, will be presented at the next meeting of the National Council of Food Security and Nutrition scheduled during the second quarter of 2017. Minister Gilberto Silva explained some of the key challenges of the sector, including the access to credit, informal structure of the agricultural production and need to register and certify the sector, water scarcity, land tenure, post-harvest treatment, sustainability of marine resources and others. The Minster also explained current initiatives that the Government is taking to overpass them, such as the densification of the food security networks in the country and the involvement of the local structures led by the Municipal Governments in these networks. The reinforcement of the national statistics system is another priority of the government in order to have accurate data for elaborating effective evidence-based policies. Post- COP22 actions The Government also organized a public conference on the theme ""The challenges for the implementation of a public agenda for Food Security and Nutrition"", with the participation of the Prime Minister of Cabo Verde and the FAO Representative. The Conference brought together nearly hundred stakeholders from the main public institutions working on Food Security, majors from several islands, and representatives from the International Organizations, Diplomatic Missions, Academia and Civil Society. Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva assured that Food Security is a national priority at highest level and recognized FAO's role in enhancing Food Security and Nutrition in the country. ""We are determined to end food insecurity in Cabo Verde; our policies have a special focus on increasing productivity in agriculture and fisheries, as well as the income generated bythese activities "", said the Prime Minster. FAO Representative in Cabo Verde, R\'e9mi Nono Womdim, highlighted the political will of the country to tackle food insecurity and the need to increment the investments to reinforce the environmental and economic resilience of the small farmers and fishermen. ""We are committed to continue supporting the country, providing technical assistance in the formulation of policies, strategies and projects for development in areas such as nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and land and natural resources management"", he underlined. Some of the recommendations emphasized the need to articulate Food Security and Nutrition objectives with socioeconomic development, the national definition of Food Sovereignty and Right to Adequate Food, the implementation of a systemic Food Security policy, and the establishment of governing mechanisms of the Food Security and Nutrition.

However, the process to install technology to dramatically cut emissions and become ""abated"" power stations is thought to be so costly that the last plants will not be able to accomplish this, and are widely expected to shut down. Launching a delayed consultation on unabated coal power yesterday, which will close on 1 February, the government said it wanted to see an ""orderly transition"" away from unabated coal generation and that doing so will pose no risks to the security of electricity supplies. It first announced a commitment to close coal-fired power stations by 2025 in November last year. In its own analysis, the government said coal power stations have become so uneconomical, due to new constraints such as climate change and air pollution commitments, that most stations are likely to be shut down by 2022. However, if there are delays in nuclear and offshore wind projects, the last coal-fired power unit would be expected to close in 2030. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is consulting on two options for effectively forcing the plants to close by 2025 at the latest. These involve either applying more carbon capture and storage technology or modifying the existing ""Emissions Performance Standard"", which sets emissions caps based on a plant's capacity. The consultation is the first major climate change-related announcement from Theresa May's government and has been launched as UN climate change talks, COP22 , take place in Morocco. Business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: ""We're sending a clear signal that Britain is one of the best places in the world to invest in clean, flexible energy as we continue to upgrade our energy infrastructure.

The event, organized at the new facility, was attended by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and the Digital Economy; Revathi Advaithi, Chief Operating Officer, Electrical Sector, Eaton and Hamid Benbrahim El Andaloussi, CEO of Midparc SA and the Morocco Aerospace Industries Association (GIMAS). The Eaton facility in Midparc has required an investment of $ 12 million and is located on an area of 13,587 square meters, including an 10,100 square meter manufacturing facility. This demonstrates that Morocco is strategically positioned to be a key manufacturing location that can serve customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. With established and fast transportation links within Morocco and across the region, the site is ideally located to provide a rapid response and lead times to customers in the region. Eaton's Morocco Plant Operations (MPO) is the newest addition to the company's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) manufacturing footprint and has consolidated the company's manufacturing and support assets in Morocco, including Berrechid Technologies' (Btec) factory in Casablanca and the Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) training facility for West Africa. The MPO builds on Eaton's presence in Morocco, which started commercially over 40 years ago, with manufacturing beginning in the country 17 years ago. The company employs approximately 300 people in Morocco with the intention to expand to close to 550. The MPO extends Eaton's capability in the region by creating an electronics center of excellence, adding new competencies, such as printed circuit board assemblies (PCBA) and power electronics modules for rail and aerospace, a new electronic Power Distribution Unit product line (ePDU), used in IT applications and Data Centers, and UPS accessories. The company is actively hiring and developing professionals who will be part of the electronics center of excellence for the region. To support this, Eaton has established a partnership with the Moroccan Aerospace Institute (IMA) in Casablanca, enhancing their electronics training capability and developing a program whereby future employees spend a period of seven weeks at IMA before starting their new roles. 'We invested in Morocco because of its skilled workforce, the stability of its economy and the proximity to our key European and African customers. There is also a strong correlation between our objective of increasing local procurement and the National Pact for Industrial Emergence of the Moroccan Government, which helps foster a growing ecosystem of local suppliers and partners that will be essential to ensure the long term viability of our manufacturing operations in the country,' Eaton's Revathi Advaithi said. 'The establishment of our operations in Midparc would not have been successful without the extensive support of many institutions. We are grateful to the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment and the Digital Economy, the local administrations and authorities, the developers and architects, as well as the talent development partners, who have all made this possible,' added Advaithi. As for the Minister, Moulay Hafid Elalamy welcomed the start of operations at the new site of the world's leader in electrical and hydraulic components and systems, emphasizing that 'Morocco is proud to host a production site of a company that is in the top 20 of the energy storage system manufacturers in the world.' 'Its startup will help develop local value chains and strengthen the dynamics of ecosystems by building a robust supplier base; the project is fully aligned with the guiding principles of our industrial strategy,' he added. In addition, it has been identified that the Eaton facility in Casablanca will serve as the pilot manufacturing site for energy storage battery packs and systems, supplying thousands of households and businesses across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK173","Morocco adapts to challenges posed by climate change","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","In order to harness renewables potential in a bid to reduce oil imports and mitigate the negative impact of energy consumption on the environment, Morocco has established a solid legal framework in recent years to encourage the development of renewable energy and the implementation of energy efficiency strategies. After the signature of a global accord on greenhouse gas emissions in Paris in November 2015 during the 21st UN Conference on Climate Change , Morocco accelerated the development of a number of green projects, including accepting a bid in December 2015 for an 850-MW wind farm and the inauguration of the world's largest solar plant in Ouarzazate in February 2016. With the impact of global warming becoming more apparent in the country, the government has developed several initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve its management of water resources. In the context of urban sprawl, water stress and the impact on ecosystems, Morocco has put in motion a robust roadmap aimed at enabling the country to better adapt to climate variations. Legislative Reform Over the past decade, in order to ensure the protection of its environment, Morocco has enacted a solid legal framework through the adoption of a comprehensive set of laws, including the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development, the law on renewable energy, the law on energy efficiency, the law on waste management and the National Strategy for Water (Strat\'e9gie Nationale de l'Eau, SNE). Similarly, the 2011 constitution proclaimed the population's right to a healthy environment. In 2015 a series of new laws related to coastal protection and a ban on plastic bags were also passed to further efforts to ""green"" the economy. Moreover, as part of the Rio Conventions derived from the 1992 Earth Summit, the authorities are currently working on a new piece of legislation aimed at incurring the civil liability of persons in the event of environmental damage. Morocco's environment policies are supervised by the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment (Minist\'e8re de l'Energie, des Mines, de l'Eau et de l' Environnement, MEMEE), which is supported locally by regional environment observatories. Meanwhile, the National Programme of Energy Efficiency aims to achieve an energy saving of 12% by 2020 though the promotion of energy efficiency initiatives in the building sector, industry and transport. Water In recent years, Morocco has been increasingly exposed to droughts due to global warming and an over-utilisation of underground water by farmers and households. With the level of water availability dropping from 2500 cu metres per year per person in the 1960s to 500 cu metres in 2015, Morocco is considered a water-stressed country by the UN, and one of the areas most vulnerable to climate variations in the future. As such, the authorities have put in place several measures aimed at improving Morocco's overall water management in a bid to preserve the country's hydric potential, currently estimated at 22bn cu metres per year. Dams In 2009 the government launched the SNE aimed at upgrading Morocco's overall water infrastructure. The programme notably included the construction of 59 new large-scale dams and 100 small-scale dams by 2030, as well as the development of a water conveyance project to transfer surplus water from the north of the country to the south. To date, Morocco has a network of 135 large-scale dams and 100 small-sized dams, with a total capacity of 17.5bn cu metres. As part of the SNE, the country is currently constructing three new dams in the north, namely at Martil, Kharroub and Dar Khrofa, which are expected to add up to 2.6bn cu metres in capacity once completed. In January 2016 two additional dam construction projects were awarded to the Moroccan company Soci\'e9t\'e9 des Travaux Agricoles Marocains in Agdz and Todgha for an investment of more than $100m. The planned water conveyance project comprises construction of a vast network of artificial canals extending around 500 km to connect the rivers Oued Laou, Loukkos and Sebou to Oum Er-Rbia, Tensift and Bouregreg. Designed to transfer excess water in basins in the north of the country to areas subject to shortages in the south, initial studies for the project were undertaken in the late 2000s. Estimated to cost $3.6bn, the project remains on hold due to Morocco's current budget constraints (see Economy chapter). Irrigation Consuming up to 80% of the country's water resources, agriculture is expected to be the sector most affected by a shortage of water over the next few years (see Agriculture chapter). With a current surface area of 1.02m ha, irrigated agriculture accounts for 15% of cultivated areas, 45% of the agriculture sector's added value and contributes 75% of agriculture exports. In 2016 GDP growth prospects had already been reviewed downwards due to drought, which has significantly undermined agricultural yields. As part of the Green Morocco Plan, the government launched the National Plan for Irrigated Water Conservation (Programme National d'Economie d'Eau d'Irrigation, PNEEI) in 2012 in a bid to optimise the use of water resources and improve agricultural yields via the expansion of drip irrigation systems. With a $90m endowment, the programme aims to extend the surface area of irrigated land by 50% over 10 years, as well as to improve irrigation techniques. As such, several regional offices for agricultural enhancement have been set up to monitor the development of irrigation through different public-private partnerships (PPPs). Three PPPs are currently under way to develop drip systems in the Doukkala, Souss Massa and Dar Khrofa areas. Based on a report by the Ministry of Finance, the PNEEI resulted in 410,000 ha of agricultural land being equipped with drip systems in 2014. This programme is expected to save 2.4bn cu metres of water by 2030. Solar Pump According to National Agency for the Development of Renewables and Energy Efficiency (Agence Nationale de D\'e9veloppement des Energies Renouvelables et de l'Efficacit\'e9 Energ\'e9- tiques, ADEREE), agriculture accounts for 6% of Morocco's energy consumption, owing predominantly to irrigation equipment, tractors, dryers and livestock infrastructure. In 2015 the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Minist\'e8re de l' Agriculture et de la P\'eache Maritime, MAPM) implemented a $40m programme in partnership with the MEMEE, ADEREE and the local bank Cr\'e9dit Agricole to subsidise the acquisition of solar-powered ( photovoltaic) water pumps as a means of substituting the widespread use of butane as a power source in the country. According to the MAPM, butane is still used in the irrigation of approximately 100,000 ha; a total of 800,000 tonnes of oil equivalent per year. In addition, the plan is expected to alleviate the current high level of subsidies in butane gas granted by Morocco's Compensation Fund. ""So far 8000 solar pumps have been installed across Morocco. Large-scale agricultural holdings have been the first to see the potential of solar pumps, therefore our priority now is to disseminate the technology among smaller agricultural structures and show solar pumps are a sustainable economic model,"" Said Mouline, managing director at ADEREE, told OBG. Potable Water Since the implementation of the National Plan for Potable Water in the 1990s, access to potable water in urban areas has reached 100% coverage, though it has grown at a slower pace in rural areas, with 94% coverage as of 2015. The National Office for Potable Water (Office National de l'Eau Potable, ONEP), the entity in charge of developing and maintaining Morocco's water infrastructure, is working to increase the number of water networks from 73% to 80% by 2025. The institution is involved in an ongoing infrastructure project in the north-eastern city of Oudja aimed at reducing leakage rates from 37% at present to no more than 20% by 2019. Water Treatment Similarly ONEP has been focused on improving Morocco's water treatment system. The National Programme for Water Treatment aims at generalising the collection and treatment and reuse of 80% of wastewater by 2020 and 100% by 2030, and in 2005 the authorities put forth the 15-year National Programme for Water Treatment aimed at reducing the pollution index due to wastewater by 60%, as well as bringing the total number of urban households connected to sewers up to 80%. The programme has focused on upgrading and extending the country's liquid drainage system to reduce incidences of recurrent flooding. As of 2015, there was a network of 90 water treatment plants present in Morocco. In recent years the less populated southern regions of the country have been the recipients of greater engagement from the government, which has been looking to alleviate water stress in the area. As such, the south is expected to receive $290m of investment in 2016 to allow it to upgrade potable water conveyance in the regions of Laayoune and Dakhla, in addition to improved energy-recovery equipment at the former desalination plant in Laayoune. Water distribution infrastructure will be also reinforced in Tarfaya, Smara and Boujdour. Water Recycling With an estimated volume of 38m cu metres per annum, recycled water is still only used to a limited extent, mainly for the irrigation of parks, golf courses and agricultural land. In December 2015 the authorities presented a National Water Plan with the goal to recycle 325m cu metres of wastewater by 2030, with the completion of 162 projects across the hydraulic basins of Loukkos, Moulouya, Sebou, Bou Regreg Chaouia, Oum Er-Rbia, Tensift, Souss-Massa, Guir Ziz Rh\'e9ris and Sakia El Hamra Oued Eddahab. Desalination Until recent years, desalination activities were limited in the country. ONEP has been operating a dozen small-scale desalination plants - mostly in southern areas - for a total capacity of 35,000 cu metres per day. They notably provide 80% of water in Laayoune and 100% in Boudjour. In 2015 two new desalination projects came on-line. A partnership between the Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (Institut de Recherche du Solaire et des Nouvelles Energies, IRESEN), the National Centre for Nuclear Energy and Technology, the universities of Moulay Ismail and Hassan II, Moroccan company LSA Industrie and Spanish group Solar Platform de Almeria, led to the establishment of AquaSolar in January 2016. As Morocco's first solar-powered desalination plant, located in the Green Energy Park of Ben Guerir near Marrakech, the plant has the capacity to desalinate 120 cu metres of water per day. The pilot project required a $450,000 investment, fully funded by IRESEN. Powered by photovoltaic and thermal solar technologies, the plant is expected to deliver potable water at a price of $0.80 per cu metre over an operation time of 10 years. Badr Ikken, managing director at IRESEN, told local press, ""The market must now define new outlets for this technology, including sites or structures in remote areas experiencing shortage in water resources, or tourism resorts and schools."" In February 2016 a second desalination plant was set up by Morocco's national phosphate company OCP S.A. in Jorf Lasfar Industrial Park. With an initial capacity of over 68,500 cu metres per day in its first phase, the unit is aimed at tapping into the growing water needs created by the development of OCP's mining and industrial activities. Once completed, the plant is expected to have a capacity of around 205,000 cu metres per day. Similarly, the authorities are set to accelerate the development of desalination as a means to counter the country's predicted shortage of water. As such, the MAPM launched a tender bid for the construction of a new desalination plant to the south of Agadir for the Souss-Massa area in early 2016. Another tender bid is also under way to develop a similar desalination plant in Dakhla. Air Morocco is considered a low greenhouse gas emitter despite a rise in its emissions, with 3.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per inhabitant in 2012, compared to 2.95 in 2010. The country is, however, expected to be significantly exposed to the effects of global warming in the near future. Average temperatures have already increased by 1\'b0C and rainfall has decreased by 16%. As a consequence, in March 2016 the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Morocco outlined a $56.9bn greenhouse gas mitigation roadmap, which outlines 49 specific measures aimed at saving 81.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2040 and at generating $2.6bn annually. These measures comprise energy-efficiency programmes in housing, construction, industry and transport, along with the development of ""green"" cities, with the support of ADEREE, which has a mandate to reduce domestic energy consumption by 12% before 2020 and by 15% ahead of 2030. Housing In November 2015 the authorities implemented a new regulation to rationalise energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings. The legislation imposes a series of technical requirements related to thermal insulation in the development of new real estate projects. ""In the first phase the legislation will focus only on new real estate developments, especially in colder areas. The rehabilitation of Moroccan housing stock is only envisaged in the middle-to-long term,"" said Mouline. ""Similarly, as the implementation of these new thermal standards progresses, we expect the local building materials industry to raise production and meet local demand,"" he added. Created in 2013, the Energy Efficiency and Building Materials Cluster completed the first energy-producing social housing project in Settat in partnership with Morocco's Energy Investment Society and the National Office of Vocational Training and Employment Promotion. With a 95% local content rate, the pilot project paved the way for the consolidation of the local building materials industry and prompted authorities to plan the creation of the first laboratory of thermal characterisation of materials in the near term. Green Development The authorities are currently building the first green city in Africa at Ben Guerir, near Marrakech. With a total investment of $4.8bn, the project comprises 48 socioeconomic projects, including the construction of various cultural, sport, leisure and academic facilities, as well as phosphate-processing units and the extension of the existing military base. In 2015 IRESEN put in place the Green Energy Park - the first platform for testing, research and training in renewable energy - in partnership with OCP for an investment of $29m, with the goal for Morocco being to reach a critical size in terms of research and development in renewable energy. Solar Boilers In recent years the solar-powered boiler market has experienced steady growth in Morocco, with approximately 40,000 solar boilers sold annually. In 2015 the installed surface of solar boilers was estimated at 400,000 sq metres, a level considered below market potential. ""Given Morocco's high exposure to the sun, solar boilers can be amortised from the second year of installation,"" Ahmed Squalli, president of the Moroccan Association of Solar and Wind Energies, told OBG. The challenge so far has been the size of the market. ""The market needs incentives, similar to Turkey, Israel or Cyprus,"" he added. As such, in a bid to further encourage the development of solar boilers and reduce the use of state-subsidised butane gas, ADEREE is set to launch Programme Shemsi in 2016. The initiative will increase the acquisition of solar-powered boilers, with the goal to reach an installed surface area of 1.7m sq metres by 2020. Similarly, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has made it a requirement that all private developers install solar-powered boilers in their middle-income housing programmes. Morocco is also expected to start local production of solar boilers in the short term, with IRESEN investing around $660,000 in partnership with Fez-based group Ecole Sup\'e9rieure de Technologie to conceive Sol'R-Shemsy, a 100%-Moroccan solar boiler still in the development phase at the time of writing. Transport Like most emerging countries, Morocco has experienced substantial population growth and a massive rural exodus in recent years. This has caused the percentage of the population living in urban areas to jump from 29% in 1960 to 60% in 2015. As a consequence, transport contributes significantly to energy consumption (41% of the total) and greenhouse gas emissions (23%). In a bid to reduce emissions, the authorities have deployed a multi-fold strategy. First, there have been efforts to develop public transport, particularly a tram network. A tram system is already in place in Rabat and Casablanca, with plans under way to develop new lines in Marrakech, Fez, Tangiers and Agadir. Overall, the needs associated with a cleaner public transport infrastructure in the country's 10 largest cities are expected to require investment of up to $4.3bn by 2030. Premium schemes priced at $8000 for the scrapping of old trucks and taxis have also been put in place, as well as training programmes in eco-driving for captive fleets. New measures are also in the pipeline, such as the introduction of tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles, limitation standards for gas emissions and the implementation of energy audits on commercial fleets. In addition to these moves, Morocco is set to develop a fleet of 38,500 electric vehicles for its public institutions as part of a $540m programme. Industry In recent years the state has looked to limit the impact of major industries. A partnership between the French Development Agency, the German Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as well as local banks Banque Marocaine du Commerce Ext\'e9rieur and Banque Central Populaire, led to the creation of a $90m investment fund called the Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility, which is focused on supporting industries in their energy efficiency and renewable production projects. ""Thus far, $20m has been allocated, through loans for energy efficiency, mostly to tourism facilities, hotels and agri-business,"" Mouline told OBG. In addition, local lender Attijari Bank, has created a new credit line called ""Effinergie"" aimed at funding energy-efficiency investments conducted by small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as individuals. Other sector stakeholders are also expecting long-term benefits from funding. ""Renewable energies are cost efficient and have improved our competitiveness,"" Hakim Marrakchi, CEO of Maghreb Industries, told OBG. ""Our solar panel facility capacity, for example, should have a five-year return on investment now that we have financing assistance and a grant from the EBRD. This experience can be reproduced in sub-Saharan countries."" More Effective Waste Management Waste management has become a growing concern as the output of urban solid waste in the country has progressively increased over the years to an average of 6.9m tonnes per annum. In 2004 Casablanca was the first city in Morocco to commission a waste collection service by contracting three companies, Sita el Beida, which is a subsidiary of Suez Environnement; Tecmed; and Sedegema, a subsidiary of Pizzorno. A number of other cities followed suit in 2006, including Khouribga, Essaouira, Mekn\'e8s, B\'e9ni-Mellal, Fquih Ben Salah, Ouazzane and Tangiers. The country also established the National Programme of Waste Management. Costing Dh40bn ((EURO)3.7bn), the programme was launched in 2008. The programme aims to help the country reach a waste collection rate of 85% by 2016 and 100% by 2030. The plan calls for collecting, recycling, valorisation and establishment of landfills. The initiative should be succesful if it is accompanied by the development of production chains. There are 16 companies currently active on the delegated waste collection market, with turnover estimated at $260m in 2015. More than 90% of urban communes follow a waste management system - which corresponds to a total of 118 contracts - a trend which is reaching rural communes, such as Moulay Abdellah, which contracted Segedema as part of a $530,000 deal. While French companies dominated the waste-management market in previous years, new local operators have emerged since 2010, namely OS-NDD, Ozone, GMF and Casa Technique, to apply for small tender bids. Larger municipal waste management budgets have supported the entrance of these new operators. Casablanca's annual budget for waste collection rose from $35m in 2004 to $48m in 2014, Rabat's from $12m in 2008 to $21m in 2014 and Tangiers' increased from $8m in 2008 to $17m in 2014. In 2015 Sita El Beida was the major waste-management operator, with several major contracts in Casablanca, Mohammedia, Safi, Nouacer, Tangiers, T\'e9touan and Oujda, generating an annual turnover of $80m. Lebanon's Sukleen-Averda, which operates in Casablanca, Rabat and Marrakech, followed in second, with a $35m turnover. Waste Recycling Until recently, recycling in Morocco was a process organised through an informal network of 10,000 rag-pickers, meaning the country recycled just 10% of its waste, mainly plastics, board paper, glass and iron. The authorities, however, put in place a National Programme for Household Waste Management in 2008 with a goal of reaching a recycling rate of 20% by 2022. At an estimated cost of $4bn, the strategy has led to major improvements across 180 cities, pushing up the waste-collection rate from 48% in 2008 to 86% in 2015. The MEMEE is also set to improve all existing landfills by 2020 and to develop training and awareness programmes at the municipal level. In addition, 12 recycling centres for household waste are currently under construction to the informal structures that exist currently. ""The collection of plastic bottles is informal, hence their price is undervalued. By bringing this activity into the formal sector, the public sector could create value, with a higher social impact,"" Abdelkhalek El Youbi, director of Les Eaux Min\'e9rales d'Oulmes, a company specialising in bottled water, told OBG. In 2015 the World Bank praised the management model of the Oum Azza landfill near Rabat, which receives 850,000 tonnes of waste annually and resells 2200 tonnes of solid waste. The facility is to begin accepting organic waste - which accounts for two-thirds of total waste in Morocco compared to 33% in Europe - and will use it to produce bio-gas, which it will resell to a nearby cement plant. Similarly, Spanish firm Sando, which is in charge of trash collection in the western part of Tangiers, launched a waste-sorting experiment in December 2015, whereby colour coding was applied at garbage dumps to encourage residents to categorise and separate their rubbish. Smaller players have also been developing initiatives under the aegis of Cluster Solaire, an association aimed at encouraging innovation by small enterprises in the implementation of green projects. Moroccan research company Peps, for example, developed a solar oven able to transform waste into electricity. Another company, Kilimanjaro Environnement, collects edible oils from 3500 operators and makes them into biofuels for export to Europe. The firm also launched a pilot scheme to collect oil from households. So far, the group has reached out to 50,000 households in Casablanca, Khouribga and Ben Guerir. In October 2015 the state signed three agreements on waste recycling development with private operators, namely the Federation of Wood, Graphic Arts and Packaging Industries; the Association of Morocco's Petroleum Firms; and Eco-Gras. The accord's objective is to recycle 140,000 tonnes of cartons, 70,000 tonnes of lubricant oils and 105,000 tonnes of edible oils annually, and, in the process, generate 15,000 jobs. Human Resources Moroccan engineering schools and faculties of science and technology have thus far provided the green energies sector with the bulk of qualified personnel. More recently, the advancement of renewable energies and an increase in the popularity of environment-related careers among students has led to the development of new faculties in most Moroccan universities. Ensuring these programmes meet the needs of employers in the industry is crucial, as the sector is evolving quickly. ""Not only do we have to ensure there is a match between the qualification of Moroccan graduates with specific needs in human resources expressed by renewable energy and green companies, but we also have to make sure there is no oversized manpower in these areas. Large-scale projects in the solar and wind sectors are highly automated and do not require much human capital,"" Touria Barradi, former vice-president at the Moroccan Society of Renewable Energy Development, told OBG. ""However, the upcoming development of smaller projects related to low or medium voltage, as well as the take-off of new green industrial sectors, should undoubtedly lead to increased needs in engineering qualifications in the medium term. Our higher education and vocational training systems have to be ready to train a large number of students to a high standard in order to best accompany these developments."" As part of a Franco-Moroccan cooperation programme, the authorities launched the construction of three training institutes related to renewables and energy efficiency in 2016. Known as Institutes of Training on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Jobs, these are based in Oujda, Tangiers and Ouarzazate, and are a way of supplying the growing human capital needs that have emerged through the development of wind farms and solar stations. The facilities are expected to train 1500 new technicians every year in a wide variety renewable segments. Outlook In less than a decade Morocco has made some important strides in terms of environmental conservation and protection. The development of large-scale solar plants and wind farms has been accompanied by the creation of new industrial segments and a series of green initiatives aimed at saving water and reducing gas emissions. To lower energy consumption further, the kingdom is also working on a new bill that will see the introduction of a 1% tax on oil products. This will be used to contribute to the subsidisation of energy-efficiency initiatives going forward. With Morocco set to host the 22nd UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP22 For Barradi, "" COP22 will be the opportunity for Morocco to consolidate its experience in the development of renewables and natural resources management, and to share its know-how with most African and MENA countries."" Marrakech seems to be at the crossroads of many of the green initiatives that have been deployed by Morocco. ""During the COP 22 , in a 200-km radius around Marrakech, Morocco will show the progress made in a wide range of areas, including the solar plant in Ouarzazate, the wind farm in Essaouira, the green city of Ben Guerir, the upgraded water-cleaning station in Marrakech, as well as the solar pump programme,"" Mouline told OBG. ""Morocco has managed to put in place a new economic model that is replicable for African countries and allows a rapid return on investments in a public-private approach, as well as positive environmental impacts. For example, every dirham invested in energy efficiency yields triple the value for each country in terms of energy savings and gas emissions,"" he said. \"

I really like to see more relationship between these two extremes.'\~ The Schwoerers visit communities and schools around the world during stops on thier trip to speak with people about climate change and how to not damage the world further. \~ The couple has called their journey the\~ TopToTop Global Climate Expedition \~ and it first started over a decade ago in the melting Alps of Switzerland, where Dario worked as a mountain guide and witnessed icy peaks disintegrating and melting away. His wife and he decided it was time to bring attention to climate change by climbing the highest of the seven continents without the use of motors.\~ To complete the task, it required for them to have a sailboat to travel to the continents.\~ The couple was able to borrow a 50-foot aluminum sloop Pachamama, which is Inca for Mother Earth, from a guiding client, as the boat had just a mast and a few sails. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par They promised to work and finish the boat while it was afloat, and during their journey they accepted gifts from local people who supported their climate change mission.\~\~ The couple ended up in Kolkata to climb the iconic Mount Everest. But while taking on the mountain by just walking and biking, they also spent months cleaning and removing tents and other gear that has been left behind by other expeditions. \~ It was at this time the family began to grow and Sabine carried five-month-old Noe from the boat to the Everest base camp.\~ When they climbed the tallest mountain in South America,\~Aconcagua, she was six months pregnant and they biked more than 500 miles.\~ Sabine did not go to the top of the 22,800 feet mountain for the baby's safety. \~ In 2005, the expedition gained sponsorship from the company that makes the Swiss Army knife, as the family found countless ways to use many of its products including cutting the umbilical cords for each of the five children with their knives.\~ From 2013 to 2014, the family had spent the winter in Cordova, where their children had learned to work with the public about climate change.\~ During the spring of 2014, the Swiss family sailed to Whittier and climbed over Portage Pass before biking to Anchorage and Talkeetna where they presented about climate change to roughly 3,000 students along the journey. Dario and a few pals eventually worked their way to the Kahiltna Glacier before climbing to the top of Denali.\~\~ Of the family's stops around the world, Cordova has been the happiest place for them so far, as the children have made friends while attending school.\~ For food, they ate salmon they caught while fishing, along with berries and moose.\~ That winter, the Schwoerers attempted to heat the boat in Cordova, however, the aluminum hull had gathered too much condensation so they added insulation to stay warm along with layering and bundling up clothing.\~ In August the family left Nome to head east to get supplies to protect the boat's bow from ice, and along the way they spoke to classes in the villages.\~ During the fall they sailed along the East Coast in the U.S. and visited schools, as they plan to visit Haiti next where they will bring school supplies.\~ Their effort to save the planet even brought the family to Paris for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference . \~ \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK176","Solar energy in Africa comes of age as costs reach grid parity","FT.com"," ","By Simon Currie and Laura Kiwelu, Norton Rose Fulbright Harnessing abundant and free solar energy has long been regarded as the obvious solution to Africa\' s persistently low electrification rates. After a sluggish start due to unproven technology and high capital costs, we are now witnessing a solar revolution which will transform Africa\' s energy landscape over the next decade. In February 2015 the first solar photovoltaic (or PV) grid connected plant in Africa outside of South Africa was inaugurated at the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village in Rwanda, a refuge for those orphaned during and after the 1994 genocide. With a layout resembling the Africa continent, its ramifications have spread far beyond the 8.5MW it exports to the grid, attracting visitors such as Bono and members of the US Senate. In Africa the usual development period for power plants is nine years from inception. Yet this project was generating power barely two years after completion of the feasibility study. Following the success of this project, and the large scale solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) programmes in Morocco and South Africa, we have seen a ripple effect across the continent. There are currently large scale solar PV projects under development in nearly every country across Africa, including regions with relatively high political risk such as Chad, Burundi and northern Nigeria. Africa is a direct beneficiary of the sustained fall in the cost of solar PV plant and equipment. In 2010 the cost of a utility scale, fixed, ground mounted solar PV plant was around US$4.19 per watt, whereas it has now dropped by over 56 per cent of this cost, with forecasts of around US$0.8 per watt in 2025, according to data from the HYPERLINK http://www.irena.org/home/index.aspx?PriMenuID=12&mnu=Pri International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). This cost reduction means that in many countries solar PV has reached grid parity with conventional thermal sources of power despite suppressed commodity prices \- the inclusion of PV in the energy mix is now a no-brainer in Africa. Right now the speed of negotiations on tariffs for new PV projects with African utilities cannot keep up with the fast moving PV sector. We are seeing a land dash for suitable sites. This is coupled with increased funding becoming available following COP 21, the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in 2015, and through schemes such as the United States\' Power Africa, the World Bank\' s Scaling Solar programme and the recent Terrawatt Initiative (which is backed by Engie and IRENA). In June we saw a record low tariff in a Scaling Solar auction in Zambia, following other record lows in Dubai, South Africa and Morocco. These tariffs are not always down to a reduction in project costs. In some cases the level of local state support (such as providing the site and meeting grid connection costs) and concessional funding have reduced the tariff. A critical issue is whether the tariff is fully or partially  dollarised . The majority of the low tariffs achieved recently have been fully dollarised. When assessing tariff levels regionally or globally it is important to compare  apples with apples . The recent and sudden drop in tariffs for PV projects in Africa has had unintended consequences. African utilities are delaying agreeing to tariffs for projects which are  shovel-ready as they believe a cheaper project may be around the corner. While the costs for PV projects may be falling globally this doesn\' t mean tariffs will be uniform. As well as differences in solar irradiation there are many factors which affect costs such as country risk, security costs, connection costs and logistics. The endgame for Africa is achieving electrification rates mirroring the rest of the world. Deploying PV technology is easy compared with conventional power projects as it can be constructed in months and requires no fuel. In most parts of Africa projects are not yet coming onto the grid at the rate which is possible. Why? The reasons include utilities\' current fixation on achieving a lower tariff (than the neighbour) and on the impact of connecting an intermittent PV plant to a fragile grid. We believe that the technology itself will provide the answers to the challenges. Solar PV isn\' t just getting cheaper; it is getting smarter. Efficiency levels are rising. Inverters can now store energy and provide grid support. Developers understand the need to move from being a  dumb generator which dumps power onto a grid whenever the sun shines to a utility-aligned model. For example, they are starting to use advanced weather forecasting technology which helps the grid deal with unpredictable cloud coverage. In Africa and globally solar PV is increasingly being paired with storage. Storage isn\' t just about batteries (although thanks to companies like Tesla, Panasonic, LG and Samsung the market for battery storage is growing rapidly). In many parts of Africa the best and cheapest form of storage may be HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity pumped storage hydro Simon Currie is the Global Head of Energy based in Sydney and Laura Kiwelu is a senior associate based in Dar es Salaam at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright HYPERLINK http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics Back to beyondbrics \~ \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK178","Nikhil Rathi, CEO, London Stock Exchange (LSE): Interview","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","Interview:\~Nikhil Rathi NIKHIL RATHI: A key part of the agreement is to give the CSE access to technologies that provide international investors with a better investment environment and infrastructure. It is also critical to develop education and training programmes, and to this end the development of a financial cluster in Morocco means the improvement of its human capital. Allowing local firms to attract more investors is another area the agreement addresses. It provides access to a network of capital market participants throughout Europe. Our partnership also enhances the CSE's visibility. London offers very strong infrastructure, with a diversified banking industry and a solid community of lawyers, managers and accountants. From now on, the CSE can leverage this ""network effect"". A recent event hosted in London to enhance Morocco's visibility was very successful, and investors acknowledged Morocco's strong-performing economy. The LSE will benefit because Morocco has the ambition of becoming an investment hub in Africa. We believe Morocco opens a window to business opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in francophone countries. Anglophone Africa has also seen greater connectedness with Morocco within the last few years. This is of interest to us because Africa's economies are thriving and offer greater investment opportunities than other parts of the world in certain domains. What sort of lessons might be learned from the development of other financial hubs? RATHI: Emerging markets can learn a lot from global financial hubs. A strong legal and regulatory framework is of first and foremost importance to building a sound and sustainable financial hub. Emerging markets need to comply with international standards in terms of legal and regulatory frameworks, and disclosure of financial information in order to reassure investors. Other factors, such as the presence of international companies, the quality of human capital, and better connectivity with other countries and financial markets, are top priorities for emerging financial hubs. What we have seen in Morocco is very encouraging. The ongoing efforts to maintain a strong cluster effect to further attract human capital will make a difference in the long run. The kingdom clearly stands out in the region thanks to its strong institutions, growing wealth and significant economic reforms. Despite slower growth in 2016, the forecast remains very positive. Which foreign markets has Morocco developed relations with, and which sectors are seen as having the most investment potential? RATHI: I would pick out several sectors that seem most encouraging. The energy sector in Morocco, and in the region as a whole, offers unparalleled opportunities, since consumption and demand are increasing sharply. International investors could help to raise corporate standards. We also see renewable energy and technology as being very significant. In the wake of the UN conference on climate change , green finance will also become a major contributor to the growth of capital markets. Morocco has developed a network with the US, China and the EU. Our expertise can help support growth by developing infrastructure and market liquidity through the use of technology and the transfer of know-how. Technological improvements in international trading systems are expected to boost functionality and post-trade services. Meanwhile, education and training programmes should help with the transfer of knowledge going forward. \"

(TSE: 6501; 'Hitachi') today announced its set of long-term environmental targets with a view towards 2050, called 'Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050'. In 'Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050', under its 'Environmental Vision' which sets forth a vision for the company through environmental management, Hitachi has set targets such as achieving 80% reductions in CO2 emissions across the company's value chain by fiscal 2050 compared with fiscal 2010, achieving a 50% improvement in the efficiency of the use of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared with fiscal 2010, and minimizing the impact on natural capital; for building a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature. Moving ahead, Hitachi will drive forward with initiatives towards the future achievement of these targets. In recent years, the will for society to work towards the reduction of environmental burdens, and towards the resolution of global environmental issues in the long term, has been demonstrated by agreements such as the Paris Agreement adopted at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP21, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by a United Nations. Additionally, because the Social Innovation Business that Hitachi is developing globally are long-term business operations relating to the construction of social infrastructure, a long-term environmental perspective is also essential in accelerating the development of these business operations. In light of these developments, and from a long-term perspective, Hitachi believes that it is necessary to take steps to combat environmental issues such as climate change, depletion of resources and destruction of ecosystems; and has therefore established the 'Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050' as a set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2050.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK181","Nissan and Enel to launch vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trial in UK","May 13, 2016 Friday","Progressive Media - Company News","Automaker Nissan and power company Enel plans to launch a major vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trial in the UK. The trial will work by installing and connecting 100 V2G units at locations agreed by private and fleet owners of the Nissan LEAF and e-NV200 electric van. By enabling Nissan electric vehicle owners to plug their vehicles into the V2G system, they will be able to sell stored energy from their vehicle battery back to the National Grid. This move comes following the signing of the Nissan-Enel V2G partnership agreement in Paris in December 2015 during the 21st UN Conference on Climate Change (COP21) and the subsequent kick-off of the installation of 40 V2G units in Denmark in January this year. Nissan Europe chairman Paul Willcoxsaid: ""The landmark trial in the UK is a significant step forward in renewable energy management, helping shape the future of industries, cities and societies. ""Smart energy management is one of the biggest challenges any nation faces for the future which is why this trial is so critical in assessing the feasibility of using variable, more flexible energy sources. ""We see Nissan electric vehicles as being the mobile energy hubs of the future, pioneering a self-sustaining energy infrastructure that will help solve the capacity issues of the future."" ""This is the first time this has ever been done in the UK and by enabling customers to sell energy back to the grid, we're providing a financial incentive to choose the sustainable option."" This initiative is part of Enel and Nissan's commitment to support the entire electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. As there will be an increasing number of EVs on the roads across Europe in the future and therefore, it is essential that V2G technology is rolled out to ensure the grid can satisfy the demands made upon it for increased energy, the companies stated. Enel innovation and sustainability head Ernesto Ciorra said: ""We are thrilled about the launch of this project in the UK. ""The installation of our innovative two-way charging technology will encourage the integration of non-programmable renewable energy flows into the grid and will help the spread of electric mobility in the country, benefitting the energy sector and the environment, while also having a positive impact on electric owners' wallets. ""The fact that Nissan has chosen Enel's charging technology to trial in the UK is the perfect demonstration of just how much potential the Group's V2G electric vehicle charging system has to revolutionise not only transport but also the way electricity distribution works."" It is estimated that if all 18,000 Nissan electric vehicles in the UK are connected to the energy network, they will generate the equivalent output of a 180MW power plant. If that is scaled up in a future where all the vehicles on UK roads are electric, vehicle-to-grid technology could generate a virtual power plant of up to 370GW. This energy capacity would be enough to power the UK, Germany and France. \"

The NOOR PV I program will feature three projects: NOOR Ouarzazate IV, with a capacity of around 70MW, 80MW NOOR Laayoune,\~and 20MW NOOR Boujdour. It\~is the first solar PV phase of the NOOR Solar Plan, which already has\~three concentrated solar power\~projects in Ouarzazate. Morocco is the only nation in North Africa, with few fossil fuel reserves and it imports 90% of its energy. The country now plans to produce at least 52% of its energy from renewable resources by 2030. The three projects are expected to help the country\~reduce thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions occurring per year and supply clean energy to thousands of homes with every year in operation. Sterling and Wilson claims that this project will be one of the largest solar PV plants in North African region and it can be in operation for 20 years. As the EPC contractor for this project, the company said that it will maximize the use of local resources for the construction of the solar plants, which can ensure local community development. The company also noted that it will\~provide specialised training to both skilled and unskilled local resources to meet project expectations. Construction of the NOOR PV I Program is expected to begin shortly and is estimated to be completed in one year\' s time. Sterling and Wilson Renewable and Electrical president Bikesh Ogra said:  These projects have been won after an intense competitive bidding process.

""We need everyone. And we need action from the local to the global. Partnerships should focus on results today - and make progress for the long-term. We have no time to waste, and much to gain, by acting now,"" Mr. Ban told a High-Level event on Accelerating Climate Action. The President of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, noted that ""without minimizing the eminent responsibility of States,"" the contribution of non-State actors serves as a ""structuring supplement"" to multilateral action against the impacts of climate change. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. The Global Climate Action Agenda, launched formally in 2014 at COP 20, in Lima, Peru, aims to mobilize non-State actors in addressing climate change. In Paris the next year, two Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana, French Ambassador for climate change negotiations, and Hakima El Haite, Moroccan Minister for the Environment, were appointed to accelerate joint action on the Agenda.

""We need to immediately drive a radical transformation of the global economy"", he said, adding that the private sector has a key role to play. The Secretary-General went on to stress the importance of adaptation. Climate resilient innovations are needed to help billions of people adapt to increasing droughts, floods, temperatures and other impacts. ""Adaptation is not a luxury. It is a prudent investment in our future"", he said. The UN chief said he was pleased to see so many African countries mobilizing climate action, taking as an example the Adaptation of African Agriculture initiative. ""This partnership will help create more resilient food systems on the continent and advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"" he stated. Tuesday, at the opening of the high-level segment of COP 22 , dozens of Heads of State and Government showed a strong support for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK186","-AfDB-Sustainable and responsible tourism driving development in Africa","January 25, 2017 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","The United Nations has declared 2017 as 'International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development', with the official launch by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on January 18 in Madrid. On this occasion, UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai put the continued growth of tourism into figures: 'In 2016, more than 1.2 billion people travelled around the world for tourism purposes and another 6 billion people travelled domestically,' he said, highlighting the need to promote more sustainable tourism. 'Tourism has become a pillar of economies, a passport to prosperity, and a transformative force for improving millions of lives. The world can and must harness the power of tourism as we strive to carry out the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,' said UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. 'In parallel with the growth of the sector, there is also increased responsibility to advance towards greater sustainability, equity, inclusiveness and peace in our societies,' added Rifai. This will consist of promoting tourism that is respectful of the environment - to preserve countries' resources and natural wealth - and of the people, who stimulate the economy, creating jobs and income and, thus, the development of countries and their populations. Tourism in Africa, a developing potential With its wealth of exceptional flora and fauna, legendary landscapes and varied cultural heritage, Africa offers a still largely untapped tourism potential. Representing more than 15% of the world population, the continent only currently attracts a small share of the world's tourists. It welcomed 65.3 million tourists in 2014, or 5.8% of worldwide tourist travel. Compared to the 17.4 million international tourist arrivals on the continent in 1990, the performance of the sector has increased nearly fourfold in less than 15 years. In other words, tourism on the continent, especially in the hotel industry, is booming. In terms of revenue, Africa earned US $ 43.6 billion in 2014, representing 3.5% of worldwide tourism revenue. Tourism, engine of growth Generating income and jobs, tourism can be an engine of growth. In 2014, the sector accounted for 8.7 million jobs in Africa, 500,000 more than in the previous year. The African Development Bank has, for some years, been publishing an annual report on the sector in English, entitled Africa Tourism Monitor. Jointly produced by the AfDB, New York University Africa House and the Africa Travel Association (ATA), the third and latest edition, published in January 2016, had the theme of 'Unlocking Africa's Tourism Potential'. The 2016 edition is being finalized. The Bank has also set up a tourism data portal for Africa in collaboration with other partners, similar to the Africa Visa Openness Index, which measures the degree of visa openness on the continent - an important criterion particularly for the mobility of tourists. Developing infrastructure and regional cooperation Infrastructure and transport services remain the Achilles' heel of the growth of the tourism sector: 'Journeys in the African continent are not always seamless', noted the 2015 edition of Africa Tourism Monitor. It proves more complicated - and more onerous - to travel across the continent than it does to get there from Europe, North America or Asia. Dedicated incentive policies are still to be put in place, beside strengthening regional cooperation. On the ground, the work of the Bank also supports the interests of dynamic tourism, provider of income and growth. Not only when it funds and builds roads, airports and other infrastructure, but also when the AfDB makes every effort to ensure that neighbouring communities are involved in and associated with projects for them to better take ownership and benefit from them later. Reconciling tourism and sustainable development November 2016, at COP22 in Marrakech, saw the birth of an African Charter on Sustainable and Responsible Tourism under the auspices of Morocco and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and signed by 20 countries of the continent. The objectives of responsible and sustainable tourism are fully aligned with the African Development Bank's High 5s, for development on the continent. Moreover, three of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, adopted in September 2015, target tourism: SDG 8, 'Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all', SDG 12, 'Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns' and SDG 14, 'Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development'.

Its goal is to federate the main actors in the field of clean technologies, in order to create synergies, promote profitable solutions to the world's most pressing environmental and health challenges, and give credible advice to governments. Less than four months after the landing of the first ever solar flight around the world, accomplished by Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, the Solar Impulse Foundation is launching, at COP22 , the World Alliance for Clean Technologies - a second phase in the realization of Bertrand Piccard's vision that clean technologies can accomplish impossible goals and offer tangible solutions to solve many of the challenges facing global society today, as well as reach the objectives of the Climate Action Agenda. The Alliance's overarching ambition is to globally advance the cause of clean technologies, which it defines as £ny practical solution that allows to bridge the gap between ecology and economy. They are not limited to the production of renewable energy, but encompass technologies, systems, know-hows or processes that protect the environment, improve health, increase energy efficiency or save natural resources, while creating jobs, generating profit and sustaining growth'. 'We need to embrace clean technologies, not because they are 'eco-logical,' but because they are 'logical,'' said Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation. 'Even if climate change didn't exist, energy efficient technologies would make sense to create jobs, generate profit and boost economic development, while also reducing CO2 emissions and protecting natural resources.' Until now, there was no such organization, gathering the clean technologies stakeholders around the world; hence the Alliance will bring together start-ups, companies, institutions and organizations producing, implementing or supporting the use of clean technologies. Together, the members will share experiences and create synergies in order to improve the overall value chain and demonstrate concrete solutions to support governments, corporations and institutions in reaching their environmental and health targets, advising them depending on their specific situation. Commenting on the launch of the Alliance, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: 'The Solar Impulse flight showed the world that it is possible to push the limits of technology in order to build the foundation for a sustainable future. By harnessing this and other innovative technologies, we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.' 'Initiatives like the World Alliance for Clean Technologies are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean 'Initiatives like the World Alliance for Clean Technologies are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean technologies that already exist or are under development,' added Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, who was present at the launch. 'We need the best and brightest minds - from the North and the South - to deliver clean technologies that can collectively accomplish the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and all the Sustainable Development Goals to catalyze a healthy and prosperous future for all.' Richard Northcote, Chief Sustainability Officer at Covestro, shared: 'We are delighted to continue our relationship with Solar Impulse though the World Alliance for Clean Technologies. Our contribution to the Solar Impulse project proved that we have the technology to make the world a brighter place and through this alliance we intend to accelerate the implementation of these technologies to tackle the challenges society faces while generating business growth.' 'The success of Solar Impulse has proven to the world how powerful collaborative innovation between visionary entrepreneurs and companies that believe in science and research can be to deliver technological breakthroughs. This is just the beginning of what open collaboration and innovation can do to combat climate change,' concluded Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, CEO of Solvay, Solar Impulse's first partner. The Solar Impulse Foundation offers to the Alliance its administrative support, as well as the media, political and institutional relations developed during the round the world solar flight. The Alliance is funded thanks to partners such as Covestro, Solvay and Nestle, among others, as well as private donors. As Bertrand Piccard said upon the final landing in Abu Dhabi 'If an airplane can fly around the world without a drop fuel, clean technologies can undoubtedly be implemented on the ground to make a cleaner, more efficient and richer world.' About the World Alliance for Clean Technologies The World Alliance for Clean Technologies brings together start-ups, companies, institutions and organizations producing, implementing or supporting the use of clean technologies. Together, the members share experiences and create synergies in order to improve the overall value chain and demonstrate concrete solutions to support governments, corporations and institutions in reaching their environmental and health targets, advising them depending on their specific situation. An association registered under Swiss law and headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Alliance is a non-profit entity.

According to a report by Ecofin Agency, citing L'Usine Nouvelle , the consortium will stage a demonstration of the Moroccan-made model during the 22nd annual Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) global summit on climate change, to be held from 7 to 18 November. Separately, Renault is planning to shift some production of its Dacia Logan ""multi-convivial vehicle"" (MCV) wagon from its Romanian Pitesti plant to its Moroccan Tangiers plant during the first quarter of 2017. Renault spokesperson Celine Furet said that only some production of the Logan MCV, which totalled about 40,000 units in 2015, would move to Tangiers. Furet added that the shift in production comes as the automaker's Pitesti plant frees up capacity to build more Duster sport utility vehicle (SUVs). Significance: EVs that are also expected to be used during the climate conference include the Renault Twizy, Kangoo, and Zoe and the Nissan Leaf and Evalia. During the 21st COP in Paris, Renault-Nissan installed 90 new EV charging points to support 200 EVs in a bid to underline its commitment to the technology (see France: 20 November 2015: ). The installations were undertaken in partnership with French energy provider EDF, Schneider Electric, Aeroports de Paris, Paris City Council, and France's national railway company, SNCF. Renault has invested USD1.33 billion in the Tangiers plant, which builds the Lodgy, Sandero, and Dokker models, and the Logan MCV will be a new addition to the facility's output. The Tangiers plant exported around 94% of its production in 2015, according to IHS Automotive data. In 2015, Renault Group produced 2.8 million vehicles worldwide, of which nearly 10%, or 288,050 vehicles, were produced at its Moroccan plants. Furthermore, in April, Renault, along with nearly 15 component suppliers, signed an agreement with the Moroccan authorities to build a new strategic project dubbed ""Renault Ecosystem"" (see\~ Morocco: 11 April 2016:\~ ). The new project, worth MAD10 billion (USD1.04 billion), aims to develop a ""global supply platform"" for the automaker. \"

The agreement marks an unprecedented milestone in the global effort to combat climate change. Under the landmark agreement, nations have agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and focus efforts and investments toward a low-carbon, resilient and sustainable future. The goal is to keep global average temperatures from rising well below 2&deg;C with the aim of working to limit it to 1.5&deg;C. &nbsp; The question now turns to implementing the terms of the agreement, helping nations meet their goals and, more critically, ratchet them further. Next week, the world meets in Marrakesh, Morocco, during COP22 to do just that. The International Energy Agency will soon release World Energy Outlook 2016, which will highlight the various pathways to reach these targets. The report this year looks at individual country pledges and examines how close \- or far \- nations are from reaching these goals. It outlines a course that would limit the rise in global temperature to below 2&deg;C and, for the first time, it also plots possible pathways for meeting the much more ambitious 1.5&deg;C goal.  Let\' s not underestimate the task ahead, said Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA.  Limiting carbon emissions and changing our energy systems is a monumental challenge. But the IEA is working with governments around the world to help identify solutions and show how it can be done. The Paris Agreement will transform the global energy system for decades to come. WEO-2016 will examine how a post-Paris world redefines the idea of energy security, particularly in the power sector, the frontline in the fight against climate change. &nbsp; WEO-2016 offers the most comprehensive analysis of what this transformation of the energy sector might look like, thanks to its energy projections to 2040. It reviews the key opportunities and challenges ahead for renewable energy, the central pillar of the low-carbon energy transition, as well as the critical role for energy efficiency. \"

According to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in Astana today, the two partners will explore ways to promote energy efficiency in the gas sector. A more efficient use of energy and reduced losses will strengthen energy security and help Kazakhstan cut greenhouse gas emissions. The document was signed by EBRD First Vice President Phil Bennett and Rustam Suleimanov, the General Director of KazTransGas. The EBRD and KazTransGas, which is mainly engaged in the transportation, sale, exploration and production of natural gas in Kazakhstan, will examine specific possibilities for modernisation and energy efficiency improvements in gas compressor stations and gas networks, systems responsible for the monitoring and control of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions and of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The EBRD is a leader in sustainable energy investments, including in other countries of Central Asia and eastern Europe with similar energy efficiency challenge, and in research and technical cooperation related to energy and resource efficiency. The cooperation framework will allow KazTransGas to benefit from EBRD expertise in this area. The EBRD and KazTransGas started cooperating in May this year, when the EBRD committed nearly EUR300 million to two landmark projects in Kazakhstan aimed at the modernisation of gas networks and the fuel switch from coal to gas for heat and power generation with the upgrade of the Bozoi underground gas storage to help it reach full capacity. The signing of the MoU comes shortly before the COP22 climate talks in Morocco. As a result of the historic COP21 talks in Paris last year, Kazakhstan has undertaken to reduce its CO2 emissions and increase the sustainable use of energy. The EBRD has consistently supported Kazakhstan's policy to build up a 'green economy' by financing the first solar and wind power renewable energy projects, a range of energy efficiency projects, as well as by supporting the introduction of renewable energy law and supporting. The EBRD invested close to US$ 7.5 billion in Kazakhstan's economy to date. Addressing global challenges such as climate change is one of the Bank's priorities.

Organized by the Africa Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the side event was an opportunity for experts to showcase a number of initiatives on collaborative research and capacity development, which included the Southern African Regional Universities Association (SARUA) Programme for Climate Change Capacity Development (PCCCD); and WASCAL (the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use). The SARUA Programme for Climate Change Capacity Development (PCCCD), has led to a consortium of seven universities from five SADC countries developing a regional Master's curriculum in Climate Change and Sustainable Development, based on the principles of trans-disciplinarity and innovation; while WASCAL pools the expertise of ten West African countries and Germany to strengthen climate change research infrastructure and capacity. Ms. Penny Urquhart, Independent analyst and member of the SARUA Curriculum Review Team said there is a need for funding in order to scale up these initiatives to a continental scale to support Africa's development aspirations, reduce vulnerability, increase resilience and optimise low-carbon options for growth. Other speakers included Daouda Kone, Director of the WASCAL doctoral programme in Climate Change and Biodiversity, Universit\'e9 Felix Houphouet Boigny, C\'f4te d'Ivoire; Dr Wilfran Moufouma Okia, Head of Science, Technical Support Unit, IPCC and; Professor Roland Roesch, Senior Programme Office, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The event was moderated by Mr Linus Mofor, ACPC Senior Natural Resources Officer responsible for energy, infrastructure and climate change. In summing up the session, Ms Simbisai Zhanje, Project Manager at the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) said that while capacity is important, capability is equally significant as the context in which implementation takes place can be an enabler or barrier.

A more efficient use of energy and reduced losses will strengthen energy security and help Kazakhstan cut greenhouse gas emissions. The document was signed by EBRD First Vice President Phil Bennett and Rustam Suleimanov, the General Director of KazTransGas. The EBRD and KazTransGas, which is mainly engaged in the transportation, sale, exploration and production of natural gas in Kazakhstan, will examine specific possibilities for modernisation and energy efficiency improvements in gas compressor stations and gas networks, systems responsible for the monitoring and control of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions and of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The EBRD is a leader in sustainable energy investments, including in other countries of Central Asia and eastern Europe with similar energy efficiency challenge, and in research and technical cooperation related to energy and resource efficiency. The cooperation framework will allow KazTransGas to benefit from EBRD expertise in this area. The EBRD and KazTransGas started cooperating in May this year, when the EBRD committed nearly &euro;300 million to two landmark projects in Kazakhstan aimed at the modernisation of gas networks and the fuel switch from coal to gas for heat and power generation with the upgrade of the Bozoi underground gas storage to help it reach full capacity. The signing of the MoU comes shortly before the COP22 climate talks in Morocco. As a result of the historic COP21 talks in Paris last year, Kazakhstan has undertaken to reduce its CO2 emissions and increase the sustainable use of energy. The EBRD has consistently supported Kazakhstan\' s policy to build up a  green economy by financing the first solar and wind power renewable energy projects, a range of energy efficiency projects, as well as by supporting the introduction of renewable energy law and supporting. The EBRD invested close to US$ 7.5 billion in Kazakhstan\' s economy to date. Addressing global challenges such as climate change is one of the Bank\' s priorities. \"

""Climate change will make a difficult situation much worse, and will affect millions of people in the Middle East and North Africa region,"" World Bank MENA Vice-President Hafez Ghanem told a press conference at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""Countries in the region are aware of the challenges, and have begun taking action."" Agriculture in the MENA region is especially vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation. As global temperatures rise, they will rise even faster in MENA, causing more frequent and severe droughts. The 2015 drought in Morocco destroyed more than half the wheat harvest and led to a 1.5 per cent drop in the country's Gross Domestic Output. During a panel discussion on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Initiative on Climate Resilience at COP 22 on Friday, Saudi Arabia's Chief Climate Negotiator, Khalid Abuleif, said that the region ""is going to see a lot of challenges from an ecosystem point of view and from a socio-economic point of view."" The challenge is not only about reducing gas emissions but also about raising ""our resilience."" Mr. Abuleif stressed that as Saudi Arabia is diversifying its economy, any new sector will be put under regulations that will address sustainability and climate resilience. He added that his country is focusing especially on water management, ""making sure we are using water in a sustainable manner,"" and on the protection of coastal zones. Tunisia has announced a 41 per cent emission reduction by 2030. Most importantly, 13 per cent will be based on national efforts, while the rest will come from support provided by the international community. A week after COP 22 concludes, Tunisia will host an international investment conference (29-30 November) to mobilize $ 2.4 billion dollars, 40 per cent of which will be allocated to projects pertaining to the 'green economy,' with a focus on renewable energy. In Morocco, to meet the country's commitments on climate action, the Bank Al Maghrib (Central Bank of Morocco) recently unveiled the road map of the Moroccan financial sector in climate financing. That country has also taken steps to adapt its agriculture, with better water management and more climate-resistant crops, while also lowering its emissions by eliminating most energy subsidies and with the construction of the large solar plant in Ouarzazate, World Bank senior official Hafez Ghanem noted. ""This is the kind of comprehensive climate action we will support across the region, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable,"" he added. The World Bank Group announced on Tuesday a new plan to ramp up support for countries in the MENA region by nearly doubling the portion of Bank financing dedicated to climate action, taking it to around $ 1.5 billion dollars per year by 2020. The plan focuses on four priorities: food and water security; sustainable cities adapted to new climate conditions; the transition to low-carbon energy; and the protection of the poorest that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change. The current Conference follows the adoption by 196 UNFCCC States Parties last December, of the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved, which aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. Before the meeting wraps up on Saturday, 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action.

Its goal is to federate the main actors in the field of clean technologies, in order to create synergies, promote profitable solutions to the world's most pressing environmental and health challenges, and give credible advice to governments. Less than four months after the landing of the first ever solar flight around the world, accomplished by Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, the Solar Impulse Foundation is launching, at COP22 , the World Alliance for Clean Technologies - a second phase in the realization of Bertrand Piccard's vision that clean technologies can accomplish impossible goals and offer tangible solutions to solve many of the challenges facing global society today, as well as reach the objectives of the Climate Action Agenda. The Alliance's overarching ambition is to globally advance the cause of clean technologies, which it defines as £ny practical solution that allows to bridge the gap between ecology and economy. They are not limited to the production of renewable energy, but encompass technologies, systems, know-hows or processes that protect the environment, improve health, increase energy efficiency or save natural resources, while creating jobs, generating profit and sustaining growth'. 'We need to embrace clean technologies, not because they are 'eco-logical,' but because they are 'logical,'' said Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation. 'Even if climate change didn't exist, energy efficient technologies would make sense to create jobs, generate profit and boost economic development, while also reducing CO2 emissions and protecting natural resources.' Until now, there was no such organization, gathering the clean technologies stakeholders around the world; hence the Alliance will bring together start-ups, companies, institutions and organizations producing, implementing or supporting the use of clean technologies. Together, the members will share experiences and create synergies in order to improve the overall value chain and demonstrate concrete solutions to support governments, corporations and institutions in reaching their environmental and health targets, advising them depending on their specific situation. Commenting on the launch of the Alliance, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: 'The Solar Impulse flight showed the world that it is possible to push the limits of technology in order to build the foundation for a sustainable future. By harnessing this and other innovative technologies, we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.' 'Initiatives like the World Alliance for Clean Technologies are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean 'Initiatives like the World Alliance for Clean Technologies are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean technologies that already exist or are under development,' added Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, who was present at the launch. 'We need the best and brightest minds - from the North and the South - to deliver clean technologies that can collectively accomplish the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and all the Sustainable Development Goals to catalyze a healthy and prosperous future for all.' Richard Northcote, Chief Sustainability Officer at Covestro, shared: 'We are delighted to continue our relationship with Solar Impulse though the World Alliance for Clean Technologies. Our contribution to the Solar Impulse project proved that we have the technology to make the world a brighter place and through this alliance we intend to accelerate the implementation of these technologies to tackle the challenges society faces while generating business growth.' 'The success of Solar Impulse has proven to the world how powerful collaborative innovation between visionary entrepreneurs and companies that believe in science and research can be to deliver technological breakthroughs. This is just the beginning of what open collaboration and innovation can do to combat climate change,' concluded Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, CEO of Solvay, Solar Impulse's first partner. The Solar Impulse Foundation offers to the Alliance its administrative support, as well as the media, political and institutional relations developed during the round the world solar flight. The Alliance is funded thanks to partners such as Covestro, Solvay and Nestle, among others, as well as private donors. As Bertrand Piccard said upon the final landing in Abu Dhabi 'If an airplane can fly around the world without a drop fuel, clean technologies can undoubtedly be implemented on the ground to make a cleaner, more efficient and richer world.' About the World Alliance for Clean Technologies The World Alliance for Clean Technologies brings together start-ups, companies, institutions and organizations producing, implementing or supporting the use of clean technologies. Together, the members share experiences and create synergies in order to improve the overall value chain and demonstrate concrete solutions to support governments, corporations and institutions in reaching their environmental and health targets, advising them depending on their specific situation.

The global ocean is fundamental to sustaining life on Earth. It is a major carbon sink; it absorbs heat, and produces half the oxygen we breathe. It sustains the lives and livelihoods of the coastal and island communities who call it home, and who rely on its bounty to meet their nutritional needs. The important role our oceans play was recognized at the 43rd Session of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Nairobi, Kenya earlier this year, which decided to prepare a special, scientific report on climate change and the oceans. But while oceans are key to mitigating climate change, a warming planet also places them, and the services they provide, at great risk. Climate variability and change, habitat degradation and ocean acidification all pose additional risks to the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans, and to the well-being of dependent coastal and island communities. Ocean Climate Action Announcements Made in Marrakech At today's event, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the World Bank and the African Development Bank has announced the African Package for Climate-Resilient Ocean Economies. This ambitious package of technical and financial assistance will support ocean economies in Africa, and build greater resilience of coastal areas to climate change, tailoring approaches based on the countries' specific priorities and objectives. The initiative will mobilize 500-900 million USD and implement programs linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation over the period 2017-2020. The Kingdom of Morocco has announced its Blue Belt Initiative aimed at building the resilience of coastal communities and promoting sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in keeping with SDG14 expectations. Focus areas will include integrated coastal monitoring systems, sustainable fisheries and aquaculture throughout the entire value chain. Solutions for adaptation and contributions to curbing greenhouse gas are proposed as part of a priority roadmap for implementation. The initiative is supported by an investment plan and capacity building program of 60 million USD over the period 2017-2020, building on the Blue Growth initiative launched at COP 21 in Paris. COP22 Ocean Action partners released the Strategic Action Roadmap on Oceans and Climate: 2016 to 2021, which provides a vision for action regarding oceans and climate in the next five years, addressing six ocean and climate issue areas: the central role of oceans in regulating climate, mitigation, adaptation, displacement, financing, and capacity development. ""These ambitious programmes aimed at strengthening the resilience of African coastal communities are critical to meeting the challenges and opportunities of climate change - especially for vulnerable Small Island Development States,"" according to Maria Helena Semedo, FAO's Deputy Director-General for Natural Resources. ""African coastal communities are some of the most affected by climate change. FAO is fully engaged and ready to be at the heart of these significant developments to work alongside countries and communities to reduce their vulnerabilities, build their resilience, and maximize opportunities emerging from climate change."" ""The World Bank is pleased to be a part of the international mobilization of financing in response to the Mauritius Communiqu\'e9. The package presented today could make a significant contribution to meeting the adaptation needs of African countries as they develop their ocean economies. We plan to ramp up our own concessional financing in this area and look forward to working with our partners to increase the effectiveness of overall development assistance"" said Laura Tuck, World Bank Group Vice President for Sustainable Development. Dr. Biliana Cicin-Sain, Global Ocean Forum, noted that ""the Global Strategic Action Initiative on Oceans and Climate (involving Parties, IGOs, NGOs, academic institutions, private sector groups, and local authorities from all world regions) will implement actions identified in the Roadmap to safeguard the health of the oceans and the wellbeing of coastal and island populations, reporting on progress at the yearly COPs."" The full day of discussions addressed numerous challenges faced by oceans under climate change scenarios. Sessions addressed challenges to food security and resilience, adaptation challenges and solutions, country mitigation efforts, access to finance and capacity building, and science solutions to moving forward to achieve SDG 14. About Global Climate Action France and Morocco's global climate champions have set out their detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. Message from the Champions ""A year after COP 21, the great dynamic of climate action is now growing strong. As we all gather to Marrakech time has come to start to take stock of what has been achieved during the last year. To be consistent with the long-term goals, all actors will have to work together, not only to achieve the national targets of the NDCs, but also to go further and bridge the gap of emissions. This sense of urgency should guide us all into accelerating immediate efforts and delivering ambitious action. We must identify what concrete policy options and what tools we will have to mobilize in the short term. The science is clear: the path towards achieving the long-term goals should bring us to peaking GHG emissions by 2020. This is a challenge, and we are not there yet. On the current trends, we will be in 2030 between 11 to 14 GT above Paris-compatible pathways. The purpose of these days is to strengthen all efforts and take them to the next level to stay on track for the objectives: stay well below 2\'b0C and if possible 1,5\'b0C, increase adaptation and resilience capacities and reorient financial flows. It is our responsibility, as champions, to make the link between the real world and the COP process. Political leaders from all around the world should hear and be inspired by the solutions at our reach.""

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK204","New centre aims to help financial investors manage climate risks","November 14, 2016 Monday","M2 PressWIRE","November 14, 2016 A new centre that will help businesses to make better green investment decisions is being launched today. The new Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College Business School will work with companies to manage the risks and financial opportunities posed by climate change. The centre will help businesses make better financial decisions when choosing to invest in technologies that help stabilize the climate, whilst providing a good return on investment. These areas include solar and wind energy, and energy efficient transport. The centre will be the first of its kind to tackle green investment issues within a leading business school, building on Imperial College London's global reputation for innovative research on climate change. Researchers will help investors identify the risks and financial opportunities posed by climate disruption and address the current lack of information on emerging industrial sectors such as clean energy, energy efficiency and climate-resilient infrastructure. Researchers from Imperial College Business School will examine how large firms, SMEs and entrepreneurs are already responding to climate change and will recommend new approaches to solving investment issues. The centre will support research by established experts and emerging scholars on the business models, financial instruments, and investment strategies that are taking shape in the new climate economy. It aims to contribute to the global debate on climate investment through academic research, and collaborations with businesses and policy-makers, to address the key issues. Dr Charles Donovan, Head of the Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College Business School, said: ""Every year a trillion dollars of investment in the energy sector could be wasted simply because the majority of investors don't understand the risks or opportunities presented by climate change. However, until now there simply hasn't been enough good information to give business leaders the ability to accurately assess the risks and returns of making a transition to a low-carbon economy."" He continued: ""Climate change has already created major political and technological changes that are disrupting a number of business sectors. Adapting intelligently to these changes is not just about the environmental agenda for companies, it's about how they survive and thrive amidst a climate of risk. The new research centre will help businesses avoid the serious impact of climate change, whilst raising the prospects for global economic growth."" The work of the centre will be divided into three main themes: tools for financing climate-ready infrastructure; routes to sourcing clean energy investing (new forms of investing and the barriers to business growth); and managing firms in carbon-constrained economies (financial returns on sustainable business management and the impact of carbon pricing). The new centre follows the launch of a new MSc in Climate Change, Management and Finance, which started in September 2016. The one year's Master's degree was launched by Imperial College Business School in partnership with the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, which is Imperial's hub for climate change-related activities. The course aims to equip graduates with the skills needed to tackle the business challenges caused by climate change.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK205","-Carrefour presents its commitments to promoting sustainable fishing and tackling illegal fishing; The aim being for 50% of all fish to be sourced using Carrefo....","December 2, 2016 Friday","ENP Newswire","Carrefour is implementing a number of initiatives to help it reach its target of 50% of all seafood products sold at its seafood and frozen food counters being the result of a sustainable supply approach by 2020. These initiatives involve: Giving preference to abundant species, MSC-certified sustainable fishing products and fishing methods that have less of an impact on the environment Suspending the sale of endangered species Developing a responsible approach to aquaculture by selecting fish farms that have adopted good practices and by giving preference to responsible aquaculture ASC-certified products Supporting sustainable local fishing through partnerships with local organisations Showcasing the diversity of seafood products Carrefour has announced three new breakthroughs at the Ocean & Sustainable Fishing conference: Carrefour is now working on adapting the 'Professionals' guide to tackling illegal fishing' for the French market, alongside the Environment Justice Foundation (EJF), SeaWeb Europe and the WWF. This guide is available to all professionals in the sector so they can better understand the issues associated with illegal fishing and implement the necessary measures for minimising risks at the various stages of the supply chain. Carrefour is also breaking new ground by entering into a partnership with SafetyNet, a start-up company which has developed a new selective fishing technique which involves subsea lamp systems attached to the fishing net. This system helps fishermen to comply with the new regulations, ensuring that they only capture the species that they want to capture. At the COP22 conference in Marrakesh, Carrefour announced its decision to do away with all single-use checkout bags between now and 2020 in its consolidated stores throughout the world. With support from the Consumer Goods Forum, the retailer is launching an international initiative to reduce - and eventually do away with altogether - the free distribution of single-news checkout bags. And Carrefour wants to break new ground with its suppliers, reducing the pollution of the planet's oceans by other forms of plastic. As far as Carrefour is concerned, doing our job well means offering our customers high-quality products and a diversified range of food; it means taking action and investing to limit the depletion of our planet's natural resources; and it means ensuring the long-term life of our offering.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK206","Interview with: Abdulrahman Jawahery, President, Gulf Petrochemicals Industries Company (GPIC), on sustainability issues","Oxford Business Group: Economic Views"," ","HYPERLINK https://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/sites/default/files/BH17_Industry_EV_Jawahery.png https://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/sites/default/files/BH17_Industry_EV_Jawahery.png Why should investment continue despite the current economic climate? ABDULRAHMAN JAWAHERY: The decision to build a HYPERLINK liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Bahrain is the best thing to happen to its energy strategy since the discovery of oil decades ago, and is a perfect example of why investment should continue or accelerate even at a time of low prices. The new LNG terminal is a requirement to fuel sustainable development that would be practically impossible\~ given Bahrain's resources. Currently the country has at best 10-30 years of gas reserves, and this development will enable downstream industrial development that would not have been possible given domestic energy needs. In order to add value for shareholders and to remain competitive and sustainable in this evolving and challenging global market, companies need to grow. In line with this outlook, we will be embarking on a major expansion project to build a multi-billion dollar ammonia and granular urea plant adjacent to our existing facilities. Furthermore, Bahrain has proven to be a safe investment destination for investors from across the GCC, returning a steady investment for years rather than volatile shifts or unsustainable growth. How would you rate Bahrain in the sustainability of its industrial operations? JAWAHERY: Sustainability as a concept is still in its infancy in the GCC region. However, organisations have started to recognise that to remain competitive they have to embed sustainability in their strategies and business plans. This is not just about financial performance gaining from sustainability through increasing employee loyalty, consumer reputation or demonstrating competitiveness and lower risk to potential sources of equity, but also about creating the space for innovation. Sustainability issues are not going away, and they will continue to intensify over the next 10 years. This is not an individual crisis, but a collective one, which means that these challenges can be addressed through collaborating and by fostering a culture of transparency and accountability, which can be done through institutional reporting mechanisms. Focusing on sustainability ensures that new plans are forward-thinking and on the cutting edge of potential changes in process and business. In short, engaging in sustainability initiatives can simultaneously increase success and add the value to society at the local level and at the international level. Bahrain committed to reducing its CO2\~emissions at the 2015 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris. Working with the Supreme Council for Environment to develop a biodiversity online database and strategy for the kingdom will ensure this stays a priority in the future. How does Bahrain's fertiliser production fit into the global marketplace? JAWAHERY: Having been fully affiliated with the International Fertiliser Association since 1985 and a full board member since 2005, GPIC has also helped shape the direction of the Arab Fertiliser Association (AFA), holding the chairmanship since 2015. The AFA has a membership of more than 166 companies from 30 countries, and aims to assist members with production issues through the exchange of information and experiences. The fertiliser market was the eighth largest among chemical markets in 2015, with Asia ranking as the largest contributor to demand because of the presence of large farming communities in China and India that are now using fertilisers. Per capita consumption is also increasing because of a growing demand for water soluble fertilisers in many parts of the world. Global fertiliser turnover is between $200-300bn per year, with Bahrain exporting around $195m per year. Assuming no major changes to agriculture market fundamentals, global fertiliser demand is set to expand around 1.9% in 2017, which equates to an estimated 186.6m tonnes, compared to Bahrain's total production of around 1.46m tonnes.\~ \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK207","Efforts to improve waste management in Morocco yield positive results","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","Over the last three years, the government has accelerated improvements to the country's recycling, waste management and sanitation infrastructure as part of the roll out of Morocco's Charter for Environment adopted in 2014 and in preparation for the 22nd UN Conference on Climate Change in Marrakech in November 2016. Managing Waste\~ The government initiated a Dh40bn ((EURO)3.7bn) national programme in 2008 aimed at improving waste collection and recycling, as well as overhauling the country's landfills. The strategy has borne fruit, with official waste collection rates doubling from 44% to 85.2% between 2008 and 2016. This has been aided in part by the construction of 22 new landfill and trash treatment centres ( centres d'enfouissement et de valorisation, CEV), which provide a capacity of 3.37m tonnes of waste handling per year - the equivalent of roughly 53% of Morocco's total household waste. Three additional CEVs are currently under construction in Tangiers, Casablanca and Khenifra, which should enable Morocco to treat 81% of its household waste upon completion. In conjunction with this, the authorities have also set out to address household behaviour via the National Programme for Household Waste Management of 2008, which looks to promote recycling and waste reconversion for a selection of highly polluting products. The strategy is primarily focused on polychrobiphenyls, batteries, paper-cardboard and plastic-based products. ""Our main objective has been to consolidate the principle of shared responsibility by encouraging industries to take their responsibilities and organise themselves to reduce pollution,"" according to Hakima El Haite, minister of environment. To this end a series of eco-taxes have been implemented for waste batteries, prompting producers and importers to create a consortium for recovering and reprocessing waste batteries. ""Similarly in the plastic sector, we have implemented an eco-tax whose revenues will finance the development of a recycling channel of plastics products,"" El Haite said. Authorities are also working on setting up new recycling channels for lubricants, tyres and edible oils, as well as conducting studies on the potential for recycling electronic waste, construction and demolition waste, and spare car parts waste. In addition, the state is looking to provide support to what is a predominantly informal and small-scale workforce that has accounted for the majority of activity in the recycling and waste collection sector in the past. ""We aim at setting up a structured collecting and sorting channel, which will include the rag-pickers that still play a major role in recycling activities,"" El Haite told local media. The state expects that this drive will lead to the creation of 10,000 and 11,000 jobs in the liquid and solid waste management segments, respectively, by 2020. Water Sanitation Government efforts also extend to water management, with the creation of the Dh50bn ((EURO)4.6bn) National Programme for Water Treatment in 2005. The project aims to generalise the collection, treatment and reuse of 80% of waste-water by 2020, and 100% by 2030. Since its implementation, the programme has led to steady improvements, with a total of 750m cu metres of wastewaster treated in 2015 compared to 600m cu metres in 2005. The water system connection rate has also increased to 74% from 70% in 2005, while the sewage treatment rate stood at around 42% in 2015 compared to 8% in 2005. This is in large part a result of the construction of a vast new water sanitation infrastructure, comprising 102 wastewater treatment plants, with an additional 63 installations currently under construction. Lastly, the National Strategy for Water launched in 2009 aims to save and mobilise 2.5bn cu metres of water through projects related to rainwater capture, non-conventional water sources and dams. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK209","Japan Tobacco International | WHO Summit: Censorship Continues","November 4, 2016 Friday","M2 PressWIRE","November 4, 2016 Geneva - A worrying culture of censorship is emerging behind the scenes of the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP7) to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), taking place in Greater Noida, India from November 7 to 12. Those journalists and members of the public who were thrown out of the public gallery at COP6 (Moscow) in 2014 will not be fooled by the FCTC Secretariat's new, supposedly transparent accreditation process for COP7. Proposals to be discussed at the summit, which if adopted will formalize censorship practices in WHO meetings, contain plans for the compulsory screening of media attendees and any individual or organization who directly or indirectly consults with the tobacco industry, including government representatives and experts with legitimate credentials . Michiel Reerink, Global Regulatory Strategy Vice President at JTI, said: ""The COP is promoting a culture of exclusion and secrecy, where debates are held behind closed doors. This contradicts the fundamental principles of international law. The fact that this is happening in the largest democracy on the planet is a double insult, as individual rights are held dear there"". The extent of the COP's lack of transparency and accountability is highlighted in a recently published report by Mr. Jean-Claude Piris, an expert in international public law. The report, commissioned by JTI and sent to the WHO Director General, the FCTC Convention Secretariat and the Bureau of COP, concludes that following COP6's decision to change the Rules of Procedure behind closed doors, there is an opportunity and a need to improve transparency in how the FCTC COP works. According to Mr. Piris' report, these rules discriminate against the accreditation of observers, restrict the access to key documents, and allow no mechanism for complaint. This is in stark contrast with the decision-making of COP22 on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('UNFCCC') which will be held in Marrakech from November 7 to 18, where a policy of disclosure and openness has been adopted and representatives of businesses, alongside public policy officials, are invited to play their role in finding workable solutions . At COP7, delegations predominantly led by public health officials will be discussing issues which go beyond their competences such as Agricultural practices, Trade and Investment, Dispute Settlement and Liability - ""topics that should be debated by the appropriate experts in governments"", emphasizes Mr. Reerink. Michiel Reerink concludes: ""The FCTC COP has lost sight of its aim to improve the world's health, and has instead become ideology-driven, taking on a fight against businesses, tobacco growers, vapers and smokers, when it should open itself up to scrutiny and hear a diverse range of views. It has become an expensive, tax-payer funded closed shop"". \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK212","Union for the Mediterranean's Ministerial Conference on Energy","December 1, 2016 Thursday","FinancialWire","ROME, Italy -- Only a few days after the closing of the COP22 conference in Marrakech and concomitantly with the opening of the second edition of the Rome Med Dialogues, today the Farnesina is hosting the Ministerial Conference on Energy of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), with the participation of 43 Countries from the two shores of the Mediterranean sitting around the Mediterranean Table designed by Michelangelo Pistoletto. The meeting, co-chaired by the European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, and Jordan's Energy Minister, Ibrahim Saif, will engage ministers and diplomats in a discussion on revamping energy cooperation as a source of wellbeing for the whole Region. Energy traditionally represents one of the soundest and most crucial areas of cooperation among Mediterranean Countries and their Neighbours, which are consistently among Italy's and Europe's top providers of hydrocarbons. Energy is increasingly becoming a strategic growth factor that Europe and the Southern Shore of the Mediterranean must commit to share in promoting a common sustainable development. Also thanks to Italy's active support of the new lines of cooperation outlined in the Agenda 2030, energy cooperation between the EU and the Mediterranean Countries will increasingly underpin Europe's energy policy with a view to fully exploiting the potential that it can fulfil as a key element in stabilising areas of conflict. The Union for the Mediterranean The UfM's main aim is to tackle the three priorities closely correlated to the region: human development, stability and integration through regional cooperation, and dialogue and the implementation of concrete projects and initiatives with a tangible impact on the citizens of the region, especially young people. In the aftermath of the Arab revolutions, since 2011 the UfM, in agreement with the European Commission and major European financial institutions, has been focusing its attention on infrastructure. Italy, through the ""EuroMed"" Conference held in Rome on 19 November 2014, has succeeded to assert a policy aimed at relaunching multicultural cooperation in the energy sector, with the creation of three separate cooperation platforms respectively on gas, renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and on establishing a regional power supply market. The three platforms, which were launched in 2015, now provide a reliable framework of reference in implementing cooperation programmes financed by the European Commission. The last platform launched was the one on renewable energy sources, in compliance with the COP22 conference recently held in Marrakech. Off-shore gas and oil fields in the eastern Mediterranean Energy is one of the soundest and most crucial areas of cooperation between the Mediterranean Countries and their Neighbours on the Southern Shore, which are consistently Italy's primary suppliers of hydrocarbons. Also thanks to Italy's constant and progressive action within the European Union, energy cooperation between the EU and the Mediterranean Countries is increasingly placed at the centre of Europe's energy policy, also with a view to improving security by diversifying energy supply routes and sources, which is the priority objective of the Energy Union. The EU'S Energy Diplomacy Action Plan was developed and is constantly updated to achieve this objective, attributing utmost importance to capitalising on the energy dialogue between Mediterranean Countries and by fully exploiting the potential that energy cooperation can offer in terms of stabilising the areas of conflict. The recent finds of gas in the eastern Mediterranean represent only a portion of the new gas fields in the so-called ""Levantine basin"" - which includes maritime areas of Israel, Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria - and lay the groundwork for a new form of cooperation and for possibly rebalancing the regional energy market. Following the success of these exploration activities, Israel has become a natural gas producer and a gas exporter for future decades. (The Tamar and Leviathan fields are estimated to contain gas reserves of almost 900 billion cubic metres and the gas fields offshore of Cyprus are estimated to contain 128 billion cubic metres). In August 2015, ENI made the major offshore gas field discovery in the Mediterranean, in the so-called Zohr exploratory prospect. The gas field has an estimated in place gas production volume of up to 850 billion cubic metres (5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent) on an area of approximately 100 square kilometres. The development plan foresees the start of production by the end of 2017 and a progressive increase in production to a volume of approximately 75 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (approximately 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day) by 2019. These gas finds have given new momentum to cooperation between Egypt, Israel, Cyprus and Greece through the Cyprus-Egypt-Greece and Cyprus-Israel-Greece trilateral agreements, which Italy looks on with favour while relying on the networking action that ENI is carrying out in all the Eastern Mediterranean Countries in which it operates. The ELMED Project The ELMED (ELectricit\'e9 MEDiterran\'e9enne) electricity interconnection project between Italy and Tunisia stemmed from a 2009 agreement between TERNA and its Tunisian counterpart STEG (creating a mixed company), which was followed by a 2008 Agreement between the two competent Ministries. It envisaged the creation of a power production district in Tunisia (producing 1,200 MW, 800 MW of which earmarked for the Italian market) and a 1,000 MW export capacity submarine power cable (of approximately 230 km) from Tunisia to Italy. The cost estimate ranged from 1.7 and 2.2 billion euros, and it was to become operational in 2015/2016. The project was recently revised by eliminating the power production district in Tunisia and replacing the Tunisia-Italy export flow with a two-way flow (on the short term, the cable is planned to be used to export 600 MW of electricity from Italy to Tunisia, with the possibility of doubling this volume). The cost is estimated to total 600 million euros. Distributed by APO on behalf of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK www.m2.com )) \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK213","EMF-ECBC to unveil Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) initiative","November 8, 2016","Global Capital Euroweek","The presentation aims to show how it might be possible to use mortgage financing to advance energy efficiency improvements in properties in line with the COP21 climate and energy targets that were established last year in Paris. See here for more on theEEM initiative. The Paris agreement highlighted the need for $100bn of global financing per annum for the next four years in order to mitigate the effects of global warming. While much of this could be achieved with public financing, it is also necessary to compliment this with new and independent sources of private finance. Delivering COP21 targets The EMF-ECBC's pan-European EEM initiative was launched in September in partnership with major banks and mortgage lenders, as well as businesses and organisations from the building and energy industries. The project partners include the Ca'Foscari University of Venice, RICS, European Regional Network of Green Building Councils, E.ON and SAFE Goethe University Frankfurt. Luca Bertalot, Secretary General of the EMF-ECBC, said there is ""huge potential"" for the mortgage financing industry to support energy efficiency and help implement European Union climate targets, noting that buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in Europe and that the mortgage market is equal to 53% of the European Union's GDP. A pan-European standard The ultimate objective of EEM is to design a pan-European standardised procedure for originating energy efficient mortgage loans that incentivise home owners to invest in energy efficient improvements to their properties. See here for more on the EMF-ECBC's action plan. Based on a set of energy efficiency indicators, lenders would offer a discounted interest rate based on the improvement in the energy rating or performance of the property. Lower capital charge? Regulated investors could also be incentivised to buy EEM collateralised covered bonds on the basis that such improvements should lead to a reduction in the probability of default, an increase the value the property and, hopefully, a lower risk weighting. Energy efficient mortgage loans would also offer investors some protection against a potential ""~brown discount' on their portfolios. A brown discount could be levied on portfolios that fail to meet certain energy efficient thresholds. The EMF-ECBC presentation is set to take place during the afternoon at a side event organised by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Partnership on Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC).

The companies welcomed the ratification of the Paris agreement and its entering into force before the COP22 . This shows once again the leadership of the European Union in the fight against climate change. The EU must now turn its long term climate commitments (80-95% of greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to 1990 by 2050) into concrete measures in order to align the EU ETS with the objectives agreed in Paris.The reform proposed by the European Commission, whilst welcome, will not be sufficient to live up to Europe&#39;s ambitious low-carbon agenda and to secure the shift to low carbon technologies. A functioning EU ETS is critical to make the energy transition possible in a cost effective way while providing the private sector with clear and robust price signals to invest in low carbon and carbon free technologies.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) investments of almost USD 2.5 trillion are required in the EU&#39;s power sector over the period 2015-2040 to reach its climate goals. The energy sector accounts for almost 60% of greenhouse gas emissions covered by the EU ETS. Policymakers must go beyond measures taken so far to strengthen ETS (""backloading""/ Market Stability Reserve) and the current proposal under discussion. The negotiations of its ""4th phase"" (2021-2030) provide a unique opportunity to fix the European carbon market.In this context, a combination of short and long term measures to fix the EU ETS is needed, no single measure being able to do that alone.Therefore, new initiatives must go beyond the current texts under discussion with the aim of: Strengthening the structure of the carbon market and restoring the investors&#39; confidence by providing visibility and predictability; Fostering robust price signals on the market - a significant increase in CO2 prices is necessary to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of the power sector in the future.Measures adopted at EU level should be preferred over uncoordinated national initiatives that undermine the ETS and disrupt the level-playing field in the European Union.These proposals must go hand in hand with efficient carbon leakage provisions to protect the competitiveness of European industries exposed to international trade. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK217","Union for the Mediterranean's Ministerial Conference on Energy","December 1, 2016 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","December 1, 2016 ROME, Italy -- Only a few days after the closing of the COP22 conference in Marrakech and concomitantly with the opening of the second edition of the Rome Med Dialogues, today the Farnesina is hosting the Ministerial Conference on Energy of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), with the participation of 43 Countries from the two shores of the Mediterranean sitting around the Mediterranean Table designed by Michelangelo Pistoletto. The meeting, co-chaired by the European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, and Jordan's Energy Minister, Ibrahim Saif, will engage ministers and diplomats in a discussion on revamping energy cooperation as a source of wellbeing for the whole Region. Energy traditionally represents one of the soundest and most crucial areas of cooperation among Mediterranean Countries and their Neighbours, which are consistently among Italy's and Europe's top providers of hydrocarbons. Energy is increasingly becoming a strategic growth factor that Europe and the Southern Shore of the Mediterranean must commit to share in promoting a common sustainable development. Also thanks to Italy's active support of the new lines of cooperation outlined in the Agenda 2030, energy cooperation between the EU and the Mediterranean Countries will increasingly underpin Europe's energy policy with a view to fully exploiting the potential that it can fulfil as a key element in stabilising areas of conflict. The Union for the Mediterranean The UfM's main aim is to tackle the three priorities closely correlated to the region: human development, stability and integration through regional cooperation, and dialogue and the implementation of concrete projects and initiatives with a tangible impact on the citizens of the region, especially young people. In the aftermath of the Arab revolutions, since 2011 the UfM, in agreement with the European Commission and major European financial institutions, has been focusing its attention on infrastructure. Italy, through the ""EuroMed"" Conference held in Rome on 19 November 2014, has succeeded to assert a policy aimed at relaunching multicultural cooperation in the energy sector, with the creation of three separate cooperation platforms respectively on gas, renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and on establishing a regional power supply market. The three platforms, which were launched in 2015, now provide a reliable framework of reference in implementing cooperation programmes financed by the European Commission. The last platform launched was the one on renewable energy sources, in compliance with the COP22 conference recently held in Marrakech. Off-shore gas and oil fields in the eastern Mediterranean Energy is one of the soundest and most crucial areas of cooperation between the Mediterranean Countries and their Neighbours on the Southern Shore, which are consistently Italy's primary suppliers of hydrocarbons. Also thanks to Italy's constant and progressive action within the European Union, energy cooperation between the EU and the Mediterranean Countries is increasingly placed at the centre of Europe's energy policy, also with a view to improving security by diversifying energy supply routes and sources, which is the priority objective of the Energy Union. The EU'S Energy Diplomacy Action Plan was developed and is constantly updated to achieve this objective, attributing utmost importance to capitalising on the energy dialogue between Mediterranean Countries and by fully exploiting the potential that energy cooperation can offer in terms of stabilising the areas of conflict. The recent finds of gas in the eastern Mediterranean represent only a portion of the new gas fields in the so-called ""Levantine basin"" - which includes maritime areas of Israel, Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria - and lay the groundwork for a new form of cooperation and for possibly rebalancing the regional energy market. Following the success of these exploration activities, Israel has become a natural gas producer and a gas exporter for future decades. (The Tamar and Leviathan fields are estimated to contain gas reserves of almost 900 billion cubic metres and the gas fields offshore of Cyprus are estimated to contain 128 billion cubic metres). In August 2015, ENI made the major offshore gas field discovery in the Mediterranean, in the so-called Zohr exploratory prospect. The gas field has an estimated in place gas production volume of up to 850 billion cubic metres (5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent) on an area of approximately 100 square kilometres. The development plan foresees the start of production by the end of 2017 and a progressive increase in production to a volume of approximately 75 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (approximately 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day) by 2019. These gas finds have given new momentum to cooperation between Egypt, Israel, Cyprus and Greece through the Cyprus-Egypt-Greece and Cyprus-Israel-Greece trilateral agreements, which Italy looks on with favour while relying on the networking action that ENI is carrying out in all the Eastern Mediterranean Countries in which it operates.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK218","TIME FOR EUROPE TO TAKE THE LEAD... AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE OF MANKIND","September 8, 2016","The New European","This April marked the 55th anniversary of the first human spaceflight into Earth orbit. Those formative decades in the middle of the 20th century saw Europe, still recovering from its recent shattering military past, building its industrial strength while firmly grounding its humanistic values. Can it really be 55 years since that momentous event? I am also among those who remember the day mankind landed and walked on the Moon for the first time. Albeit in the wake of the severe competition between the two superpowers and contrasting systems, humanity has made quantum leaps in evolutionary terms. In less than 100 years, air travel has become routine and the car has provided us with an unprecedented amount of personal freedom. Life expectancy in the West has almost doubled and education and healthcare are taken for granted. All this has pretty much happened in my lifetime. When I look back across the past five decades, I remember very clearly that I was educated to know that 'life will get better'. As the Western world was recovering from the devastation of the war, strong visionary leaders made uneasy decisions about uniting Europe, taking the legacy of democratic society to new levels. They looked into the future, well beyond election campaigns and popularity polls. Thanks to the foundations laid in the middle of the 20th century we have enjoyed several decades of the promised progress in societal, economical, technological and scientific domains. Under the leadership of Jacques Delors, a French economist and politician, and the eighth President of the European Commission, Europe decided on a single currency, the Euro. It was also decided to remove internal border controls and create the Schengen zone. When I was young the world was evolving exactly in the way I had grown up to believe - it was getting better. And this was the promise of the 20th century. So, where are we today? I am sure you'd agree the world has changed in ways we did not anticipate even 20 or 25 years ago. What about Europe? Certainly we can no longer view events in isolation from the rest of the world. Just in the past decade we have undergone a banking crisis and Euro crisis. We are still in the midst of a refugee and terrorist crisis and have been confronted with the danger of the EU falling apart, as some countries seek to regain national identity. What happened to the promise of the 20th century that life will get better, that the future holds improvements for everyone? When and where did we lose it? Or was it just an illusion all along? The leaders in the 20th century managed to rebuild Europe after a devastating war and lay the foundation for its progress and development but why are we no longer sure which way to go to give our children and grandchildren the same kind of certainty? Today's leaders seemingly lurch from one crisis to another. And in the process we have lost track of vision and concentrated on a backlog of failures. Politicians across Europe are forcing each other into populist measures to please the electorate. And the electorate largely demands short-term solutions for immediate questions. But where would we be today if the decision to fund Christopher Columbus' great voyages of exploration were not taken by the Spanish crown because, let's be honest, there was not much use in it to a peasant in the 16th century? Where would we be if the Wright brothers did not make their historic flight, or if the Space Race did not bring out the best of two giant superpowers? Where would we be without satellite navigation, world-wide communications through satellites, innumerable TV channels and weather forecasting? Today, we take these comforts for granted and do not even think about the impact they have on our daily lives - but in European terms they have been delivered at the price of just 10 euro per European citizen per year. To me the answer is obvious. We have cutting edge knowledge and we have the experience of achieving the impossible, a heritage of exploration and discovery dating back hundreds of years. My response it that now is the time for Europe to once again take the lead in moving humanity forward. I am calling upon European leaders to take a bold decision to transfer all European countries to a carbon-free energy system by 2050. In terms of capability and resources, all the prerequisites are there. And the benefits will be significant - job creation, growth stimulation, European energy independence, a cleaner environment and creating a lead role for European industry in the global economy. It would be exactly in line with the goals set by the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference held in Paris, France, at the end of 2015, an environmental summit which set clear targets and goals for public and private sector investment. And, as a flagship project, creating a 'carbon free' society across Europe by 2050, should also be the catalyst to start a global effort, fostered by Europe, to establish a sustainable human outpost on the Moon - a 'Moon Village' - that by definition will require a renewable energy system. In the year of the 55th anniversary of the first human flight into space, these are the visionary decisions Europe's leaders should take a lead on now. Following in the footsteps of the great Europeans like Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer and Charles De Gaulle, we should look beyond the current crisis and set visionary goals which carry a realistic promise of progress and a better future for the next generations of Europeans. Let's again be daring for our future and rise above the day-today problems. Let's decide now, it is time! \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK219","-New Study by REC completed, Closing the COP21 Gap by Going Solar","July 4, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","Just in time for Intersolar Europe in Munich, a special intelligence task force at REC completes a thorough study which shows how solar energy can make a significant contribution to limiting the global temperature rise. However, the study clearly demonstrates a shortfall in many countries around the world between renewable energy commitments and emission reduction targets. The required global capacity ramp-up could be up to nine times higher in 2025 than predicted by any other current forecast. In a major new study, REC, a leading global provider of solar energy solutions, highlights the potential of solar energy to close the CO2 emissions gap. REC's calculations clearly show that, based on the COP21 targets set during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris last December, solar can make a significant contribution. However, to be on track by 2025 to close the emissions gap and avoid further accelerating climate change impacts, the potential solar capacity ramp-up is far larger than industry analysts today expect, resulting in up to 4.8 terawatts above current forecast of cumulated new solar capacity by 2025. The full study was presented for the very first time at Intersolar Europe in Munich, the world's leading trade show for the solar industry. The study includes different global scenarios as well as country breakdowns for major emissions contributors such as, India, Japan, the U.S. and Germany, but also highlights the potential contribution by smaller emitters like The Netherlands and Belgium. The full study can be downloaded from the REC website ( HYPERLINK http://www.recgroup.com www.recgroup.com )here. The results of the REC study - one of the first in the world to calculate the specific impact of COP21 for the solar industry - come at an opportune time for global efforts to drive down emissions. Governments are defining programs and targets to move ahead with the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement, and prepare for the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to be held later this year. At COP22 , governments are targeting an accord on the rule book of the Paris Agreement, hammering out concrete steps for taking the agreement into force. To meet the targets agreed in Paris, there will have to be quick and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the decades ahead. One key area investigated in the REC study is the shortfall in many countries around the world between renewable energy commitments and emission reduction targets. The German power sector, for example, will have to reduce emissions by 1.152 Gt by 2025 (equivalent to taking 50 million cars off the road) to be on track for the COP21 target of keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5C. The REC task force has calculated that Germany will have to almost fully eliminate coal - which still accounts for 45% of the country's electricity generation mix - to close its cumulative emissions gap by 2025. To replace coal and concurrently deliver on the commitment to phase out nuclear, Germany will need to add an average of 8 GW of solar capacity every year above current forecast. Coal is in fact an issue in all of the countries that REC investigated. India, for instance, although having a lower electricity consumption rate per capita, because of its 73% share of coal in its electricity mix, India ranks as the fourth largest emitter worldwide. The emerging country will require cumulative solar installations of 374 GW above the current forecast by 2025. The Netherlands, whose share in total global CO2 emissions is just 0.4%, is the fifth-worst environmental performer in Europe on the 2015 Environmental Performance Index, with increased use of coal the reason for the poor ranking. The REC study calculates that a sharp ramp-up of solar and wind energy (with cumulative additional solar capacity of 14 GW, less than double the current forecast) will make coal fully dispensable as of 2023. In the USA, cumulative solar PV installations of approximately 790 GW will be required to keep the country on track to meet its share of closing the emissions gap by 2025 in the power industry. That is four times the current forecast installations through 2025. For Japan, the world's fifth largest emissions emitter, the REC calculations demonstrate that the country's COP21 pledge to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030 compared to 2013 levels falls short of what would be required considering Japan's 3% share in global emissions. Using solar to close part of the gap, Japan would need cumulative additional solar capacity of 250 GW by 2025, more than three times the current forecast. Steve O'Neil, CEO at REC, summarizes the outlook: 'The results of our calculations are eye-opening. Comparing emissions forecasts under current policies and to limit temperature increase to 1.5C, the world needs to reduce a significant cumulative amount of 144 Gt of CO2 emissions by 2025. Since one third of energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide are from the power sector, REC believes that solar can make a significant contribution - specifically, 25% - to reducing emissions, which in turn will contribute to limiting the temperature increase. And the earlier the world begins to accelerate the pace of installations, the less capacity will be required at the end.' As REC has calculated, this will require a sharp ramp-up of solar capacity, reaching installations of 1.7 terawatts in 2025 alone, nine times the forecast based on the current trend. Taking a longer-term view until 2040, will significantly reduce required capacity ramp-ups. However, this decelerated adoption rate is expected to inevitably increase the impact of climate change in the intervening years. REC will continue to leverage this incredible momentum for solar with expanded capacities, new business models and increased activities in new emerging markets.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK220","Reward farmers for their good stewardship of land, says prince","October 29, 2016 Saturday","The Journal (Newcastle, UK)","THE Prince of Wales has called for farmers across the globe to be ""properly rewarded"" for being good stewards of their land as he declared the ""fertility and health of the soil is at the heart of everything"". Charles said increasing the ""wellbeing"" of family farmers in places as diverse as the UK, Senegal and the Middle East would have a positive impact on ""social, economic and political stability"", during a conference speech about the importance of agriculture in the fight against carbon emissions. Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom, International Development Minister Rory Stewart and agriculture ministers from Europe and representatives of other governments also attended the Sustainable Landscapes meeting being held ahead of next month's climate conference COP22 Marrakech. Charles, who runs his Duchy Home farm in Gloucestershire sustainably, described himself as an agro-ecological, organic farmer of more than 30 years during the event staged by the Prince of Wales' International Sustainability Unit, at Lancaster House in central London. He told the delegates: ""What a wonderfully positive difference it would make to the lives of farmers and rural communities right around the world ... if farmers and rural communities, who are the first to suffer from the rigours of a changing climate, as well as from the damage to the health, ecology and biodiversity of the natural environment upon which they (and we) wholly depend, could be properly rewarded for being good stewards of their land, including their soil carbon."" Agriculture is seen by some commentators as a somewhat neglected weapon in the fight against carbon emissions as a healthy soil will sequester carbon captured by plants during the process of photosynthesis. Charles highlighted the role soil could play in his address. ""Suffice it to say that it appears evident from the science that something in the order of a third of global greenhouse gas emissions mitigation potential might be found in the more sustainable, longterm management of our farmed soils, along with the protection and restoration of the world's remaining forests and peatlands - a prize of absolutely critical importance."" The prince praised the French government's signature project on soil health, the Four per Thousand Initiative, which seeks to increase the organic content and health of soils worldwide. He stressed that if all nations followed the central tenet of the initiative, which Charles described as ""to improve the organic content and health of their soils"", it would have a fundamental effect. The heir to the throne said: ""It would make a remarkable contribution to the wellbeing, livelihoods, food security, and resilience of farmers right around the world, to the health of the planet, and, above all, to addressing climate change through the consequent reduction of carbon in the atmosphere, including by reducing the impact of floods and droughts."" \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK221","Batteries set for a recharge","June 30, 2016","Financial Adviser","Disruptive technology trends present exciting investment opportunities Global resources equity investing is in the midst of fast-paced and profound change. The transition from the 'super' to 'normal' commodity cycle has presented a host of challenges for many resource companies, perhaps felt most acutely by upstream commodity producers. To focus attention only in this area, however, would be to miss a much bigger picture. A number of structural growth opportunities are starting to emerge in the resources space. For example, look at the emerging structural growth area of lithium-ion batteries and the huge potential that cost-efficiency advances present for this market. It is expected that this battery technology will be a transformative energy solution that will present long-term investment opportunities that are not reliant on the commodity cycle. The locus of this change is taking place in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Today, we are at an inflection point in this demand-driven trend, that owes principally to the arrival of cost-effective rechargeable batteries. Spurred, but importantly not led, by the scandal surrounding Volkswagen's emissions testing irregularities and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, we are now on the brink of the mass commercialisation of electric vehicles which will drive significant global battery demand growth for the next 10 years. We expect EVs to soon become cost-competitive, with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs). The key driver behind this trend will be the rate of decline in rechargeable battery costs, as battery packs comprise 30 per cent to 50 per cent of total EV production costs. One of the principal drivers that will enable EVs to reach full commercialisation is to have a sticker price on a par with an equivalent ICE on the showroom floor. One of the principal drivers that will enable EVs to reach full commercialisation is to have a sticker price on a par with an equivalent ICE on the showroom floor. In other words, we do not believe that consumers always evaluate price competitiveness on an £ll-in' cost basis - that is, including fuel and maintenance costs, both of which are currently competitive for EVs when compared to ICEs. It is unlikely that changing fuel costs and hence the oil price will act as a particularly important driver for the take-up of EVs. The scale of the opportunity for this mass commercialisation can be seen in the chart, which projects rapid growth in the number of vehicles sold, through to 2020. Ultimately, we see EVs gaining a 7 per cent share of new sales by 2020 and eventually growing to become dominant within the automotive market by 2030. <span>Disruptive technologies The notion that EVs could fully replace the ICE in the not too distant future may seem far-fetched, but it is important to remember that paradigm shifts are often only obvious retrospectively. The first commercial LCD TV was released in 1984 by Casio, and although it took until 1999 for LCD TVs to enter the mass market, LCDs had silently and completely replaced cathode ray tubes as the resident technology by 2014. Clearly, TVs and cars are two completely different purchases. None the less, the timeframe for the change is not only relevant, but also disturbingly similar for the change to the car from the horse and cart, with some arguing that wholesale disruption in the early years of the last century took just 13 years. We believe a 15-year average timeframe for complete disruption of the ICE market (so that EVs make up 100 per cent of the global car pool by 2030) is probably a fair estimate, and that the key driver, currently overlooked, is the rapid and continuing decline of rechargeable lithium-ion battery costs. While battery manufacturers should see strong production growth ahead, we remain sceptical of their ability to generate attractive returns in a market in which, ultimately, falling prices are not only necessary to grow volumes, but are already embedded in contract structures. As an industry, we believe that it is ripe for commoditisation in a manner similar to that witnessed by solar over the past decade. In our opinion, the best investment opportunities are to be found in companies that offer genuine competitive advantages in niche areas further along the supply chain. In particular, our analysis shows that lithium miners, cathode and separator manufacturers will be the key beneficiaries. Lithium producers: Until recently, lithium demand has been dominated by industrial applications and has historically grown at a factor of 1.1 times gross domestic product growth. While lithium accounts for just 3 per cent of battery production costs, we foresee demand and price rises ahead as it is the ever-present raw material in lithium-ion batteries. Cathode manufacturers: Cathode manufacturers produce the chemistry, which largely determines the performance of the battery, and they own or licence the intellectual property surrounding it. Unlike battery manufacturing, it is a complicated process for the newer technologies and a more oligopolistic market overall. Separator manufacturers: Separators provide a crucial safety function, and as such form an integral part of a battery-incorporating cathode technology. Together with high barriers to entry in this area, this should sustain demand, pricing rigidity and economic profits for producers. We see minimal scope for disruptive technologies to threaten this area over the coming five years. The mass commercialisation of EVs is at an inflection point that is being underpinned by the increased cost-competitiveness of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with traditional internal combustion engines. That presents a tremendous investment opportunity in particular, as analysis indicates that future demand for lithium-ion batteries and the falling production costs are materially underestimated by the market. <span>Duncan Goodwin, head of global resources at Baring Asset Management <span/> <table class=""articleTable"" cellspacing=""0""> Key points A number of structural growth opportunities are starting to emerge in the resources space. The notion that EVs could fully replace the ICE in the not too distant future is not as farfetched as it sounds. The best investment opportunities are to be found in companies that offer genuine competitive advantages in niche areas further along the supply chain.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK222","Private capital, politics, and the Paris commitment","May 24, 2016 Tuesday 12:00 PM GMT","Private Equity International","Traveling to London to speak at the PEI-PRI Responsible Investment Forum this week, I couldn't help but reflect on the stormy political weather on both sides of the Atlantic. The US and UK face uncertain civic and economic futures as a result of a highly polarised election in the US and, in the UK, the looming possibility of a ""Brexit"". In these volatile conditions, issues of global significance, particularly environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns, can be overlooked. This creates an opportunity-and a responsibility-for the private sector to lead and continue to show progress in ESG engagement. A recent report by the Institute of European Environmental Policy concluded that the UK's environment would be highly vulnerable without EU regulation. Similarly, the ability of sustainability legislation in the US to survive partisan crossfire is questionable. The framework of ESG regulation may prove to be unstable, yet international agreements have been made -at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris last November, the US committed to a 26- to 28-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, including new regulations to rein in CO2 emissions from automobiles and power plants as well as methane from fossil fuel production. The US has not, however, identified the means it will deploy to achieve a third of the promised reductions. The Paris commitments are even more fragile when it comes to fast-growing emitters in the developing world such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, where economic and political turmoil often take precedence over ESG concerns. Developing countries made promises to implement massive new wind and solar power generating capacity. Without renewable energy additions at such a scale, we have no prospect of keeping global warming from reaching catastrophically disruptive levels, but, as the 'Shaping Energy Transitions' 2016 report notes, the investment necessary to finance these initiatives is an estimated $2 trillion over 15 years. We can be certain that there is not that kind of money in government funding or the international aid and development community. Much of the capital necessary to realise the COP21 commitments worldwide will have to come from the private sector. The commitments are explicitly contingent on receiving financing, and fulfilling them is thus contingent on the desirability of the investment opportunities they present. Investors may have good intentions, but deals must still be profitable. We are going to have to get serious about eliminating barriers and implementing the investment criteria, regulatory systems, and transparency that will make these opportunities attractive, at a very large scale, to investors with access to capital. Fortunately, the private sector has, in recent years, stepped up to meet social obligations as never before. A decade ago, private equity firms had no dedicated professionals responsible for the ESG policies of their portfolio companies. TPG, a leading global alternative investment firm where I am a senior advisor, now has four. Other major firms - KKR, Carlyle, Goldman Sachs, and others - now have similar priorities and professional oversight. Until the COP21 conference, major UN environmental gatherings were populated by government officials and nongovernmental groups, while business representation was notably absent. In Paris, that changed. Major banks, investment funds, and business leaders were active, making headline pledges to help finance the commitment to keeping the world's temperature increase at or under two degrees Celsius. This follows a well-established tradition of private enterprise going where government will not or cannot go, helping fulfil the need for sanitation, quality public education, reliable electricity, roads and ports, and transparent, corruption-free regulation. I used to run a fund that invested in water companies in developing countries to offer services that government did not: drip irrigation in India, clean water for beverages in Russia, water filtration and household storage in Mexico. We standardised accounting, best practices for pollution control and workplace safety, and rigorous transparency. Private equity often plays this role in developing countries, and it is a major contribution to economic innovation. It is also a crucial factor in creating opportunities for further investment, which will be key to helping meet the COP21 commitments. Private equity can invest in a struggling company and improve business management, bringing it to a condition in which it can be sold on the international market and attract investments that would not have otherwise been made. What's more, the market is changing, as are priorities for the millennial generation, in ways that give the private sector a powerful incentive to invest in sustainability. ESG concerns were once relatively marginal to the income-generating outlook of a company. Now, they are central, understood to be directly related to the bottom line. When I was EPA Administrator under the first Bush Administration, I once pressed Procter & Gamble CEO Ed Artzt about his good efforts to reduce waste by trimming non-essential packaging. He said: ""We're not doing this for you. Our customers are demanding it."" Likewise, when Walmart stopped purchasing seafood from unsustainable fisheries, then-CEO Lee Scott said very plainly that it's not because the company is trying to ""go green"", but because they want to make sure that in five years they still have seafood to sell. Private investment in businesses' ESG initiatives now has the power to change production procurement and market-facing design, with enormous influence on work practices, waste, and ethics in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India. I urge major investment institutions to convene formally and regularly, exerting leadership in setting goals and timetables for climate-friendly investments. They should not simply wait to receive proposals to help countries honour their Paris commitments, but actively pursue investment opportunities that will advance carbon reduction on a global basis. As a sector, we have the capability, and therefore a duty and a responsibility, to help build the foundation for a sustainable future around the world-a foundation that can withstand any political tempest. William K. Reilly was Administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency from 1989 to 1993. He is now a senior advisor to leading global private equity firm TPG. Reilly will give the keynote interview at the seventh annual PEI-PRI Responsible Investors Forum in London May 25-26, 2016. The Forum is the largest and most influential international conference dedicated to responsible investment in alternatives. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK223","Ocean Climate Action Making Waves","November 14, 2016 Monday","M2 PressWIRE","November 14, 2016 At today's event, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the World Bank and the African Development Bank has announced the African Package for Climate-Resilient Ocean Economies MARRAKECH, Morocco -- A special Oceans Action Event at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ) is bringing together over 400 high-level participants from around the world to advance oceans and climate change issues and to pledge concrete actions in support of the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal number 14, which is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. The global ocean is fundamental to sustaining life on Earth. It is a major carbon sink; it absorbs heat, and produces half the oxygen we breathe. It sustains the lives and livelihoods of the coastal and island communities who call it home, and who rely on its bounty to meet their nutritional needs. The important role our oceans play was recognized at the 43rd Session of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Nairobi, Kenya earlier this year, which decided to prepare a special, scientific report on climate change and the oceans. But while oceans are key to mitigating climate change, a warming planet also places them, and the services they provide, at great risk. Climate variability and change, habitat degradation and ocean acidification all pose additional risks to the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans, and to the well-being of dependent coastal and island communities. Ocean Climate Action Announcements Made in Marrakech At today's event, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the World Bank and the African Development Bank has announced the African Package for Climate-Resilient Ocean Economies. This ambitious package of technical and financial assistance will support ocean economies in Africa, and build greater resilience of coastal areas to climate change, tailoring approaches based on the countries' specific priorities and objectives. The initiative will mobilize 500-900 million USD and implement programs linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation over the period 2017-2020. The Kingdom of Morocco has announced its Blue Belt Initiative aimed at building the resilience of coastal communities and promoting sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in keeping with SDG14 expectations. Focus areas will include integrated coastal monitoring systems, sustainable fisheries and aquaculture throughout the entire value chain. Solutions for adaptation and contributions to curbing greenhouse gas are proposed as part of a priority roadmap for implementation. The initiative is supported by an investment plan and capacity building program of 60 million USD over the period 2017-2020, building on the Blue Growth initiative launched at COP 21 in Paris. COP22 Ocean Action partners released the Strategic Action Roadmap on Oceans and Climate: 2016 to 2021, which provides a vision for action regarding oceans and climate in the next five years, addressing six ocean and climate issue areas: the central role of oceans in regulating climate, mitigation, adaptation, displacement, financing, and capacity development. ""These ambitious programmes aimed at strengthening the resilience of African coastal communities are critical to meeting the challenges and opportunities of climate change - especially for vulnerable Small Island Development States,"" according to Maria Helena Semedo, FAO's Deputy Director-General for Natural Resources. ""African coastal communities are some of the most affected by climate change. FAO is fully engaged and ready to be at the heart of these significant developments to work alongside countries and communities to reduce their vulnerabilities, build their resilience, and maximize opportunities emerging from climate change."" ""The World Bank is pleased to be a part of the international mobilization of financing in response to the Mauritius Communiqu\'e9. The package presented today could make a significant contribution to meeting the adaptation needs of African countries as they develop their ocean economies. We plan to ramp up our own concessional financing in this area and look forward to working with our partners to increase the effectiveness of overall development assistance"" said Laura Tuck, World Bank Group Vice President for Sustainable Development. Dr. Biliana Cicin-Sain, Global Ocean Forum, noted that ""the Global Strategic Action Initiative on Oceans and Climate (involving Parties, IGOs, NGOs, academic institutions, private sector groups, and local authorities from all world regions) will implement actions identified in the Roadmap to safeguard the health of the oceans and the wellbeing of coastal and island populations, reporting on progress at the yearly COPs."" The full day of discussions addressed numerous challenges faced by oceans under climate change scenarios. Sessions addressed challenges to food security and resilience, adaptation challenges and solutions, country mitigation efforts, access to finance and capacity building, and science solutions to moving forward to achieve SDG 14. About Global Climate Action France and Morocco's global climate champions have set out their detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. Message from the Champions ""A year after COP 21, the great dynamic of climate action is now growing strong. As we all gather to Marrakech time has come to start to take stock of what has been achieved during the last year. To be consistent with the long-term goals, all actors will have to work together, not only to achieve the national targets of the NDCs, but also to go further and bridge the gap of emissions. This sense of urgency should guide us all into accelerating immediate efforts and delivering ambitious action. We must identify what concrete policy options and what tools we will have to mobilize in the short term. The science is clear: the path towards achieving the long-term goals should bring us to peaking GHG emissions by 2020. This is a challenge, and we are not there yet. On the current trends, we will be in 2030 between 11 to 14 GT above Paris-compatible pathways. The purpose of these days is to strengthen all efforts and take them to the next level to stay on track for the objectives: stay well below 2\'b0C and if possible 1,5\'b0C, increase adaptation and resilience capacities and reorient financial flows. It is our responsibility, as champions, to make the link between the real world and the COP process. Political leaders from all around the world should hear and be inspired by the solutions at our reach.""

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK224","Japan Tobacco International | WHO Summit: Censorship Continues","November 4, 2016 Friday","FinancialWire","Geneva - A worrying culture of censorship is emerging behind the scenes of the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP7) to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), taking place in Greater Noida, India from November 7 to 12. Those journalists and members of the public who were thrown out of the public gallery at COP6 (Moscow) in 2014 will not be fooled by the FCTC Secretariat's new, supposedly transparent accreditation process for COP7. Proposals to be discussed at the summit, which if adopted will formalize censorship practices in WHO meetings, contain plans for the compulsory screening of media attendees and any individual or organization who directly or indirectly consults with the tobacco industry, including government representatives and experts with legitimate credentials . Michiel Reerink, Global Regulatory Strategy Vice President at JTI, said: ""The COP is promoting a culture of exclusion and secrecy, where debates are held behind closed doors. This contradicts the fundamental principles of international law. The fact that this is happening in the largest democracy on the planet is a double insult, as individual rights are held dear there"". The extent of the COP's lack of transparency and accountability is highlighted in a recently published report by Mr. Jean-Claude Piris, an expert in international public law. The report, commissioned by JTI and sent to the WHO Director General, the FCTC Convention Secretariat and the Bureau of COP, concludes that following COP6's decision to change the Rules of Procedure behind closed doors, there is an opportunity and a need to improve transparency in how the FCTC COP works. According to Mr. Piris' report, these rules discriminate against the accreditation of observers, restrict the access to key documents, and allow no mechanism for complaint. This is in stark contrast with the decision-making of COP22 on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('UNFCCC') which will be held in Marrakech from November 7 to 18, where a policy of disclosure and openness has been adopted and representatives of businesses, alongside public policy officials, are invited to play their role in finding workable solutions . At COP7, delegations predominantly led by public health officials will be discussing issues which go beyond their competences such as Agricultural practices, Trade and Investment, Dispute Settlement and Liability - ""topics that should be debated by the appropriate experts in governments"", emphasizes Mr. Reerink. Michiel Reerink concludes: ""The FCTC COP has lost sight of its aim to improve the world's health, and has instead become ideology-driven, taking on a fight against businesses, tobacco growers, vapers and smokers, when it should open itself up to scrutiny and hear a diverse range of views. It has become an expensive, tax-payer funded closed shop"". (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \"

In the eastern Russian port city, Park will attend the annual Eastern Economic Forum (EEF), a venue to discuss ways to bolster regional cooperation in developing Russia's resource-rich Far East. Under the main theme, ""Opening up the Russian Far East,"" the second EEF will bring together some 2,500 participants from 32 countries, including China, Japan and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the forum on Saturday, Park will deliver a keynote speech to put forward her vision for cooperation with Russia in the development of the Russian Far East, her office Cheong Wa Dae said. After the forum, Park will sit down with Putin for a summit to discuss cooperation on an array of issues, including joint efforts to denuclearize North Korea and curb its provocations. The agenda also includes a set of global issues, such as terrorism and climate change. The recent decision by Seoul and Washington to deploy an advanced US antimissile system on South Korean soil is expected to be discussed at the summit, since it has emerged as a source of tension in bilateral relations. During her summit with Putin, Park will likely reiterate that the THAAD deployment is an inevitable, self-defence measure to counter Pyongyang's evolving nuclear and missile threats, and that it will only target the provocative state, observers said. The South Korean leader is also expected to use the summit to restore trust with Moscow. The bilateral relationship has apparently chilled since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which Seoul, in tandem with the international community, maintains breached international law and undermined Ukraine's territorial integrity. The suspension of the ""Rajin-Khasan"" project, a three-way logistics scheme involving the two Koreas and Russia, has added fresh tensions to two-way ties. The project got bogged down after Pyongyang's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch the following month. This week's summit between Park and Putin will be the fourth one. The two leaders held talks on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in September 2013; during Putin's visit to Seoul in November 2013; and at the UN conference on climate change in November 2015. Following Park's visit to Russia, she will travel to Hangzhou, eastern China, to attend the G-20 summit. The two-day event, slated to begin Sunday, will be held under the main theme, ""Towards an Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy."" At the summit, Park plans to voice her concerns over the recrudescence of protectionist tendencies and call for more active efforts by the G-20 to expand free trade, Cheong Wa Dae said. From Wednesday to Thursday, Park will attend the South Korea-ASEAN summit, the ASEAN-plus-three summit, which involves South Korea, China and Japan, and the East Asia Summit (EAS), all of which will take place in the Laotian capital of Vientiane. The EAS is a summit that includes the US, Russia, India, Australia and New Zealand, along with the ASEAN-plus-three members. Following the multilateral summits, Park will begin her official visit to Laos, which was arranged on the invitation of Laotian President Bounnhang Vorachith. On Friday, the leaders of South Korea and Laos will hold a summit to discuss trade, investment, development and other areas of mutual concern, the presidential office said.

Speaking to local newspapers during his official visit to Madagascar on 26 November, King Mohammed VI said: ""I know that the Moroccan presence in Africa and particularly my current tour are displeasing to some"", in a likely reference to Algeria, with which relations are strained. His comments were covered in full by state-owned Moroccan news agency MAP as well as Akhbar al-Youm newspaper, which highlighted that this was his first interview since 2003. ""I would like to pay tribute to my African brothers and our continent. Each visit to Africa is an opportunity to reconnect with the African populations that I admire and respect, they teach me true wealth; the wealth of the heart. Morocco and Africa are one. To separate them would be an uprooting, an error"", the King began the interview by saying. ""I have an ever stronger pride in being an African. I also feel strongly attached to this continent"", he added. King Mohammed VI also outlined proposals for Moroccan investment in Madagascar alongside similar plans in the rest of the continent. He recalled that he had overseen with with Malagasy President Hery Rajaonarimampianina the signing of several cooperation agreements, ""which reflect the will of the Moroccan State to help the Malagasy government and improve the living conditions of its population. This is the sense of the projects of construction of social infrastructure and economic development"". He added that Morocco was ready to support Madagascar's ""ministerial departments, public companies and private sector"", adding: ""I would particularly encourage the Moroccan private sector to undertake projects in Madagascar"". Recalling his grandfather's good memories during his exile in Madagascar's Antsirabe after the King's own visit to the city a few days ago, he asserted that projects he had launched there - including setting up a vocational training centre and maternity hospital - were to benefit all. ""I would like to remove any ambiguity: the rumours that these projects would only benefit the Muslim community are totally false. These projects are, of course, intended for the entire population"", he said. He stressed that his country followed a mainstream ""moderate and tolerant Islam"", and did not seek to impose Islam on anyone. In this context, the King extended in the interview his traditional title of Commander of the Faithful to commander of ""the faithful of all religions"". Although this was the Moroccan monarch's first newspaper interview in over a decade, he traditionally speaks in Morocco on national holidays or occasions. He has also delivered speeches at and on the sidelines of the COP22 climate change conference held from 7-18 Novermber in Marrakesh.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK227","Moroccan King pursues country's African Union bid","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political ","Excerpt from report by Moroccan privately-owned newspaper Assabah website on 2 November King Mohammed VI has had telephone conversations with a number of African presidents concerning Morocco's request to join the African Union [AU] and strengthen the strategic partnership whose foundations have been laid by his majesty, a partnership marked by his numerous visits to a number of countries of the continent. According to a statement released by the Royal cabinet, His Majesty held a telephone conversation with President Idriss Deby Itno of Chad, during which the two leaders praised the level of bilateral cooperation and the ties between the two fraternal countries. His Majesty asked the Chadian president, in the latter's capacity as president of the 27th session of the African Union summit, to make representations to Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, president of the African Union Commission, to distribute to all member countries Morocco's request to join the union, a request she received on 22 September. His Majesty was eager to bring back to mind that the charter founding the union and its working rules oblige the president of the African Union commission to distribute Morocco's request immediately. The Chadian president has reacted positively to the Morocco's request by promising to do the necessary. His majesty also had a similar telephone conversation with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn concerning preparations for the expected royal visit to Addis Ababa after the COP22 conference. The two countries want the conference to be a basic stage to strengthen bilateral economic partnership and rapprochement between the two peoples. Commenting on the royal initiative to get in touch with the Chadian president in his capacity as president of the African Union, Abdelkrim Benatig, strategic issues expert, said that the king's initiative of making a telephone call to the president of the African Union is a strong signal reflecting Morocco's faith that it belongs to Africa; this link does not depend on the whim of certain persons because the matter concerns an African organisation that has structures and laws and belongs to all the countries of the continent. Benatig pointed out in a telephone interview with Assabah that Zuma's procrastination and her concocting justifications to obstruct Morocco's request to re-join the African Union are unacceptable and do not honour the African Union; this is because the union is a collective space ruled by international law, and no state has the right to obstruct an African country joining it; also all decisions of this kind must be justified, which is impossible because they are wrong. Benatig stressed that the procrastination of the president of the African Union Commission in implementing the law reflects the fight conducted by the Algerian and South African lobby against Morocco's return to the union out of their fear to see a growth of Morocco's role in the continent, which is showed by the size of relations of cooperation linking Morocco to most countries, the latest of which are East Africa countries.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK229","Arid land to a fertile Eden: permaculture lessons from Portugal; Tamera's ecology experts transformed an area at risk of desertification - and say they can do t....","March 7, 2017 Tuesday 9:59 AM GMT","The Guardian(London)","The land undulates upwards into gentle hills, cradling nooks of fertile terraces growing sweetcorn, sunflowers and tomatoes, before rolling down into tranquil lakes. It looks like a natural Edenic paradise on earth. But 20 years ago this land was arid and barren, and farming was a struggle. The land is called Tamera, the name given to these 330 acres in southern Portugal by a community of 30 people who moved here from Germany in 1995. Today, 200 people from all over the world live here. Through simple practices of digging swales (ditches) and creating water retention spaces, Tamera's ecology experts have transformed an area on the brink of desertification - and say they can do the same anywhere in the world. The community wanted to be more sustainable and grow more of their own food, rather than importing it, and it was clear that water would be central to being able to live autonomously on the land. ""When I came to Tamera in 2006, trees were dying and wells were drying out,"" says Bernd Mueller, director of Tamera's Global Ecology Institute and one of the engineers behind the transformation. At that time, in the summer months, Tamera looked like a desert with hardly any vegetation. In the winter months, however, there was heavy rainfall and flooding. Mueller and his co-engineer Thomas L\'fcdert realised that most of the water was running off the soil and causing damage to infrastructure, rather than soaking into the earth. ""It rushed down to the rivers causing erosion and other damaging side effects,"" says Mueller. The project's goal, then, was to retain all the rainwater that falls on the land, to refill the groundwater which was getting lower each year, and to provide flowing spring water. When you have flowing rainwater, something in your ecosystem is wrong They started from the top of the hills, hit hardest by erosion and overgrazing. ""The wind and the water eroded all the fine earth that should serve as a sponge for the rainwater,"" says Mueller. ""We started to manipulate the situation so these places retain the rainwater falling on them. Then you start to build structures like swales, which fill with rainwater and slowly filter into the earth."" The lakes were dug out and formed without any concrete seal at the bottom so water can seep into the earth. ""There's a principle in permaculture called the triple S - slow, spread and sink,"" says Mueller. ""When you have flowing rainwater, something in your ecosystem is wrong. You have to slow it down, spread it over the land and let it sink."" Transformation of the landscape began in August 2007, and by February 2008 a new spring had appeared at the edge of Tamera's boundary. ""I was surprised. I didn't expect that to happen so fast,"" says Mueller. ""We suddenly had a creek going through the valley, and that brought more lush vegetation and animals; wildlife responds immediately to constant access to water."" The Tamera case study has been presented to the EU and at the UN's Cop22 in Marrakech by the Global Ecovillage Network. ""For us it was important from the beginning to change the situation in Tamera, but do it in a way that it will be a model for the rest of the world,"" says Mueller, who has travelled most continents to consult on water projects. ""When you scale the ecological problems down to principles, it's all due to the same mistakes. In all the cases I have seen all over the world, the key to ecosystem restoration is rainwater and vegetation management."" Related: 'By separating nature from economics, we have walked blindly into tragedy' Mueller has consulted on water management in Israel and Palestine, Turkey, Jordan, Kenya, Togo, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, and has shown how the Tamera model can be used in development and humanitarian settings. After the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, Mueller worked with NGO Cafod on a project at the Carradeux camp for internally displaced people (pdf), providing sanitation, drinking water and waste management. Recommendations for the camp included harvesting rainwater from roofs, providing alternative fuels to wood to prevent deforestation, and installing composting toilets. ""I'm happy to support [Tamera] because they've got a different way of doing things,"" says Geoff O'Donoghue, Cafod's operations director who worked with Mueller on the Haiti project. He says that the Tamera approach helps in humanitarian settings because they have an awareness of the bigger picture. ""There's so much you can do which isn't more expensive, but requires a front-loading of knowledge and design."" After the consultation in Haiti, the Blueprint Alliance was set up for organisations to share sustainable solutions in humanitarian emergencies. Related: The three wonders of the ancient world solving modern water problems Mueller also worked with a local government in Kitui, Kenya (pdf). ""I witnessed how in a short time a supportive local government could make a programme prompting swale building on a large scale,"" he says. ""In three months, I couldn't recognise the land. It was a relatively small amount of money that was invested there. After three years every farmer could see the effectiveness of it."" So could this approach be used somewhere experiencing extreme drought or even famine, such as South Sudan? The country has similar ecological conditions to Kenya, says Mueller, where he has seen how effective it can be.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK230","New EWG study: Germany falls behind on its climate targets; Zero-carbon economy needed to meet Paris Agreement","November 4, 2016 Friday","FinancialWire","Berlin - Germany's current climate targets are too weak and fall short of meeting the Paris Climate Agreement. Meanwhile, the German government is on track to missing even these weak climate targets, a new study by the Energy Watch Group and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) Germany shows. The Paris Agreement is entering into force today. Yet, the former climate leader Germany is most likely to take off to the world climate conference COP22 in Marrakesh without a Climate Action Plan in place - and is turning into a climate sinner. ""The federal government needs to completely rewrite its Energy Concept and climate targets. The greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels is inadequate to meet the Paris targets"", Hans-Josef Fell, co-author of the study, President of the Energy Watch Group, and Member of the German Parliament 1998-2013 says. ""Current climate protection measures do not bring about any significant emissions reduction. Global temperature is increasing at unprecedented speed. Given the consequences we already observe today, any further increase of global temperatures - 1.5\'b0C or less - should be unacceptable. The target should be a cooling to preindustrial levels"", Fell adds. The new study 'German Climate Policy - From Leader to Laggard' proves that the emissions reduction pathway in Germany has been surpassed every year since 2010. Especially the transport, electricity and agricultural sectors have contributed to this transgression. According to the government projections, in its most ambitious scenario, the transport sector for example will exceed the set 2035 targets by a striking 91%. ""The emissions reduction pathway from 2010 was already exceeded years ago. With the new more ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement in place, additional and stronger measures are now needed. The aim should be a zero-carbon economy by 2030"", J\'f6rn Schwarz, author of the study and chairman of ASPO Germany says. A global zero-carbon economy should go hand in hand with the creation of effective carbon sinks and requires a range of measures on the policy and technical level. The study shows that 100% renewable energy as well as a functioning circular economy is essential. The study authors recommend including climate protection into the constitution; creating incentives for private investments into climate change protection; and promoting research and education in this field. ""This study clearly shows that the current German energy policy removes any possibility to meet the Paris climate targets.

""Finance and investment hold the key to achieving low-emissions and resilient societies,"" Mr. Ban said in remarks read by his Special Advisor on Climate Change, Bob Orr, to a High-Level Ministerial dialogue on climate financing at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UN chief underscored that one of the core objectives of the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November 2016, is ""to make all finance flows consistent with a pathway to low-emissions climate-resilient development."" He noted that there has been progress, in particular in renewable energy. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. Before the meeting wraps up on Saturday, 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. ""We will invest 90 trillion dollars in global infrastructure over the next fifteen years. It would not cost much more to ensure that this infrastructure delivers the low-emission resilient economy envisioned in the Paris Agreement"", added the UN chief. The Secretary-General noted that in Paris, governments collectively reaffirmed their 2009 pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year by 2020, and to continue financing at this level until 2025 to support climate action by developing countries. ""This goal is within reach - if we stay focused,"" he said. In remarks read by the World Bank Vice-President for sustainable development, Laura Tuck, the President of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said that his organization is doing its best ""to try to mobilize as much as financing as possible."" ""It is not just about trying to persuade donors and financiers to put up more money, although we are definitely trying to do that, but it also about creating the environment that crowds in a lot more financing. Even if we have the 100 billion dollars we are talking about, it is not nearly enough to reach our goals,"" he added. For the World Bank, the other priority is greening the financial sector. ""We are trying to find ways to improve the way the existing banking sector understands and considers the risks of climate smart investments,"" Mr. Kim stressed. The Secretary-General stressed that financing is central to building resilience. Last year in Paris, Mr. Ban launched the Initiative on Climate Resilience, or 'A2R' - Anticipate, Absorb and Reshape. It has the goal of redoubling efforts to provide climate risk insurance, in close cooperation with the insurance sector.

A Bank study of 117 countries concluded that the full cost of natural disasters was $520bn a year - 60% higher than any previous estimate - once the impact on poor people was taken into account. The World Bank published its findings at the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech and said the report underlined the need to protect the most vulnerable against the effects of global warming. Related: How America's new president will affect the global economy Jim Kim, the World Bank's president, said: ""Severe climate shocks threaten to roll back decades of progress against poverty. Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative."" The report cited evidence from the impact of Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010, which led to consumption per head falling by 5.5% and increased poverty by 14%. Policies that made countries more resilient to extreme natural disasters and improved early warning systems could bring benefits of $100bn a year, the Bank said. It cited the examples of Kenya where the country's social protection system had provided help to vulnerable farmers well before the 2015 drought, and Pakistan, where a rapid response programme of cash grants after severe floods in 2010 had benefited 8 million people. Stephane Hallegatte, who prepared the World Bank report, said: ""Countries are enduring a growing number of unexpected shocks as a result of climate change. Poor people need social and financial protection from disasters that cannot be avoided. With risk policies that we know to be effective, we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from falling into poverty."" The Bank's research showed that previous studies had underestimated the impact of natural disasters because they had measured the cost by assessing damage to physical assets. Costs were much higher when lost consumption of poor people who have fewer assets than the better off was taken into account. It said $1 in losses did not mean the same to a rich person and poor person. ""The same loss affects poor and marginalised people far more because their livelihoods depend on fewer assets, their consumption is closer to subsistence levels, they cannot rely on savings to smooth the impacts, their health and education are at greater risk, and they may need more time to recover and reconstruct. ""A flood or an earthquake can be disastrous for poor people, but have a negligible impact on a country's wealth or production if it affects people who own almost nothing and have very low incomes."" \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK234","2016 set to be the hottest year ever recorded - sparking fresh climate change debate","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Yorkshire Evening Post","Environmental campaigners have accused world leaders of ignoring climate change after it was revealed that 2016 will be the hottest year on record. Provisional figures from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) which were published yesterday have predicted that global temperatures this year will have risen to 1.2C (2.16F) above pre-industrial levels. If the estimates are found to be correct at the end of the year, it will mean 16 of the 17 hottest years on record will have occurred in the 21st century. The WMO's assessment has been released to inform UN COP22 climate talks in Morocco, which are focusing on implementing the world's first comprehensive climate treaty, the Paris Agreement. And a separate report published in the medical journal The Lancet estimated climate change causes some 18,000 deaths a day. The news comes after US President-elect Donald Trump pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement. The billionaire has previously claimed global warming is a conspiracy by the Chinese to make American manufacturing non-competitive. A Campaign against Climate Change spokesperson said the WMO's figures came as no surprise. She added: ""We have had a year of global record-breaking temperatures, and we are starting to see the impacts, from melting ice caps to severe coral reef damage, as well as localised drought and heat waves. ""And yet during this time the Government has cut support for clean energy and pushed through high carbon projects. ""Scientists are clear that if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change, we need to act now, shifting away from fossil fuels and towards a sustainable economy. ""It's time the Government started listening."" He added: ""While Trump denies the existence of climate change, and May approves fracking and the Heathrow expansion, our planet is warming fast and time for action is ticking down."" The Lancet report concluded that climate change posed a ""potentially catastrophic risk to human health"" while conversely being ""the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"" if the right steps are taken now. Professor in health sciences at York University, Hilary Graham, who contributed to the report, said: ""Climate change is already exacerbating existing health inequities, damaging the health of children and future generations. By embracing the health opportunities that a strong response to climate change brings, we can help them grow, develop, and live full lives."" Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at Leeds University, said climate change could affect human health in ""a myriad of ways"". He added: ""Arguably the largest threat to health is through food security. Without urgent action, harvests in warm countries will be damaged by climate change. This will especially affect large and growing populations across India, Asia and Africa."" \"

This partnership will take the initial form of a joint venture - ZECI - in Ivory Coast, announced on the occasion of the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP) held by the United Nations in Marrakech, Morocco. This first joint venture aims to supply power to nearly 2 million people in Ivory Coast by year 2020, with plans to rapidly extend the partnership's initiatives to other countries in the region. Within the scope of this joint venture, ZECI, EDF and Off Grid Electric will install and maintain solar kits for rural and peri-urban households1. These individual kits include solar panels, which are easy to install, along with batteries for storing energy. Payment can be made through the simple use of a mobile phone. Customers will therefore have access to lighting and will be able to power a suite of energy-efficient household appliances including television sets, radios, fans and mobile phone chargers. Rolling out this initiative in West Africa will create thousands of new sustainable jobs (over 1000 jobs in Ivory Coast alone), from sales managers to call-centre employees, who will benefit from Off Grid Electric and EDF in-house training. Giving customers the option to use a renewable energy source like solar energy also benefits the environment by replacing candles, paraffin, and kerosene. 'We're thrilled to partner with EDF, an industry leader whose presence in Africa, combined with its experience, will enable us to grow Off Grid Electric's footprint across the continent,' said Bill Lenihan, President and CFO, Off Grid Electric. 'Access to reliable energy is a challenge throughout Africa and our partnership with EDF will help us to meet this challenge. Through energy independence, we hope to see households and communities seize new opportunities.' 'Off Grid Electric is the perfect partner for EDF, with its excellent knowledge of the African continent and a proven track record of providing innovative and competitive solar solutions,' said Simone Rossi, EDF Group Senior Executive Vice President, International Division. He also stressed that 'EDF is delighted to partner with Off Grid Electric, thus enabling the latter to benefit from the Group's extensive expertise in the area of customer relations. This will be an opportunity for us to share the experience we have gathered from supplying energy to more than 30 million customers worldwide, to the advantage of new customers in West Africa.' Off Grid Electric will be receiving the UNFCCC's Momentum for Change 2016 Award at COP22 . The Momentum for Change initiative is spearheaded by the UN Climate Change secretariat to shine a light on some of the most innovative, scalable and replicable examples of what people are doing to address climate change.

These warnings recently culminated in two landmark reports produced with the input of dozens of wildlife organisations. In September, the State of Nature: Wales report revealed the alarming figure that one in 14 species in Wales are headed towards extinction. A month later, new data released by WWF and the Zoological Society of London revealed that global wildlife populations are on course to decline by 67% in 2020 since 1970. Poor management of our natural surroundings and pollution have been blamed. The Welsh Government believe we have one of the ""strongest foundation[s] in the UK"" to deal with these issues, however that hasn't given reassurance to some key figures in the environment community, including naturalist Iolo Williams, who has blasted the government's response as ""incredibly poor"". So what are we to do? One of the experts behind the State of Nature: Wales report, Stephen Bladwell, biodiversity manager at RSPB Cymru, points to how we are becoming more and more disconnected with nature (p10 and 11) and this is negatively shaping how we view the natural world. In other words, if we spend next to no time surrounded by our natural environment, how will we know what we are losing and why would we care when it is gone? It would seem that the reality is, most of us don't even know what we're losing. So if these reports are to have any major impact, it should be to encourage each of us to immerse ourselves in the wonders of the beautiful natural landscapes of Wales - especially now the Welsh Government is investing to improve access to our great outdoors (page 4). You can read more about wildlife and nature on pages 12 and 13. Over the next fortnight, representatives from nations across the world will meet in Marrakesh in Morocco for the Cop22 climate change conference to discuss how to implement the commitments made last year that came into force last Friday, November 4. It includes the commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius. It comes as Wales' first solarpowered village nears completion (page 5) and leading figures, firms and organisations are awarded for their efforts in the renewable energy field at an awards ceremony in Cardiff Bay (page 6). We are entering a critical period in preventing further human-caused global increases in temperature, and a huge part of Wales' input will come from these green-energy pioneers. To close, this is the last issue before Christmas and, as seems to be tradition, we have a list of great green gifts for those of you who want to lessen their impact on the environment while still bringing a smile to their loved ones' faces (pages 8 and 9).

For Environment Committee chair Giovanni La Via (EPP, IT) the decision allows the EU to remain a leader in climate action ahead of the next round of talks to take place in Marrakech in November. ""I welcome the decision by environment ministers to allow for a timely EU ratification. This decision will permit Parliament to conclude the agreement and will send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its Member States and their continuing efforts to address climate change at international level"", said Mr La Via. ""The prospect that the Paris Agreement might enter into force without the EU as a signatory, considering the EU's leadership on the fight against climate change, its role in the Kyoto Protocol, and its continuous efforts towards a subsequent universal treaty, would have been unthinkable"", he added. ""At the same time, Parliament is focusing its efforts on delivering the concrete policies that will enable us to reduce Europe's greenhouse gas emissions: the reform of our carbon market, the recent proposals for curbing emissions from the building, transport and agriculture sectors (the so-called ""effort-sharing decision""), and those on land-use and forestry (LULUCF), which will be discussed in Parliament in the coming months"". ""Finally, ""I would also like to recognise the effort of the Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, with whom I have been in permanent contact during this process, and extend it to the European Commission and Council. This is a true success for the EU and its citizens,"" he concluded. On Monday evening, the Environment Committee will meet at 19.00 to vote on its recommendations to plenary. Towards the COP22 in Marrakesh Next week, Parliament will also hold a debate with the Council and Commission on priorities for the next round of talks, to take place in Marrakesh in November. The Parliament will send a 12-MEP delegation led by Giovanni La Via to Marrakesh to follow the talks closely and work with its counterparts. Background The COP21 Agreement will enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which at least 55 Parties (out of 197) to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the UN Depositary. To date, 61 parties, including the US and China, have ratified the Convention, accounting for 47.79% of global GHG emissions, while India will ratify the Paris Agreement on the 2nd of October 2016. The EU's ratification of the Paris Agreement will enable it to enter into force, by fulfilling the second criterion of 55% of global emissions.

A functioning EU ETS is critical to make the energy transition possible in a cost effective way while providing the private sector with clear and robust price signals to invest in low carbon and carbon free technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) investments of almost USD 2.5 trillion are required in the EU's power sector over the period 2015-2040 to reach its climate goals. The energy sector accounts for almost 60% of greenhouse gas emissions covered by the EU ETS. Policymakers must go beyond measures taken so far to strengthen ETS (""backloading""/ Market Stability Reserve) and the current proposal under discussion. The negotiations of its ""4th phase"" (2021-2030) provide a unique opportunity to fix the European carbon market.

The energy sector accounts for almost 60% of greenhouse gas emissions covered by the EU ETS. Policymakers must go beyond measures taken so far to strengthen ETS (""backloading""/ Market Stability Reserve) and the current proposal under discussion. The negotiations of its ""4th phase"" (2021-2030) provide a unique opportunity to fix the European carbon market. In this context, a combination of short and long term measures to fix the EU ETS is needed, no single measure being able to do that alone. Therefore, new initiatives must go beyond the current texts under discussion with the aim of: In this context, a combination of short and long term measures to fix the EU ETS is needed, no single measure being able to do that alone. Therefore, new initiatives must go beyond the current texts under discussion with the aim of:Fostering robust price signals on the market - a significant increase in CO2 prices is necessary to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of the power sector in the future. Measures adopted at EU level should be preferred over uncoordinated national initiatives that undermine the ETS and disrupt the level-playing field in the European Union. These proposals must go hand in hand with efficient carbon leakage provisions to protect the competitiveness of European industries exposed to international trade. 1 Since its launch in May 2013, the Magritte Group has offered its assessment of the energy and climate situation in Europe. The CEOs of the ten companies that make up the group aim to contribute to the debate by offering constructive proposals, in particular concrete solutions to revitalize Europe's energy and climate policy. \"

By taking a purposeful approach to this challenge, Canada intends to be at the forefront of creating a better world for future generations. As we shift to a low-carbon economy, Canada must be positioned to successfully compete globally.The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, announced Canada&#39;s Mid-Century Long-Term Low-Greenhouse Gas Development Strategy, at COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco, making Canada one of the first countries to do so.The mid-century strategy describes various pathways for innovative and creative solutions consistent with our international goal of holding the global average temperature rise to well below 2 \'c2\'b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 2 \'c2\'b0C, as called for in the Paris Agreement. The strategy focuses on meeting climate-change objectives and enabling growth, requiring significant long-term investments in infrastructure to support transformation to a low-carbon economy.The Government of Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and with Indigenous peoples to develop our made-in-Canada plan to meet or exceed our 2030 emissions-reduction target and grow the economy. We have engaged Canadians from across the country, on the best path forward.Canada&#39;s mid-century strategy looks beyond 2030 to start a conversation on the ways we can reduce emissions for a cleaner, more sustainable future by 2050.""The global economy is moving towards cleaner, more sustainable growth. Canada&#39;s mid-century strategy outlines how we will create the conditions for innovation and long-term growth, keeping Canadian businesses competitive and helping grow the middle class, ""Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change.The Paris Agreement called for Parties to develop long-term, low greenhouse-gas development strategies by 2020.Canada&#39;s mid-century strategy is not a blueprint for action nor is it policy prescriptive. Rather, it is based on modelling of different scenarios and is meant to inform the conversation about how Canada can achieve a low-carbon economy. As a result, it will be a living document.For the purpose of the mid-century strategy, Canada examined an emissions-abatement pathway consistent with net emissions falling by at least 80 percent in 2050, from 2005 levels.Using clean electricity to power our vehicles and appliances that currently use fossil fuels-like cars, trucks and heating systems-will be an important part of our long-term plan for reducing our greenhouse-gas emissions. Low carbon or alternative fuels, energy efficiency, sequestration from forests, and reduction of non-carbon dioxide emissions are also key.The International Energy Agency estimates that 38 percent of the required global emissions reductions associated with a 2 \'c2\'b0C pathway could be met through energy efficiency improvements. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK243","Climate change negotiations in search of a host","FT.com"," ","It is a bit like waking up after a big party and trying to find someone to help wash up the dirty dishes. HYPERLINK http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/paris-climate-timeline/ Paris climate change agreement The dearth of volunteers means that the UN is looking at hosting the 2017 meeting itself at its climate change secretariat in Bonn, says the body\' s executive secretary, Patricia Espinosa.  It\' s just a situation that can happen once in a while, Ms Espinosa told the FT.  The truth is that this conference has really become a major project for any country that wants to host it, she said.  It\' s not evident that many countries can do it. Two-week UN climate negotiations are normally held in a different part of the world at the end of each year. Past hosts have included the Indonesian island of Bali, the Japanese city of Kyoto and Denmark\' s capital, Copenhagen. The job of putting on the sprawling events is vast. Virtually every country in the world sends a delegation, sometimes led by a head of state, and the meetings draw thousands of others from companies, environmental groups and news organisations. At least HYPERLINK http://www.cop21paris.org/about/cop21 15,000 people went to the 2014 conference in Lima, Peru, organisers said, while Paris attracted more than twice that number. Ms Espinosa said that meant countries had to have substantial financial resources plus the capacity to provide the transport and security needed to make such events a success. The meetings had been held in Bonn before, in the 1990s, when they were  not so high on the political agenda , said Ms Espinosa. Each meeting is known as a  COP , short for the Conference of the Parties to the UN HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php Framework Convention The COPs are the treaty\' s main decision-making bodies and last year\' s Paris meeting was the 21st, so it was known as COP21. This year\' s conference, COP22 , started on Monday in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh and is due to run until November 18. A host country is normally chosen well ahead of time. France offered to hold the COP21 meeting in Paris in September 2012, three years before it began, a move deemed brave after the dismal failure of the last effort to strike a global climate deal, in Copenhagen in 2009. Morocco, a country that has enthusiastically embraced green energy, was keen to be the first nation to host a COP after the success of the Paris agreement\' s adoption. But this year\' s meeting poses a challenge for its hosts, not least if Donald Trump wins Tuesday\' s US presidential election: the Republican candidate has said he wants to  cancel the Paris agreement. In addition, because the new accord entered into force last week, much earlier than expected, delegates are not going to be able to finalise the  rule book governing the pact in Marrakesh, because doing so would exclude dozens of countries that have yet to formally ratify the deal. Instead, countries are expected to kick final decisions down the track to at least 2018. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK244","Why a new Cold War would be bad for the world and disastrous for Russia; For all our sakes, Donald Trump must try to persuade Russia to come in from the cold, s....","January 2, 2017 Monday","The Western Mail","FORBES magazine has named President Vladimir Putin the most powerful person in the world and his capture of Crimea in Ukraine and game-changing intervention in Syria have re-established Russia as a potent power we ignore at our peril. An angered Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia last week in response to alleged meddling in the US election, there is widespread alarm at the state of human rights in the former USSR, and the year ahead is rife with opportunities for confrontation between the Kremlin and Nato states. Donald Trump has said it is ""highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely"" that he will ever use nuclear weapons but are we heading for a new Cold War and, if so, what will this mean for families and the world our children will inherit? This much is clear: 1 There are fears that the world is heading into an era of dangerous instability Back in February Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev complained of Nato's ""unfriendly"" attitude towards Russia and warned: ""One could go as far as to say that we have slid back to a new Cold War."" But Masha Gessen, writing in the New York Review of Books, argues that what awaits could be ""worse"" than that. She said: ""The Cold War was fought by men who had different visions of the future - the ideologies of the two sides were battling for the right to define societies to come. This made the prospect of mutuallyassured destruction an effective deterrent... ""Trump and Putin, on the other hand, lack a concept of the future. In Putin's version of the clash of civilisations we have only a threatening Western present versus an imaginary Eurasian past... ""They are also both short-tempered, thin-skinned, not very bright, and disinclined to listen to advisers - all major risk factors for escalation."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov struck a much calmer note in September. He said: ""I see no reason why we should expect a repeat of the ColdWar. Unlike during those years we have no ideological differences now, and we have common principles... ""These common principles presume democratic development of societies, though democracy has many forms and concrete manifestations, reflecting different societies' historic traditions, development stage, culture and much more."" However Mr Lavrov did signal one aspect about dealing with his US counterparts that he found particularly irritating. He said: ""Our American colleagues have developed a genetic code whereby the most important thing is that they decide everything themselves."" 2 It will take more than the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House to reboot relations between the United States and Russia. Mr Trump has said plenty of warm things about Mr Putin. In 2013 he said the Russian leader had ""done really a great job of outsmarting our country"" and in 2015 he predicted they would ""get along very well"", although in February he said he had ""no relationship with him other than Mr Putin gives the impression that if the West will not grant Russia the respect he believes it deserves he will win it through with military force. Leon Aron, director of Russian Studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, recently wrote: ""To Putin, the end of the Cold War was a humiliating defeat of a great and glorious state... Hence, the overarching strategic objective of Putin's policies, both domestic and external, is to recover and repossess the political, economic, and geostrategic assets lost by the Soviet state at its fall."" 3 A breakdown in relations will make it harder for Nato countries and Russia to grasp real opportunities and tackle true threats. A new arms race between Russia and the US and its allies would involve spending billions on new nuclear weapons systems and upgrading traditional fighter planes and battlefield tanks - right at the time when ideologically-driven extremists such as the so-called Islamic State are working on terror plots with the potential to maim and kill civilians. The long-term security interests of both the US and Russia would be better served by working to combat the modern terrorist threat. East-west hostility could be disastrous for the Russian economy, which is deeply reliant on energy exports. It will be bad news for Europe if instead of opening up trade links Russia tries to destabilise pro-EU Governments in former Communist states. If Russia's economy crumbles the world will fear chronic instability in this nuclear power when the Putin era finally comes to an end. 4 A major flashpoint looms on the horizon Russian hawks have been angered by the expansion of Nato to include former Communist states. Will President Trump support Montenegro's wish to join Nato or will he attempt to curry favour with the Kremlin by trying to stop the club getting even bigger? As a recent Foreign Affairs analysis put it: ""If Trump wants to cater to Putin, he'll get Senate Republicans to ice Montenegro's bid; if Trump wants to signal that warming ties does not mean acquiescing in another Yalta, he'll green-light Senate ratification and Montenegro will join the alliance."" 5 The Russian Federation is not the Soviet Union Before panic sets in about a century defined by US-Russian antagonism and nuclear brinkmanship, it's worth remembering that the country Mr Putin leads is radically different to the USSR at the peak of its powers. Mr Putin may do his best to galvanise the forces of Russian nationalism and anti-Americanism but for decades Red Square was the centre of gravity for international Communism, an ideology that inspired revolutions on different continents. Russia is a significant power and Mr Putin is an audacious and effective tactician, but he does not present an ideological challenge to the western democracy. The endemic corruption and the whittling away of civil liberties in Russia is a sign of weakness, not strength, and bodes ill for the country's future. OECD figures put GDP per capita at just $24, 469, compared with $41,768 in the UK and $56,066 in the US. Life expectancy at 65.3 lagged far behind many global counterparts. The true challenge for Mr Putin is to diversify Russia's economy, improve living standards, strengthen civil society and restore relations with its neighbours. Russia's fortunes depend on it being the country that comes in from the cold. I see no reason why we should expect a repeat of the ColdWar. Unlike during those years we have no ideological differences now, and we have common principles... Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov speaking in September \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK245","Paris climate pledges 'will not be enough' - IEA.","December 1, 2016","Modern Power System","Worldwide Climate change The International Energy Agency has published its assessment that pledges made under the Paris climate agreement will not be enough to limit the global temperature rise to 2 degsC. The agency says that it has studied the implications on the energy sector of the Paris Agreement and forecasts that warming could be limited to 2.7 degsC if all pledges were adhered to. The Paris Agreement came into force in November. At that time national representatives met in Morocco at the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to discuss the details of the deal. Over 100 countries have now ratified the Agreement, but IEA executive director Dr Fatih Birol said that fossil fuels are still a threat to the fight against climate change in spite of the significant growth in renewable energy in recent years. ""The fossil fuel era is far from being over,"" said Dr Birol. ""Fossil fuels currently have an 81% share in the energy mix and if all the Paris pledges are implemented, this share will go down by 2040, but only to 74%. The IEA's analysis, outlined in its latest World Energy Outlook (WEO), shows that although coal and oil's share in the energy mix will decline, natural gas use will rise. Coal demand is projected to barely grow in the next 25 years, but global oil demand will continue to grow, IEA believes, mainly because of a lack of alternative fuels for road freight, aviation and petrochemicals. LNG will also drive a ""second gas revolution"", according to Dr. Birol, thanks to LNG infrastructure coming on-line in new supply countries such as Australia, the USA, Mozambique and Tanzania. The IEA has forecast a 50% rise in natural gas consumption to 2040, and says that LNG will re-shape the natural gas markets by overtaking pipeline gas in terms of trade and redefining the nature of contracts and pricing. The WEO 2016 report also shows the rapid rise of renewable energy across the globe. ""Renewables is a growth story,"" Dr Birol said. ""We have seen a major expansion in renewables, led by wind and solar and across all countries."" In the IEA's WEO 2016 main scenario, nearly 60% of all new power generation capacity to 2040 comes from renewables and by 2040 the majority of renewables-based generation is competitive without any subsidies. ""Renewables make very large strides in coming decades but their gains remain largely confined to electricity generation,"" said Dr Birol. ""The next frontier for the renewable story is to expand their use in the industrial, building and transportation sectors where enormous potential for growth exists."" The IEA notes that limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degsC will require the energy sector to be carbon-neutral by the end of the century. A more ambitious target of 1.5 degsC would require it to be carbon-neutral by 2040. ""The 2 degsC target is not out of reach but will require an acceleration of climate policies and a harder push on renewables,"" said IEA's Laura Cozzi, one of the report's authors. \"

Adopted by 196 States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) last December, the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for the accord to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for the UNFCCC Marrakech Climate Conference, known by the shorthand COP 22 , that begins in Morocco this Monday, where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on 15 November. Before the meeting wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules for the accord and to lay out a viable plan for providing at least $ 100 billion a year to developing countries to support climate action. ""The UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech is the crucial next step for governments looking to operationalize the Paris Climate Change Agreement adopted last year,"" said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa.

UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe While the Paris Agreement gave clear pathways and a final destination in respect to decisive action on climate change, many of the details regarding how to move forward as one global community in that common direction still need to be resolved. This is a moment of celebration but also a moment of reflection on the task ahead and a point where governments recommit to the new agenda of rapid implementation, not least in pressing forward with adequate support for vulnerable countries to take their own action. With the entry into force of the Agreement just before the Conference, ""the dialogue and decisions in Marrakech hold immense potential to accelerate and amplify the immediate response to the challenge recognized in the Paris Agreement. This meeting is therefore incredibly important,"" Ms. Espinosa underscored. As such, she encouraged world's governments to work together in the same spirit that produced such success over recent years. ""I also encourage leaders of public and private sectors and every citizen to follow the Marrakech Conference proceedings to further understand how you can take action and contribute to the mounting momentum to meet the interlinked global challenges of climate change and sustainable development,"" she added. 'Marrakech will create a tangible bridge between our vision for a brighter future and implementation of concrete climate-responsible projects on the ground' The President-Designate of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, said: ""Marrakesh will be the COP of inflexion. Besides moving forward on major negotiation areas, action is taking more space and creating a tangible bridge between our vision for a brighter future and the implementation of concrete climate responsible projects on the ground."" ""We, Parties as well as non-State actors, have here a real opportunity to emphasize this momentum, celebrate successes and share experiences and learning to set inclusively the path forward for action,"" he added. COP 22 will include a number of meetings and high-level events , including the high-level segment to be attended by dozens of chiefs of State and Government, on Tuesday 15 November. Other events include the facilitative dialogue on enhancing ambition and support, the ministerial high-level dialogue on climate finance, and the high-level event on enhancing climate action.

Now that's what geologists call change. The thing that freaks me out is that it's rarely mentioned. To unwrap that: for the past 10,000 years or so, we have hung out comfortably in what we call the Holocene epoch. During this period we have been able to rely on the Earth's systems to dampen the effects of ""forcings"". These are different factors that affect the Earth's climate, such as volcanic eruptions and solar variations. When the system does well, the Earth's resilience to these factors is high. But over the past 50 years, our influence has eroded them so rapidly that we humans have become a geological force in our own right, driving us toward the Anthropocene. Beset by planetary tipping points, we now risk flipping nature into new ""operating zones"". Swedish scientist Johan Rockstr\'f6m has mapped out a ""safe operating space for humanity"" to avoid these disastrous tipping points, distilled into a book, Big World Small Planet. Climate change is just one of these boundaries. We must transition away from a fossil-fuel world economy in the next 25-30 years, but because our systems are so interconnected, other boundaries, such as ocean acidification and extinction rates, are critical, too. To curtail these negative trends we need to think differently. Now that the party is over, it's all about respecting the planet's boundaries of the Holocene, which after all allowed us to exist happily for many years. There's no place like home, we need to keep it that way. The big picture: generate electricity at the gym Energy harnessed from exercise is a huge untapped resource.

It was during a plenary session on the AAI, which formed part of the Africa Day at the UN climate change talks ( COP22 ). During a presentation, Egypt's Assistant Minister of Environment for Sustainable Development & External Affairs, Yasmine Fouad, recalled that 'Phase 1 of the AAI, which spanned between 2015 and 2016, has been successfully achieved.' 'A political mandate from African Heads of State and Government, endorsed by all 54 African countries was given, the AAI was launched at COP21 in Paris, and two technical working group meetings were held,' she said, listing the activities held within the two-year period that the initial phase lasted. Ms. Fouad added, however, that the second phase of the project would span four years - beginning next year up to 2020. She also said of the Phase 2: 'The AAI will facilitate working with partners to scale up and replicating adaptation actions and approaches to address loss and damage. This phase will begin with facilitating support for African countries to development and implement National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) through a partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 'Additionally, AAI will develop a yearly report to map ongoing initiatives on adaptation and address loss and damage. It will also and assess progress towards meeting the objectives.' The Egyptian Minister further noted that, under Phase 3 (2020-2030), 'the AAI will continue to work with partners to facilitate the scaling up and replication of adaptation action and approaches to address loss and damage. Additional flagship programmes will be developed and additional resources will be mobilised,' she added. Launched at COP21 in Paris by Egypt's President, Abdelfateh Al-Sissi, the AAI is an African-led initiative rooted in existing African institutions. It aims to provide support to African countries to enhance adaptation action and address loss and damage on the continent. Participants at the session lauded the initiative, saying it would address the gaps and challenges as well as assist African countries enhance adaptation and address loss and damage. Augustine Njamnshi of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) said: 'One thing we are happy about is that, before Paris, the industrialised world used to accuse Africa and other developing countries, for demanding money but having no avenues to spend it. But we now have where and how to spend the money, thanks to such great initiatives like AREI and the AAI that have been brought on the table. The time has come and we've proven that this is what we want to do. Seyni Nafo, Chair of the Africa Group of Negotiators (AGN), noted: 'The AAI and AREI are all about Africa taking care of Africa, which is very commendable. The two main objectives of the AGN entail the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, under which the aim is to strengthen the technical and operational foundations. The second is implementation and action.' [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk newswire@enpublishing.co.uk \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK250","Paris climate pledges will not be enough \u8211  IEA","November 23, 2016 Wednesday","Progressive Media - Company News","Sian Crampsie The IEA believes that the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement will not be enough to limit the global temperature rise to 2\'b0C. The agency says that it has studied the implications on the energy sector of the Paris Agreement and forecasts that warming could be limited to 2.7\'b0C if all pledges were adhered to. The Paris Agreement came into force earlier this month and nations are currently meeting in Morocco at the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to discuss the details of the deal. Over 100 countries have now ratified the Paris Agreement, but IEA Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol said that fossil fuels are still a threat to the fight against climate change in spite of the significant growth in renewable energy in recent years.  The fossil fuel era is far from being over, said Dr. Birol.  Fossil fuels currently have an 81 per cent share in the energy mix and if all the Paris pledges are implemented, this share will go down by 2040, but only to 74 per cent.  The Paris Agreement provides momentum and a framework, but those pledges are not enough to bring the planet to the 2\'b0C trajectory. The IEA\' s analysis, outlined in its latest World Energy Outlook (WEO), shows that although coal and oil\' s share in the energy mix will decline, natural gas use will rise. Coal demand is projected to barely grow in the next 25 years, but global oil demand will continue to grow, IEA believes, mainly because of a lack of alternative fuels for road freight, aviation and petrochemicals. LNG will also drive a  second gas revolution , according to Dr. Birol, thanks to LNG infrastructure coming on-line in new supply countries such as Australia, the USA, Mozambique and Tanzania. The IEA has forecast a 50 per cent rise in natural gas consumption to 2040, and says that LNG will re-shape the natural gas markets by overtaking pipeline gas in terms of trade and redefining the nature of contracts and pricing. The WEO 2016 report also shows the rapid rise of renewable energy across the globe.  Renewables is a growth story, Dr. Birol said.  We have seen a major expansion in renewables, led by wind and solar and across all countries. In the IEA\' s main WEO 2016 scenario, nearly 60 per cent of all new power generation capacity to 2040 comes from renewables and by 2040 the majority of renewables-based generation is competitive without any subsidies.  Renewables make very large strides in coming decades but their gains remain largely confined to electricity generation, said Dr Birol.  The next frontier for the renewable story is to expand their use in the industrial, building and transportation sectors where enormous potential for growth exists. The IEA notes that limiting the global temperature rise to 2\'b0C will require the energy sector to be carbon-neutral by the end of t he century. A more ambitious target of 1.5\'b0C would require it to be carbon-neutral by 2040.  The 2\'b0C target is not out of reach but will require an acceleration of climate policies and a harder push on renewables, said IEA\' s Laura Cozzi, one of the report\' s authors. \~ \"

They provide jobs, food security and remain an important source of leisure and spiritual value. Yet, oceans -a tremendous resource for Africa when used in a sustainable way- are currently under threat. One of the biggest challenges to coastal and marine systems is climate change, which is already affecting many countries in Africa especially the poor. 'African oceans, coasts and seas are vital to the development and prosperity of the continent,' said Jamal Saghir, Senior Regional Adviser at the World Bank and Co-Chair of the African Ministerial Conference on Oceans Economies and Climate Change. 'The international community needs to become more aware of their importance in the context of climate action, in particular climate adaptation.' Building sustainable climate-smart ocean economies to sustain the livelihoods of millions of people to the Blue Economy is a key priority for African governments. At the same time, it remains a challenging new area with needs for capacity, technology and innovation, finance, knowledge and lasting transformational partnerships. To that end, the World Bank Group, in collaboration with the Republic of Mauritius, is organizing the African Ministerial Conference on Ocean Economies and Climate Change, on September 1 - 3, 2016. The conference will bring together African countries, development partners, the private sector, scientists, thought leaders, civil society, academia, media and communities whose everyday lives depend on healthy oceans. 'Mauritius is pleased to host the conference and reaffirm its commitment to the sustainable development of our region. The ocean economy is a national priority and we look forward to learning from the international experts to incorporate the climate change dimension into our investments,' said Hon. Charles Gaetan Xavier-Luc Duval, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Tourism and External Communications, Republic of Mauritius and Co-Chair of the African Ministerial Conference on Oceans Economies and Climate Change. 'We equally look forward to sharing our experience with other African countries.' The conference will create a platform for engagement about what it takes to harness the full potential of the blue economy in a changing climate, and is expected to help participants strategize priorities regarding the ocean economy, based on potential benefits, technical and economic feasibility, and environmental sustainability. The outcomes of the conference will feed into future events on oceans and climate change, including those such as at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP22 in Marrakesh, Morocco in November 2016. 'The changing climate itself must be factored into the ocean economy development plans, using scenarios and relying on best practice from around the world,' said Benoit Bosquet, Practice Manager for Environment and Natural Resources at The World Bank. A Journalists workshop will be conducted ahead of the conference on August 29-31 to train African correspondents on urgent topics regarding the ocean economy and climate change. The program will also include visits to fishing communities.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK252","Morocco to give 600 mosques a green makeover; Mosques across Morocco will be fitted with solar energy systems in government scheme to boost clean energy awarene....","September 5, 2016 Monday 7:00 AM GMT","The Guardian","Six hundred ""green mosques"" are to be created in Morocco by March 2019 in a national consciousness-raising initiative that aims to speed the country's journey to clean energy. If all goes to plan, the green revamp will see LED lighting, solar thermal water heaters and photovoltaic systems installed in 100 mosques by the end of this year. Morocco's ministry of Islamic affairs is underwriting the innovative scheme, paying up to 70% of the initial investment costs in a partnership with the German government. Jan-Christophe Kuntze, the project's chief, said: ""We want to raise awareness and mosques are important centres of social life in Morocco. They are a place where people exchange views about all kinds of issues including, hopefully, why renewables and energy efficiency might be a good idea."" Morocco has established itself as a regional climate leader with high-profile projects, ranging from the largest windfarm in Africa to an enormous solar power plant in the Sahara desert, which opened earlier this year. COP22 climate summit to discuss preparations for implementing the Paris climate agreement. The country's environment minister, Hakima el-Hait\'e9, told the Guardian that religion could make a powerful contribution to the clean energy debate, shortly before an Islamic declaration on climate change last year. ""It is very important for Muslim countries to come back to their traditions and remind people that we are miniscule as humans before the importance of the earth,"" she said. ""We need to protect it, and to save humankind in the process."" The new green mosques project plans to do this with established technologies that can be adapted to public buildings and residential homes. By training electricians, technicians and auditors, it hopes to direct Morocco's clean energy along the path followed by German's Energiewende, (energy transition). But Kuntze stressed that Germany was offering technological support, rather than financial opportunities for its own industries. ""We are not representing any German business interests at all,"" he said. ""The good thing about this project is that the Moroccan government came up with the idea themselves. It is something new and really innovative and it has not been tried anywhere else before, to my knowledge."" The initiative has broken new ground for gender equality in Morocco too. Many mourchidates (female clerics) have been involved in the project, as well as imams, and about a quarter of the participants in recent seminars have been women, Kuntze said. Under the project's energy service contract model, contractors will eventually be paid by the energy savings generated from the clean power systems they install. As the renovations should cut the mosques' electricity usage by 40%, these should be substantial. The first 100 mosques to get a green makeover are mostly based in big population centres - such as Rabat, Fez, Marrakech and Casablanca - but the project will quickly move on to smaller villages and towns. With 15,000 mosques dotted around the north African country, the idea's growth potential is clear. The objective was to kickstart a renovations industry for sustainable companies that could employ many Moroccans in the clean energy sector, Kuntze said. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK257","Modern Marrakesh \u8212  a city of alluring contrasts","FT.com"," ","When American writer and long-time Morocco resident Paul Bowles visited Marrakesh in 1961, he discovered a town painted with a  wash made of the pink earth on which it rests and filled with dusty expanses and palm gardens. Today the pink walls remain but  la ville rose has morphed from a dusty backwater into Morocco\' s second-biggest city. Set against the spectacular backdrop of the Atlas Mountains, it has managed to retain an easy-going charm and edgy exoticism that make it a magnet for visitors from around the world. The city is roughly divided into three parts: the walled medina  home to labyrinthine souqs, hidden mansions and historic sites; a substantial French-built new town, known as Gu\'e9liz; and the Palmeraie, a 8km-long palm-filled oasis at the city\' s northern edge. Shopping, nightlife and restaurants are concentrated in the medina and Gu\'e9liz. Resort hotels are located in the Palmeraie. COP 22 has given the authorities an excuse for a citywide spruce-up. New highways have been built, infrastructure has been upgraded, solar-powered street lights installed and pink walls re-rendered. Smart new cabs with COP 22 logos now ply the streets alongside somewhat shabbier share-taxis used by ordinary Marakshis (the local name for the city\' s inhabitants). The conference will be held at a 30 hectare site adjacent to Bab Ighli, on the town\' s southern edge. Delegates will have access to electric cars and minibuses to ferry them back and forth from key points in the town Those looking for a break from the proceedings are spoilt for choice. Wandering the winding streets of the medina is one of the joys of Marrakesh, and a well-enforced ban on unofficial guides means the aggressive touts that used to harass tourists have gone. The city may not have as many historic sites as some others in Morocco, but a number of them are clustered inside the old city walls not far from the conference site. Highlights include the ornately-decorated Saadian tombs, which date back to the 16th century; the ruined Badi palace, with a spectacular 90m long pool and sunken gardens; and the alleyways of the Mellah, the historic Jewish quarter. A little further away is the Ben Youssef Medersa, a religious school established in the 14th century which has echoes of the Alhambra in Spain. The medina\' s spiritual  if not physical  centre is the famous Djemaa el-Fna. A vast, chaotic square filled with market stalls, Berber hawkers, snake charmers, musicians playing exotic instruments and the aroma of grilled meat  it is an anarchic emblem of the city that cannot be missed. Passages off the north side of the square lead into Marrakesh\' s colourful souqs. Morocco nurtures its handicrafts  there is even a ministry devoted to artisanship  and their range and quality is on exuberant show in the souq\' s winding alleys and colourful stalls. Suede babouches (slippers), embroidery, carpets, leather goods, wood and metalwork and clothing are mostly sold in dedicated alleys or sections. Bargaining is expected and is part of the fun. The city\' s rich tradition of artisanship has attracted Moroccan and European designers, who have also made their mark  most famously Yves St Laurent, who bought the park of Jardin Majorelle in the Gu\'e9liz district to prevent it from being sold to a hotel developer. The east-west cross-fertilisation can be seen in some parts of the souk  in the little boutiques of HYPERLINK http://souk-cherifia.com/ Souk Cherifa for example  but especially in the shops of Gu\'e9liz, where chic emporia sell homewares and clothes with a modern twist on Moroccan tradition. A perennial favourite is 33 rue Majorelle, recently \~ HYPERLINK https://howtospendit.ft.com/home-accessories/116571-33-rue-majorelle featured in the FT, Food in Marrakesh is as varied as the offerings in the souk. Many of the city\' s riads (old mansions or houses that have been turned into boutique hotels) offer Moroccan or European-Moroccan fusion dishes to non-residents if they call ahead. In the heart of the souk there is a profusion of rooftop caf\'e9s and restaurants with good food and cool drinks for recovering from all the bargaining. The fashion crowd\' s long love affair with Marrakesh has also helped foster a lively, atmospheric nightlife. COP 22 delegates may not have time to paint the town a deeper shade of red, but they could try to have sundowners in the elegant HYPERLINK La Mamounia , Marrakesh\' s famous grand hotel. Otherwise there are cocktail bars, lounges and throbbing nightclubs dotted around the city. Finally, there is the age-old Marakshi pleasure of sipping sweet mint tea on a rooftop under the stars.

'Our presence here is to support the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's aspiration in tackling climate change and meeting its sustainable goals. Our goal is to present a suite of technologies and initiatives that are market relevant and acceptable energy solutions, which helps to address Kingdom and global challenges and aspirations for a cleaner future,' said Ahmad O. Al Khowaiter, chief technology officer for Saudi Aramco. Supporting the Kingdom Saudi Aramco's presence at the event was in line with the Kingdom's energy transformation agenda, which will see us working with relevant stakeholders in driving forward a solid and sustainable energy framework to meet the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement, which was ratified by Saudi Aramco last year prior to COP 22 . The event also provided Saudi Aramco a platform to outline initiatives in both technology and innovation, aligned with the Kingdom's aspiration for a cleaner energy future. Saudi Aramco's technology roadmap broadly supports Saudi Vision 2030 and more specifically, the ongoing energy transformation in the Kingdom. Technology and efficiency Al Khowaiter also participated in a panel session titled 'The Role of Technology and Innovation in Enabling the Energy Sector Transformation,' which was within the work stream 'Focus on Saudi Arabia: How Economic Transformation Will Fast-track Investment in Renewables.' During the session, Al Khowaiter explained in great detail about the company's pivotal role in improving energy efficiency in the industry. 'Efficiency is clearly the key to achieve sustainable energy solutions. We at Saudi Aramco view sustainability as a strategic research area to produce cleaner energy technology,' he said. 'We are also committed to explore the vast potentials of renewables such as wind and solar. It will take time as we find the right economics, but we are surely getting there.' Al Khowaiter said that ultimately, the goal is to close the carbon cycle by using all available resources whether hydrocarbon-based or alternatives. 'We see CO2 as a future feedstock for the world; plants convert CO2 from the atmosphere to sustain life as we know it, and our emphasis should be on closing the carbon cycle through innovative solutions,' he said. Al Khowaiter said Saudi Aramco is playing a significant role for the Kingdom by investing in scalable solutions, turning emissions into value-added products, and leveraging its long standing expertise in minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier in the week, Saudi Aramco announced a renewable energy milestone with the commissioning of the Kingdom's first wind turbine in Turaif.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK259","-Telefonica announces that 50% of their electricity consumption will come from renewable energy sources by 2020","November 21, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","Madrid - Telefonica announces its global objectives in Energy and Climate Change for 2020, in which its commitment to renewable energy as a sustainable source for business is highlighted. It undertakes that 50% of the electricity used in its operations will come from clean sources by 2020 and 100% by 2030. Telefonica estimates that the launch of energy efficient projects and the use of renewable energy will generate a saving of 90 million euros. In addition, the company will reduce the energy consumption per traffic unit by half and will decrease Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG), by 5% in absolute terms. The objectives are aligned with the world commitment to limit the rise in temperature to 2-degreeC as established in the Paris Agreement; and their announcement coincides with the United Nations Organization Climate Change Conference, COP22 , held in Marrakech until the 18th of November. According to Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, President of Telefonica 'These objectives respond perfectly to Telefonica's growth strategy and network deployment: to do more with less and have the most efficient and clean Network in the sector in terms of energy and carbon. Moreover, we want this because it is good for our profit results, for our clients, their families, and for future generations.' For Telefonica climate change is an urgent threat and being energy efficient is vital in dealing with it. 'We are aware of our responsibility to reduce our own carbon footprint as well as the role that we can play with IoT and Big Data solutions to improve the management of transport, energy, water, waste etc. in other sectors. In the last few years we have advanced on both fronts and now we are taking another step, with new targets for 2020', adds Alvarez-Pallete. With this step, the multinational company also wants to maintain its leadership in indexes such as the CDP, which displays 827 institutional investors with assets worth 100 billion dollars, the transparency and the performance of companies relating to climate change. Energy Efficiency Program To meet its new commitments, Telefonica will be supported by an Global Energy Management Policy recently approved by the Board of Directors and will enhance its Energy Efficiency Programme, recognized at the last Mobile World Congress of Barcelona with the 'GSMA Glomo 2016' Award. In addition, Telefonica will promote further reductions of fuel, the transformation of its network with state-of-the-art technology and the use of clean energy. In the framework of this Programme, from 2010 to 2015, the multinational carried out 257 initiatives in energy efficiency and the reduction of GHG emissions in their networks and offices, which resulted in a saving of more than 64 million euros and a 25% reduction in energy intensity. Less emissions in buildings and transport Telefonica forms part of the new 'SMARTer2030 Action Coalition', a group presented this week in Marrakech by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) to support the Paris Agreement with specific initiatives that enable industrial sectors to reduce their CO2 emissions through ICT. According to GeSI, the emissions that can be avoided by using digital solutions are almost ten times higher than those generated by the deployment of ICT. Initially, the coalition will focus on energy efficiency in buildings and in mobility. In addition to the Government of Morocco, GeSI and Telefonica, the founding members of the coalition are BT, Connected Devices Alliance, CSCP, Ericsson, IBM, IEA, ITU, Microsoft, Philips Lighting, Schneider Electric, Telia Company, Verizon and WBCSD.

Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Stefan Crets, executive director of CSR Europe, opened the day-long debate at the Concert Noble, saying, ""Globalisation has brought a lot of benefits, but it also has an unacceptable downside. ""We need to change radically and one thing there should be is a change in growth models. The change should be at the level local, national, regional and global levels."" RELATED CONTENT EU Parliament approves new caps on air pollution Much still to do following COP22 , says Ca\'f1ete Seb Dance:Electrification and green biofuels are within reach He referred to the climate goal targets agreed at COP21 and reinforced by COP22 and the Paris agreement. He added, ""COP21 is a language - a common language on where we want to go. Measurement is important but you don't want to waste too much time so the message is to take action now."" There are, he said, two basic requirements- how are companies embracing new business models and what the process is. The key, he added, is collaboration between the public and private sector. He called for an ""internal transformation"" of companies and more collaboration at the public-private level but also within value chain. He told the audience, ""We can act and that is what this conference is all about. ""As CSR Europe we think we are uniquely placed to push this through the leveraging the power of the CSR Europe network and by collaborative action towards the implementation of the SDGs."" Crets said CSR Europe can also contribute to achieving the UN SDGs ""through innovative and collaborative action and co-creating solutions for the future."" The conference also heard from Alan Aicken, chief sustainability officer with Huawei, who reminded participants of his company's contribution to tackling environmental and sustainability issues. He said Huawei had made ""massive cuts"" to greenhouse gas emissions at its many facilities around the world. ""As a result we have witnessed some amazing results,"" he said, adding, ""In 2015, Huawei reduced its CO2 emissions by 40,000 tonnes, saving 44.3 million kWh of electricity a year. This massive emissions cut was achieved thanks to technological and management improvements, as well as partnerships and a strategic focus on ICT energy efficiency. ""Of course we have the clout to make it happen but we are fully aware of the part we can play and the huge responsibility we have."" He added, ""CSR is now integrated into company. It is delivering tangible results but, even so, collaboration is crucial. ""Working with partners has been essential in achieving results across the global supply chain. Our collaboration project with Orange is an example of how we are putting this idea in practice at a European level. ""In the years to come, we will be working together on solutions for more energy efficiency, such as low-power network architecture and renewable energy technology."" Aicken told attendees that Huawei's sustainability commitment also spanned employee protection, cyber security and a focus on contributing to local communities. ""At a European level, actions to bridge the digital divide and address the eSkills challenge are at the heart of these efforts. As a leading global ICT solutions provider, we are very much aware of the part that we can play in achieving sustainable progress."" He also used his address as an informal call for further collaborative action, ""to use this opportunity to express our hopes of joining forces with all of you, to collaborate on long-term investments in a Europe that lives up the vision of the Paris agreement and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development."" In a video address to the conference, former senior European Commission official Karl Falkenberg admitted that a ""social element"" of the market economy was often overlooked and said it was ""shocking"" that an estimated one in four Europeans risk ""slipping into poverty."" ""This has led to problems,"" said Falkenberg, a former director general at the Commission's environment directorate who was a keynote speaker at a conference on sustainable development. The event was hosted by CSR Europe in cooperation with Huawei Technologies. Falkenberg, who served as DG from 2009-2015, said an estimated 120 million people in Europe were at risk of poverty. He believes growing numbers of people risk being marginalised, which was one reason behind the rise of populist political parties in Europe. ""It is both surprising and shocking that one in four Europeans are at risk of slipping into poverty,"" Falkenberg told the conference, 'Taking Action: One year on from COP21 and the launch of the SDGs'. ""We have to realise that the societal aspects of the market economy are important as well,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean that we reject growth but it has to be a different type of economic growth. We have to offer future generations new and interesting jobs."" The SDGs are a UN initiative and part of the so-called 2030 agenda for sustainable development, a set of 17 aspirational ""global goals"" with 169 targets. Falkenberg, who now advises the Commission on sustainable development issues, said the SDGs present Europe with a ""real opportunity"" for achieving sustainable development in Europe and around the world. Falkenberg, who has authored a new policy paper, called 'Sustainability Now', also said Europeans ""have to make better use of the planet's limited resources."" ""Our policies today are not in line with what nature requires,"" he argued. ""We need to reconsider the value of waste and improve recycling rates."" Sue Riddleston, CEO and founder of sustainability charity Bioregional, took part in a panel session and opened by asking, ""How can we live natural healthy lives within the natural limits of the planet?"" She went on, ""It's about being resource efficient, but it's about a better quality of life. It's really possible and it is heartening to see how quickly COP was ratified. It shows we can champion a better way of life. ""I am inspired by how curious everyone is about implementing the SDGs. All of you here can do something. But we've got to embrace the opportunities and run with them. The message from me today is: become a frontrunner and leave the competition behind in the dust."" Christine Faure Fedigan, head of corporate climate strategy at French electricity and energy utility ENGIE, said, ""Climate change is not news for us. Global energy and climate action is at the core of our thinking and is driving what we do. ""Since last year we have doubled our emissions reductions and new contracts sourced in France will be 100 per cent renewable. ""Europe is in energy transition. Putting a price on carbon everywhere is key driver to company investment but in Europe we need a minimum price on carbon. Happily, there is a trend on reduction of pricing. Not even a Trump presidency can change the mood. But we still need to go to two degrees or less.! Sabine Denis, CEO of Belgian sustainability network, The Shift, said there was a ""broad coalition"" in support of achieving the SDGs, adding, ""The SDG agenda not only for business. It's a common language."" Another panellist, Steven Moore, of Sustainable Business, at UK telecoms giant BT, said, ""Energy and carbon have the biggest impact on the climate. At BT we first measured our carbon footprint back in 1992 and have started to procure 100 percent renewable electricity. By 2020 for our company this will be global."" The consultant said the ""flip side"" to mitigation is adaptation and Moore had a ""simple but important"" message for the audience: ""Make sure we adapt."" The event was moderated by Peter Woodward who said that Europe is, and can remain, a ""major player"" when it comes to encompassing all dimensions for achieving sustainable development. However, he cautioned, ""Sustainability will be a challenge for decades to come."" \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK261","-Natural Disasters Force 26 Million People into Poverty and Cost $ 520bn in Losses Every Year, New World Bank Analysis Finds","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Human and economic costs of disasters underestimated by up to 60 percent. The impact of extreme natural disasters is equivalent to a global $ 520 billion loss in annual consumption, and forces some 26 million people into poverty each year, a new report from the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) reveals. 'Severe climate shocks threaten to roll back decades of progress against poverty,' said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. 'Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative.' The report, Unbreakable: Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters, warns that the combined human and economic impacts of extreme weather on poverty are far more devastating than previously understood. In all of the 117 countries studied, the effect on well-being, measured in terms of lost consumption, is found to be larger than asset losses. Because disaster losses disproportionately affect poor people, who have a limited ability to cope with them, the report estimates that impact on well-being in these countries is equivalent to consumption losses of about $ 520 billion a year. This outstrips all other estimates by as much as 60 per cent. With the climate summit, COP22 , underway, the report's findings underscore the urgency for climate-smart policies that better protect the most vulnerable. Poor people are typically more exposed to natural hazards, losing more as a share of their wealth and are often unable to draw on support from family, friends, financial systems, or governments. Unbreakable uses a new method of measuring disaster damages, factoring in the unequal burden of natural disasters on the poor. Myanmar's 2008 Cyclone Nargis, for example, forced up to half of the country's poor farmers to sell off assets including land, to relieve the debt burden following the cyclone. Economic and social repercussions of Nargis will be felt for generations. The report assesses, for the first time, the benefits of resilience-building interventions in the countries studied. These include early warning systems, improved access to personal banking, insurance policies, and social protection systems (like cash transfers and public works programs) that could help people better respond to and recover from shocks. It finds that these measures combined would help countries and communities save $ 100 billion a year and reduce the overall impact of disasters on well-being by 20 percent. 'Countries are enduring a growing number of unexpected shocks as a result of climate change,' said Stephane Hallegatte, a GFDRR lead economist, who led preparation of the report. 'Poor people need social and financial protection from disasters that cannot be avoided. With risk policies in place that we know to be effective, we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from falling into poverty.' Efforts to build poor people's resilience are already gaining ground, the report shows. For example, Kenya's social protection system provided additional resources to vulnerable farmers well before the 2015 drought, helping them prepare for and mitigate its impacts. And in Pakistan, after record-breaking floods in 2010, the government created a rapid-response cash grant program that supported recovery efforts of an estimated 8 million people, lifting many from near-certain poverty. Building resilience is key to meeting the World Bank Group's twin goals of ending global poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK262","-World Bank Partners with State of California to Support Low Carbon Cities","November 14, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","The World Bank and the US state of California are joining forces to support low carbon city efforts in China and other countries. In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed today during the UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change ( COP22 ), the World Bank and California committed to cooperate on sharing knowledge and good practice with territories and cities on low carbon development strategies to help them meet their Paris Agreement commitments. 'This is an exciting new platform that will enable us to build from California's experience in driving down emissions and to extend it to cities in China and beyond,' said Laura Tuck, World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development. 'We need partnerships like this if we are going to deliver on the ambitions of Paris.' As an early mover on climate policy, California passed a landmark bill to reduce emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. It has committed - through the Under2 Coalition agreement - to reduce its emissions to 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels, or to less than 2 metric tons per capita, by 2050. Since 2000, the state has reduced its overall carbon footprint even as its population grew and economy boomed, proving that economic growth does not have to be accompanied by an increase in emissions. 'The California-World Bank MOU is part of a unique partnership with the Alliance of Peaking Pioneer Cities and the Under2 Coalition to promote sustainable cities in China, California, and beyond,' said Ken Alex, Director and Senior Advisor, Governor's Office, California. Under this MOU and the Under2 MOU, California will become a technical partner under the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPSC) to work with the Bank in sharing knowledge and experience to support cities in China and other countries on their: GHG inventory methodology; decarbonization pathway to 2050; and resource efficiency management. Chinese cities have been active in the smart urban development space. Many of them are looking to take on even tougher targets than their national government - working towards 'innovative development pathways' that focus on new models of urbanization, combining the three objectives of economic prosperity, low-carbon development, and long-term sustainability. According to Jiang Zhaoli, Deputy Director General of the Climate Change Department of China's National Development Reform Commission, 'China's low carbon city program has expanded to 100 cities and provinces. More than 30 of them have pledged to peak their emissions much earlier than the national target of peaking by 2030. We believe that Chinese cities can significantly benefit from the collaboration between California and the World Bank, and can leverage the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities to learn from and share experiences with many other cities around the world.' This MOU with California is illustrative of the World Bank's Climate Action Plan, which commits the organization to increasing the climate-related share of its portfolio from 21 to 28 percent by 2020, with total financing of potentially $ 29 billion per year by 2020. An important component of this Plan is to help developing countries, such as China, deliver on their national climate targets - specifically, to support cities and sub-nationals to: integrate climate into urban planning by developing tools and knowledge products through the GPSC - an initiative led by the World Bank in partnership with many other organizations - and roll this out to at least 30 cities by 2020; and develop and pilot in 15 cities by 2020 a city-based resilience approach that integrates infrastructure development, land use planning, disaster risk management, strengthened governance, and social components.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK263","Article - Paris climate agreement: ""We are working to secure a swift entry into force""","September 29, 2016 Thursday","FinancialWire","HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu http://www.europarl.europa.eu The first-ever universal and legally binding global climate deal was agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December at the COP21 conference.Parliament wants the EU to ratify the Paris climate agreement as soon as possible to ensure it can rapidly enter into force. We talked to environment committee chair Giovanni La Via, an Italian member of the EPP group, about Parliament's commitment to implement the climate deal and the challenges ahead. About the Paris agreement: The Paris agreement sets out a global action plan to fight climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C. It was agreed by 195 countries at the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015. The agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which it has been ratified by 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions. For decades we have prided ourselves on our environmental protection but now we seem to be playing catch-up with the US and China. How did this happen? What is Parliament doing about it? It happened because we wasted a lot of time. After the UN General Assembly and New York Climate Week, we now have 60 countries, representing 47.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions, who have ratified the Paris agreement. We are working to secure a swift entry into force of the agreement. The first step in Parliament is a vote by the environment committee followed by a vote during the plenary session on 3-6 October for the final confirmation. A timely EU ratification decision would send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its member states and their continuing efforts to address climate change at an international level. We cannot miss this opportunity. What are the main points of the agreement? What will they mean in practical terms for people and companies in Europe? It is clear that the main goal of the Paris agreement is to maintain the increase of the temperature during the current century well below two degrees. What does it mean? That we have to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, we are now going to do a lot of legislative work on climate policy. We are working on efforts sharing, which concerns reducing emissions in sectors not part of the emissions trading system. We have to decide how we contribute to this goal and divide up the efforts between the different 28 member states. We also have to work on energy efficiency and renewable energy in order to reduce the production of greenhouse and to store CO2 in soil or somewhere else without putting our competitiveness at risk. The next climate change conference - COP22 - takes place in Marrakesh on 7-18 November. What will happen there? Could this prove to be an even tougher challenge? In Marrakesh we will start the process of implementing the policies after Paris. We plan to make significant progress on key elements of the agreement, including an enhanced transparency framework, details of the global stocktake, further guidance on nationally determined contributions and a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance. The European Union has done its homework: we have published new proposals and put some ideas into practice. The first steps in that direction are initiatives such as effort sharing, waste reform, the circular economy package, the emissions trading system and LULUCF, a proposal on land use, land use change and forestry. We now need global efforts at an international level. Giovanni La Via was the chair of the Parliament delegation at the COP21 conference in Paris last year.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK264","It's more vital than ever that Britain looks beyond Europe to forge commercial ties","April 24, 2017 Monday","City A.M.","AS PART of my role, I travel the world seeking out investment opportunities for British businesses that will not only create highquality jobs for our partners overseas, but also long-term growth investments for UK firms. North Africa is a part of the world with many such opportunities to uncover. I recently returned from a visit to Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco at the head of a City business delegation. During our time in Algiers, Tunis and Casablanca, we were able to identify much potential for UK business, in a region with bountiful natural resources and an increasingly global outlook. When I began my year in office, visiting the dynamic, growing economies of North Africa was a key priority for me, as I believe that there are many opportunities for mutually rewarding growth and development in both London and North Africa. There is huge ambition across the region to create financial services centres of excellence, and the City of London can fully support these ambitions as we understand how a dynamic, burgeoning financial centre can bring prosperity to an entire society. These regional centres in North Africa would operate as spokes centred on our own global hub city, the international financial centre that is London. I offered the City of London's continued advice and support in developing North Africa's financial sector further. Among the many opportunities we discussed during my visit, one very promising area for British investment is in the green finance sector, as was persuasively demonstrated in last year's COP 22 meeting held in Marrakesh. Morocco produces more than twothirds of the world's phosphate, essential for modern farming, and also enjoys an enviable 350 days of sunshine a year. Taking advantage of these two natural resources through access to green finance in London can bring benefit to both the UK and Morocco. Building a large-scale solar plant, such as the recently opened Noor 2 deep in the Moroccan desert can, for example, provide high-quality local jobs as well as develop a valuable commodity for export. I know there is a substantial appetite here in the City to hear more about large-scale infrastructure projects such as this that are ready for investment and support. There are big opportunities for British companies elsewhere in the region too. During my discussions with the Prime Minister of Algeria, we spoke at length about potential investment alongside Sonatrach to help the country further take advantage of its substantial gas reserves with imagination, efficiency, and new technology, while also growing economic diversification. In Tunisia there was huge interest in developing the renewables sector with British expertise and capital. As we start the process of leaving the European Union following the triggering of Article 50, it is now more important than ever that we deepen our business relationships with such valued partners as Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. The United Kingdom has always been a global trading nation, epitomised most strongly by the City of London, the world's leading financial centre. I believe that with support from the City's unique cluster of services, North Africa can see an era of strong growth that will benefit both the City and local economies across the Maghreb. \£3 Andrew Parmley is lord mayor of the City of London. \"

She has also been accused of appointing political allies to top posts in the organisation. She denies both allegations. Last month International Development Secretary Priti Patel accused the Commonwealth of having no ""budget discipline"" and warned funding could be pulled if it fails to reform. In the latest development, senior Foreign Office official Tim Hitchens has been put in charge of the team planning next year's Commonwealth summit in London. According to the BBC Mr Hitchens will be based in the Cabinet Office and report directly to the Prime Minister. Meanwhile Sir Simon Grass, a retiree from the Foreign Office, has been installed as acting chief operating officer at the Commonwealth Secretariat. The broadcaster says the appointments are being seen in Whitehall as a government attempt to get the struggling body back on track as the UK prepares for Brexit. A parliamentary source told the BBC: ""Baroness Scotland has got this wrong from the beginning. It is an inbuilt arrogance. She appoints mates, people who don't have the relevant experience. ""The way she handled the [official] house was all wrong. There is a lot of concern."" The corporation reports that the Queen will not attend the Commonwealth Day reception at Marlborough House - which she rarely misses. Royal sources said the decision was a matter of practicality and had nothing to do with Baroness Scotland, but a Commonwealth insidertold the BBC otherwise. ""The Queen has only got to nip down the road from Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House in a Bentley. It's not that hard. And yet she has decided not to come,"" they said. ""The Palace are thinking there is so much more to be done with the Commonwealth and yet they are lumbered with such poor leadership. The Commonwealth is stuffed. ""The High Commissioners have all given up on (Lady Scotland). They have other fish to fry. I do wonder if she can survive. She just treats people appallingly. And she has this political tin ear.""

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK267","-Orange and ENGIE pursue their commitment to the electrification of rural Africa","November 18, 2016 Friday","ENP Newswire","Orange and ENGIE have today launched a plan to deploy nearly 1,000 solar kits in Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon. Several villages in rural areas have been identified to participate in the first phase of this pilot program, prior to deployment on a larger scale. The kits include a solar panel connected to a battery that can be used to provide domestic appliances with electricity. They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralized source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones. This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment. ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via 'Orange Money'. The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. Access to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimize the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa. During the COP22 conference, Orange and ENGIE reaffirm their commitment to leveraging their technological expertise to stimulate sustainable progress and economic and social development on the African continent. ENGIE in Africa ENGIE has been present in Africa for over 50 years, where it operates in the fields of electricity, natural gas and services. ENGIE has a cumulated energy capacity of approximately 3,000MW across power plants in operation or under construction. ENGIE is also working on decentralized electricity production for isolated companies and rural villages in order to achieve the global goal of providing 20 million people with electricity by 2020. The Group is also researching opportunities for the deployment of home solar systems and mini-grids, as well as its policy to promote the use of solar energy to power telecoms towers in areas not connected to the electricity grid. ENGIE is also present through its solidarity investment fund, 'ENGIE Rassembleurs d'Energies', which invests in sustainable energy access projects for vulnerable populations. Orange in Africa Orange is present in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East where, at the end of September 2016, it had 113 million customers. With annual growth of around 5%, the continent represents an important part of the Group's international development strategy. The Group's mobile money service, Orange Money, enables customers - including those who do not have a bank account - to use their mobile phone to easily carry out a wide range of financial services such as money transfers or the payment of bills. This service, which was first launched in Cote d'Ivoire in 2008, is now available in 16 countries and is used by over 20 million customers.

ClimDev-Africa, a joint programme of the African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) presented components of the new business plan at a side event at the Africa Pavilion at COP 22 . Acting ECA Executive Secretary, Abdalla Hamdok said the Programme had achieved ""some spectacular successes"" adding that ""... despite the achievements of phase 1, there is an urgent need for the programme to address the continent's changing landscape of climate change, within the overall regional and global development agenda."" ClimDev-Africa Programme was launched in 2011 with the mandate to address the gaps in the observational records of past, current and future climate trends--gaps which African leaders and development partners recognized as major obstacles to integrating climate change into Africa's development policy processes and strategies. Since inception it has brought to bear the collective efforts of the three key African institutions to foster a common and coordinated response to climate change throughout the continent. The programme operates in three main areas: Support for investments in the modernization of Africa's climate observation infrastructure and capacities. This component is led by the AfDB through the ClimDev Special Fund (CDSF). In addition, the programme embarks on analysis, packaging and delivery of climate information to relevant policy and decision making forums and processes, led by ECA through the ACPC. Support for the development of appropriate climate response policies at national, regional and global levels is led by the AUC through the Climate Change and Desertification Unit (CCDU). The first phase of the programme--supported financially by the European Union, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), Norway, Sweden, the Nordic Development Fund and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)--comes to an end in 2016. The partners expressed appreciation for the financial support to the programme and invited continued partnership and new alliances for phase two. ""As we go into Phase two, which I strongly believe will contribute immensely to ensuring that climate change becomes an integral component of our continent's structural transformation and green industrialization agenda. We look forward to your continued support and partnership,"" Hamdok said.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK271","Paris climate deal has 'failed' poor countries","May 16, 2016 Monday"," The Independent - Daily Edition","The international climate deal agreed in Paris has ""failed to include meaningful mechanisms"" to guarantee financial support for poorer countries adapting to global warming, according to a report by Oxfam. In the study, Unfinished Business, the aid charity claims the high cost of climate adaptation measures, such as creating flood defenses and drought-resistant crops, means smallerscale farmers across the world are ""being left on their own"". The 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), held last December, was at the time heralded by some as an ""historic"" agreement. But Oxfam has criticised the West for failing to commit to any concrete investment targets. The report, released as UN officials recommence climate negotiations in the German city of Bonn, states: ""If global cooperation on climate change is to be inclusive, durable and fair, it must leave no one behind - particularly not those who are most vulnerable to its impacts and least able to cope."" Oxfam estimates that just 16 per cent of the $100bn (\£370bn) a year pledged by rich nations in 2009 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and cut carbon emissions has been paid. It has called on countries to target 35 per cent by 2020, and 50 per cent by 2025, via grants and other forms of financing in order to avoid the burden of ""heavy repayments"". The cost for developing countries to adapt to climate change could go as high as $500bn a year by 2050 - four to five times larger than previous estimates, according to a report released last week by the UN. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's policy adviser on climate change, blasted the lack of commitment to developing countries, warning the issue ""cannot be kicked down the road"" for any longer. She also emphasised the impact of El Ni\'f1o, a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean which can influence the weather. Ms Carty said in a statement: ""We have known about the growing gap in adaptation funding for years now, and we were dismayed when the Paris deal failed to fix it. We need to see specific commitments in Bonn to increase adaptation finance and for that money to be spent supporting small farmers who are on the front lines of the climate crisis. We are already seeing the price of failure; tens of millions of people around the world face hunger and poverty from the droughts and crop failures caused by El Ni\'f1o."" In an interview with The Independent, Lord Stern, the world's most authoritative climate economist, called on rich countries to do everything they can to help poorer nations weather the storm of global warming - warning that a failure would escalate poverty, migration and conflict. Lord Stern said: ""Equality is a big issue. The rich got rich on high-carbon growth and it's the poor people of the world - whether they be poor people in rich countries or poor people in poor countries - who suffer earliest and most. ""The defining challenges of this century are overcoming poverty and managing climate change: if we fail on one we fail on the other. Clearly if we fail to manage climate change we create an environment so hostile that development will be undermined - leading to hundreds of millions having to move because their environment has been devastated."" New data released by Nasa revealed that last month was the hottest April ever recorded. It is therefore the sixth month in a row to be more than 1 per cent above the 1951-1980 average - and 2016 is projected to be the hottest year ever.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK273","INSIGHT: Solar Impulse backers can help hasten global clean technologies drive","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","ICIS Chemical News","By Nigel Davis Solar impulse Covestro JOHANNESBURG (ICIS)--The Paris climate change accord is held out as the beacon of hope for those who believe sincerely in anthropomorphic climate change. Many of the accord's adherents would also argue strongly for further, concerted global action to stem greenhouse gas emissions. US president-elect Donald Trump has stated loud and clear that he is one of the naysayers. He has strong backing among groups which would love to roll back President Obama's climate action plan and give stronger support to the fossil fuel industries. So what happens next as regards the landmark, global climate agreement very much hangs in the balance, although the steps being taken worldwide to shift away from the burning of fossil fuels should not be underestimated. It is this underlying trend that ultimately will have the greatest impact. The incentives to adopt clean technologies are so much better understood now than only a few years ago. A generation is growing up keen to live in a cleaner world and one in which industries and individuals pollute less. So the argument is not simply about wind power in one part of the world or other alternative sources of energy in others. It is about the total, overarching drive to produce cleaner electricity and deliver it more effectively. Cleaner motive power is part and parcel of that drive. At the COP22 It is not surprising to see two chemical companies giving their support to the clean technologies initiative. Materials makers Solvay and Covestro understand the opportunities as well as the challenges that lie ahead as regards the battle against climate change and how their products and technologies might be applied in future. Solvay was Solar Impulse's first partner. ""The success of Solar Impulse has proven to the world how powerful collaborative innovation between visionary entrepreneurs and companies that believe in science and research can be to deliver technological breakthroughs. This is just the beginning of what open collaboration and innovation can do to combat climate change,"" said Solvay CEO, Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, as creation of the alliance was announced. This is all about taking the far-seeing and outrageously ambitious Solar Impulse initiative much, much further. ""We need to embrace clean technologies, not because they are `eco-logical,' but because they are `logical,'"" said chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation and one of the Solar Impulse pilots, Bertrand Piccard. ""Even if climate change didn't exist, energy efficient technologies would make sense to create jobs, generate profit and boost economic development, while also reducing CO2 emissions and protecting natural resources,"" was his most telling point. Clean technologies make sense for most people in most places. But, until now, there has been no organisation specifically designed to accommodate clean technology stakeholders. The alliance says it will ""bring together start-ups, companies, institutions and organisations producing, implementing or supporting the use of clean technologies. Together, the members will share experiences and create synergies in order to improve the overall value chain and demonstrate concrete solutions to support governments, corporations and institutions in reaching their environmental and health targets, advising them depending on their specific situation."" Covestro's chief sustainability officer, Richard Northcote, said: ""Our contribution to the Solar Impulse project proved that we have the technology to make the world a brighter place and through this alliance we intend to accelerate the implementation of these technologies to tackle the challenges society faces while generating business growth."" It will be fascinating to see what the alliance's first projects are. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK274","Leading change and powering the future","September 10, 2016","AgendaNi","The energy system and the electricity system are changing and the scale and pace of that change is accelerating. Working with business and communities around the country, and with our stakeholders in the energy sector, EirGrid is stepping up to this challenge. For large businesses that are making investment decisions here in Ireland, a secure supply of electricity is at the top of their list of critical priorities. In fact, a recent survey highlighted that 90 per cent of major companies viewed quality of electricity as important or very important in their investment decisions in Ireland. Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon have all located data centres here in the in the past two years. Given that these centres all require a large amount of reliable quality electricity; this would not have been possible without confidence in our electricity system. Demonstrating leadership In order to maintain and build on this confidence, EirGrid is focused on planning for the future. To ensure a secure supply of electricity now and for years to come, EirGrid must maintain and develop the national grid. This may sometimes require new infrastructure, such as the proposed North-South Interconnector, but where possible, we make the most of existing assets. We're continuously pushing the envelope of knowledge around power system operation with our innovation programmes, including DS3 (Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System) and the Smart Grid Innovation Hub. These initiatives explore the use of new technologies and methodologies to allow for a more flexible and adaptive use of the grid. This is in response to the increasing role of renewable energy sources, which can't simply be ""turned on"" to meet demand for electricity. In the meantime, it is critical that we continue to look ahead. At EirGrid, we base our plans on the key forces that are central to shaping the energy industry in the future. These include climate change, new technology, regionalisation and user participation. Climate change EirGrid has no role in choosing one form of energy generation over another, and we have no interest or involvement in any form of energy generation. However, we are required to respond to Government policy, and to connect new energy generators to our grid when requested. Because of the threat of climate change, there is an increasing push for greater use of renewable energy sources. This requires significant changes to how we operate the grid, and how we plan for its future. On a positive note, what was agreed in Paris last year at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) was remarkable. As Al Gore commented: ""This universal and ambitious agreement sends a clear signal to governments, businesses, and investors everywhere; the transformation of our global economy from one fuelled by dirty energy to one fuelled by sustainable economic growth is now firmly and inevitably underway."" New technology In technological terms, the electricity industry is changing rapidly. What we're now seeing is new technologies, new telecommunication capabilities and the rise of big data. These all have the ability to disrupt the value chain and introduce new business models across many sectors. The electricity industry, and especially the transmission grid, will need to respond. There are new technology innovations in energy generation and transmission. The Irish grid now includes 10MW of battery storage, operated by AES in Belfast. EirGrid is also trialling new devices to control, in real time, the flow of power on our transmission system. These provide a glimpse of how we will manage and transition the power system over the coming 20 years. Regionalisation At EU level, approaching energy from a regional perspective will continue to be important for a number of reasons. It assists us as we seek to establish the foundations to address climate change. It also empowers us to drive competition as it decreases barriers to trade and drives out lower prices for consumers. Finally, it addresses energy security in what is an increasingly noisy and fractious geo-political environment. Regionalisation has a number of implications for Ireland. First of these is the new wholesale energy market arrangements being put in place to meet the EU target model. There is also a focus on increased interconnection. EirGrid commissioned the East West Interconnector to the UK in 2012 and EirGrid is now looking at a new interconnector to France, called the Celtic Interconnector. This will all lead to increased coupling between markets, which will drive consolidation, increased competition, and ultimately lower energy prices. User participation In contrast to regionalisation at a European level, user participation is about individuals at household and domestic level becoming active in the energy market. This will be enabled by technology advances and will lead to the transformation of today's energy models. In turn, this will raise some interesting dilemmas in terms of how assets are paid for. For example, if you have invested in solar panels and a battery and largely use the grid as a back-up, how should you pay for the grid that's there providing that back-up? Also, not everyone will have the opportunity or the resources to invest in a solar panel or a battery. There is a danger that these people could end up paying disproportionately more for the grid when it is providing a service to all. This is an issue of social equity and needs to be addressed as we see new business models emerge. Social acceptance As we think about these changes in the energy system over the next 20 years, we need to ensure that we bring people and communities with us. Without that, we won't have the ability to change the energy system to address these challenges. At EirGrid we are acutely aware of the need to engage with communities at the earliest possible opportunity. We need to build trust and respect to get input into deliberations and decision making right from the start. EirGrid must achieve the trust and permission of the public to carry out our work. This is so Ireland can respond to the coming changes in our energy system. To achieve this, EirGrid will continue to bring people and communities into our decision making process at the earliest possible opportunity. Driving innovations - residential demand side management In June, EirGrid launched a new residential demand-side management initiative. Power Off & Save is an innovative pilot that will reward customers who agree to reduce their energy use in response to a signal from the national control centre. Over the next 18 months, we're trialling this programme, in conjunction with Electric Ireland to 1,500 homes across the country. The key, innovative part of all of this is that we are enabling these domestic households to participate in meeting the needs of the power system without the need for a smart meter. As we take this pilot forward, we will see very significant benefits in terms of more efficient operation of the power system and lower costs for consumers as a whole. Powering the future Continued collaboration across society, from leaders in the public sector, the business community and communities right across the country, will be central to shape the future of our energy industry. These partnerships will also ensure EirGrid can respond to the challenges and opportunities of change in the energy market. Working together, we can be ready for the future.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK275","-EBRD-Developing sustainable value chains in Morocco","April 21, 2017 Friday","ENP Newswire","Developing sustainable value chains in Morocco. Agriculture contributes significantly to Morocco's economy and employs 40 per cent of the country's workforce. But the sector continues to face major challenges and important steps need to be taken to make it more sustainable. Working with the private sector to pave the way is key. With this in mind, the International Center for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) organised a forum on sustainable value chains on 20 April 2017, in partnership with the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forests. The forum gathered participants from all segments of the value chain - agribusinesses, producers' associations, financial institutions - to examine opportunities for improving the economic, social and environmental sustainability of Morocco's agrifood sector. Held in Meknes, the forum capitalised on the ever-increasing audience of the Salon International de l'Agriculture au Maroc of which the 12th edition is held under the theme £gribusiness and sustainable value chains'. The exhibition has now become one of the largest international fairs in Africa and in the world, bringing together more than 1,220 companies and attracting over one million visitors. The forum also built on the achievements of the government's 'Green Morocco Plan' (PMV) and the role that Moroccan producers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), large agribusiness companies and policy-makers play in making the sector more dynamic and sustainable. In his opening speech on behalf of the Minister, Mohamed Sadiki, General Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forests, said: 'Interaction with the private sector has been the backbone of the PMV since its inception. Aggregation, which is one of the foundations of the Plan, is an innovative model for organising farmers around private actors or professional organisations with a strong managerial capacity. It is a win-win partnership between the productive upstream and the commercial and industrial downstream, which helps overcome land fragmentation and enables farmers to access modern production techniques, finance and markets.' Agribusiness leading the way Private sector companies in Morocco have already started taking concrete steps towards more inclusive and environmentally friendly business models. For example, Lesieur Cristal, a leading vegetable oil company, invested in two biomass boilers to produce steam from olive waste and managed to reduce its fuel consumption by up to 40 per cent. Another example is Frulact, a major international player in fruit preparations for the food industry and present in Morocco for 10 years. It has created significant value in the Larache region by sustainably sourcing strawberries from local farmers and processing them locally into high value-added fruit preparations for yoghurt and other dairy products for the domestic and export markets. In Casablanca, Maghreb Industries, a leading Moroccan confectionery producer, provides a good example of concrete actions in the use of renewable energies: the company built a modern, energy-efficient facility that is powered by a 1.4 megawatt rooftop solar plant, one of the first of its size in Morocco. These are just some of the many examples that can be replicated in the country. Working together along the value chain The event also focused on interprofessional organisations and how they can support a more inclusive and efficient agriculture sector by fostering a common vision among value chain players and working to improve essential services. 'The promotion of public-private dialogue and cooperation between value chain players is essential for a stronger and more productive agriculture sector in Morocco. In this context, inter-professional organisations play an essential role by promoting a unified vision of the sector's development. They can combine the efforts of all operators in key areas such as research, extension and technology transfer, interact with public authorities on sectoral policies and offer shared services to their members,' said Michael George Hage, FAO representative in Morocco. Among the many interprofessional and professional organisations supported by FAO in Morocco, Interprolive, an interprofessional organisation involving all of Morocco's major private sector players for table olives and olive oil - from production to marketing - is already moving quickly to promote and defend the interests of the olive sector in Morocco. Among other initiatives, the organisation has launched an advertising campaign to encourage consumers to buy olive oil in bottles rather than in bulk, and has started a series of technical trainings to help members improve productivity in olive production. 'First we have focused on organising ourselves better and ensuring good representation of the players all along the value chain. With the signature of a 'Contrat programme' with the government we have been able to start providing services to our members, such as technical assistance and communication strategies to increase consumer awareness. We have also been collaborating with FAO and the EBRD on olive oil quality systems and productivity along the supply chain,' said Rachid Benali, President of Interprolive. Disseminating climate knowledge Climate change is affecting Morocco's agriculture, with lower-than-average rainfall and increasing drought and groundwater depletion. Adapting Morocco's agriculture to climate change while also enhancing the sector's ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was debated at length during the COP22 global climate talks in Morocco in November 2016. Cosimo Lacirignola, Secretary General of the CIHEAM, said: 'For Morocco's agriculture to overcome the challenges that climate change brings about, fostering the uptake of innovative and socially inclusive technologies and practices is essential. It is also important to draw on the ancestral know-hows of the Mediterranean diet which provides local sustainable jobs. It is vital to reach out to players at all levels of the value chain, through research, extension, education and cooperation, and trigger transformational change in terms of climate adaptation and mitigation. These actions are at the heart of CIHEAM's mandate.' Developing capacities The forum also highlighted how the development of technical and managerial skills is key to ensuring the sustainability of value chains. Companies - of all sizes - as well as farmers need to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to access critically important success ingredients such as technological innovation, markets and finance. Marie-Alexandra Veilleux-Laborie, EBRD Director in Morocco, said: 'Agribusiness is a priority sector in Morocco. We, at the EBRD, not only provide finance but - together with partners like FAO - are keen to foster constructive policy discussions and support the development of capacities at all levels of the value chain. This is what we are proposing in Morocco's olive oil sector, where we hope to introduce changes that are beneficial not only to our clients but to the sector as a whole.' In Morocco, the EBRD has invested more than EUR155 million in the corporate sector, including investments in the olive oil, fruit and vegetables and confectionery sub-sectors. With the EBRD's upcoming EU Trade and Competitiveness Programme, funded by the EU Neighbourhood Investment Facility, it will place additional focus on agrifood value chains and support the creation of value-added, higher food standards and increasing competitiveness. Pursuing their common objective to promote sustainable agricultural value chains in the Mediterranean region, FAO and CIHEAM will also build on the forum's conclusions to continue their support towards business-enabling policies and promotion of international best practices in Morocco's agrifood sector. Regarding these elements, the CIHEAM would like to launch a new initiative, called the 'Mediterranean Pact for sustainable agriculture and food'. The pact intends to bring together several public and private actors around strong engagements for the sustainable development of inclusive value chains and to address food security, sustainable management of natural resources and employment issues especially for youth and women.

Earlier this year, desperate moves from countries representing the majority of the world's population to examine how the UN might identify and minimise conflicts of interest were swept under the carpet by rich countries - especially the US, EU and Australia - who argued they wanted to be as ""inclusive"" as possible and that the concept of ""conflict of interest"" was too hard to define. Related: What's in store at the Marrakech climate talks - and will Australia still back coal? | Graham Readfearn As a result, representatives of companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Peabody, BP, Shell and RioTinto will have unquestioned access to most discussions in Marrakech, will be called upon for advice and will be walking the corridors and holding private discussions with countries that are trying to move the world to stop consuming the products those companies have based their businesses on. The bodies through which those companies access the COP22 meetings have been detailed in a chart created by Corporate Accountability International. Groups such as the World Coal Association, the Business Council of Australia, Business Europe and Business Roundtable will represent the world's biggest fossil fuel companies in the meetings through their ""observer status"". Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International says it is clear those groups are driven by a profit motive and not by the desire to curb carbon emissions, and so have a conflict of interest. ""It's hard to believe the World Coal Association is having conversations with delegates, encouraging them to more strictly regulate the coal industry,"" Bragg says. ""That's completely against their interests. So what is their purpose in that space other than to continue to extract and burn coal?"" Bragg says those groups have a role to play in the implementation of the rules set by nations but no legitimate role to play in the setting of the rules themselves. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The role many fossil fuel companies play in policy debates as the world attempts to curb carbon emissions has been clear: A series of ongoing revelations have shown the fossil fuel industry was aware of climate change for decades but publicly denied its scientific basis.   Analyses of the limited amount of public information about the lobbying efforts of fossil fuel companies suggests that ExxonMobil, Shell and others spend millions of dollars to manipulate public discourse on climate change. When Peabody went bankrupt this year a Guardian analysis of court documents revealed America's biggest coalmining company was funding at least two dozen groups that cast doubt on human-made climate change and oppose environmental regulations. Peabody will be represented at the meeting by six bodies with observer status. In a striking irony, the climate change COP at which these corporate interests will be welcome will happen at exactly the same time as another UN COP, where the exclusion of corporate interests has been hailed as a fundamental ingredient to its success: COP7 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, starting today in Delhi, India. At that meeting, a report will be presented analysing the impact of the tobacco control treaty. It concludes the FTCT ""has contributed to significant and rapid progress"" in tobacco control action. Part of the FTCT - article 5.3 - says that ""parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law"". ""It's pretty much the most important aspect of implementation,"" says Mike Daube from Curtin University in Australia, of article 5.3. Daube was the deputy chairman of the committee that wrote the report on the impact of the tobacco control treaty. Related: The Paris climate agreement is a game-changer - and business risks being left behind ""It essentially says that governments should only speak with the tobacco industry when they absolutely have to and do so holding their nose and washing their hands afterwards,"" Daube says. Despite the strong acknowledgement of corporate conflicts of interest in that UN treaty, rich countries have argued strongly against any measure to limit corporate involvement in the implementation of the Paris agreement. In May, the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDC) - a collection of more than 20 countries representing most of the world's population - pushed for an report to be prepared examining how ""the United Nations system and other intergovernmental forums ... identify and minimise the risk of conflicts of interest"". Far from a radical call for governments to distance themselves from the fossil fuel lobby, it merely asked for a report on how conflicts of interest have been dealt with in other forums. The convention and the Paris agreement is an instrument between states. And the inclusion of non-state actors must go through a revision of conflict of interest. This is a standard request, a legal request and a moral request. It is unacceptable for our delegation that the concept of conflict of interest was not even considered as the fundamental basis for the ethical integrity and the effective implementation of the Paris agreement ... It is a concern for the majority of the world represented here at this conference and the discussions in the contact room. We are astonished that this issue was completely overturned in the conclusions. But the EU, Australia and the US rose to speak against any exclusion of fossil fuel lobbyists. The Australian delegation framed the issue as one where developing countries were trying to make the process less ""open"", despite supporting measures in the tobacco control treaty to lock out the tobacco industry: Parties are merely the custodians of this issue. Australia cannot and will not support an approach under the UNFCCC that will lead to us trying to block people from having access to what we do here. We operate under the basis ... of openness and inclusiveness and transparency. Australia also argued the concept of ""conflict of interest"" itself was too hard to define, despite the issue being grappled with in many other forums: There is no clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is and it means different things to different people. The US delegation also framed the issue as one where they were trying to be as inclusive as possible. ""We oppose constraining NGO participation in the UNFCCC process,"" the US delegation said. Kingsley Faulkner is the deputy president of the Australian Council of Smoking and Health as well as the national chair of Doctors for the Environment Australia. Faulkner says the exclusion of the smoking lobby from tobacco control forums was essential and that there are clear parallels to the fossil fuel lobby. ""Bodies that make these decisions should be looking very seriously at who they allow into the policy-making groups and see in whose interests they are talking,"" Faulkner says. ""And if you do that, of course, you clamp down on the fossil fuel lobby. ""There are a number of real examples where industries have huge influence on public policy, to the detriment of the health of the community. ""If politicians are serious about saying their first priority is the security and the wellbeing of the community then they're going about it in a bad way if they allow the fossil fuel lobby to put that at risk."" \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK277","-EBRD/BMCE Bank of Africa climate finance conference in Casablanca","October 13, 2016 Thursday","ENP Newswire","The creation of green banking markets in Africa took centre stage at a conference in Casablanca, Morocco, today, less than a month before Morocco holds a major climate meeting to usher in a new era in the global battle against climate change. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) teamed up with Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, BMCE Bank of Africa, to hold a one-day conference in the Moroccan city of Casablanca on how to engage the financial sector with the climate challenge in Africa. Entitled 'Creating Green Banking Markets in Africa', the EBRD/BMCE Bank of Africaconference was an important example of the steps being taken to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, a global climate accord that will come into effect in the coming weeks. The Casablanca conference dealt specifically with the practical steps that need to be taken to turn the Paris vision into reality, a theme that will be taken further at the COP 22 climate talks in Marrakesh in November, the follow-up to the COP 21 in Paris last year. Senior representatives from the EBRD and BMCE Bank of Africa welcomed guests from across Africa to the green banking markets conference. Although the EBRD only invests in three African countries - Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia - other nations from across the continent are interested in applying the EBRD's financing model. In his opening remarks to the conference, the EBRD's Energy Efficiency and Climate Change Managing Director Josue Tanaka said: 'There is an urgent need for strong action ?now to achieve global climate goals.' He stressed 'the EBRD's strong conviction that commercial banks will play an ever more important role in the scaling up of green financing and in achieving significant environmental benefits based on their broad distribution capacity.' Othman Benjelloun, Chairman BMCE Bank group of Africa, commented: 'In parallel with the great commercial success of the first EUR20 million financing facility dedicated to sustainable energy, MorSEFF has enabled Group BMCE-Bank of Africa to familiarise itself more closely with the renewable energy market, to improve its awareness and to support the development of resources devoted to the promotion of sustainable development, energy efficiency and renewable energy. It is therefore with enthusiasm and commitment that, within the context of the next COP 22 , we are renewing our partnership with the EBRD, the AFD and the EIB for a new MorSEFF programme designed to support businesses in their environmental approach and position ourselves as a benchmark bank in the field.' The two organisations used the conference to celebrate the success stories of BMCE Bank of Africa clients who had invested in renewable or energy efficiency projects using a joint EBRD/BMCE Bank of Africa financing facility. At an awards ceremony on Wednesday evening at the BMCE Bank of Africa headquarters, prizes were due to be handed out to corporate pioneers in the sustainable use of energy and to individuals who had helped deliver renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The conference included sessions on the regulatory framework for innovative financial products in the green arena, and the role of commercial banks in promoting green economy transition and cooperation with development banks. There was also a focus on integrating green finance into banks' business operations. This sort of integration lies at the very heart of the EBRD's Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (SEFF) product, which has now been successfully introduced in some 24 countries. With SEFFs, the EBRD makes loans to partner banks in its countries of operations which then on-lend funds to clients investing in efficient and renewable energy programmes. It is a crucial element in the drive by all development banks including the EBRD to attract significant sums of private capital to the global climate challenge. During the conference the EBRD and BMCE Bank of Africa signed their latest agreement under the MorSEFF facility, a SEFF specifically tailored to the Moroccan market. This represented EUR35 million funding provided by the EBRD, together with Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), with the support of the European Union Neighbourhood Investment Facility (EU NIF). This comes after a string of large-scale green investments made by the EBRD in Morocco in the past 12 months, including a EUR126 million joint BMCE Bank of Africa-EBRD investment in the 120 MW Khalladi wind farm near Tangiers and a EUR24 million loan to Morocco-based bio-fertiliser group Elephant Vert. These projects are part of the EBRD's Green Economy Transition strategy, adopted in the lead-up to COP 21 in Paris, which aims to increase annual financing for green projects to 40 per cent of its annual investments by 2020 (versus an average of 24 per cent in the 10 years to 2016). The EBRD invests to promote the development of the private sector in 36 countries spanning three continents - from Mongolia in Central Asia to Morocco on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, from Estonia on the Baltic to Egypt on the Mediterranean. It places a special emphasis on investing in the sustainable use of energy and resources. Since 2006 the EBRD has invested over EUR20 billion in some 1,160 green energy projects worth a total of more than EUR112 billion. This includes over EUR1 billion in 44 green projects in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region worth EUR6.5 billion, saving an estimated 1.7 million tonnes of oil per year (5,700 kt CO2 per year). The EBRD will play an active role in the COP 22 conference and will lead activities that focus on capacity building in relation to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), energy efficiency, carbon market policies, adaptation and technology transfer.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK278","VoIP Liberalisation Forces Expansion Of Data Services","October 28, 2016 Friday","BMI Middle East And Africa Telecommunications Insights","BMI View: The ANRT's decision to remove the ban on VoIP services will create a more dynamic data-oriented VAS market, as it becomes imperative for operators to . However, the ban at a later date . Morocco's National Telecommunications Regulation Agency (ANRT) reversed its ban on over-the-top (OTT) voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services on October 25 2016. The ANRT introduced the ban in January 2016, on the grounds that OTT VoIP players such as Viber , Skype and WhatsApp were not licensed to operate as telecom service providers, and to protect operators' falling voice revenues.We believe the ANRT's decision to lift the VoIP ban now is a response to external pressures supporting local consumer groups' vehement opposition of the regulation. Earlier in October a Brookings Institute report claimed that the domestic economy lost USD320mn due to the VoIP ban, while Morocco is hosting the high profile COP22 climate change conference in November. We nevertheless believe there remains a risk of the regulator reinstituting the ban after the conference is over. In April 2016, an unidentified plaintiff filed a lawsuit against ARNT on its VoIP ban, but government investment arms retain stakes in all three mobile operators and it is not clear that the judiciary would rule in favour of consumers over state-owned companies.

As customers adopt VoIP applications for their voice usage and the fall in legacy voice revenue deepens, operators will now have to turn their focus to driving stronger take-up of data services. Even though Maroc Telecom dominates the 3G/4G market, with a 50.7% share in June 2016, data ARPU growth has been slow and will need to accelerate to offset sharper voice ARPU declines.All mobile operators will, therefore, have to increasingly leverage value-added-services (VAS) in encouraging higher data usage on their networks. They are likely to begin by easing price competition in the mobile data market, but we believe they must make a more aggressive push in their data monetisation strategies beyond the bundling OTT VoIP services with mobile data offerings. Operators have already made some efforts around this, for instance by partnering with video-on-demand (VOD) players to offer more content with 4G packages, but they will have to seize more diversification opportunities to support revenues. One area of promise we have previously cited is Morocco as a potential e-commerce outperformer in Africa, due to the relative openness of the market ( see ' Mobile, Telco Partnerships And Infrastructure Focus Key To e-Commerce Success , June 07 2016 \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK279","-AfDB-Climate finance mobilization required to strengthen NDC ambition, says new report","December 5, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","The African Development Bank (AfDB) Climate Investment Funds (CIF) unit released in November a new study which details regional member countries' progress in ratifying the Paris Agreement and their efforts to transition Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The report found that in many countries, projected contributions will be conditional based upon receipt of climate finance support. On 4 November 2016, the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the average global temperature increase by 2100 to well below 2-degreeC through adaptation, mitigation and financing efforts, entered into force ahead of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ). The Agreement calls for INDCs-national climate mitigation and adaptation plans to constrain harmful greenhouse gas emissions-to be transitioned to NDCs, which will form the foundation of the post-Kyoto multilateral climate regime. Half of the African countries have already taken the first steps toward ratification of the Paris Agreement and thirteen of those countries are pilots under the USD 8.3 billion CIF. As an implementing agency of the CIF geared to helping African countries achieve NDCs, the AfDB undertook the study, 'Transitioning from INDCs to NDCs in Africa,' to understand the challenges countries face with respect to ratifying the Paris Agreement. Based upon extensive interviews with government, private sector and civil society stakeholders, the study provides an overview of regional (I)NDCs from CIF pilot countries. It further addresses efforts in transitioning toward NDCs and discusses dedicated policy planning and measures underway to implement and achieve INDC goals in six focus countries-Cameroon, Ethiopia, South Africa, The Gambia, Tunisia and Uganda. The countries were selected as case studies based on criteria including size, development status, geographic spread, language, ambition, and CIF engagement. Gareth Phillips, AfDB Chief Climate Change and Green Growth, stated, 'As countries look to integrate their development paths with their commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the AfDB is reshaping its institutional approach to bolster that shift. AfDB-CIF support is focusing on helping countries fulfill their NDCs, successfully balance mitigation and adaptation in their climate responses, and maneuver among various climate funding sources.' According to the study, support in preparing funding proposals will help alleviate a major impediment to operationalizing mitigation commitments, empowering governments to view climate finance as an accessible and reliable vehicle to mobilize future infrastructure and development investments. And, as CIF activities require the potential for either scalable pilot activities or sectoral reform, they are more likely to result in transformational impact required by many funds, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF). 'Once countries witness the mobilization of climate funding, confidence is expected to increase, which will likely strengthen NDC ambitions. Moving forward, in addition to mobilizing financing, the AfDB is well-placed to help fully integrate CIF-funded activities with (I)NDCs and harmonize monitoring, reporting and verification systems for NDC reporting,' AfDB Consultant, Axel Michaelowa highlighted. The study also noted that some governments have begun to view their NDC not only as a binding contribution to global climate action, but at the same time, as an opportunity to showcase the country's attractiveness for investments into a low-carbon future. With approved projects totaling USD 2.1 billion, today's AfDB-CIF portfolio contains 39 policy-based Investment Plans which link their climate actions to their national development policies in various stages of preparation and development. Of these, 21 contain a total of 41 projects going through the range of development from preparation to implementation. About the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) Established in 2008, as one of the largest fast-tracked climate financing instruments in the world, the USD 8.3 billion CIF provides developing countries with grants, concessional loans, risk mitigation instruments, and equity that leverage significant financing from the private sector, multilateral development banks and other sources. Five MDBs - the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American Development Bank, and World Bank Group - implement CIF-funded projects and programs.

They also urged all EU member states to conclude the ratification process, to ensure its rapid entry into force. In a separate resolution, they also called on the EU to upgrade its emission reduction pledges, so as to close the gap between the individual targets agreed by the Parties and the Paris goals. ""It is unthinkable that the Paris Agreement might enter into force without the EU as a signatory, considering the EU leadership on the fight against climate change, its role in the Kyoto Protocol, and its continuous efforts towards a subsequent universal treaty. For this reason, we urge the Council and the individual member states to take the necessary steps to complete their EU and national ratification process prior to the next climate conference in Marrakech, enabling it to enter into force"" said rapporteur and Environment Committee chairman Giovanni La Via (EPP, IT). World ""not even close"" to 2-degree target with existing commitments In a separate resolution, on the next round of talks to take place in Marrakech in November, MEPs regret that the sum of all the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted ""does not bring the world even close to the two degree target"" and stress the urgent and critically important need for all Parties to raise their emission reduction commitments. The EU should also commit to further emission reductions for 2030, they say. Mid-century strategy MEPs say that the EU should also revisit its own mid- and long-term goals and policy instruments, and call upon the Commission to ""prepare a mid-century zero emissions strategy for the EU, providing a cost-efficient pathway towards reaching the net zero emissions goal adopted in the Paris agreement"". Migration MEPs notes with concern that 166 million people were forced to leave their homes because of floods, windstorms, earthquakes or other disasters between 2008 and 2013. They call for the recognition of the issue of climate refugees, saying that climate-related developments in parts of Africa and the Middle East could contribute to political instability, economic hardship and an escalation of the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. Aviation and shipping MEPs insist on the need to lower emissions from international aviation and shipping, and call on all the Parties to work through the ICAO and the IMO to take measures to set adequate targets before the end of 2016. Climate finance Further efforts are necessary to ensure the mobilisation of climate finance to meet the $ 100bn goal by 2020, say MEPs. Additional sources should be delivered, including a financial transactions tax, setting aside some EU ETS emission allowances or revenues from EU and international measures on aviation and shipping emissions. Brexit Amendments tabled by British MEPs and endorsed by the committee say that the EU should uphold the commitments agreed in Paris in spite of any changes of status of EU member states, and ask that ""strong efforts"" be made to keep any member states with a changing status in the EU carbon market. Next steps The recommendation that Parliament consent to the conclusion of the agreement, was approved by 47 votes to 1.The full European Parliament can vote and give its consent to the Paris Agreement only when an agreement is reached at the Council. The resolution on COP22 , was approved by 48 votes to 1, with 2 abstentions. The vote in the full House is planned for early October. Background The Paris Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention, accounting in total for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession at the UN. As of 7 September 2016, 27 Parties have deposited their instruments of ratification at the UN, accounting in total for 39.08 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.

Low-emission development and climate resilience will advance all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"", added Mr. Ban. Adopted by 196 States Parties to the UNFCCC last December, the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved by the previous Conference, known as COP 21, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK284","MIXED MARRAKECH","November 17, 2016","AutoSport","ALL THE TALK IN THE BUILD-UP TO THE Marrakech ePrix was that this race at the Moulay El Hassan Circuit in Morocco would be a one-off. Nothing more than a necessary addition to the calendar to plug the gap between the Buenos Aires round in late February and the immovable early October season opener in Hong Kong. And it did fit quite nicely, what with the United Nations' climate change summit - COP 22 - taking place literally down the road from the track. But over the course of the event it became clear that this one-off might not be much of a one-off. Series CEO Alejandro Agag certainly suggested as much. ""It's important to be in Africa,"" he said. ""This race is a one-off because of COP 22 , but this is a good start and we're going to talk to the authorities to see if we can make this a permanent race on the calendar. ""This is a great place, Marrakech is a fantastic city, we have this track, which is great. Why not?"" Some in the paddock were keen to flag up a couple of reasons, but neither is significant enough to torpedo the event from being a regular fixture. First, there's the general location - it's surrounded by dirt roads and undeveloped land, and a far cry from the stunning backdrop that greeted the season opener in downtown Hong Kong. But Agag rightly pointed out ""we have to be all over the world and the places around the world are not the same"". So that covers reason number one. Number two? The event was a bit of a non-event. If it returns, far more work/effort needs to be put into it. The circuit was fine - better than fine, to be honest. It was a good race, the circuit lent itself nicely to overtaking and it is tricky both in design and because of the sand rolling in from the surrounding environment. Plus, even though it's not properly city-centre, it's still a street track within reasonable distance of a reasonably large African city. And there's something to be said for the backdrop of a 'proper' circuit set-up devoid of temporary garages (although not having enough space in the pitlane to avoid Renault e.dams, the champion team, being thrown in a pop-up set-up at the end was frankly ridiculous). The main issue was the presentation, and what I believe the PR folk call £ctivation'. There was little advertising around town - a street demo two days before doesn't cut it - and the crowd was very low, the official claim being an attendance of just over 7000. Although with very little signage on the way in, maybe there were a few thousand more who simply couldn't find where they needed to walk Maybe it's a good thing that not many people showed up, because little care had gone into the presentation. It's a dusty place, but there's no excuse for broken, glass-covered pavements. I'm not being snobby. Formula E's on the radar of the world's biggest manufacturers and that means every event needs to be worthy of its place, and world class. Marrakech satisfies the first criterion, but there's definitely work to be done on the second. Hong Kong highlighted the difference an invested local promoter can make, and that's what Marrakech needs if it is indeed to return. \"

Low-emission development and climate resilience will advance all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"", added Mr. Ban. Adopted by 196 States Parties to the UNFCCC last December, the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved by the previous Conference, known as COP 21, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November.

The company's announcement coincides with the COP22 climate change talks in Marrakesh, which are being held one year on from the landmark Paris climate change agreement. Mars' investment in renewable technology is part of its ambition to eliminate all fossil fuels from its operations by 2040. Mars called on business and global leaders to do the same by setting ""ambitious goals"" that go beyond the national targets agreed at COP21. ""This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society. It is imperative that global businesses, like Mars, do their part to face down those threats,"" Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, said. Mars' new wind farm in Mexico is the latest in a series of major renewable electricity projects that the company has embarked upon. The company now operates 118-turbine wind farm at Mesquite Creek, Texas, which generates the equivalent of 100% of the electricity needed to power the entirety of the Mars US operations. In partnership with Eneco the group plans to activate a 20-turbine wind farm in Scotland that will provide electricity equal to that required to power all of its UK operations. The wind farm in Mexico, due to come online in 2017, is being developed in partnership with Vive Energia and Envision. It will produce power equivalent of 100% of the electricity required by its five plants in Mexico. At COP21 in Paris, Mars joined the chief executives of the world's leading food companies to publish an open letter to global leaders pledging individual and collaborative action on climate change and urging governments to forge clear international agreements at the meeting. Also last year, Mars signed on to the American Business Act on Climate, led by the White House. The Act is a commitment to climate action that aims to rally business, government, academic, technical and scientific communities to tackle climate change in the US and on a global scale. This week's shock presidential election win by Donald Trump has cast some doubt over the future of the US's policy on climate change and energy production, however. As just-food reported in our analysis of the potential impact Trump's win could have on the global food sector, the Republican President-elect made campaign pledges to make the US energy self-sufficient by 2022. This will largely be achieved, Trump has said, by opening up oil fields that the Obama administration moved to protect and increasing the country's use of fossil fuels such as coal and ethanol. Trump has also indicated he plans to back out of the Paris agreement that seeks to cut global CO2 emissions and limit temperature increases. ""I strongly oppose the extreme, climate alarmism agenda of the Obama-Clinton years. Too often, the Obama-Clinton team imposed billions of dollars in environmental costs on American citizens without achieving real environmental benefits,"" Trump insisted. Trump's stance on climate change is out of step with much of the food sector, which has pushed ahead with initiatives to voluntarily tackle climate change and make their business models more sustainable. \"

In a separate resolution, they also called on the EU to upgrade its emission reduction pledges, so as to close the gap between the individual targets agreed by the Parties and the Paris goals. ""It is unthinkable that the Paris Agreement might enter into force without the EU as a signatory, considering the EU leadership on the fight against climate change, its role in the Kyoto Protocol, and its continuous efforts towards a subsequent universal treaty. For this reason, we urge the Council and the individual member states to take the necessary steps to complete their EU and national ratification process prior to the next climate conference in Marrakech, enabling it to enter into force"" said rapporteur and Environment Committee chairman Giovanni La Via (EPP, IT).

The EU should also commit to further emission reductions for 2030, they say. Mid-century strategy MEPs say that the EU should also revisit its own mid- and long-term goals and policy instruments, and call upon the Commission to ""prepare a mid-century zero emissions strategy for the EU, providing a cost-efficient pathway towards reaching the net zero emissions goal adopted in the Paris agreement"". Migration MEPs notes with concern that 166 million people were forced to leave their homes because of floods, windstorms, earthquakes or other disasters between 2008 and 2013. They call for the recognition of the issue of climate refugees, saying that climate-related developments in parts of Africa and the Middle East could contribute to political instability, economic hardship and an escalation of the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. Aviation and shipping MEPs insist on the need to lower emissions from international aviation and shipping, and call on all the Parties to work through the ICAO and the IMO to take measures to set adequate targets before the end of 2016. Climate finance Further efforts are necessary to ensure the mobilisation of climate finance to meet the $ 100bn goal by 2020, say MEPs. Additional sources should be delivered, including a financial transactions tax, setting aside some EU ETS emission allowances or revenues from EU and international measures on aviation and shipping emissions. Brexit Amendments tabled by British MEPs and endorsed by the committee say that the EU should uphold the commitments agreed in Paris in spite of any changes of status of EU member states, and ask that ""strong efforts"" be made to keep any member states with a changing status in the EU carbon market.

Seconds later, the camera turns away as one of them is crushed to death. The death of the fishmonger sparked outrage across the country as gruesome pictures emerged of his body. Thousands attended the funeral of the fishmonger amid calls for protests nationwide including in the capital Rabat. Moroccan authorities have vowed to punish those responsible.\~ Footage online showed thousands of people following the yellow ambulance that carried Fikri's body through Al-Hoceima in the ethnically Berber Rif region on Sunday. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Interior Minister Mohamed Hassad condemned the incident and vowed that an investigation would be held to 'determine the exact circumstances of the tragedy and punish those responsible'.

The ambulance headed to the area of Imzouren some 12 miles southeast of the city, where Fikri was buried in the late afternoon. The circumstances of his death remained unclear. But a human rights activist said that the authorities forced the fishmonger to destroy several boxes of swordfish. Catching swordfish using driftnets is illegal. 'The goods were worth a lot of money,' said Fassal Aoussar from the local branch of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH). 'The salesman threw himself in after his fish and was crushed by the machine,' he said. 'The whole of the Rif is in shock and boiling over.'\~ Long neglected under the father of the current king, the Rif was at the heart of Morocco's protest movement for change in 2011, dubbed the February 20 movement. Protests continued in Al-Hoceima late Sunday, an AFP reporter said, with protesters shouting: 'Criminals, assassins, terrorists!' 'The people of the Rif won't be humiliated!' The crowd eventually dispersed around 9.30pm without incident. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Thousands of demonstrators - including activists for Berber rights - also gathered in Rabat, chanting 'We are all Mouhcine!'.

In a statement on Sunday, the AMDH condemned the state for 'having trampled on the dignity of citizens since the ferocious repression of the February 20 movement and keeping the region in a state of tension'. It warned of a 'possible repeat' of the 2011 protests in the Rif, just a week before Morocco starts hosting international climate talks. King Mohammed VI has ordered a 'thorough and exhaustive investigation' into Fikri's death and the 'prosecution of whoever is found responsible', an interior ministry statement said. The king - who was in Zanzibar on a tour of East Africa - sent the interior minister to 'present his condolences' to Fikri's family, it said. It was the self-immolation of a street vendor in Tunisia in late 2010 in protest at police harassment that sparked Tunisia's revolution and the Arab Spring uprisings across the rest of the region the next year.

While political analysts have long suspected Africa's oldest serving head of state woulddie in office, Mr Mugabe appears to have finally acknowledged the growing calls for him to resign. At the age of 92, Mr Mugabe is visibly frail. Opposition elements in Zimbabwe seized on footage of his ""wobbly"" arrival last week at the COP22 UN climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco. And speaking on his return to Harare in a key speech to senior government officials and police leaders, Mr Mugabe admitted that the country was entering a period he described as ""regime change"". The war veterans who fought for Mr Mugabe against white minority rule and for independence in 1980 have been the foundation of his support during his 36 years as the country's leader. But as the country's economy has deteriorated beyond all hopes of a quick recovery, the failure to pay their pensions and support widows has seen his leadership questioned even by them. Addressing the officials, Mr Mugabe said: ""If I am failing, let me know. I will go."" Read more Mugabe says Zimbabwe judges 'reckless' for allowing political protests Calls for the president to step aside were given new impetus in July by the former vice-president and close Mugabe ally Joice Mujuru, now having formed her own party in exile. Ms Mujuru said the president was corrupt, the country ""collapsing"" and that Mr Mugabe must ""resign and call for fresh elections"". And while Mr Mugabe's speech can be seen as a concession to his critics, there is no suggestion he will resign any time soon - despite some of the gleeful headlines the news has generated. According to his own ruling Zanu-PF party, Mr Mugabe will still contend the country's 2018 elections. If he runs, he will most likely win, making him president until 2023 - when he would be 99 years old. According to a translation by the Africa Check web resource, Mr Mugabe said he accepted Zimbabwe's leadership would have to change - but he rejected the idea of doing so on what he called ""British, American"" terms. The country that is banning its own national flag Mugabe returns to Zimbabwe and jokes 'Yes, it's true, I was dead' Black South African politician calls for Mugabe-style 'land grab' Mugabe: There will be no 'Arab Spring' in Zimbabwe ""We are in a critical time of regime change.

The British [and] Americans are working hand in hand, but I think we have defeated them. So change will come in good time. ""If I have to retire, let me retire properly; people must sit down and discuss it cordially and not go to traditional healers such as that woman did [Ms Mujuru], leaving us and calling themselves Zimbabwe [People] First [the party Mujuru started after she was expelled from Zanu-PF by Mugabe]. That's just not OK."" If observers were looking for an indication that Mr Mugabe will change his authoritarian leadership style in the wake of his speech, there was none to be found in the news that five war veterans began their trial in Harare on Tuesday accused of undermining the president's authority. Among those on trial are the former secretary-general and spokesman of the war veterans' association, which announced in a statement in July that it was withdrawing its official backing for Mr Mugabe. All five defendants have been expelled from Zanu-PF and, if convicted, face up to 10 years in prison. \"

The three financial institutions are providing a EUR35 million financing facility to BMCE Bank of Africa and its leasing subsidiary Maghrebail. The finance line is the third under the Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF), a comprehensive programme for sustainable energy investments through financial institutions. The proceeds of this EBRD-led facility are dedicated to financing energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy investments. BMCE Bank of Africa will on-lend to small and medium-sized enterprises and corporates in the commercial and industrial sectors, including commercial construction and energy service companies. BMCE Bank of Africa will also raise awareness among its clients, promoting energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies and strengthening local production. In addition, comprehensive technical assistance and investment incentives, funded by the EU NIF and by the EBRD Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) Multi-Donor Fund, will provide support to BMCE Bank of Africa in the design of business development tools and the successful implementation of the facility. It will also allow clients of BMCE Bank of Africa to receive support for project implementation, as well as investment incentives, encouraging them to make sustainable energy investments. Mike Taylor, EBRD Director for Financial Institutions, SEMED and the Caucasus, said: 'We are very happy to be continuing our work with BMCE Bank of Africa towards the more efficient and sustainable use of energy in Morocco. This is a very important initiative that promotes best practice and raises awareness about the advantages of sustainable energy investment. MorSEFF benefits from the expertise the EBRD has accumulated in similar schemes through which we have invested EUR19 billion in sustainable energy, of which EUR4 billion has been made available through SEFF's to more than 100 financial intermediaries in 24 countries.' Othman Benjelloun, Chairman of BMCE Bank of Africa Group, commented: 'In addition to the great commercial success of the first sustainable energy facility of EUR20 million for BMCE Bank of Africa, MorSEFF has increased knowledge of the renewable energy market, customer awareness and the skills of staff who are dedicated to the promotion of sustainable development, energy efficiency and renewable on a small scale. In the context of COP22 , it is with enthusiasm that we are renewing our partnership with the EBRD, AFD and EIB for a new MorSEFF program to support companies in their environmental approach and position ourselves as the reference bank in these fields.'

Ms. Tubiana, French Ambassador on climate change, and Ms. El Haite, Moroccan Minister in charge of Environment, were appointed Climate Champions by the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris last year (COP 21), where nations adopted the landmark Agreement, which calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of the phenomenon. The two high-level Champions were tasked with heeding the call made at COP 21 and taking forward the idea that mobilizing stronger and more ambitious climate action by all Parties and non-Party stakeholders is urgently required if the Paris goals are to be achieved. Just last week, on 4 November when the Paris Agreement entered into force, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convened at UN Headquarters in New York a special meeting with civil society representatives, thanking them for their courage, persistence and leadership in realizing the Paris Agreement and calling on them to ""keep up the fight,"" to press for action and to hold governments accountable. Ms. Tubiana and Ms. El Haite have meanwhile set out a detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. They have also launched a consultative process in order to seek the views of governments and non-State stakeholders on this vision. During COP 22 , several thematic days have been planned, including on forests, water, cities, energy, transport and agriculture. ""In Paris, it was about momentum, enthusiasm and political commitment. Now the question is how we will implement and how we will conduct a race against time,"" said Ms. Tubiana during a press conference in Marrakech on about the launch of the Champion's 'Global Climate Action Agenda' to mobilize non-State actors. The [Agenda] ""is really the response to this race against time that everyone, governments first, but also cities, businesses, civil society, indigenous people, youth, women movements"" is part of, she added. ""We can't be complacent,"" underscored Ms. Tubiana. ""We have everything to do, we are lagging behind."" She added that the [Action Agenda] ""is a way to accelerate the movement, to accelerate action, develop cooperation, to do it faster, better, cheaper and to get everyone on the same page [...] It is about concrete action on the ground, how to transform the transport, how to have better cities, how really to stop deforestation,"" she added. Ms. El Haite stressed that 80 per cent of the decisions on climate action are implemented by non-State actors. ""I think it is very important for all of us to recognize that the non-State actors are already moving and there are many [actions], initiatives and coalitions and they are very active,"" she said. ""This is the first time we are building a real partnership between the non-State actors and the actors,"" she added. ""We think it is very important to have these partnerships. We have built for many years walls between the negotiators and the parties and the real world and the non-State actors. Today we need to build bridges between them."" Asked by the UN News Centre about the link between climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Ms. Tubiana noted that there is a ""single development agenda"" and that climate is ""a part of that development agenda."" ""No doubt the negotiations on implementation are more advanced in the climate area than in other areas, but it is all the same thing [...] There is one agenda that governments must implement and this new development model should really be supported by the citizens, the businesses, the financial sector in each country, and internationally,"" she added. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK293","-Sustainable is the new 'green' for supply chains; BearingPoint study finds social responsibility is pushing supply chain to the next maturity level","June 10, 2016 Friday","ENP Newswire","Frankfurt- According to a new study by management and technology consultancy BearingPoint, the emerging trend is to move from green to sustainable supply chain management. The company's 5th Supply Chain Monitor found that European supply chains have already harvested most of the low-hanging fruit of carbon reduction initiatives since the previous 2010-11 study. In between there was even some kind of slow down for green initiatives, as all climate conferences prior to COP21 failed. However, currently BearingPoint sees a revival of green awareness, which is especially driven by the Diesel scandal. For social aspects the study shows a clear trend: the importance of social aspects along the supply chain is constantly evolving. Measurement and reporting of social initiatives and performance today are at a similar level to where green initiatives were four years ago. This reflects a growing demand from some national regulators for companies to include social responsibility information in their CSR reporting. For 70 percent of companies in Europe, the social aspects of a supply chain were a strategic priority in their supply chain management endeavors, according to the study, with a further 12 percent saying this would be the case within the next 1-5 years. Only 11 percent felt that the social impact of their supply chain to be of no importance. 'We see social topics rising quickly in importance for companies as regulators sharpen their focus on social sustainability. Consumers are already increasingly selecting products and suppliers that are 'fairer,' or more sustainable. This becomes obvious by the mind change of companies like Wal-Mart that shift from cheap is best to sustainable is best.' Matthias Loebich, Partner at BearingPoint Ignoring the environmental side of business can lead to a one-two punch from regulators and consumers The study drilled down into environmental efforts by companies as well, with more than half the survey focused on the current state of green supply chains. Having a green supply chain is high on the agenda for 59 percent of European companies and for 51 percent of US companies. Considerably more US companies (21 percent compared with 6 percent of European companies) see it becoming an important priority in the short term (the next 1-3 years), as they strive to close the gap and bring their activities in line with Europe. The survey shows the current key drivers and willingness to invest, as well as the state of carbon accounting, eco-design and development, green production and procurement, logistics and recycling. 'How painful it can be to ignore the environmental side of a company's business became obvious with the diesel emissions scandal, it can be a one-two punch from regulators and consumers. This together with the agreement reached at the COP21 UN conference on climate change , we see a renewed commitment.' Matthias Loebich, Partner at BearingPoint Lack of sustainability reports Almost half (46 percent) of respondents indicated that their companies had either increased or heavily increased the number of employees working on sustainability topics, reflecting the increase in efforts in social terms. The US in particular has raised its game, which is attributed to the fact that activity to date there has lagged European efforts by a visible margin. However, only 25 percent of European companies in the sample produce sustainability reports, and just 3 percent are planning to, reflecting the immaturity of fuller CSR activities and the current lack of systems which allow these activities to be recorded and measured. Recommendations Companies should consider all opportunities for improvement, including those which transcend their own operational boundaries, using tools to streamline and automate the process wherever possible, such as: -Joining official programs such as LEAN and GREEN by GS1 or Green Freight Europe to structure and report energy and CO2 reductions in a formalized manner. -Calculate carbon footprint by using leading standards like EN 16258, only. -Run sustainability programs in line with ISO 26000 or with GRI G4. -Think of sustainable supplier rating platforms such as EcoVadis ( HYPERLINK ), to reduce the need to handle repeated requests. Read the study here to find out more. BearingPoint's 5th Supply Chain Monitor 'From Green to Sustainable Supply Chain Management,' the research pool comprised 215 European and 51 US companies participating in the survey. 76 percent of the respondents came from Germany, Switzerland and Austria. 15 percent of respondents came from the Nordics, seven percent from France and two percent from the Benelux countries. For comparative purpose, only selected questions were asked to respondents coming from the US.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK294","MARRAKECH: Civil society vital to drive momentum on Paris Agreement targets, say 'Climate Champions'","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","FinancialWire","Beyond the work of governments, other stakeholders such businesses, cities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have a crucial role to play in implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change, 'Climate Champions' Laurence Tubiana and Hakima El Haite said today in Marrakech, where the United Nations conference known as ' COP 22 ' is under way. Ms. Tubiana, French Ambassador on climate change, and Ms. El Haite, Moroccan Minister in charge of Environment, were appointed Climate Champions by the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris last year (COP 21), where nations adopted the landmark Agreement, which calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of the phenomenon. The two high-level Champions were tasked with heeding the call made at COP 21 and taking forward the idea that mobilizing stronger and more ambitious climate action by all Parties and non-Party stakeholders is urgently required if the Paris goals are to be achieved. Just last week, on 4 November when the Paris Agreement entered into force, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convened at UN Headquarters in New York a special meeting with civil society representatives, thanking them for their courage, persistence and leadership in realizing the Paris Agreement and calling on them to ""keep up the fight,"" to press for action and to hold governments accountable. Ms. Tubiana and Ms. El Haite have meanwhile set out a detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. They have also launched a consultative process in order to seek the views of governments and non-State stakeholders on this vision. During COP 22 , several thematic days have been planned, including on forests, water, cities, energy, transport and agriculture. ""In Paris, it was about momentum, enthusiasm and political commitment. Now the question is how we will implement and how we will conduct a race against time,"" said Ms. Tubiana during a press conference in Marrakech on about the launch of the Champion's 'Global Climate Action Agenda' to mobilize non-State actors.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK295","MARRAKECH: New initiatives on forest protection give boost to climate action agenda","November 10, 2016 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","November 9, 2016 The global effort to protect and sustainably manage forests and deliver on climate change targets got a major boost at the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP 22 ) taking place in Marrakech, Morocco, where several projects on protecting woodlands worldwide were announced. Forest actors at the meeting, formally known as the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), expressed cautious optimism, welcoming the progress made on forest protection but warned against complacency. ""We know that the annual net loss of natural forests is slowing - a 25 per cent decrease in 2015 compared to 2000. But this is very much about restoration, regeneration of forests and reforestation, [but] unfortunately tropical forest clearing continues,"" said 'Climate Champion' Laurence Tubiana at a press conference yesterday. Ms. Tubiana, the French Ambassador on climate change, and Hakima El Haite, Moroccan Minister in charge of Environment, were appointed Climate Champions by the previous UN Climate Conference, known as COP 21. ""It is improving, the action was effective, but we have to improve it if we want to be really consistent with the [Paris targets],"" Ms. Tubiana added, referring to the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, which was adopted in the French capital last year and calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of the phenomenon. Also at press conference, Rene Castro Salazar, the Assistant Director-General for Forestry of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), also warned against complacency. ""Forests are still disappearing at close to three million hectares per year [...] especially natural forests. We hope the remaining four billion hectares of forest of the world will be sustainably managed, that will be the only way to preserve the resource. Addressing climate change cannot be done without a sustainable forest management programme,"" he underscored. In efforts to tackle climate change, forests play an important role as they absorb and store carbon as trees grow, thereby eliminating emissions from the atmosphere. But deforestation and forest degradation have the opposite effect: they release carbon into the atmosphere. Currently, deforestation and forest degradation are responsible for 12 per cent of global carbon emissions. ""Forests are one of the largest and most cost-effective responses we have to climate change,"" said Helen Clark, Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), said in a news release. According to Mr. Castro Salazar, healthier forests not only help combat climate change but also contribute to many other global development goals by providing food, income, fuel and shelter. The sense of prudent optimism was shared by the Senior Director of the Forest and Climate Program of the non-governmental organization WWF, Josephina Brana-Varela. ""There is a lot of progress. We are on the right path but we need to do it faster,"" she said at the press conference. To that end, she drew attention to the ""very unusual coalition of partners"" that has emerged around the issue, including developed countries, developing countries, corporations, private sector actors, indigenous people, and multilateral organizations. A dozen initiatives were presented yesterday at COP 22 by countries from Africa, Asia and South America during Forest Action Day, which is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda initiative by France and Morocco to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens. Among initiatives, the Government of Indonesia announced that it is implementing a moratorium on clearing super-high-carbon intact peatlands. Colombia announced forest plans linked to the peace process, including an initiative to put very large areas of forest under the control of indigenous people. The Moroccan Government announced an initiative called 'Strengthened Action in Favor of Forests in the Mediterranean-Sahel Region in the Context of Climate Change' to help countries of that region meet multilateral commitments to forests. ""The idea is to form a collaborative partnership throughout the region given the interactions and strong relationships in environmental and socio-economic areas,"" said the Secretary General of the High Commissioner for water and forests of Morocco, Abderrahim Houmy, at the press conference. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK296","Nissan and Enel launch vehicle-to-grid trial in the UK","May 12, 2016 Thursday 12:06 PM GMT","just-auto global news","Automotive industry leader Nissan and multinational power company Enel on 10 May 2016, confirmed plans to launch a major vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trial - the first ever carried out in the UK. The trial will work by installing and connecting one hundred V2G units at locations agreed by private and fleet owners of the Nissan LEAF and e-NV200 electric van. By giving Nissan electric vehicle owners the ability to plug their vehicles into the V2G system, owners will have the flexibility and power to sell stored energy from their vehicle battery back to the National Grid. This announcement follows the signing of the Nissan-Enel V2G partnership agreement in Paris in December 2015 during the 21st UN Conference on Climate Change (COP21) and the subsequent kick-off, in January 2016, of the installation of 40 V2G units in Denmark. \~ Today\' s announcement heralds an exciting era for energy management in the UK. Not only will Nissan electric vehicle owners be able to play an active role in grid stability, providing an alternate source of income, but it will revolutionise how energy is supplied to the grid. Once scaled up, the V2G technology can become a game-changer for owners of Nissan EV in the UK as they become fully fledged and active participants in the UK energy market. \~ \~ Paul Willcox, chairman of Nissan Europe, said:  Today\' s landmark trial in the UK is a significant step forward in renewable energy management, helping shape the future of industries, cities and societies. Smart energy management is one of the biggest challenges any nation faces for the future which is why this trial is so critical in assessing the feasibility of using variable, more flexible energy sources. We see Nissan electric vehicles as being the mobile energy hubs of the future, pioneering a self-sustaining energy infrastructure that will help solve the capacity issues of the future. \~  This is the first time this has ever been done in the UK and by enabling customers to sell energy back to the grid, we are providing a financial incentive to choose the sustainable option. \~ This endeavour is part of Enel and Nissan\' s commitment to support the entire EV Ecosystem, going beyond the car itself and delivering new services to the energy industry. Moreover, there will be an increasing number of EVs on the roads across Europe in the future and it is vital that V2G technology is rolled out to ensure the grid can satisfy the demands made upon it for increased energy. \~  We are thrilled about the launch of this project in the UK, said Ernesto Ciorra, Enel\' s head of innovation and sustainability.  The installation of our innovative two-way charging technology will encourage the integration of non-programmable renewable energy flows into the grid and will help the spread of electric mobility in the country, benefiting the energy sector and the environment, while also having a positive impact on electric owners wallets. The fact that Nissan has chosen Enel\' s charging technology to trial in the UK is the perfect demonstration of just how much potential the group\' s V2G electric vehicle charging system has to revolutionise not only transport but also the way electricity distribution works. \~ Industry projections show that by 2050 there might be twice as many cars on the road as there is today - a staggering 2.4bn. Delivering and managing that growth in a way that is sustainable for the world, requires smart thinking. \~ Nissan, as the pioneer of electric vehicles, alongside Enel, a worldwide leader in smart grid technology and advanced energy metering, have been looking at ways to use electric vehicles beyond traditional mobility. Nissan electric vehicles will be used for more than just getting from A-to-B. They will turn into clean mobile energy units whose unused power can be sent back to the grid to power homes, offices, schools and hospitals. \~ Steve Holliday, former CEO at National Grid, said:  At National Grid we are constantly looking to the future to ensure we have the capacity to meet national energy demand - it\' s our job to future proof the national transmission network. The rapid uptake of electric vehicles is certainly positive yet could also be challenging if we don\' t plan ahead. One of our future energy scenarios indicates that there could be up to 700,000 electric vehicles in 2020 requiring an extra 500 MW of energy. That\' s why we support innovative technologies and pioneering projects such as this one that have the potential to make a real difference to the way we manage energy supply and demand. \~ Currently if all 18,000 Nissan electric vehicles in the UK were connected to the energy network, they would generate the equivalent output of a 180 MW power plant. If that was scaled up in a future where all the vehicles on UK roads are electric, vehicle-to-grid technology could generate a virtual power plant of up to 370GW. This energy capacity would be enough to power the UK, Germany and France. \~ V2G technology allows electric vehicles to be fully integrated into the electricity grid and will help improve grid capability to handle renewable power, making renewable sources even more widely integrated and affordable. V2G charging infrastructure developed by Enel gives private EV owners and businesses with large EV fleets the opportunity to create mobile energy hubs by integrating their vehicles into the grid. The system works by allowing Nissan EV owners to connect to the grid to charge at low-demand, cheap tariff periods, with an option to then use the electricity stored in the vehicle\' s battery at home and at work when costs are higher, or even feed back to the grid which could generate additional revenue for the EV owner. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK299","Article - Paris climate agreement: ""We are working to secure a swift entry into force""","October 4, 2016 Tuesday","FinancialWire","Parliament is ready to give its consent to the ratification of the Paris climate agreement today in the presence of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and COP21 President Segolene Royal after EU ministers approved it on 30 September. The EU ratification would trigger the entry into force of the first-ever universal, legally-binding global climate deal. Ahead of the Council vote, we discussed the agreement with Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via, chair of the environment committee. Following the vote and signing live online You can follow the event live on our website from noon CET. Parliament's consent vote on the ratification of the Paris climate agreement will take place at about 12.15 CET. Before the vote UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will address the plenary. Parliament President Martin Schulz and political group leaders will also take the floor. About the Paris agreement The Paris agreement sets out a global action plan to fight climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C. It was agreed by 195 countries at the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015. The agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which it has been ratified by 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions. So far 62 countries have ratified the agreement but the threshold of 55% of global emissions has not been met yet, even after the ratification of the climate deal by the US, China and India. The ratification by the European Union is therefore significant as it would trigger the entry into force of the agreement. Interview with Giovanni La Via The following interview was originally published on 29 September ahead of the Extraordinary Environment Council on 30 September: For decades we have prided ourselves on our environmental protection but now we seem to be playing catch-up with the US and China. How did this happen? What is Parliament doing about it? It happened because we wasted a lot of time. After the UN General Assembly and New York Climate Week, we now have 60 countries, representing 47.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions, who have ratified the Paris agreement. We are working to secure a swift entry into force of the agreement. The first step in Parliament is a vote by the environment committee followed by a vote during the plenary session on 3-6 October for the final confirmation. A timely EU ratification decision would send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its member states and their continuing efforts to address climate change at an international level. We cannot miss this opportunity. What are the main points of the agreement? What will they mean in practical terms for people and companies in Europe? It is clear that the main goal of the Paris agreement is to maintain the increase of the temperature during the current century well below two degrees. What does it mean? That we have to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, we are now going to do a lot of legislative work on climate policy. We are working on efforts sharing, which concerns reducing emissions in sectors not part of the emissions trading system. We have to decide how we contribute to this goal and divide up the efforts between the different 28 member states. We also have to work on energy efficiency and renewable energy in order to reduce the production of greenhouse and to store CO2 in soil or somewhere else without putting our competitiveness at risk. The next climate change conference - COP22 - takes place in Marrakesh on 7-18 November. What will happen there? Could this prove to be an even tougher challenge? In Marrakesh we will start the process of implementing the policies after Paris. We plan to make significant progress on key elements of the agreement, including an enhanced transparency framework, details of the global stocktake, further guidance on nationally determined contributions and a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance. The European Union has done its homework: we have published new proposals and put some ideas into practice. The first steps in that direction are initiatives such as effort sharing, waste reform, the circular economy package, the emissions trading system and LULUCF, a proposal on land use, land use change and forestry.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK302","Article - Paris climate agreement: ""We are working to secure a swift entry into force""","October 4, 2016 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","October 4, 2016 Parliament is ready to give its consent to the ratification of the Paris climate agreement today in the presence of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and COP21 President Segolene Royal after EU ministers approved it on 30 September. The EU ratification would trigger the entry into force of the first-ever universal, legally-binding global climate deal. Ahead of the Council vote, we discussed the agreement with Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via, chair of the environment committee. Following the vote and signing live online You can follow the event live on our website from noon CET. Parliament's consent vote on the ratification of the Paris climate agreement will take place at about 12.15 CET. Before the vote UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will address the plenary. Parliament President Martin Schulz and political group leaders will also take the floor. About the Paris agreement The Paris agreement sets out a global action plan to fight climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C. It was agreed by 195 countries at the Paris climate conference (COP21) in December 2015. The agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which it has been ratified by 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions. So far 62 countries have ratified the agreement but the threshold of 55% of global emissions has not been met yet, even after the ratification of the climate deal by the US, China and India. The ratification by the European Union is therefore significant as it would trigger the entry into force of the agreement. Interview with Giovanni La Via The following interview was originally published on 29 September ahead of the Extraordinary Environment Council on 30 September: For decades we have prided ourselves on our environmental protection but now we seem to be playing catch-up with the US and China. How did this happen? What is Parliament doing about it? It happened because we wasted a lot of time. After the UN General Assembly and New York Climate Week, we now have 60 countries, representing 47.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions, who have ratified the Paris agreement. We are working to secure a swift entry into force of the agreement. The first step in Parliament is a vote by the environment committee followed by a vote during the plenary session on 3-6 October for the final confirmation. A timely EU ratification decision would send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its member states and their continuing efforts to address climate change at an international level. We cannot miss this opportunity. What are the main points of the agreement? What will they mean in practical terms for people and companies in Europe? It is clear that the main goal of the Paris agreement is to maintain the increase of the temperature during the current century well below two degrees. What does it mean? That we have to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, we are now going to do a lot of legislative work on climate policy. We are working on efforts sharing, which concerns reducing emissions in sectors not part of the emissions trading system. We have to decide how we contribute to this goal and divide up the efforts between the different 28 member states. We also have to work on energy efficiency and renewable energy in order to reduce the production of greenhouse and to store CO2 in soil or somewhere else without putting our competitiveness at risk. The next climate change conference - COP22 - takes place in Marrakesh on 7-18 November. What will happen there? Could this prove to be an even tougher challenge? In Marrakesh we will start the process of implementing the policies after Paris. We plan to make significant progress on key elements of the agreement, including an enhanced transparency framework, details of the global stocktake, further guidance on nationally determined contributions and a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance. The European Union has done its homework: we have published new proposals and put some ideas into practice. The first steps in that direction are initiatives such as effort sharing, waste reform, the circular economy package, the emissions trading system and LULUCF, a proposal on land use, land use change and forestry. We now need global efforts at an international level. Giovanni La Via was the chair of the Parliament delegation at the COP21 conference in Paris last year. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK303","-Imperial College London - Focus green investments on tried and tested technology, says Imperial expert","November 24, 2016 Thursday","ENP Newswire","At the UN climate summit in Marrakech ( COP22 ), an expert panel considered how financial tools can encourage investment in low-carbon technologies. Speaking at the event last week, Dr Charles Donovan, Director of Imperial's new Centre for Climate Finance & Investment, advocated prioritising investment in proven technologies. 'There's a huge difference between technologies that are merely possible and the ones that are already economically viable. More effort needs to go into scaling up the technologies that we know work,' he said. Over 100 representatives from the private sector, governments and NGOs attended the panel discussion, which was jointly organised by Imperial, led by the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC). In contrast, Donovan questioned the appeal to private investors of technologies that have yet to prove viable on a large-scale, like Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) -a solution whereby the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is extracted from the atmosphere by growing plant crops, which are then burned to generate energy, and the resulting emissions are stored underground. 'I can't see a way that this technology could become acceptable to the private sector in the next two decades,' commented Donovan. Although BECCS is widely considered essential to meeting climate targets, it is still in the early stages of development and no full-scale trial BECCS plants have yet been built. Watch Dr Donovan and other Imperial academics speaking at the conference in Marrakech : HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eusSWJzVyOI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eusSWJzVyOI Funding a low carbon world 'Low-carbon technologies' that either reduce or produce less emissions of greenhouse gases will be instrumental in limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius, the target agreed by governments signing the 2015 Paris Agreement. But experts agree that substantial financial investment will be needed to roll them out in sufficient quantity to have the desired effect. Whilst governments around the world have committed to raising US$ 100 billion every year to fund projects designed to avoid and adapt to climate change, it will come nowhere close to meeting the need for new climate-friendly infrastructure. According to the International Energy Agency, meeting the pledges set out in the Paris Agreement will come with a hefty price tag: US$ 13.5 trillion by 2030. Getting private investors on board is therefore critical. 'Private sector investment is vital: we need trillions, not hundreds of billions,' said Donovan, speaking at the event. 'The challenge however lies in convincing investors that low-carbon projects can reap the same rewards as more traditional investments. 'Green projects are frequently overlooked by the private sector as they typically do not offer high returns and present uncertain risks. New financial mechanisms might, however, encourage investors to think again.' One such example is the UK's Green Investment Bank, which invests in infrastructure projects that are both green and profitable. Since its inception in 2012, the bank has mobilised GBP11 billion from private investors. Donovan was however keen to emphasise that for financial solutions to work, green projects can't be sold purely on their environmental impact. 'A financial injection alone can't make up for a project that is deemed to be too risky,' said Donovan. As well as difficulties in attracting private investment, BECCS technology faces a number of additional hurdles. Find out how climate change is affecting businesses in this animation : \~ HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj2d8ZboWvw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj2d8ZboWvw 'The challenges around deploying BECCS at the scales we think are required to meet the Paris Agreement's goals are daunting,' said Ajay Gambhir, Senior Policy Research Fellow at the Grantham Institute, whose work in the AVOID 2 programme for the UK Government modelled the future for different energy technologies under different policy scenarios. 'We need to consider the huge amount of land area required for bioenergy crops as well as the infrastructure to transport and store captured carbon dioxide. To progress BECCS from a few pilot scale plants to a global bioenergy industry servicing thousands of commercial scale facilities, there will need to be considerable investment in planning, demonstration, infrastructure development and all of the supporting financial, legal and regulatory aspects surrounding this technology.' 'Governments should be focused on laying the foundations for these activities right now, even if - without effective carbon pricing or policy signals - BECCS will remain unattractive to private investors for some years to come.'

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK304","Luxembourg launches world's first Green Exchange","Institutional Asset Manager"," ","The Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) has become the first stock exchange to introduce a platform for green financial instruments - the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX) which has gone live this week. Access is limited to issuers who comply with stringent eligibility criteria, while the platform aims to set a new benchmark for the rapidly evolving green securities market. \~ Robert Scharfe, CEO of LuxSE, says: ""New issuance of green securities has taken off since COP21. There is a real desire for change. The green market has enormous potential but this needs to be matched by interest from investors. By setting strict standards for green securities, LGX aims to create an environment where the market can prosper. The upcoming COP22 event will focus on preparations for the Paris Agreement to enter into force. With LGX, a dedicated platform for both issuers and investors, we are granting the solution for financing green projects."" \~ LGX gathers issuers that dedicate 100 per cent of the raised funding to green investments. \~ The platform will immediately become home to the majority of the 114 green bonds listed on LuxSE, worth over USD45 billion. \~ LGX marks the first time that a stock exchange requires green securities to adhere to strict eligibility criteria, including the fact that the issuer has to clearly state, during the application process, the intended green nature of the security, while there must also be clear disclosure that the proceeds are exclusively used for financing or refinancing projects that are 100 per cent green, according to the GBP or CBI eligibility taxonomy. \~ In addition an issuer must be committed to providing both independent external review and ex-post reporting - a requirement unprecedented on the market. \~ ""Ex-post reporting is far from being the market standard. The bold decision to introduce it as an entry requirement stems from our ambition to be able to guarantee that securities on LGX are genuinely green. Such reassurance is what investors seek as they increasingly expect issuers to be crystal clear about the use of proceeds,"" says Scharfe. \~ Access to LGX is banned for securities on the excluded categories list comprising of, but not limited to, nuclear power production; trade in CITES; animal testing for cosmetics and other non-medical products; medical testing on endangered species; fossil fuels. \~ The LGX concept has been developed in line with best practices set out by Climate Bonds Initiative, International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). LGX has its own logo - a colour variation of the standard LuxSE trademark. \~ ""An issuer who does not meet LGX eligibility criteria can still list on our markets, but the 'bar is higher' for entry to LGX. Having said that, we encourage issuers to go further than the minimum requirements and really leverage this platform to create new standards on the quality of communication with investors,"" says Scharfe. \~ With over USD42 billion in new issuances globally, 2015 was another record year for labelled green bonds. As estimated by the Climate Bonds Initiative, in 2016 the green bonds issuance will reach USD100 billion. The already thriving green bonds sector received an additional boost after the COP21 conference in Paris last year during which 195 countries agreed on keeping the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius. The\~International Energy Agency\~estimates that the world\~needs USD1 trillion a year until 2050 to finance a low-emissions transition. The market for green finance is growing fast, and yet it represents an almost invisible fraction of overall capital market funding. \~ ""That's because investors are sceptical, and understandably so, about how the proceeds for green projects are being allocated. It's not enough to say 'green is green'. Investors are becoming more sophisticated and are demanding more granular information. Equally, issuers must be convinced of the benefits a truly green bond market can provide. In particular, the visibility for their securities and trust gained among investors,"" says Scharfe. \~ ""As the leading exchange for green bonds, LuxSE can play a vital role in shaping the future of green finance,"" he says. ""In fact, we regard the development of this market as our duty. Users of international capital markets look to us to provide the best generally available information to investors. With respect to the green bond market, we are committing the same efforts to promote improved visibility by providing greater transparency and more trust."" \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK306","-WB-Leaders Call for Global Action to Reduce Transport's Climate Footprint","May 9, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","Ministers of Environment from France, the Netherlands and Morocco, mayors and CEOs today joined with the World Bank Group and other stakeholders to call for global and more concerted action to tackle the climate impact of transport while ensuring mobility for everyone. Transport represents 23% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. With demand for mobility increasing exponentially, especially in developing countries, transport is the fastest growing source of GHG emissions. The number of privately owned motorcars is expected to double to 2 billion by 2050 and, under a business as usual scenario, the share of transport in GHG emissions would reach 33% by then. At the Climate Action 2016 Summit, senior leaders highlighted the potential for the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be derailed if current trends in high-carbon transport and related investments continue. And a consensus emerged around the need for a 'sustainable mobility' global vision, supported by clear goals and targets, bold actions and a common tracking framework. 'We have a huge opportunity right now to unite our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of the transport sector and to make it more accessible, more efficient and safer for all,' said Laura Tuck, World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development. 'If we join forces around a global coalition with a clear vision and achievable targets, sustainable mobility for all can become a reality.' 'COP21 finally put transport on the climate map as both a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and as a key solution to tackling climate change,' said Segolene Royale, France's Minister of Ecology, Energy and the Sea, and President of COP 21. 'From electric mobility, transport planning, efficient vehicles, solutions exist, and the Lima Paris Action Agenda initiatives will contribute to make this global effort happen.' 'Heading into COP22 in Marrakech, we see action on sustainable transport needed on innovation and on behavior,' said Dr. Hakima El Haite Morocco's Delegate Minister in Charge of Environment. 'We will be among those calling for a coalition on green mobility.' The Summit heard concrete ideas that can have immediate impact. These included fuel standards, fossil fuel subsidy reform and carbon pricing, as well as more efficient and safer mobility solutions that deliver greater access through better public transport systems. Discussions also focused on the need for more resilient mobility infrastructure, and on how successful local mobility efforts can be scaled up at global level, and thereby have dramatic impact on total carbon emissions and accessibility for all. 'We can build an alliance of the people who want to see a transformation done in transport,' said Sharon Dijksma, Netherlands Environment Minister. 'Such a coalition is really important. And I hope that together with the World Bank, the United Nations, the Netherlands and others who have experience in such efforts, we can scale up worldwide the good work that is already happening at the local or national level.' 'Convergence and synergism in action plans are essential to mobilize the private sector, through the emergence of significant new markets, and to reduce the cost of transformation. Timely investment in innovative solutions will be critical to the success of both environmental and social goals, including job creation, a worldwide concern. This requires visibility on regional and global roadmaps' added Jean-Dominique Senard, Michelin CEO. The goals of the sustainable mobility for all framework include: secure access for all to economic and social opportunities through greater mobility; increase the efficiency of transport systems and the services these provide to people and businesses; improve the safety of mobility and reach the SDG target of halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020; and respond to the climate imperative of mitigation and adaptation as set forth in the Paris climate agreement. This common framework will also help the international community -including the UN, World Bank Group, private sector, civil society and all development partners- to focus its support to developing countries' governments in reaching their commitments under the Paris climate agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK308","-Luxembourg - EIB partnership highlighted as global example to unlock additional climate investment","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Luxembourg - European Investment Bank partnership highlighted as global example to unlock additional climate investment. The Luxembourg - EIB Climate Finance Platform has been welcomed as an international model for increasing climate investment using limited public sector support and representing a key step to tackle the challenge of limited equity investment in climate projects. The new initiative will enable climate focused investment funds to support high-impact climate projects around the world and bring in additional support from private investors who otherwise could not back more challenging climate schemes. 'Access to public funds to reduce investment risk is essential to scale up climate finance from private investors. Initiatives such as the new Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform represent a clear model for others to follow,' said Elvira Lefting, Managing Director of fund manager Finance in Motion. The contribution of the new Luxembourg - EIB Climate Finance Platform to unlocking new climate investment and address the limited availability of equity investment in climate projects was outlined to representatives of countries, financial institutions and international fund managers at the COP 22 climate conference currently being held in Marrakesh, Morocco. 'Governments around the world have limited public budgets and unlocking private investment is essential to address climate change. Luxembourg is pleased to work with the European Investment Bank, the world's largest lender for climate related investment, to support the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform.' highlighted Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg Minister of the Environment. This new initiative will support Luxembourg based climate investment funds to support high-impact climate projects inside and outside Europe and be managed by the European Investment Bank, the world's largest financier for climate related investment. 'Mobilising new investment for projects that help tackle climate change is a global challenge. Here at COP 22 in Marrakech the global community is starting to implement the historic Paris Climate Agreement and sharing experience of successful initiatives such as the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform will strengthen similar efforts elsewhere around the world. At a time when political leadership on climate is needed, it is essential for Europe to show how climate challenges can be turned into opportunities through exciting new initiatives such as this. Considering the importance of our financial centre, it is only natural that Luxembourg is a frontrunner in shifting towards sustainable investments.' added Minister Dieschbourg. Earlier this month Luxembourg ratified the Paris Climate Agreement and Luxembourg has agreed to contribute EUR 30 million to this new initiative as a key element of Luxembourg's climate finance engagement. Luxembourg's overall dedicated international climate finance contribution represents EUR 120 million, corresponding to EUR 215 per inhabitant, making Luxembourg one of the biggest per capita donors. This contribution comes on top of official development assistance. 'Scaling up private finance is a priority of the global climate agenda and a key focus is to increase the impact of the European Investment Bank's own climate financing. Simply speaking if private investment is not mobilised, efforts to tackle climate change will fail.' confirmed Jonathan Taylor, European Investment Bank Vice President. Luxembourg's environment minister Carole Dieschbourg and Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna formally launched the Luxembourg - EIB Climate Finance Platform with EIB President Werner Hoyer last month. 'Successful effort to tackle local challenges of a changing climate and increase the impact of investment require innovative financing. This new initiative will help unlock new climate focused equity investment in regions most vulnerable to climate change' Monique Barbu, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention to combat desertification. Over the last five years the European Investment Bank has provided more than EUR 90 billion for climate related investment and EIB climate finance reached a record high in EUR 20.7 billion in 2015. Prior to COP 21 in Paris the European Investment Bank adopted its first Climate Lending Strategy which reinforced the climate related impact of all EIB financing activity.

As in most of rural Morocco, climate change and population pressures have led to more unpredictable rainfall patterns and the depletion of natural water sources, such as underground aquifers, in the area around the village of Taloust. Situated in the country's south-west Sidi Ifni region, close to the coast, the area is extremely arid as it borders the northern Sahara desert. Average annual precipitation is less than 130mm. Related: Peru's fog catchers net water supplies | Dan Collyns In recent years, repeated cycles of intense drought followed by flash floods have led to deaths and the devastation of local infrastructure. Desertification, land degradation and the advance of the Sahara also affect the area. However, the Sidi Ifni region does have one precious resource: fog. ""We began to read about 'fog harvesting' projects around the world, and we wondered if we could repeat it here,"" says Bargach. ""Our observations started in 2006, and we saw that on average we have 143 days of fog a year."" The fog is caused by a unique microclimate. Warm air driven by ocean currents makes landfall on Morocco's Atlantic coast around the town of Sidi Ifni; as the humid air rises, it hits the natural barrier of Morocco's Anti-Atlas mountains, which start just 35km east from the coast and rise to more than 2,500m. From there, the air turns into blankets of thick fog, particularly between December and June. For years, the community saw this as a bad thing: they believed the fog prevented rainfall, turned fields to mud and made people ill. ""Lots of people were reluctant - and even negative - at the beginning of the project. Some even thought that cloud water would not be safe to drink,"" says Bargach, who is now director of non-profit organisation Dar Si Hmad. ""We weren't sure if it was going to deliver and we didn't want to disappoint people. But slowly people began to be convinced, and now the local women call the nets their 'wells'."" Over the past 10 years, Dar Si Hmad has erected vast mesh nets to capture the moisture at an altitude of 1,225m on the slopes of Mount Boutmezguida - for what is now the largest fog-harvesting project in the world. About 600 square metres of mesh nets capture water particles from the fog, which then condense and drip into collection trays. Roughly 6,300 litres of water can be harvested daily. The water is then filtered and mixed with underground water. More than 8km of pipelines have been installed to share the water between about 400 people in five villages. The benefits are obvious: clean water that is both instant and free. ""We used to spend at least four or five hours going to collect water every day from wells in neighbouring villages, or collecting the rain in tanks during the rainy season,"" says Zeyna Hamou Ali, 20, a local woman who works as a coordinator for Dar Si Hmad. ""This made it very difficult for us to go to school because it's just accepted by everyone that it's a woman's job to go and get water."" The population of these areas of south-west Morocco consists predominantly of rural Berber women, the indigenous inhabitants of north Africa who speak a dialect of the Tamazight language. Rates of illiteracy among rural communities in Morocco are surprisingly high: more than 40%, with women accounting for the lion's share of that figure. Dar Si Hmad also provides training and educational opportunities to women from the villages. The idea of harvesting fog was first developed in South America in the 1980s and there are other projects in Chile, Peru, Ghana, Eritrea, South Africa and California in the US. In 2017, Dar Si Hmad plans to start installing the next generation of bigger and better ""cloudfisher"" nets, developed in Germany. These larger nets will double the amount of water collected and connect another eight villages to the network. In recognition of its contribution to finding innovative, community-led solutions to climate change, Dar Si Hmad was awarded the 2016 UN momentum for change award. Ali and the project's directors travelled to collect the award at the COP22 climate change conference, which took place in Marrakech in November.

The trial will work by installing and connecting one hundred V2G units at locations agreed by private and fleet owners of the Nissan LEAF and e-NV200 electric van. By giving Nissan electric vehicle owners the ability to plug their vehicles into the V2G system, owners will have the flexibility and power to sell stored energy from their vehicle battery back to the National Grid. Today's announcement heralds an exciting era for energy management in the UK. Not only will Nissan electric vehicle owners be able to play an active role in grid stability, providing an alternate source of income, but it will revolutionise how energy is supplied to the grid. Once scaled up, the V2G technology can become a game-changer for owners of Nissan EV in the UK as they become fully fledged and active participants in the UK energy market. Paul Willcox, Chairman of Nissan Europe, said: 'Today's landmark trial in the UK is a significant step forward in renewable energy management, helping shape the future of industries, cities and societies. Smart energy management is one of the biggest challenges any nation faces for the future which is why this trial is so critical in assessing the feasibility of using variable, more flexible energy sources. We see Nissan electric vehicles as being the mobile energy hubs of the future, pioneering a self-sustaining energy infrastructure that will help solve the capacity issues of the future.' 'This is the first time this has ever been done in the UK and by enabling customers to sell energy back to the grid, we're providing a financial incentive to choose the sustainable option.' This endeavour is part of Enel and Nissan's commitment to support the entire EV ecosystem, going beyond the car itself and delivering new services to the energy industry. Moreover, there will be an increasing number of EVs on the roads across Europe in the future and it is vital that V2G technology is rolled out to ensure the grid can satisfy the demands made upon it for increased energy. 'We are thrilled about the launch of this project in the UK,' said Ernesto Ciorra, Enel's Head of Innovation and Sustainability. 'The installation of our innovative two-way charging technology will encourage the integration of non-programmable renewable energy flow into the grid and will help the spread of electric mobility in the country, benefitting the energy sector and the environment, while also having a positive impact on electric owners' wallets. The fact that Nissan has chosen Enel's charging technology to trial in the UK is the perfect demonstration of just how much potential the Group's V2G electric vehicle charging system has to revolutionise not only transport but also the way electricity distribution works.' Industry projections show that by 2050 there might be twice as many cars on the road as there is today - a staggering 2.4 billion. Delivering and managing that growth in a way that is sustainable for the world, requires smart thinking. Nissan, as the pioneer of electric vehicles, alongside Enel, a worldwide leader in smart grid technology have been looking at ways to use electric vehicles beyond traditional mobility. Nissan electric vehicles will be used for more than just getting from A-to-B. They will turn into clean mobile energy units whose unused power can be sent back to the grid to power homes, offices, schools and hospitals. Steven Holliday, Non-Executive Director, National Grid, said: 'At National Grid we are constantly looking to the future to ensure we have the capacity to meet national energy demand - it's our job to future proof the national transmission network. 'The rapid uptake of Electric Vehicles is certainly positive yet could also be challenging if we don't plan ahead to understand precisely what effect this new technology will have on the electricity system. Our Future Energy team predict that there could be up to 700,000 Electric Vehicles in 2020 requiring an extra 500MW of energy. That's why we support innovative technologies and pioneering projects such as this one that have the potential to make a real difference to the way we manage energy supply and demand.' Currently if all 18,000 Nissan electric vehicles in the UK were connected to the energy network, they would generate the equivalent output of a 180 MW power plant. If that was scaled up in a future where all the vehicles on UK roads are electric, vehicle-to-grid technology could generate a virtual power plant of up to 370 GW. This energy capacity would be enough to power the UK, Germany and France. V2G technology allows electric vehicles to be fully integrated into the electricity grid and will help improve grid capability to handle renewable power, making renewable sources even more widely integrated and affordable. V2G charging infrastructure developed by Enel gives private EV owners and businesses with large EV fleets the opportunity to create mobile energy hubs by integrating their vehicles into the grid. The system works by allowing Nissan EV owners to connect to the grid to charge at low-demand, cheap tariff periods, with an option to then use the electricity stored in the vehicle's battery at home and at work when costs are higher, or even feed back to the grid which could generate additional revenue for the EV owner. Today's announcement follows the signing of a partnership agreement between Nissan and Enel in Paris in December 2015 during the 21st UN Conference on Climate Change (COP21) to trial V2G technology in Europe. A trial comprising 40 V2G units began in Denmark in January 2016. [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk newswire@enpublishing.co.uk \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK311","Poor nations pledge deep emissions cuts at Marrakech summit; Bangladesh and Ethiopia among 48 countries to pledge tougher carbon targets and a switch to 100% re....","November 18, 2016 Friday 4:17 PM GMT","The Guardian","Some of the world's poorest countries have pledged to dramatically cut their carbon emissions and rapidly move to 100% renewable power, as the UN climate summit in Marrakech drew to a close on Friday. The announcement followed a final declaration by nearly 200 nations affirming their ""highest political commitment"" to combatting climate change, in a thinly-coded warning to the incoming US president, Donald Trump. Speaking to the Guardian after bilateral talks with the UK and US, Mezouar, who is also Morocco's foreign minister, said: ""It is a priority of this COP22 presidency to mobilise finance as this is really becoming a necessity and an emergency."" The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) projections suggest that developed countries will have stumped up just one-fifth of the initial amount needed for a $100bn-a-year global climate fund which is due to launch in 2020. A UN source insisted that the $100bn target would be met by 2020 but said trillions would be needed for development to be made more sustainable. ""The question is: how are governments going to change the whole financial structure on this planet to get these big sums going?"" Despite the huge challenges involved, some 48 nations on the climate change front line pledged on Friday to produce tougher carbon targets within four years, and rapidly switch to 100% renewable energy production. Al Gore, the former US vice-president, described the announcement as ""a bold vision that sets the pace for the world's efforts to implement the Paris agreement. These ambitious and inspiring commitments show the path forward for others and give us all renewed optimism that we are going to meet the challenge before us and meet it in time."" Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid's climate spokesman, said: ""It is moving to see, that despite their relative poverty, the world's most vulnerable countries leading the world in delivering the goals of the Paris agreement. They may be relatively small in size but these countries have become titans in the world of climate leadership."" The summit made limited headway on other key issues, ranging from the accord's rulebook to a 2018 review that could strengthen carbon targets to bring them more in line with the science. Crucially, just $165m of new money was pledged by advanced economies for the Green Climate Fund which enabled poorer countries to sign up to the Paris agreement. ""It is very, very worrisome,"" Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, chair of the Least Developed Countries group, told the Guardian. ""If you have to make agriculture resilient, build a sea wall or ensure that diseases don't spread, there is no money-making rationale behind it. That is why public money is needed."" The EU had originally expected a third of the world's climate fund to come from public monies but that percentage has fallen in a time of austerity-squeezed budgets. ""Unfortunately, at this stage it is all about climate finance which is calculated using creative accounting, and methodologies that were not agreed upon and are not conductive to building trust,"" Mpanu Mpanu said. The US has so far only delivered around $500m of a promised $3bn donation to the global climate fund, and little more is expected under a Trump administration. HSBC said that it expects imminent decisions on climate finance contributions to force clarity early in Trump's term on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Asked by the Guardian whether the US could provide an emergency fast-tracking of funds before 20 January when Trump takes office, Jonathan Pershing, the US special envoy on climate change, said that it would be premature to speculate on the president elect's actions in office. But he added: ""We believe that this is an essential part of the movement forward and there will therefore be substantial value for US citizens and taxpayers in addressing these questions and providing technical support."" \"

Speaking at an annual United Nations climate change conference on Wednesday, Mr Hollande vowed to beat by two years the UK's commitment to stopping the use of fossil fuels to generate power by 2025. Mr Hollande, a keynote speaker at the event in Marrakech, Morocco, also praised his US counterpart Barack Obama for his work on climate change, and then appeared to snub President-elect Donald Trump. Mr Trump is reportedly seeking ways to withdraw from the Paris agreement, a global treaty to limit climate change. ""The role played by Barack Obama was crucial in achieving the Paris agreement,"" Mr Hollande said, before adding, in what has been perceived as a dig at Mr Trump, that becoming a signatory to the treaty is ""irreversible"".

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK313","Give millennials a seat at climate talks as a symbolic new country","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 7:01 PM GMT","The Guardian","Nasa released data earlier this year showing that global surface temperatures across land and ocean in February were a whopping 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for that same month from 1951 to 1980. As the COP22 comes to a close, it's time we think hard, and think creatively, about the way forward and start preparing for new initiatives. Building on the impressive success of COP21 in Paris, many political and business leaders as well as representatives of civil society seem eager to engage. That is a good thing, but it is not enough. For better and, increasingly, for worse, our global system of governance rests overwhelmingly on territorial nation-states. In this system, each country's government represents its own national interest. No one represents humanity as a whole. Such devotion to narrow interests leads to a host of profound problems, well known to economists and students of human behaviour. In various contexts they are known as ""the tragedy of the commons"", ""the prisoner's dilemma"", ""exporting externalities"", and ""free riding"". When asked to act for the common good, nation-states are predisposed to echo Cain's notorious response: ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" These decision makers, mostly middle-aged and older people, need to recognise that young people have a special role in representing mankind's interest in our collective future. Most of the people currently deciding how ambitious we should be in reducing carbon emissions and adopting other environmentally sensible measures and policies won't be around in 30 years. It is unacceptable that those with the biggest stake in the future be marginalised. We need new blood - and we need it on the playing field, not on the sidelines. Once a welcome and effective showcase, the COYs (Conferences of Youth), sponsored by the UN one month prior to COPs (Conference of the Parties), run the risk of becoming the symbol of the patronising way young people's views and aspirations are treated. It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government to the exception of all others. For many years, the democracy (once removed) of nations appeared to be the best available alternative. Today, globe-spanning, individual-empowering technologies open new opportunities. Young people are ready for a global system in which democracy remains a guiding principle, but where other entities, such as a symbolic country representing global youth, join actual nation-states in the decision-making. Like the characters in the Star Wars series, this generation does not care so much about where you are from or what colour your skin is. Instead it wants to know what your values are and where you are heading. The time has come for a symbolic new country to take part in COPs and other key international gatherings, to represent the interests of those still under 30 worldwide - just like refugees were finally, deservedly, allowed to compete under their own banner in the Rio Olympics. A mix of scientists, entrepreneurs, activists, heads of NGOs and, yes, professional politicians would form the delegation. This ""country"" could have the rights and responsibilities that come with the turf, and play a commensurate role in debates and negotiations. While lacking in hard power, this country could presumably make use of reserves of soft power unavailable to most nation-states. Inertia and cynicism are powerful forces, so this idea won't be an easy sell. Luckily, young people have some formidable allies: some enlightened governments, like that of Justin Trudeau in Canada, and some of the world's leading corporations have convincingly expressed their deep sense of responsibility to the future. The future is ours. All of ours. Starting next year, let's give millennials an actual seat at the table of negotiations of our annual Conference of Parties.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK314","-Europa-EUR35 million loan to BCP to strengthen energy efficiency in Morocco","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are teaming up to further strengthen sustainable energy measures in Morocco, with the support of the European Union Neighbourhood Investment Facility (EU NIF). The three financial institutions are providing a EUR35 million financing facility to Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP). The finance line is the fourth under the Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF), a comprehensive programme for sustainable energy investments through financial institutions. This EBRD-led facility is dedicated to financing energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy investments. BCP will on-lend to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates in the commercial and industrial sectors, including commercial construction and energy service companies. In addition, comprehensive technical assistance and investment incentives, funded by the EU NIF and by the EBRD Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) Multi-Donor Fund, will provide support to BCP in the design of business development tools and the successful implementation of the facility. It will also allow clients of BCP to receive support for project implementation, as well as investment incentives, encouraging them to make sustainable energy investments. Mike Taylor, EBRD Director for Financial Institutions in SEMED and the Caucasus, said: 'We are very pleased to further support energy efficiency in Morocco with a second loan to our partner BCP, promoting best practice and raising awareness about the advantages of sustainable energy investment. MorSEFF benefits from the expertise that the EBRD has accumulated in similar schemes through which we have invested EUR19 billion in sustainable energy. Of this amount, EUR4 billion has been made available through SEFFs to more than 100 financial intermediaries in 24 countries.' Soumia Alami Ouali, Deputy General Manager for SMEs of BCP's retail bank, said: 'Boosting the MorSEFF finance line by EUR35 million marks a new phase in support for the energy transformation process involving SMEs in Morocco. The technical assistance provided by the European Union provides significant added value as part of this support mechanism. The framework also enables companies to enjoy favourable terms granted by the Banque Populaire Group for the various types of financing that can improve their competitiveness and help them develop new activities.' 'The AFD is happy to renew its support for the MorSEFF initiative, which highlights the convergence of Morocco's public policies and France's development priorities. The AFD is a major player in financing climate initiatives at the global level. Since 2005, it has committed more than EUR21 billion to financing climate co-benefit projects, including EUR2.5 billion invested directly in more than 70 partner banks, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Therefore, we are delighted to continue this cooperation with BCP aimed at promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, particularly against the background of COP22 , which is now definitely focused on taking action,' said Remy Rioux, Chief Executive Officer of the AFD Group. Heinz Olbers, EIB Director of Lending Operations in Neighbouring Countries, commented: 'At the time when the world is gathered in Morocco to discuss how to put the Paris Agreement into practice, this operation is an excellent example of how partnership with fellow financial institutions can help to do it. We have made climate action one of the EIB's top priorities, and with our lending and advisory activities we mobilise financial resources in Morocco, as elsewhere, and channel them where impacts are expected to be the highest. This sustainable energy financing facility signed with Banque Centrale Populaire will contribute to reinforcing the role of the private sector in climate investments in order to cut emissions and build a climate-resilient society.' 'I am pleased that the EU is renewing its participation in BCP funding, with a donation to assist in the preparation of bankable projects but also to ease financial conditions,' said Michael Kohler, Director for Neighborhood South Division and Enlargement Negotiations (NEAR) at the European Commission. Morocco became an EBRD country of operations in 2012 and to date the Bank has committed over EUR1 billion in 28 projects across the country in various sectors of the economy, including trade facilitation credit lines with local banks. The EBRD's strategic plan for the period 2016-18 has three priorities: strengthening economic resilience, addressing global challenges and supporting regional integration. In the context of the EBRD's focus on Green Economy Transition since late 2015, the Bank expects to more than triple the volume of renewable energy financed in Jordan in the near future. Donors to the SEMED Multi-Donor Fund include: Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Taipei China and the United Kingdom.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK315","Berkeley Group Holdings (The) PLC Final Results -3-","June 15, 2016 Wednesday 7:00 AM GMT","London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)","As part of the estate regeneration programme at Woodberry Down, we have worked with the London Wildlife Trust to restore an 11 hectare wetland. This is now a free, beautiful, public amenity. In the first five days after the opening by Sir David Attenborough on 21 April, 4,500 people visited. At One Tower Bridge, we have invested in building a 900-seat theatre, designed by Stirling Prize winners Haworth Tompkins. This is due to open in September 2016. In Bath, Berkeley recently completed 307 purpose-built student rooms for Bath Spa University. This scheme won a 2015 Royal Town Planning Institute Award for Planning Excellence on the basis of a partnership with the local council. Our work together transformed a derelict eyesore in a World Heritage site into a building that the city can be proud of. We designed a Georgian style building with a traditional Bath stone frontage, while using modern methods of construction and over 600 pods manufactured off-site. There remains an ongoing high profile debate about the role of tall buildings in solving the housing crisis. We believe they have an important part to play. Tall buildings can make efficient use of land and locate many homes close to public transport. With good design, they create a fantastic sense of place and the tax and levies paid make a major contribution to local infrastructure. The key challenge lies in how you create a community in high rise buildings. Berkeley is pioneering new solutions to this issue at South Quay Plaza, one of Britain's tallest residential developments. We have also now committed to develop community plans for every new major site. Operations Berkeley is proud of its reputation as a leader in sustainability and holds a Queens Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development, awarded in 2014; the second time the Group had been awarded this accolade. Most recently, following the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015, Berkeley has driven forward a range of major environmental initiatives. We have developed a new research partnership, designed to help us better understand and manage energy use across our developments, and then deliver operational carbon and financial savings. We also helped the Institute for Public Policy Research to undertake and launch their initiative setting out how to make London one of the greenest cities in the world. Berkeley is currently creating 212 acres of new public open space across all our developments in the capital. Most importantly, in a landmark announcement for the housing industry, Berkeley has committed to become the first major housebuilder in Britain to be carbon positive. Over the next two years (2016-18), we will aim to deliver a 10 per cent reduction in office and construction carbon emissions per person and set an internal carbon price, using the funds generated to offset more than all of the remaining carbon emissions. Berkeley currently has over 13,800 people employed in the business or working through contractors on our sites, up 2,000 in the year, and apprenticeships are a central component of our workforce development strategy. Berkeley now has over 1,000 people in structured training across its workforce, as construction apprentices, or working on NVQs or equivalent qualifications. Over the last six months, plans have been developed to set up a construction skills centre on our regeneration sites at both Southall Waterside and White City and, by 2018, we intend to have had 1,500 people in an apprenticeship or vocational training across the Berkeley Group. Our People Berkeley's talented and varied people are our strongest resource. Recruiting and retaining a high calibre workforce across our autonomous businesses is crucial to the success of our company. In recognition of this, we relaunched our graduate scheme in September 2015 and continue to evolve our talent management programmes to ensure we realise the potential of our people across all areas of the business. The safety of our people continues to be a top priority across all our operations, in addition to enabling enhanced health and wellbeing. We aspire to operate incident and injury free and are pleased to be able to report a reduced Accident Incident Rate (AIR) of 2.40 (2015: 2.46). We are proud that Berkeley employees continue to contribute to wider society through support of the Berkeley Foundation, which reached its fifth year in 2016. This year, Berkeley received a Platinum Award from the Charities Aid Foundation for its Give As You Earn scheme, with 33% of staff giving to the Berkeley Foundation in this way. Through this, and other activities, Berkeley's staff have raised just under GBP1 million in the year. We are particularly delighted to have been recognised for Berkeley's work with The Change Foundation through the Street Elite programme, having won the Best Charity Partnership (Property & Construction) category at this year's Third Sector's Business Charity Awards. The programme has helped almost 300 young people on the edge of gangs and crime to build the skills for work, with many Street Elite graduates now in full-time employment including 15 directly within Berkeley. Outlook Berkeley's focus is on building a modern world-class business which is successful and sustainable in the long-term. We have in place an enhanced shareholder returns programme through to 2021 which allows us to optimise returns to shareholders while managing the risks of a cyclical market and whilst retaining sufficient capital to invest in opportunities that will add incremental value to the ongoing business. The housing market in London and the South East continues to have strong underlying fundamentals with an imbalance between demand and supply, a persistent low interest rate environment and high employment levels, notwithstanding recent unhelpful changes to property taxation. The short-term outlook is impacted by uncertainty whether it be global in nature or through the economic consequences of the outcome of the EU Referendum. Berkeley is extremely well placed to deliver its previously announced targets over the next two years in this environment with cash due on forward sales in the next three years of GBP3.25 billion, net cash of GBP107 million and a longer-term land bank of some 42,858 plots comprising estimated future gross margin of GBP6.1 billion. The business is able to differentiate its performance through the plan, Our Vision, which embeds our strategy in each of our businesses, and provides a focal point for our ambition to be a modern world-class business with a focus on the quality of the homes and places we create and the way in which we do this. Rob Perrins Chief Executive TRADING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Trading performance Revenue of GBP2,047.5 million in the year (2015: GBP2,120.0 million) included GBP1,994.1 million of revenue from operations (2015: GBP2,020.2 million) and GBP53.4 million from the sale of a portfolio of ground rent assets (2015: GBP99.8 million). The GBP1,994.1 million of revenue from operations included GBP1,965.2 million of residential revenue (2015: GBP1,936.2 million), GBP2.3 million from land sales on two sites (2015: GBP12.3 million) and GBP26.6 million of commercial revenue (2015: GBP71.7 million). 3,776 new homes (2015: 3,355) were sold across London and the South of England at an average selling price of GBP515,000 (2015: GBP575,000). The changes to the average selling price are a result of mix with Berkeley completing two student developments in the current year, one in Bath and one in London which together comprise 638 units. Revenue of GBP26.6 million from commercial activities (2015: GBP71.7 million) included the sale of some 119,000 sqft of office, retail and leisure space across a number of the Group's developments including Fulham Reach in Hammersmith, Battersea Reach in Wandsworth and Goodman's Fields in central London. The GBP71.7 million of revenue last year was also from the sale of office, retail and leisure space across a number of the Group's developments, in particular an 89,000 sqft hotel at Goodman's Fields. During the year, the Group sold a portfolio of ground rent assets across some 43 sites for proceeds of GBP53.4 million and a gross profit of GBP51.0 million. In the prior year, the Group sold a portfolio of ground rent assets across some 60 sites for proceeds of GBP99.8 million and a gross profit of GBP85.1 million. Income and expenses associated with both sales have been recognised in the income statement through revenue and gross profit. The adjusted gross margin percentage, excluding profit from the sale of ground rent assets, has increased to 32.6% (2015: 31.3%), and reflects the mix of homes sold in the year. Overheads of GBP199.8 million (2015: GBP192.7 million) included a charge of GBP27.4 million in respect of the acceleration (there is no increase in the overall cost) of the accounting charge for the modifications to the 2011 LTIP following the changes to the shareholder returns programme made during the year. It also included an GBP8.3 million charge for Part B of the 2009 LTIP scheme which completed on 15 April 2016 with the vesting of the second tranche of awards. In the prior year, there was a charge of GBP47.0 million in respect of the Company's decision to settle the tax and national insurance liabilities arising on the vesting of options for participants in Part B of the 2009 LTIP scheme on 15 April 2015, in lieu of issuing shares to this value. The result is that the Group's adjusted operating margin, excluding the profit from sale of the ground rent assets, has increased to 22.6% from 21.7% last year. Berkeley's share of the results of joint ventures was a profit of GBP36.5 million (2015: GBP28.3 million) which reflects ongoing completions at 375 Kensington High Street and Stanmore Place within St Edward and the costs for St William in the initial pre-development stage of the joint venture. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK319","Venue blazes solar power trail","November 10, 2016 Thursday","Financial Times (London, England)","Until this year the Moroccan town of Ouarzazate was best known for its ancient-looking kasbah fa\'e7ades, used as an exotic backdrop in many Hollywood movies. But now it has a very 21st century landmark: the world's largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. With 500,000 parabolic mirrors, the plant - Noor 1 - has a generating capacity of 160 megawatts - equivalent to that of a conventional single gas turbine power station. It is the first of three CSP plants at the site that will eventually be capable of generating more than 500MW at peak output. Noor is the most high-profile component of Morocco's ambitious push for renewable energy, which will be showcased when the country hosts COP 22 in Marrakesh. The government has committed to an unconditional 17 per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030 compared with business as usual, and has adopted a multi-pronged plan combining renewable energy development and improved energy efficiency. Energy independence has been the main impetus for the programme. Morocco lacks significant fossil fuel supplies of its own. However, electricity demand is growing at 5-6 per cent a year as the country pushes its long-term programme to wean its economy off a dependence on agriculture towards industry. In 2009, the state set an ambitious target to produce 42 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 - a goal that officials say they are on track to meet. This was then extended last year at the COP21 summit in Paris, when King Mohammed VI announced a new goal of 52 per cent by 2030. The country has received plaudits for both the scale and success of its programme. Michael Taylor, a senior energy analyst at the International Renewable Energy Agency , says Morocco has been helped by factors including strong institutions, funding from bilateral and multilateral agencies and ample supplies of wind and sun. ""It's kind of a confluence of influences that have allowed them to step up early and, of course, they're reaping the benefits of those renewables now, earlier than others,"" he says. Moroccan officials say they can offer lessons for other countries looking to increase their use of renewables. ""It's not just about money. It's much more a matter of capacity building, technology transfer and the right policies,"" says Said Mouline, director-general of the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) . ""We have a sustainable environment approach for all sectors. It's in our constitution and there is will at the highest level of the state."" Over the past seven years this has translated into 54 action plans covering all economic sectors. They go beyond installing renewables to cover agriculture, land use, forestry, waste, and industrial policies. As well as establishing a nascent renewables industry , subsidies on fossil fuels have been phased out and energy efficiency encouraged. ""We have a low price in renewables, we have industrial integration, and we have job creation,"" says Mr Mouline. The Noor project has caught the attention of energy analysts around the world. The plant uses mirrors that reflect sunlight to heat liquid, which can power a turbine. Unlike onshore wind and solar photovoltaic schemes, CSP plants can store energy in superheated liquid that can be used later to drive turbines. This makes it one of ""the key technologies for unlocking those very high levels of renewable power generation,"" says Mr Taylor. But it is the project's funding model has been singled out as one of Morocco's key achievements. ""They've been a game changer,"" says Anne Lapierre, partner for energy and projects with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. She was involved in advising Masen, the government agency behind the venture, on the tendering process, which gave it tight control over all aspects of the programme and allowed it to keep costs down. Masen was able to use funds borrowed by the government from multilateral agencies and banks and then lend the money on to the project company. ""It was the first IPP [independent power producer] where the bidders were meant to bid fully-financed. So the winning bidder was accessing the financing, which is a total disruption,"" Ms Lapierre says. Through Masen, the government also became a minority shareholder in all the project structures. ""We had to simplify things as much as possible. The most complicated things can be realised if they are simplified,"" Mustapha Bakkoury, head of Masen, told the FT ahead of Noor 1's launch earlier this year. After a restructuring last year, Masen is now responsible for the development of all Morocco's renewables. It also has the capacity to invest abroad. Other countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have shown an interest in the country's approach and Ms Lapierre believes the Noor funding and development model could work as a template for future renewable projects. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK320","Finance for deep-rooted prosperity is coming; We're entering a new age for the Earth's climate and for the way we conceive of finance","October 17, 2016 Monday 11:00 AM GMT","The Guardian","""Macrocritical resilience"" may be the most mystifying two-word phrase you need to know. Though you may never have heard these two words before, what they describe affects everything you live and strive for. Wonky as it sounds, it is a common sense idea: what generates value is more valuable than what we count in dollars. And yet, it is only in the last few years that we are truly beginning to understand that macrocritical indicators -elements of human experience that shape the health and viability of the overall economy-really do describe how and where value and capability come into being. On Christmas Eve, 2013, the small island nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines experienced the most intense rainfall in its history. 15 percent of gross domestic product was wiped out in just a few hours. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused $900 million worth of damage in Grenada-more than twice the nation's GDP. One of the executive directors of the International Monetary Fund noted that when so much value can be lost so suddenly, ""you no longer know what the value of a dollar is."" Climate disruption is generating ever more destructive extreme weather events, putting countries on every continent at risk of macrocritical value loss-a disruption of economic progress that can take generations to come back from. The impact is ""macrocritical"", because it affects the overall macroeconomy in critical ways that have long-running repercussions. Resilience is the ability to ""bounce back from a shock"". A tree bends so it will not break in a heavy wind. Systems need to be able to get back in shape after being hit with a major disruption. In her address to the Chatham House Climate Change Conference, on October 10, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, said ""Climate considerations must be mainstreamed into our global financial architecture."" Leaders in business and finance are beginning to see this as well. A sustainable portfolio is not just one that does good for others; it is one that is designed to thrive in a more competitive future. This is also the view the IMF has taken, as it comes to grips with the many ways in which macrocritical drivers of value affect national budget outlooks. It is known, for instance, that between two countries that have similar resources, similar populations and similar national budgets, if all other things are equal, the one which refuses to educate young girls is far more likely to descend into sectarian conflict; its budget outlook it tainted by the macrocritical impact of under-educating girls and systematically excluding and mistreating women. We are entering a new age in the life of Earth systems, and in the evolution of human civilization, but also in the way we conceive of finance-its purpose, its vulnerabilities, and its power to generate good outcomes. As we see more and more clearly that universal education, gender equality, food and water security, and climate resilience, are macrocritical drivers on which all other value ultimately depends, major financial institutions, both in the public and private sector, are learning how to measure their performance against macrocritical indicators. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals were agreed by 193 member states of the UN General Assembly, and aims to achieve 169 action-specific targets. The Paris Agreement will operate through 195 Nationally Determined Contributions to the global climate response. These historic agreements now serve as mapping and design operations for a macrocritically resilient future. They are also ways to make sure money flows to what will empower people to sustain the systems that sustain life, human adaptive capacity, and value, over time. In a way, this is what people in all societies have always had in mind when they thought about what it means to build a strong, safe, and prosperous society. What is different now is that we can more clearly see that degradations of fundamental values cannot be discounted or swept under the rug. Those mistakes and inefficiencies scale up into systemic threats. The COP22 Joseph Robertson is Global Strategy Director for the nonpartisan nonprofit organization Citizens' Climate Lobby. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK321","Will Brexit resurrect the dirty man of Europe?","September 10, 2016","The Grocer","Weeks before the shock referendum result, a Commons environmental audit committee inquiry said it could not find a single witness who made an environmental case for quitting the EU. Membership, it said, had turned Britain from the ""dirty man of Europe"" in the 1980s to a leader in tackling air quality, climate change and food waste. S0 is Brexit really the nightmare scenario some environmentalists fear and how will it affect food and drink? The Grocer answers the key questions. Will ripping up EU red tape make businesses greener? Defra SoS Andrea Leadsom pledges to take her chainsaw to the long list of EU directives that she says have forced UK farmers to pay \£3642m in fines since 2005 - sometimes for as little as having a kink in a hedgerow that breaks regulations. The NFU and a number of waste and energy companies argue EU regulatory burdens have been applied too stringently, with UK regulators running scared of EU litigation, they say. But the NFU admits the 2020 climate and energy framework ""set an international example"", while the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive and its legally binding renewable energy targets has seen significant growth in renewables deployment. And most experts believe regulations have improved the UK's approach to the environment, and the green agenda would be much further behind without them. ""Many witnesses implied that if the UK were free to set its own environmental standards, it would set them at a less stringent level than has been imposed by the EU,"" concludes the environmental audit committee. What EU policies could be scrapped? The new-look government plans to axe several impositions on farmers, including the controversial Birds and Habitats Directive, which the NFU claims has led to economic damage to farmers. What will be the fallout from culling the CAP? The FDF warns withdrawing from the CAP, which represents almost 40% of the EU budget and the biggest element of the UK's EU costs, will have a ""drastic"" impact on farmers, as the government and devolved administrations will be unlikely to match current levels of subsidy. Chancellor Philip Hammond has committed to continue CAP payments until 2020. And farming minister George Eustice has promised a \£32bn dividend for the environment and improving sustainable agricultural practices out of the money the government expects to recoup from reductions in payments to Brussels. But Friends of the Earth campaigner Kiera Box is dubious over the future. ""Post-2020, farmers could be faced with anything from an American-style insurance system, protecting products from risks like flooding, but offering no incentives to improve efficiency or protect the local environment, to a system of payments linked to growing crops that mitigate climate change."" What will Brexit mean for climate change? Both food industry and environmental experts point out that the UK, until recently at least, has been seen as a prime mover in climate change policies. The European Commission's Third Energy Package and the 2015 Framework for Energy Union are two examples of EU measures but the UK government also has its own legally binding climate change targets through the Climate Change Act 2008. It has also launched its own carbon reduction schemes, such as the climate change levy and CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. However, the FDF warns Brexit will dilute the UK's power to influence international climate targets under the UN Conference on Climate Change . What will the economic impact of Brexit be on green investment? Daniel Calleja Crespo, director general of environment for the European Commission, estimates the UK has benefited from (EURO)500m (\£3422m) in EU ""projects and environmental innovation"" funds in recent years. Consulting group Anthesis claims the benefit to UK research funding is in the region of a net (EURO)3.5bn (\£33bn). Losing this funding could be a significant blow to the growth in green business. In a report sponsored by Friends of the Earth, Dr Charlotte Burns of the environment department at the University of York says the EU's environmental agenda has been driving business growth, pointing to CBI stats that show green businesses accounted for 8% of GDP and a third of UK growth in 2011-12. What will the impact be on food waste charities? In 2015/16, Wrap received \£31.4m in grants from EU programmes. Although this was down on the previous year's \£32.7m, it still makes up more than 5% of its total funding. Just this week, Wrap announced that a scheme to transform food waste reduction initiatives in London, intended to act as a test bed for programmes across Europe, had been powered by a (EURO)3.2m grant from the European Commission. Its grant income from Defra was also slashed this year (down from \£319.6m to \£314.8m) and Wrap has long been trying to diversify its funding base as minsters go cold on public spending on food waste projects. ""Our fear is that the UK does not lose the opportunity to learn from the lead of countries like France that do food redistribution at so much greater scale than us,"" says Lindsay Boswell, CEO of FareShare. ""We do need to have the self-confidence to recognise that there are lessons to be learnt from within the EU."" Will the UK ""do a Norway""? Some experts predict the UK will eventually sign up to a trade deal in exchange for access to the all-important single market - the so-called Norway Model. But, when it comes to environmental policy, extrication from the EU is going to be a minefield whatever happens. ""There are numerous EU environmental and energy policies that impact food and drink manufacturers,"" says FDF chief scientific officer Helen Munday. ""Reviewing this wider policy landscape and understanding future options is going to be a complex and lengthy process."" Not half. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK322","Impax Environmental Markets PLC Final Results -2-","April 7, 2017 Friday 7:30 AM GMT","London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)","President Trump's announcements have altered investor sentiment in many areas targeted by the Company. However, the underlying drivers advancing environmental technologies are increasingly beyond most regulatory intervention. The last few years have seen dramatic falls in the cost of many environmental technologies which no longer rely on subsidies or regulatory support. President Trump's stated commitment to infrastructure improvements across water, transport and real estate should be positive for the Company. The President has also stressed his support for domestic energy production and independence. This outlook should strengthen the investment case for areas such as hazardous waste management, water treatment and environmental testing and consultants. Global commitment to environmental regulation COP22 climate conference took place in Marrakesh in November 2016, and the mood from most countries was defiantly optimistic. The response from the international community to President Trump's pre-election threat to ""cancel"" the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and his subsequent changes to the structure and powers of US Environmental Protection Agency, has been to redouble support for the climate treaty, with China, crucially, reiterating its commitment to addressing climate change. Early in 2016 China released more details of its 13th Five Year Plan, with heavy emphasis on improving environmental health, tackling air, water and land pollution, and investing further in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Key developments Digitalisation drives higher returns in environmental markets We have noted for several years the rise of data, acceleration of digitalisation and deployment of software-based models in environmental markets, and are encouraged by the growth and high returns on capital that these businesses offer to investors. The smart use of data and optimisation tools is enabling enhanced efficiency of processes and networks in rail, water, electricity, agriculture, construction, lighting and building controls. IEM holdings with software solutions that benefit from the digitalisation trend include Trimble Navigation (US - agriculture, construction), Hollysys (China - rail, renewable energy) and Itron (US - water, electricity, gas). Sustainable Forestry The Food, Agriculture and Forestry sector was added to our universe in 2013. During the Period we made our first investment in the Sustainable Forestry area. Timber is an important sustainable resource and, if produced sustainably, is relatively disease resistant and helps to prevent the destruction of natural forests. During the Period we added a position in Rayonier (US) which manages large areas of sustainable timberlands (Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified) in the US and New Zealand. The strategic positioning of Rayonier's timberlands ensures premium product pricing and exposure to key market trends such as the recovery in domestic housing, restricted Canadian lumber supply, strong Chinese housing demand and wood pellet exports. Electrification of the automotive industry In the last Annual Report, we discussed the interesting investment opportunities arising from the disruption in the transport sector, in particular the increase in the electrification of vehicles. We continue to seek compelling opportunities in companies which increase the efficacy of fuel consumption and reduce pollution from internal combustion engines. We hold several companies in this area including LEM and Sensata, and during the Period we added to the portfolio Delta Electronics Thailand, a manufacturer of power supplies and electronic components to the motor industry. Absolute Performance Contributors and Detractors Contributors Companies across the portfolio largely delivered robust earnings. The Sustainable Food & Agriculture and Water Infrastructure and Technologies sub-sectors contributed particularly strong performance. Sustainable Food & Agriculture benefits from the same core drivers of other environmental markets, namely rising demand due to population expansion and higher living standards, and a need to find more resource efficient means to satisfy these basic needs. The sub-sector has proved to be a rich area for stock picking, with particular strength from a range of holdings including fibre specialist Lenzing (Austria), sustainable aquaculture company Leroy Seafood Group (Norway) and ""connected farm"" software company Trimble Inc (US). We are seeking additional opportunities in this area, which offers strong growth potential and additional diversification benefits for the portfolio. Water Infrastructure & Technologies companies maintained their robust performance. Xylem and Watts Water (both US) benefited from recovering construction markets and municipal spending to upgrade aged water networks. Water utilities also provided opportunities, with American Water (US) advancing as a result of strong execution, a positive regulatory backdrop and consolidation potential in a fragmented market. M&A continues to be a contributor to portfolio performance. During the second half of the Period two holdings (Hydro International and Ovivo) were acquired and a further two acquisitions announced and pending completion (ClarCor and Trina Solar). With strong exit multiples generally achieved, we expect M&A to continue to contribute to IEM's performance. Detractors The majority of portfolio companies performed well and there were relatively few significant detractors over the Period. However, Solar Energy Generation Equipment remains an area of weakness as solar markets continue to face supply and demand side challenges. Sunpower (US) was the main detractor in this area. We believe that short term headwinds are priced into stocks and, while our exposure is modest at around 3%, we are confident that additional opportunities will emerge. Long term prospects remain strong given falling costs of technology and incremental opportunities from combining solar generation with energy storage. IEM's environmental consultancy holdings (Arcadis, (NL) and RPS (UK)) also had a more challenging year, reflecting a combination of weakness across emerging markets and issues around exposure to oil and gas markets. Conditions appear to have stabilised and valuations remain attractive in this area. Portfolio Positioning and Current Activity The portfolio remains well diversified by geography and sub-sector and comprised 60 listed holdings at the end of the Period. The sub-sector breakdown for IEM is set out in the Annual Report, together with the comparison to the FTSE ET100. Exposure to Sustainable Food and Agriculture has increased by 4% over the Period through outperformance and the addition of new holdings including Rayonier (Sustainable Forestry & Plantations, US). Renewable & Alternative Energy and Waste Management & Technology exposure decreased. IEM remains underweight North America and overweight Europe compared with MSCI ACWI. We are comfortable with this positioning on the basis of relative valuation and growth prospects. Looking at economic cyclicality, the portfolio remains approximately 5% less ""defensive"" than the MSCI ACWI. Unquoted companies At 31 December 2016, the Company held only one significant unquoted company in its portfolio with a valuation of GBP10.9 million, representing 2.3% of net assets. This valuation is reviewed regularly and we are working towards a timely exit. Movements in the year were as follows: GBPm 2016 Foreign exchange gain GBP 1.8 Valuation at 31 December GBP10.9 Outlook During the Period, the Company has maintained its established trend of delivering higher profit growth compared to global equities, and we expect this to persist. Our investment universe also continues to expand and we are seeing interesting new opportunities in developing markets and in emerging technologies. The drivers of environmental markets strengthen further, driving future growth. Meanwhile investors are increasingly seeking access to higher growth opportunities as economic growth rates around the world look set to slow. IEM has had a strong start to 2017. We are optimistic that the long-term prospects for environmental markets and the Company will continue to strengthen. 6 April 2017 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Together with the issues discussed in the Chairman's Statement and the Manager's Report, the Board considers that the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Company fall into the following main categories: Price movements of the Company's investments are highly correlated to performance of global equities in general and small and mid-cap equities in particular. Consequently falls in stock markets are likely to negatively affect the performance of the Company's investments. There are inherent risks involved in stock selection. The Manager is experienced and employs its expertise in selecting the stocks in which the Company invests. The Manager spreads the investment risk over a wide portfolio of investments in three main sectors, and at the year end the Company held investments in 61 quoted companies. The company also held 4 unquoted companies of which 3 were valued at nil at the year end. \"

Issuance of green bonds is set to undershoot the Climate Bond Initiative's (CBI) $100bn annual target for yet another year. But stakeholders say that, volatility and uncertainty aside, a major factor in scaling up the market is on hammering out clear and widely accepted definitions on which projects can be accepted as green. ""There's a lot of work to be done in the principles in terms of definitions,"" said a senior funding official at a major public sector issuer who is involved in the GBPs. ""The big challenge is to create a framework of comparability and compatibility, to make sure that the content of green bonds is clearer for investors,"" the official added. ""Currently, impact reporting harmonisation is only on energy impact and efficiency, which are the areas that have been used as a test case for cooperation among the different parties. Now the other areas on the eligibility list of the principles need to be addressed to find consensus on certain indications."" ICMA updated the GBPs in June, focusing on recommendations for best practice on reporting, third party reviews and the creation of publicly available templates. The industry organisation also included some new definitions of the kinds of external reviews issuers should use and guidance on how to best use them to illustrate their ""project selection processes and their adherence to the GBP recommendations"", as well as some additions and clarifications to a list of categories of green eligible projects. Participants regularly debate the need for more comprehensive definitions on eligible projects, among other things, and whether that is more pressing than bringing more issuers and investors into the market. Too strict, some say, and the market risks alienating prospective issuers. Too lenient, and it risks losing credibility and the attention of investors. But underpinning that debate is the fact that supply is somewhat less than desired because issuers' traditional funding alternatives are ostensibly cheaper. ""We clearly appreciate more issuers coming, but that's one of the trickier parts of further developing the principles,"" said one green investor. ""From an investor perspective, we would love to have more legally binding documentation on the use of proceeds, but given that """" for the time being """" there is no price incentive for issuers to print green bonds, we can't set the hurdle too high for the issuer. ""We have to balance between bringing new issuers to the market to build up a very diverse portfolio or setting the standards very high """" but limiting the number of issuers coming to the market. For the time being, having a more diversified portfolio is of greater value."" One senior fund manager at a major investment house went a step further, saying that the buy-side may largely disregard the GBPs. ""We welcome the [GBPs] and the fact that we are moving more and more towards a label for green bonds. Before that, everybody was able to issue and just say, ""~It's a green bond' """" and it would be recorded as such,"" the fund manager said. ""Having said that, the strength of a big asset management house is to be able to label green bonds by itself and not rely on external rating agencies. The principles are good news for the market because they create a common language between investor and issuer, but in itself """" like a credit rating """" it doesn't prevent you from doing your own analysis. We already incorporated green in our SRI analyses. We want to avoid greenwashing, so we excluded even green bonds issued by a company that we've decided is not in itself green."" Beyond industry led initiatives, many also think governments need to punch out more regulation on the market, in the hope of increasing investor confidence and expanding the buyer base. China's recent entry into the market was accompanied by a set of rules from the People's Bank of China for financial institutions involved in green bonds, as well as policy incentives. But in Europe, at least, many are wary of regulators taking on too much of a role. ""We are afraid that if regulation is put on the green bond market, it will limit the number of issuers joining. It has been a very successful market initiative and we hope the market will have the space to develop further before regulators step in,"" the first investor said. ""It's different in China, which has a completely different political and economic system. There it might make sense to have clear regulation, but it shouldn't be a template for the worldwide market,"" he added. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK327","Growing mega-cities will displace vast tracts of farmland by 2030, study says; Cropland losses will have consequences especially for Asia and Africa, which will....","December 27, 2016 Tuesday 10:18 PM GMT","The Guardian","Our future crops will face threats not only from climate change, but also from the massive expansion of cities, a new study warns. By 2030, it's estimated that urban areas will triple in size, expanding into cropland and undermining the productivity of agricultural systems that are already stressed by rising populations and climate change. Roughly 60% of the world's cropland lies on the outskirts of cities-and that's particularly worrying, the report authors say, because this peripheral habitat is, on average, also twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. ""We would expect peri-urban land to be more fertile than average land, as mankind tends to settle where crops can be produced,"" says Felix Creutzig from the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, and principal author on the paper. ""However, we were ignorant about the magnitude of this effect."" The agricultural losses they calculated in the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, translates to a 3 to 4% dip in global agricultural production. This may not appear to be a huge figure at first glance, but on the regional scale the picture changes. Across countries and different crops, the effects of this loss vary and become more intense. In Africa and Asia especially-which together bear 80% of the projected loss due to rising urbanisation in these regions-urban expansion will consign farmers to an even tougher agricultural reality. To arrive at the estimates, the researchers combined datasets on cropland location, productivity, and projected urban expansion by 2030. By superimposing these layers of information on one other, they could highlight the locations where cropland and urban spread are expected to intersect in the future. These projections reveal hotspots of loss in countries like Egypt, Nigeria, the countries that flank Lake Victoria in East Africa, and in Eastern China. (China alone is expected to experience one-quarter of the global cropland loss.) A major worry surrounding the disappearance of this productive land is the impact it will have on staple crops such as maize, rice, soya beans, and wheat, which are cornerstones of global food security. Many of these crops occur in areas that will be consumed by urban spread in years to come. ""Due to urbanisation in Nigeria, 17% of rice production and 12% of maize production will be hampered,"" Creutzig says. ""Egypt will lose more than 40% of its rice, and more than 60% of its maize."" In Africa, there will a 26% continental loss of wheat. Rice is forecast to suffer the most, with a 9% global decline, occurring predominantly in Asia where the bulk of this crop grows. Creutzig notes that some of this loss can be compensated for by agricultural expansion and intensification. But again, this isn't possible everywhere on the planet: many regions are already limited by their inability to adapt to urban encroachment. For instance, in South Asia farmland can't simply spread elsewhere, because fertile land is already running out. In India, agricultural expansion would force crops into habitats like wetlands that act as important buffers against flooding and sea-level rise. And in North Africa, worsening conditions driven by climate change will make the land that is available less suitable for farming. ""Urbanisation pressure adds to other stresses on the food system, notably climate change,"" Creutzig says. This will undermine food security, with countries worst affected by urban expansion experiencing rising dependence on imports. That will leave them vulnerable to global fluctuations in food supply, and could also price crops out of reach of poorer populations. Creutzig sees other subtler food security impacts at play as well-like the ousting of millions of smallscale farmers, as cities expand. These farmers produce the majority of food in developing countries -and so are instrumental to global food security. ""As peri-urban land is converted, smallholders will lose their land,"" he says. ""The emerging mega-cities will rely increasingly on industrial-scale agricultural and supermarket chains, crowding out local food chains."" ""In cases where farmers have no formal land rights, such as in Africa, governments may expel farmers from their land,"" commented Anton Van Rompaey, a geographer from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, who was not part of the study but has has done research on urban spread and its agricultural impacts in China. ""In the past this has led to social instability and deadly conflicts between farmers and government."" Facing this disturbing future food map, Creutzig predicts that growing food within the city's margins-urban farming-could be part of the solution. ""Urban agriculture is of course utterly insufficient to feed the urban population, but it is very important to maintain local supply chains and provide livelihoods and subsistence for urban farmers,"" he says. However, regulations on expansion, to keep urbanisation as compact as possible, will be the bigger prerogative of cities, Creutzig says. After the COP22 \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK328","Malcolm Turnbull must address the health risks of climate change; The public health impacts of climate change are playing out in Australia while politicians ign....","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 5:36 AM GMT","The Guardian","Last week, the Paris climate agreement officially entered into force, with the landmark global climate deal ushering in a new era of international climate diplomacy and sustainable development. This week, delegates from over 190 nations are convening in Morocco, seeking to build on the spirit of cooperation born in Paris, and working to convert the broad aspirational commitments into action. While building on the architecture of the Paris agreement, national governments should keep the public health implications in mind. Climate change is now recognised in the medical field as a clear and present danger to public health. The World Health Organisation's director general has called it ""one of the greatest health risks of the 21st century,"" and the 2015 Lancet Commission concluded that climate change poses ""an unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health."" Related: Fossil-fuel CO2 emissions nearly stable for third year in row In Australia, where I studied medicine, these risks are already all too clear. This week, the Lancet, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals, is launching a new research collaboration dedicated to tracking these risks in Australia and around the world. The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change, will check in annually on countries' progress on climate change and calculate the direct health impacts of the transition to a low carbon future. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), meanwhile, is also releasing three position statements on health and climate change. These statements are informed by some dire observations. Over the past half-century, average temperatures across the continent have steadily increased, bringing more frequent heatwaves that are longer and hotter than any in recorded history. Exposure to high temperatures over a prolonged period brings heightened rates of ailments such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke, and worsens existing health conditions like heart and potentially even kidney disease. These heatwaves have caused more deaths over the last century in Australia than any other natural event. Tragically, children and the elderly are most vulnerable. The public health impacts, however, go well beyond heat-related threats. Changes to precipitation patterns are causing both severe droughts and intense floods, which together have taken the lives of thousands. Over time, new rainfall norms and warmer temperatures are expected to alter the burden and distribution of infectious disease throughout Australia, as mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and the Ross River virus take hold. Beyond these harms that warmer temperatures deliver, the combustion of climate warming fossil fuels creates other direct threats to public health. Air pollution from the burning of coal for electricity generation and from road transport presents a particularly worrying challenge, resulting in twice as many deaths as motor vehicle accidents (over 3,000 per year). In urban areas, smog from tailpipes contains ground-level ozone, dangerous particulates, and other pollutants. Ozone irritates the lining of the lungs and exacerbates asthma, and is actually made more potent on hot, sunny days, which are anticipated to be more frequent as a result of climate change. By 2050, ozone-induced hospitalisations in Sydney are expected to double. Despite all of these troubling statistics and predictions, Australia's government shows little interest in setting strong climate goals and facilitating the transition away from coal. In fact, the Australian delegation arrived at the COP22 climate talks without having ratified the Paris agreement ( although it has since been ratified ), and with some of the weakest greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets among all the participating nations. Related: Once the storm settles, a clearer picture emerges of government's energy goals | Katharine Murphy Australia's stated goal is to reduce net GHG emissions 26% below 2005 levels by 2030, a calculation that includes land use change and reforestation on top of modest emissions reductions from the burning of fossil fuels. The Climate Institute, an Australian think tank, has reported that under these current targets, Australia's per capita emissions in 2030 would be twice as high as the average for other developed countries. Rather than explore ways to bring domestic policies in line with the international community, Australia's politicians seem more concerned with protecting the coal industry and promising that the fossil fuel will be part of Australia's energy mix for ""many, many, many decades to come. "" By doing so, they are not only steering Australia to a hotter, more dangerous, and less healthy future, but also cheating Australians out of the positive co-benefits of transitioning away from coal and other fossil fuels. If the Turnbull government needs hard evidence of the health benefits of climate action, they can consult the Lancet Countdown on Climate and Health, which will put real world economic costs on the policy choices. Between the Lancet Countdown and the RACP's statements, it's clear that physicians and public health professionals understand the climate-health nexus better than Australia's politicians. Mr. Turnbull should act for the health and wellbeing of all Australians. \"

At the briefing today, Mr. Nabarro expressed confidence that the Agreement will enter into force at some point this year, highlighting that at least 14 other countries, representing at least 12 per cent of global emissions, have committed to ratifying the pact. ""There's a kind of race going on now, for countries to come in there and make sure that they are part of the ratification community - to show that they are part of wanting to get the Agreement into force,"" he said. ""We think we're going to have the speediest entry into force for any agreement that requires such a large number of ratifications. And that's why I've got a smile, because it's really good news,"" he added. The Special Adviser also praised Mr. Ban for the high-level event on the Agreement's entry into force that was held at UN Headquarters on 21 September. ""It showed us that the momentum for climate action, linked with the momentum for action to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is really strong, and it's growing.

Experts from the University of Exeter Medical School, based at its Truro campus, are to join forces with 15 other organisations worldwide to drive action on climate change given the potential ""catastrophic risk to human health"". The project - The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change - was launched yesterday at the COP 22 climate talks taking place in Morocco. Professor Mike Depledge and Dr Karyn Morrissey, of the University of Exeter Medical School, will be among the expert, international team tracking and analysing the impacts of climate change on public health. Dr Morrissey said: ""This global project is crucially important. Most projections into climate change completely fail to take into account the huge implications of a warming world impacting on human health. ""If we are to mitigate against this, we need a global effort to gather the best evidence to influence policy makers worldwide."" Dr Morrissey and Professor Depledge specialise in exploring the complicated interactions between the changing environment and health. Dr Morrissey said they would focus around how people's health adapts to a changing environment, and how health is integrated into international climate change plans. She said: ""Currently, these plans consider aspects such as infrastructure and how rising sea levels will impact coastlines, but they do not take into account key issues such as how hotter summers would mean more cases of heart disease and more frequent and severe asthma attacks. These impacts on health must be urgently considered."" The project was confirmed as it was announced that this year is set to be the hottest year ever recorded globally, beating 2015's record temperatures. The World Meteorological Organisation said provisional figures show global temperatures this year are approximately 1.2C (2.16F) above pre-industrial levels and 0.88C (1.58F) above the average for 1961-1990, which it uses as a reference period. As a result, 2016 is on track to be the hottest year in records dating back to the 19th century, and 16 of the 17 hottest years on record will have occurred in the 21st century. \"

The MEP for the South West and Gibraltar is environment spokesman for the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament.

""We will do our part to ensure this can happen as soon as possible."" The European Parliament is expected to add an item to its agenda next week so that it can also vote on granting consent to the agreement. The Paris accord, the world's first comprehensive climate treaty, commits countries to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero this century to prevent dangerous climate change. The treaty must be ratified by at least 55 countries accounting for 55% of the world's emissions, before it can come into force. Sixty-one countries have already ratified the deal, secured in the French capital last December, but the emissions total is just below 48%. European Union ratification will allow the bloc's 12% of global emissions to count towards the total before all individual member states have signed up, allowing the agreement to enter into force before the end of the year - much sooner than the planned 2020 start date. Once the European Parliament has voted for it, the EU could then formally ratify the deal in early October, so it comes into force - 30 days later - by the time countries meet in Morocco in November for the next annual round of climate talks. EU countries will also each ratify the deal individually, with the UK expected to do so before the end of the year. \"

ST. LOUIS-Addressing climate change- and more specifically, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture- can only be achieved through collective effort. To highlight the role modern agriculture can play in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Monsanto today announced the formation and first meeting of the Carbon-Neutral Collaborative, a consortium of experts on agricultural greenhouse gases. The Collaborative will help develop a framework for agricultural GHG accounting and advise Monsanto on its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2021. Monsanto announced its goal of a carbon neutral operational footprint one year ago today; the Collaborative met for the first time Tuesday. 'Since last year, we've been energized and inspired by the productive discussions and efforts around climate change from the many stakeholders involved, especially our farmer customers who are the ultimate stewards of the land,' said Brett Begemann, Monsanto's president and chief operating officer. 'While the problem of climate change is incredibly complex with many regional differences, the contributions over the past year-by some of the strongest leaders in agricultural and environmental science-are very promising.' For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service recently awarded a $ 1 million Conservation Innovation Grant to the National Corn Growers Association, to support work in this area. This grant was matched with $ 1.6 million from Monsanto and in-kind contributions by several other partners in the project. The USDA-supported project and the Carbon-Neutral Collaborative have been tasked with developing a scalable and verifiable carbon accounting framework that will provide a transparent system for measuring and reporting carbon reductions based on the adoption of specific agricultural practices and systems. In addition to Monsanto, inaugural members of the Collaborative include experts from: AgSolver, Inc. Applied GeoSolutions Coalition on Ag Greenhouse Gases Colorado State University CropGrower, LLC National Corn Growers Association The Soil Health Partnership University of Illinois at Chicago The formation of the Collaborative is just one example from the past year of the cooperative work across the agriculture industry that lays the groundwork for large scale carbon-neutral crop production to fight climate change. Other significant industry initiatives, in which Monsanto has participated, include: The formation of the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, which brings together food and agriculture companies to support farmers in improving soil health and water quality; The Climate Smart Agriculture working group of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, designed to foster collective action to promote the adoption of climate-smart agricultural systems worldwide; and Advanced work by The Soil Health Partnership to engage 100 growers to test sustainable agriculture practices, along with pilot programs to assess digital methods that validate that farmers are helping achieve greenhouse gas reductions. Early in 2016 Monsanto commissioned third-party expert ICF International to examine the potential for reducing GHG emissions through agriculture in the U.S. The resulting report showed that widespread adoption of recommended practices could potentially result in more than 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions reductions in the U.S. alone. These farming practices include: cover crops, conservation tillage and precision nutrient management. Throughout the summer and fall, Monsanto engaged with more than 20 academic leaders in soil health to share the report's findings. Meanwhile, the company is actively working with its U.S. seed corn producers to survey adoption of these best management practices, while providing education to encourage further adoption. Likewise, internal Monsanto teams mobilized to start reducing GHG intensity in the company's crop protection operations, including: Further streamlined the crop protection supply chain to curb emissions in production and transit; Established an internal carbon price, which was recently used to evaluate the climate impact of Monsanto's capital investment in converting a coal boiler to natural gas in 2017, expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 42,000 metric tons per year; and Added a sustainability index for selecting contract growers for seed corn production. The call to address climate change stretches beyond agriculture. At the November United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP22 , Monsanto joined with other companies in signing a public statement committing to move forward with the Paris Agreement.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK335","Focus on your food to help limit climate change.","November 30, 2016 Wednesday","M2 PressWIRE","November 30, 2016 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record with preliminary data indicating global warming reaching 1.2oC. As we get perilously close to the 1.5oC limit agreed at the Paris climate summit, Climates social network is calling on people to focus on food to help limit climate change and make their New Year's resolution to go climatarian. 'If you make just one New Year's resolution for 2017, pledge to go climatarian,' says Biba Hartigan, Director of Climates. 'Just a simple diet shift can have a really big impact. If everyone in the UK went climatarian it would cut 10% of the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions. It's the easiest way for people to help the climate and it's good for your health too.' Simply swapping beef and lamb for pork and poultry in your everyday meals knocks a whole tonne off your annual carbon footprint. That's equivalent to the emissions from driving 3,500 miles or six short-haul flights but much easier to achieve. You don't have to change your lifestyle or even your cooking habits. Reducing consumption of red and processed meat has been proven to lower the risk of heart disease and cancer. The latest meteorological data reveals that climate change is now an acute problem. It needs to be addressed with urgency at every level, government, business and individual. Food causes 24% of global greenhouse gases which is comparable to all the emissions from electricity and heat (25%) and far more than transport (14%). Food is where individuals have a significant role to play as a small change in diet can have a surprisingly large impact. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015. 16 of the warmest 17 years on record have occurred this century. Long term climate change indicators are also continuing to break records: Arctic sea ice is at its second ever lowest level;Sea levels are rising faster;Ocean warming has bleached half the Great Barrier Reef;Major weather events in 2016 included Hurricane Matthew which devastated Haiti, heavy flooding in North Korea, Fiji's worst ever cyclone, Canada's worst ever wildfire, flooding in the Yangtse basin, while India, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran saw temperatures soar to over 50oC;Despite global emissions levelling out, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to rise to new record levels. Urgent action is required now to reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees to prevent dangerous and irreversible climate change. The easiest and most effective action for individuals is to go climatarian. It's not all or nothing. Even if you go climatarian half the time you'll still be making a real difference. Pledge to go climatarian at HYPERLINK http://www.climatarian.com www.climatarian.com For more information: contact Liz Sutton, HYPERLINK mailto:hello@climatesnetwork.com hello@climatesnetwork.com HYPERLINK http://www.climatarian.com www.climatarian.com HYPERLINK http://www.climatesnetwork.com www.climatesnetwork.com NOTES TO EDITORS 1. Beef and lamb have five times the climate impact of other meats. See \~ HYPERLINK http://www.climatarian.com www.climatarian.com 2.

The calculation is based on average UK meat consumption of 110g/day and replacing beef and lamb in day to day meals throughout the year. Average meat consumption in the USA is 156g/day. Therefore, the CO2e (Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions) savings per head are potentially significantly more than one tonne a year in the USA. The average carbon footprint in the Uk is 10 tonnes CO2e per year. In the USA it is 19 tonnes of CO2e per year. 4. Large studies have revealed links between eating red and processed meat and an increased risk of heart disease and cancer. Red meat includes ruminant and pig meat, and processed meat includes bacon, sausages, ham and salami. While eating a small amount of red meat has been shown to be beneficial, studies agree that processed meats raise the risks. 5. Climate change statistics derived from World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) report Provisional Statement Status of Global Climate 2016 published for COP22 Morocco, November 14. i) Arctic sea ice extent was well below normal throughout the year. The seasonal minimum in September was equal-second lowest extent on record after 2012. ii) Global temperatures for January to September 2016 were approximately 1.2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. iii) Global sea levels rose about 15 millimetres between November 2014 and February 2016 as a result of El Ni\'f1o, well above the post-1993 trend of 3 to 3.5 mm per year, with the early 2016 values reaching new record highs. iv) Annual average global carbon dioxide concentrations in 2015 reached 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. Initial observations indicate new records in 2016. At Cape Grim (Australia), CO2 levels in August averaged 401.42 ppm, compared with 398.13 ppm in August 2015. At Mauna Loa (Hawaii), mean weekly concentrations of CO2 as of 23 October were 402.07 ppm, compared with 398.50 ppm at the same time in 2015, whilst the May 2016 value of 407.7 ppm was the highest monthly value on record. \~ HYPERLINK http://www.climatarian.com  For more information regarding media usage, ownership and rights please contact Climates Network CIC.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK336","Agriculture must transform to feed a hotter, more crowded planet, UN says on World Food Day","October 17, 2016 Monday","M2 PressWIRE","October 16, 2016 To mark World Food Day 2016, the United Nations is highlighting the close links between climate change, sustainable agriculture, and food and nutrition security, with the message: ""The climate is changing. Food and agriculture must, too."" ""As the global population expands, we will need to satisfy an increasing demand for food,"" said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his message commemorating the Day. ""Yet, around the world, record-breaking temperatures, rising sea levels and more frequent and severe droughts and floods caused by climate change are already affecting ecosystems, agriculture and society's ability to produce the food we need,"" he added. Mr. Ban pointed out that the most vulnerable people are world's poorest, 70 per cent of whom depend on subsistence farming, fishing or pastoralism for income and food. ""Without concerted action, millions more people could fall into poverty and hunger, threatening to reverse hard-won gains and placing in jeopardy our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"" he emphasized. To bolster food security in a changing climate, countries must address food and agriculture in their climate action plans - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon According to the UN chief, agriculture and food systems must become more resilient, productive, inclusive and sustainable. ""To bolster food security in a changing climate,"" he continued ""countries must address food and agriculture in their climate action plans and invest more in rural development."" The Secretary-General explained that targeted investments in those sectors would build resilience and increase the incomes and productivity of small farmers - lifting millions from poverty. ""They will help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and safeguard the health and well-being of ecosystems and all people who depend on them, underscored Mr. Ban. Next month, the historic Paris Agreement on climate change will enter into force - providing a much-needed boost to global efforts to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions, limit temperature rise and promote climate-compatible sustainable agriculture. ""On this World Food Day, I urge all Governments and their partners to take a holistic, collaborative and integrated approach to climate change, food security and equitable social and economic development,"" stressed Mr. Ban. ""The well-being of this generation and those to come depends on the actions we take now. Only by working in partnership will we achieve a world of zero hunger and free from poverty, where all people can live in peace, prosperity and dignity,"" he concluded. Food security and nutrition top international agenda ""Food is the most basic human right"" said Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva at a dedicated special event Friday in Rome, ""yet nearly 800 million people still suffer from hunger in the world."" He noted that without food security and adequate nutrition for all, sustainable development simply could not be achieved, which is why the 2030 Agenda called for the eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition, as well as the promotion of sustainable agriculture. ""But these objectives are clearly at risk, as climate change advances,"" he continued. ""Droughts and floods are more frequent and intense. We have seen first-hand their terrible impacts in the past months, as El Ni\'f1o hit Africa, Asia and other parts such as the Dry Corridor of Central America. We have also just witnessed the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Matthew in Haiti,"" he added. Echoing the Secretary-General, the top FAO official, natural disasters and extreme weather events are more likely to happen - and yet more difficult to predict, with the poorest suffering most. ""The vast majority of them are small holders and family farmers that live in rural areas of developing countries,"" elaborated Mr. da Silva. ""They are the least equipped to deal with the threats. Even under normal circumstances, these people barely manage to survive,"" he added. Mr. Griaziano da Silva revealed that FAO would propose to its Council Session next December the establishment of a new Department on Climate Change. He also shared news that FAO had been accredited to the Green Climate Fund. ""We cannot allow the impacts of climate change to overshadow our vision of a world free of hunger and malnutrition, where food and agriculture contribute to improving the living standards of all, especially the poorest,"" he concluded. ""No one can be left behind."" 'Climate change is not waiting. Neither can we' Speaking at the event, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi linked the fight against hunger to politics. ""Italy maintains that the fight for food security is, at this point in history, a question of politics with a capital 'P',"" he said in an FAO COP22 , said the talks would be ""action-oriented"" and geared towards implementing the Paris Agreement with a ""special emphasis on adaptation, primarily for countries of the South and for small island States."" In a special message read out at the event, Pope Francis linked the impact of climate change to people migrating from rural areas of developing countries. ""The most recent data tell us that the numbers of 'climate refugees' are growing, swelling the ranks of the excluded and forgotten, who are being marginalized from the great human family,"" the pontiff said. For her part, Executive Director of the World Food Ertharin Cousin Programme (WFP) said that climate change was already stretching the international humanitarian system financially and operationally, ""so moving beyond disaster relief to managing risk is an urgent task for all of us. Climate change is not waiting, neither can we."" UN Special Envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, Macharia Kamau, spoke about building stronger solidarity and better partnerships while Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) stressed the need to bolster rural smallholder producers against the impacts of climate change. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK337","Paris climate change accord enters into force","November 4, 2016 Friday","ICIS Chemical News","LONDON (ICIS)--The Paris climate change accord, agreed in November 2015, entered into force on Friday, the United Nations (UN) said, with China, the US and the EU among those signing up to legally-binding emissions reductions targets. The agreement, which aims to cap global warming to 2030 at 1.5 to under two degrees celsius, comes ahead of the upcoming 22nd annual Conference of Parties (COP) climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7-18 November. The UN estimates that $5,000-7,000bn annual funds will be necessary to achieve sustainable development, and a substantial portion of investment should be earmarked for the transition to a low-carbon global economy. A target for the Marrakech summit - widely expected to be a more technical COP following the landmark agreement brokered at the COP21 in Paris last year - is to facilitate the flow of $100bn/year from the developed world to assist in climate change targets in emerging countries. ""In a short time - and certainly in the next 15 years - we need to see unprecedented reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and unequalled efforts to build societies that can resist rising climate impacts,"" said UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) executive secretary Patricia Espinosa and COP22 president Salaheddine Mezouar in a joint statement. ""The timetable is pressing because, globally, greenhouse gas emissions which drive climate change and its impacts are not yet falling - a fact which the Marrakech meeting must have at the front of its concerns and collective resolve."" The Paris agreement represents the most comprehensive global agreement on emissions reduction, with the assent of key players in the US and China adding weight to a process that has traditionally been driven by EU member states. ""At the time of the COP in Copenhagen [COP15 in 2009]... the US and China pretty much went off and left Europe standing there in the cold... in this case Europe was actively brokering a deal in Paris,"" Marco Mensink, director general of chemicals industry body Cefic, told ICIS earlier this year. According to climate change regulatory sources, a transformative factor in the negotiations at Paris was the shift from a top-down model, where goals would be agreed centrally and imposed on national governments, to a model where countries could establish their own targets. China has committed to reach its emissions peak by 2030, earlier if possible, and cut back from there. The superpower, which has been dogged by air-quality problems in its fast-growing cities, has also committed to providing 20% of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2030. At 800-1,000 gigawatts, this would reproduce the US' entire installed energy capacity. The US has committed to cut emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, while Europe has agreed to cut emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030. The ambition of the targets, particularly in Europe, will require regulators to re-think climate policy, as current measures are not sufficient to cap global-warming emissions even at the less intensive target of under two degrees, according to Mensink. The shift is likely to open up new markets for chemicals producers, through new innovations in products such as light-weight materials and energy storage, as well as increasing demand for higher-margin specialty products such as fuel-efficient tyres. A conglomerate of 10 oil producers on Friday announced [1]plans for a $1bn investment to accelerate the development of low-emission technologies. ""About half of our research investments go into areas related to energy, climate and sustainability. There is huge potential in the building sector and we are developing new, more-efficient insulation products. For cars it's a case both of making traditional cars use less fuel and also developing solutions for electric cars,"" said Brigitta Huckestein, BASF senior manager for energy and climate change policy. However, the extent of the EU's emission reductions targets compared to much of the rest of the world has raised concerns among industry players about further impact to the competitiveness of Europe's chemicals sector. Firms in the EU already face higher energy costs than producers in competitor regions, exacerbated by higher feedstock costs and more-intensive regulatory oversight than players outside the union. ""These areas provide new markets for us, but we need to produce these products in a cost-effective way if we want to be competitive on a global market, which means we need conditions for industry here in Europe that do not add additional cost burdens [compared to] international competitors,"" Huckestein said. More affordable avenues to reduce emissions, such as improved insulation and building materials, often receive less national backing than more capital-intensive solutions such as renewable energy, Huckestein added, noting that renewables receive 10 times the funding of building renovation in Germany. The next key milestone for the global climate change agreement is the establishment by participating governments of a rulebook to measure, review and account for climate change actions, which the UNFCCC is advocating for completion by 2018 at the latest. ""If you look at all the plans on the table for the future, if you look at windmills, there's chemicals involved, if you look at solar panels, there's chemistry involved, also for lightweight cars chemicals and housing insulation,"" Mensink said. ""What's very clear is that, whatever the targets of the future will be, the chemicals industry will be part of that solution. The only thing we just need to make sure of is that we do it in a way where the European industry can provide those solutions,"" he added. References 1.

It confirms that investment in climate-sensitive approaches for smallholder farmers can more than double farmer incomes \- meaning directing climate funding for adaptation in African agriculture would make both climate and economic sense. However, Africa currently only attracts around 5 per cent of climate funding. This is despite the fact that six of the 10 countries most affected by climate change are in Africa, and every single African nation that submitted climate adaptation strategies to the UNFCCC in Paris last year, included agriculture in its plans. The political will exists. So what are the most effective approaches that climate funds could invest in to bolster Africa\' s key economic activity? The AAA initiative focuses on three areas for investment. The first is sustainable soil management. As much as HYPERLINK http://ag4impact.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MP_0106_Soil_Report_LR1.pdf 65 per cent of soils in Africa are estimated to be degraded and unfit for growing the food crops that are needed.

Thanks to this project led by the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency, it is now possible to detect which soils in which region are deficient in which minerals. Custom-made fertilizers are now recommended at a local level and crops yields are increasing by 65 per cent, when they are used with other recommended improved crop and soil management practices. Climate risk reduction is the second pillar of AAA. The award winning work of the HYPERLINK https://ibli.ilri.org/ Index Based Livestock Insurance Improved water management is the final pillar of Morocco\' s AAA initiative. Around 70 per cent of freshwater is directed to agricultural use. Improvements in efficiency will not only give Africa more crop per drop of water, but free up water for other sectors at the same time. In Benin and Togo, water management techniques that have shown success in Asia\' s rice fields have been successfully adapted to West Africa by farmers working closely with scientists at the Africa Rice Center. This adaptation, known as the HYPERLINK http://ricetoday.irri.org/a-smart-choice-for-africas-inland-valley-rice-farmers/ Smart-valleys approach The private sector in the developed world has already woken up to the need for vast investment in agriculture so that food systems will withstand the challenges posed by extreme weather events and dwindling supplies of natural resources.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK339","Fossil-fuel CO2 emissions nearly stable for third year in row; But while increase in emissions has been halted, CO2 concentrations in atmosphere still at record....","November 14, 2016 Monday 6:00 AM GMT","The Guardian","Global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels have seen ""almost no growth"" for a third consecutive year, according to figures released as world leaders begin to arrive in Marrakech for a UN climate summit. Related: Donald Trump presidency a 'disaster for the planet', warn climate scientists After zero growth in emissions last year, researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have forecast a rise of just 0.2% for 2016, signalling a break from the average 2.3% year-on-year increases in CO2 output from fossil fuels until 2013. The rise in 2014 was 0.7%. Growth in emissions has stalled despite global economic growth exceeding 3% a year, and is mainly down to China burning less coal, according to a study in the journal Earth System Science Data. ""This third year of almost no growth in emissions is unprecedented at a time of strong economic growth,"" said Professor Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9, the director of UEA's Tyndall Centre and lead on the global carbon budget analysis. ""This is a great help for tackling climate change but it is not enough. Global emissions now need to decrease rapidly, not just stop growing."" The levelling of fossil-fuel emissions dovetails with the government pledges made at the Paris climate summit last year to limit global temperature rises, but still falls short of the actions needed to contain global warming to the UN target of ""well below 2C"". ""If climate negotiators in Marrakech can build momentum for further cuts in emissions, we could be making a serious start to addressing climate change,"" Le Qu\'e9r\'e9 said. Several countries are expected to announce new emissions curbs at the Marrakech summit, although off-floor discussion will be dominated by last week's US election, won by climate-change sceptic Donald Trump. Trump has disparaged global warming as a Chinese hoax and promised to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, although that pledge was removed from his official website on Thursday. The US is the world's second biggest emitter, responsible for around 16% of the greenhouse gases pumped into the world's atmosphere. Climate funding will certainly be another. The US has so far only delivered $500m of a promised $3bn contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which aims to disburse $100bn a year to help poorer countries deal with global warming by 2020. The EU is the largest contributor to the fund, donating (EURO)17.6bn last year, but it is unclear whether it will move to fill any funding shortfall. ""It is far too early to say whether there is a possibility, a capacity or the will to step up our climate finance commitment as the ministers have not yet had the chance to discuss this following the US election,"" an EU source said. Much of the official COP22 agenda will be focused on agreeing a rule book to implement the Paris deal. This will have to deal with technical issues such as setting common baselines and methodologies to measure emissions cuts. Despite the tailing off of emissions growth in polluting industries, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 hit a record high in 2015 and are on track to continue doing so every year until emissions hit near zero. The Paris agreement itself puts the world on track for a potentially disastrous 3C of global warming, but it also offers hope that this course can be changed by a series of reviews beginning in 2018. Under the Paris agreement, all governments that have ratified the accord, which includes the US, China, India and the EU, carry an obligation to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. That is what scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Stock-takes based on the latest scientific assessments should follow every five years - with the first scheduled for 2023 - offering a chance for the world to adjust its trajectory towards the agreement's 1.5C goal. Bob Ward, a director at the Economic and Social Research Council's centre for climate change economics and policy said that while global fossil fuel emissions appeared to have peaked ""Donald Trump as president could undermine this achievement if he carries through with his threat to scrap the Obama administration's clean power plan, and encourages an increase in the use of coal for electricity generation"". According to the UAE research, China, which is the world's biggest polluter, accounting for 29% of global carbon dioxide output, saw emissions fall 0.7% in 2015 and they are projected to drop another 0.5% in 2016, though the scientists warn of large uncertainties in the figures. In the US emissions fell 2.6% in 2015 as the country reduced its coal use while increasing gas and oil consumption, and carbon dioxide is expected to fall 1.7% this year. But the European Union's emissions rose 1.4% in 2015, against a backdrop of long term declines in pollution, while another major emitter, India, saw emissions rise 5.2%.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK340","-AfDB-World Food Day: Adapting Africa's agriculture to the exigencies of climate change","October 17, 2016 Monday","ENP Newswire","This World Food Day, Sunday, October 16, 2016, will mark the 71st anniversary of the creation of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) whose primary objective is to free humanity from hunger and malnutrition. Focusing on 'Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too,' the theme resonates with the next UN Climate Change Conference, COP22 , which takes place November 7-18, 2016 in Marrakech, Morocco. Ahead of Marrakech, the importance of food and nutrition to Africa's development will top the agenda of the 7th Africa Day for Food and Nutrition Security scheduled to take place in Accra, Ghana, from October 26-28, 2016 on the theme, 'Investing in Food Systems for Improving Child Nutrition: Key to Africa's Renaissance.' With nearly 240 million hungry people, Africa accounts for 30% of the 800 million people across the world who do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest prevalence (percentage of population) of hunger despite the fact that the region is home to 65% of the world's available arable land. Worse, Africa's food and nutrition situation is getting worse as staples such as maize, millet, rice, cassava, yams and beans, among others, are no longer easily available to ordinary people largely due to declining yields and higher prices attributed to the impact of climate change. Reports of thieves making away with steaming pots of soup and the intermittent wars pitching herdsmen against local farmers in parts of the continent are clear indications of the magnitude of the food-related crisis that lie ahead. The African Development Bank's Agriculture and Agro-Industry Department believes that without concerted action to tackle the causes and effects of climate change, the yields of major African staple crops would decline by 8% to 22% by 2050. By 2100, maize yields could decline by 20-45%, wheat by 5-50%, rice by 20-30%; and soybean yields by 30-60%. At the same time, agriculture accounts for approximately 14% of greenhouse gas emissions, with the figure projected to rise to 25% when forestry and other land-use activities are included. Attaining the 2030 Zero Hunger target can only be attained by addressing climate change, as the millions of people suffering from chronic undernourishment are small-scale farmers, fishers and pastoralists mostly affected by rising temperatures, floods and other weather-related disasters. The AfDB is tackling the impacts of climate change on agriculture and how agriculture fuels climate change through a multi-pronged approach spearheaded by its High 5 priorities - Light up and power Africa, Feed Africa, Industrialize Africa, Integrate Africa, and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa - which is a blueprint for the implementation of its Ten Year Strategy 2013-2022. The first priority, Light up and power Africa also deals with climate finance, adaption and low carbon development. The Bank has committed to triple its climate finance to US $ 5 billion a year by 2020, including by leveraging more finance from climate funds. Going forward, the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy focuses on scaling up agriculture as a business through value addition, led by the private sector and enabled by the public sector, and using innovative financing mechanisms to end hunger and rural poverty in Africa in the next decade. Enabler 6 of the Feed Africa Strategy, i.e., Increased Inclusivity, Sustainability, and Nutrition, includes shoring up climate resilience funding by providing funds to support climate adaptation and climate-smart agricultural practices. Over the years, the Bank has worked with its regional member countries (RMCs) to mobilize additional resources for climate change, some of which have a focus on climate smart agriculture. These funds include the Climate Investment Funds, the Global Environmental Facility, the Green Climate Fund, and the Africa Climate Change Fund. These efforts have helped to mainstream environment, climate change and food security, build resilience and integrate fisheries and water resource management in the Bank's agriculture operations. Under the Feed Africa Strategy, the total investment required for realizing the transformation agenda over 10 years is estimated at US $ 315-400 billion. Over the 10-year period of the Strategy, the Bank will invest a total of US $ 24 billion and leverage additional funding through equity, quasi equity, debt, risk instruments, and other sources to catalyze investments at scale from the private sector in addition to co-financing from traditional donors and new players so as to meet the funding required for agricultural transformation. Most importantly, at the Lusaka Annual Meetings in May 2016, the Bank, in partnership with the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, African Union/NEPAD, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Big Win Philanthropy, Dangote Foundation, World Bank and the World Food Program, established The African Leaders for Nutrition, a high-level body, which will include Heads of States and private sector leaders to champion accountability and elimination of malnutrition in all its forms across the continent. 'Access to food, in the right quantity and quality, is a basic human right,' AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina said in May. 'There is absolutely no justification that Africa, which has over 65% of all the arable land left in the world, is unable to feed itself, spending $ 35 billion per year on food imports - an amount projected to rise to $ 110 billion by 2030 if the current trends continue.' President Adesina's exhortation is worth reiterating on the 71st World Food Day and the 7th Africa Day for Food and Nutrition Security.

The sector policies set out the framework governing the financial services Societe Generale offers in the business sectors in which it operates. The bank will also scale back its outstanding loans to the coal industry, with a goal of reducing the proportion of coal-fuelled share in power production financed by the bank to 19% by 2020, in line with the International Energy Agency\' s 2-degree scenario. The shift in the energy mix will also result from increased financing for renewable energies. Societe Generale is continuing to ramp up project financing in this sector. In 2015, it announced it was doubling project financing in the renewable energy sector, with a &euro;10 billion of funding allocated to the renewable energy sector by 2020. In 2016 Societe Generale maintained its position among the world leaders in this area. For example, it was involved in 100% of offshore wind farm projects financed in Europe this year.

Food and agriculture must, too."" ""As the global population expands, we will need to satisfy an increasing demand for food,"" said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his message commemorating the Day. ""Yet, around the world, record-breaking temperatures, rising sea levels and more frequent and severe droughts and floods caused by climate change are already affecting ecosystems, agriculture and society's ability to produce the food we need,"" he added. Mr. Ban pointed out that the most vulnerable people are world's poorest, 70 per cent of whom depend on subsistence farming, fishing or pastoralism for income and food. ""Without concerted action, millions more people could fall into poverty and hunger, threatening to reverse hard-won gains and placing in jeopardy our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"" he emphasized. To bolster food security in a changing climate, countries must address food and agriculture in their climate action plans - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon According to the UN chief, agriculture and food systems must become more resilient, productive, inclusive and sustainable. ""To bolster food security in a changing climate,"" he continued ""countries must address food and agriculture in their climate action plans and invest more in rural development."" The Secretary-General explained that targeted investments in those sectors would build resilience and increase the incomes and productivity of small farmers - lifting millions from poverty. ""They will help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and safeguard the health and well-being of ecosystems and all people who depend on them, underscored Mr. Ban. Next month, the historic Paris Agreement on climate change will enter into force - providing a much-needed boost to global efforts to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions, limit temperature rise and promote climate-compatible sustainable agriculture. ""On this World Food Day, I urge all Governments and their partners to take a holistic, collaborative and integrated approach to climate change, food security and equitable social and economic development,"" stressed Mr. Ban. ""The well-being of this generation and those to come depends on the actions we take now. Only by working in partnership will we achieve a world of zero hunger and free from poverty, where all people can live in peace, prosperity and dignity,"" he concluded. Food security and nutrition top international agenda ""Food is the most basic human right"" said Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva at a dedicated special event Friday in Rome, ""yet nearly 800 million people still suffer from hunger in the world."" He noted that without food security and adequate nutrition for all, sustainable development simply could not be achieved, which is why the 2030 Agenda called for the eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition, as well as the promotion of sustainable agriculture. ""But these objectives are clearly at risk, as climate change advances,"" he continued. ""Droughts and floods are more frequent and intense. We have seen first-hand their terrible impacts in the past months, as El Ni\'f1o hit Africa, Asia and other parts such as the Dry Corridor of Central America. We have also just witnessed the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Matthew in Haiti,"" he added. Echoing the Secretary-General, the top FAO official, natural disasters and extreme weather events are more likely to happen - and yet more difficult to predict, with the poorest suffering most. ""The vast majority of them are small holders and family farmers that live in rural areas of developing countries,"" elaborated Mr. da Silva. ""They are the least equipped to deal with the threats. Even under normal circumstances, these people barely manage to survive,"" he added. Mr. Griaziano da Silva revealed that FAO would propose to its Council Session next December the establishment of a new Department on Climate Change. He also shared news that FAO had been accredited to the Green Climate Fund. ""We cannot allow the impacts of climate change to overshadow our vision of a world free of hunger and malnutrition, where food and agriculture contribute to improving the living standards of all, especially the poorest,"" he concluded. ""No one can be left behind."" 'Climate change is not waiting. Neither can we' Speaking at the event, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi linked the fight against hunger to politics. ""Italy maintains that the fight for food security is, at this point in history, a question of politics with a capital 'P',"" he said in an FAO COP22 , said the talks would be ""action-oriented"" and geared towards implementing the Paris Agreement with a ""special emphasis on adaptation, primarily for countries of the South and for small island States."" In a special message read out at the event, Pope Francis linked the impact of climate change to people migrating from rural areas of developing countries. ""The most recent data tell us that the numbers of 'climate refugees' are growing, swelling the ranks of the excluded and forgotten, who are being marginalized from the great human family,"" the pontiff said. For her part, Executive Director of the World Food Ertharin Cousin Programme (WFP) said that climate change was already stretching the international humanitarian system financially and operationally, ""so moving beyond disaster relief to managing risk is an urgent task for all of us.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK344","Focus on your food to help limit climate change.","November 30, 2016 Wednesday","FinancialWire","2016 is set to be the hottest year on record with preliminary data indicating global warming reaching 1.2oC. As we get perilously close to the 1.5oC limit agreed at the Paris climate summit, Climates social network is calling on people to focus on food to help limit climate change and make their New Year's resolution to go climatarian. 'If you make just one New Year's resolution for 2017, pledge to go climatarian,' says Biba Hartigan, Director of Climates. 'Just a simple diet shift can have a really big impact. If everyone in the UK went climatarian it would cut 10% of the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions. It's the easiest way for people to help the climate and it's good for your health too.' Simply swapping beef and lamb for pork and poultry in your everyday meals knocks a whole tonne off your annual carbon footprint. That's equivalent to the emissions from driving 3,500 miles or six short-haul flights but much easier to achieve. You don't have to change your lifestyle or even your cooking habits. Reducing consumption of red and processed meat has been proven to lower the risk of heart disease and cancer. The latest meteorological data reveals that climate change is now an acute problem. It needs to be addressed with urgency at every level, government, business and individual. Food causes 24% of global greenhouse gases which is comparable to all the emissions from electricity and heat (25%) and far more than transport (14%). Food is where individuals have a significant role to play as a small change in diet can have a surprisingly large impact. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015. 16 of the warmest 17 years on record have occurred this century. Long term climate change indicators are also continuing to break records: Arctic sea ice is at its second ever lowest level;Sea levels are rising faster;Ocean warming has bleached half the Great Barrier Reef;Major weather events in 2016 included Hurricane Matthew which devastated Haiti, heavy flooding in North Korea, Fiji's worst ever cyclone, Canada's worst ever wildfire, flooding in the Yangtse basin, while India, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran saw temperatures soar to over 50oC;Despite global emissions levelling out, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to rise to new record levels. Urgent action is required now to reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees to prevent dangerous and irreversible climate change. The easiest and most effective action for individuals is to go climatarian. It's not all or nothing. Even if you go climatarian half the time you'll still be making a real difference.

For full references see \~ HYPERLINK http://www.climatarian.com www.climatarian.com 3. The calculation is based on average UK meat consumption of 110g/day and replacing beef and lamb in day to day meals throughout the year. Average meat consumption in the USA is 156g/day. Therefore, the CO2e (Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions) savings per head are potentially significantly more than one tonne a year in the USA. The average carbon footprint in the Uk is 10 tonnes CO2e per year. In the USA it is 19 tonnes of CO2e per year. 4. Large studies have revealed links between eating red and processed meat and an increased risk of heart disease and cancer. Red meat includes ruminant and pig meat, and processed meat includes bacon, sausages, ham and salami. While eating a small amount of red meat has been shown to be beneficial, studies agree that processed meats raise the risks. 5. Climate change statistics derived from World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) report Provisional Statement Status of Global Climate 2016 published for COP22 Morocco, November 14. i) Arctic sea ice extent was well below normal throughout the year. The seasonal minimum in September was equal-second lowest extent on record after 2012. ii) Global temperatures for January to September 2016 were approximately 1.2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. iii) Global sea levels rose about 15 millimetres between November 2014 and February 2016 as a result of El Ni\'f1o, well above the post-1993 trend of 3 to 3.5 mm per year, with the early 2016 values reaching new record highs. iv) Annual average global carbon dioxide concentrations in 2015 reached 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. Initial observations indicate new records in 2016. At Cape Grim (Australia), CO2 levels in August averaged 401.42 ppm, compared with 398.13 ppm in August 2015.

Speaking at a press conference hosted by the Russian delegation today at the UNFCCC COP 22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Agneta Rising said; 'Electricity is a vital part of our modern world. Full global access to reliable and affordable electricity supplies is essential. To meet the climate change objectives of the Paris agreement this must be achieved using all low carbon sources of electricity. Nuclear is a proven source of low carbon electricity. It promotes the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions while fostering sustainable development.' Speaking at the same event, Kirill Komarov, First Deputy CEO for Corporate Development and International Business of Rosatom, noted that to meet world demand for electricity and tackle climate change there was a need to review the entire world energy supply with the aim to reduce carbon emissions. 'We believe that in these circumstances, the most effective solution is to expand the use of nuclear power generation ', he said. Kirill Komarov continued, 'We are confident that the future of energy is a diversified balance of low-carbon technologies, providing affordability, security of supply and minimal environmental impact.' Governments should act and give the policy support that is needed to be able to provide nuclear energy, which is low carbon, competitive, reliable and scalable energy. Nuclear is proven to scale up fast and the nuclear sector is ready to deliver. The members of the world's nuclear industry have agreed a goal of constructing 1000 GW of new nuclear build by 2050, tripling the global capacity, so that nuclear would generate 25% of global electricity demand. Over the last 45 years, nuclear generation has avoided the equivalent of two years of the world's total carbon dioxide emissions - nearly 80 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Agneta Rising said, 'France, Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada's province of Ontario, have all achieved more than 80% low carbon electricity generation by using nuclear energy in harmony with renewable. By using nuclear energy those countries have already achieved the kind of low carbon generation mixes that the whole world will have to adopt by 2050 if we are to meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement.

While past developments in agriculture have led to major improvements in productivity, he continued, ""progress has been uneven"" and that ""greater emphasis must be placed on the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability."" The Director-General pointed to growing international recognition that agriculture can play a transformative role in addressing the impacts of climate change. Countries are set to gather for the next Conference of States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), informally known as ' COP 22 ,' in Morocco in November to put into motion their pledges on climate change, and FAO ""stands ready to assist governments, especially of developing countries to have access to international resources that are available to finance these actions,"" he said.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK348","Strong moral leadership is needed to combat populist tide","FT.com"," ","Millions across the world feel that the current globalised system is not working in their best interests. From unemployed former steel workers in the US rust belt, to the small island states in the South Pacific where livelihoods are threatened by climate change, people are angry that decisions taken by governments and in corporate boardrooms appear blithely indifferent to their daily struggles. We know from history that crude populism offers no real solutions, creating only false hope and scapegoats. Yet it is also clear that there are many politicians who will cynically exploit genuine grievances for their own ends. All of this means that the new year is beginning with uncertainty and trepidation at every level of society. Potentially seismic changes in political leadership in 2017, not only in the US but also across Europe, Iran, India and parts of Africa, could disrupt established institutions and multilateral processes. At the same time, across the world we see rising levels of xenophobia and intolerance, a narrowing of political vision and a focus on parochial introspection. It feels as if a lid has been taken off a simmering pot of tensions and discontent. Views on race, gender and religion that only a few years ago were deemed unacceptable are now commonplace. Over the past year we have seen how public discourse can be tarnished by harsh and ugly rhetoric. This is most evident online, where women and minority groups are targets of cowardly abuse and intimidation. Some politicians claim this is a populist revolt against global elites and that the whole system of international governance established since the end of the second world war, including the UN, needs to be comprehensively overhauled. I would argue that the values that form the foundation of the UN and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are as relevant today as they were in the 1940s and that our challenge is to uphold them. At the same time, we need to make changes to the international governance system so that it is more resilient, robust, representative and equipped to adapt to new geopolitical realities and complex long-term challenges, including climate change, mass migration and growing inequality. If we are to have any hope of making constructive progress in 2017, and stopping this rising tide of anger turning into destructive nihilism, all responsible politicians, civil society and business leaders must stand firm and reassert our basic, common values of dignity for all. I am encouraged by the fact that there are many leaders, organisations and citizens who are still determined to act together to secure a sustainable future for our people and our planet. I saw this for myself at the COP 22 climate negotiations that took place in November 2016 in Marrakesh. Leaders from countries at all levels of development  as well as business, cities, regions, civil society and indigenous communities  renewed their commitment to the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. The focus now is on implementation, so that any rise in global temperatures can be limited to 1.5C or below, an absolute prerequisite for climate justice. Fortunately, leadership exists. In Marrakesh, I was very impressed by the Climate Vulnerable Forum: a group of 48 countries that are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and most committed to leading a rapid transformation in their own countries to carbon-neutral, climate resilient economies. I was inspired by their call for  a new era of the pursuit of development, ending poverty, leaving no person behind and protecting the environment and for an international co-operative system that is fully equipped to address climate change. This is precisely the right vision and attitude  and a powerful antidote to today\' s pervasive gloom. Only by embracing such a holistic approach can we successfully implement not only the Paris Agreement but also the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Taken together  which is absolutely essential, because without action on climate change the rest of the UN\' s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be unachievable  they have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people across the planet. It must be a bottom-up approach, in which leaders and policymakers show humility and listen to the experiences and voices of people at the sharp end of climate change, poverty, violence and injustice. This is no time for naive optimism; the challenges ahead are stark and the voices of hostility are strident. But I remain inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela, who said in 2003 that:  Those who conduct themselves with morality, integrity and consistency need not fear the forces of inhumanity and cruelty. As a member of The Elders, the group of independent former leaders founded by Mr Mandela to work for peace and human rights, I will hold his words close in the coming year and hope they will continue to inspire citizens across the globe to trust their best instincts and work together for justice.

More than a dozen initiatives from Africa to Indonesia to South America are demonstrating how climate mitigation and adaptation actions related to forests and agriculture are firmly anchored in the Nationally Determined Contributions of over 120 Parties to the Climate Convention. The announcement also comes only two years after the New York Declaration on Forests, an ambitious multi-stakeholder commitment to cut deforestation in half by 2020 and striving to end natural forest loss by 2030. Forest Action Day at the Marrakech Climate Change Conference ( COP 22 ) is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, an initiative by France and Morocco to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. ""Conserving, restoring and managing forests is essential to meeting global sustainable development goals, including combating desertification and water security,"" said Abdeladim Lhafi, High Commissioner for Water, Forests and the Fight against Desertification of Morocco, co-organizer of the event. ""That is why the Moroccan government is announcing a new initiative ""Strengthened Action in Favor of Forests in the Mediterranean-Sahel Region in the Context of Climate Change"" (AFMS) to help countries meet multilateral commitments to forests, including the adaptation and mitigation actions under the Paris agreement, and facilitate climate change investments to Improve forest management and build the resilience of forest-dependent communities. ."" ""Forests are one of the largest and most cost-effective responses we have to climate change,"" said Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), event co-organizer. ""Countries, civil society, the private sector and indigenous peoples are working powerfully together to protect forests to limit global warming to below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement."" Healthier forests will not only help combat climate change but also contribute to many other global development goals by providing food, income, fuel and shelter, said Ren\'e9 Castro Salazar, Assistant Director-General, Forestry, of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which also co-organized the event. ""The Zero Hunger goal of the SDGs cannot be achieved by 2030 without addressing climate change, and climate change cannot be addressed without managing the world's forests in a sustainable manner,"" he said. Deforestation and forest degradation currently contribute up to 12 percent of carbon emissions - more than the entire transport sector combined. Yet, by halting deforestation and reducing and reversing forest degradation, forests could contribute significantly to the climate solution in the coming decades. More than a dozen announcements were made at today's session, including: - Moratorium on Indonesian Peatland Clearing: The Government of Indonesia announced it is implementing a moratorium on clearing super-high-carbon intact peatland. Today's action builds on Indonesian President Joko Widodo's announcement at last year's Forest Action Day in Paris, to end new and review existing peat concessions. - Forest Planning for Peace in Colombia: Over the past three years, deforestation has been reduced by 50% below the average during 1990-2010. Now, linked to the peace process, Colombia has announced plans to close the forest frontier as a key component of a post-conflict future. Efforts include focusing development on non-forest lands, implementing strong tenure reform, and placing very large areas of forest under indigenous peoples' control. - African Leadership on Sustainable Development: The public-private partnership Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 announced the African Palm Oil Initiative, a new regional declaration of principles charting a path for responsible development of this commodity in one of its fastest-growing producer regions. Through this initiative, African governments at the highest level have committed to learning from and avoiding the serious deforestation caused by the palm oil sector in Asia. In addition, the Central African Forest Initiative, which includes six central African high-forest-cover countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, the DRC, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon), has taken a major step since COP21 toward the implementation of sustainable development frameworks in the region through the signing of a $ 200 million Letter of Intent to support REDD+ and responsible and inclusive development investments. - Brazilian Transformation: Brazil's Forest Code is a concrete tool for avoiding illegal deforestation, increasing and consolidating forest conservation, management and restoration processes in the field, and adding sustainable value for Brazilian agriculture and cattle (both on domestic and international level). The multi-stakeholder Produce, Conserve, Include (PCI) strategy in Mato Grosso, Brazil, will simultaneously reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 90% by 2030, increase agricultural production and promote socioeconomic inclusion of smallholders and traditional populations. - Breakthrough Technology for Transparency: A new partnership between FAO and Google has created Collect Earth, an open-source tool that provides access to large collections of free, high-resolution satellite imagery and cloud computing. This enables countries to produce fast and cost-effective land use and land-use change estimates, thus increasing the accuracy of the emissions-reduction estimates from deforestation and forest degradation and improving the reliability necessary for performance-based payments. A recent assessment of the global drylands by Collect Earth revealed the existence of 1.11 billion hectares of forest land - 27% of worldwide forest cover - and 13.5 billion trees outside forests in the world's drylands. So far over 700 national experts have been trained to use Collect Earth in over 30 countries, which will help them to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

""Agriculture is at the very heart"" of a recent series of ground-breaking international agreements, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jose Graziano da Silva told ministers, and representatives of government, private sector and civil society attending the biannual meeting of the agency's Committee on Agriculture, according to a FAO news release ""Sustainable agriculture is paramount to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, to sustain natural resources, to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, to achieve healthier food systems and to build resilience against crises and natural disasters,"" he said. While past developments in agriculture have led to major improvements in productivity, he continued, ""progress has been uneven"" and that ""greater emphasis must be placed on the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability."" The Director-General pointed to growing international recognition that agriculture can play a transformative role in addressing the impacts of climate change. Countries are set to gather for the next Conference of States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), informally known as ' COP 22 ,' in Morocco in November to put into motion their pledges on climate change, and FAO ""stands ready to assist governments, especially of developing countries to have access to international resources that are available to finance these actions,"" he said. Mr. Graziano da Silva also noted that the ""role of agriculture goes beyond generating food and income,"" referring to FAO's recent commitment at the UN General Assembly to work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to curb antimicrobial resistance. ""We at FAO believe that antibiotics and other antimicrobials should be used in agriculture to cure diseases and to alleviate suffering. Only under strict circumstances they could be used to prevent an imminent threat of infection,"" he said. Mr. Graziano da Silva told the Committee's opening session today that in 2014-15, FAO supported 245 initiatives in 89 countries to promote sustainable agricultural production practices based on participatory approaches. The Committee meets every two years to assess the current state of affairs in world agriculture and provide guidance to FAO on its program of work.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK351","Scientists rate Canadian climate policies; Canada has made significant progress in its climate policy, but has further yet to go","November 28, 2016 Monday 11:00 AM GMT","The Guardian","The Paris Agreement was ratified globally in November. This is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. The Agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change, and requires as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked in a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing green-house gas emissions at the planetary-scale. This process is not unlike the Olympics games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD) - a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada - produced Rating Canada's Climate Policy ; a progress report on Canada's climate actions over the past year. We analysed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars. Canada has recently taken two important steps forward. In September, the Government of Canada announced a $120 billion infrastructure investment plan that explicitly highlights support for infrastructures reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. In October, the Government of Canada Announced a Pan-Canadian Pricing on Carbon Pollution starting in 2018. The price on carbon pollution should start at a minimum of $10 per tonne in 2018 and rise by $10 a year to reach $50 per tonne in 2022. This is a modest start given the Canadian government has stated a central value for the social cost of carbon (SCC) is about $41 Cdn/tonne; and could be as high as $167 Cdn. Despite the progress discussed above, the Canadian Government decision to approve the Pacific Northwest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the Federal Government to address climate change with concrete and meaningful policies and actions. Our impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase BC's emissions by 8.5%. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada's stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5 oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2 oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector, and academia. We must discuss how to redirect subsidies of $3.3 billion away from the fossil fuel industry. Those funds should promote transitions to low-carbon energy and ensure that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills in other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up the expectations created by joining the COP21 High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Our federal government has not developed a complete climate action plan. But two further steps forward have occurred since the close of the COP22 Marrakech Meeting. On November 19, Canadian Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna announced details of support for Canadian and Global actions towards cleaner, more sustainable growth in Canada and internationally. As we pen this article, on November 21, Minister McKenna announced that Canada will phase out all coal fired electricity by 2030. Sustainable Canada Dialogues applauds the Minister's announcements. But SCD will continue to push for Canada to adopt actions on clean energy and climate policy that will decrease GHG emissions, increase certainty in Canadian and global business environments, and encourage companies to invest in low-carbon technologies. Canada, Canadians, can and will show international leadership on climate action. Download Sustainable Canada Dialogues' November 2016 Progress Report on National Government Leadership on climate actions. Our March 2015 Acting on Climate Change Report charted a path for eliminating coal fired electricity in Canada. SCDs' Open Letter to Canadian Political and Indigenous leaders in March 2016 warned continued investment in oil extraction and transportation locks Canada into carbon intensive energy for decades.

More than a dozen initiatives from Africa to Indonesia to South America are demonstrating how climate mitigation and adaptation actions related to forests and agriculture are firmly anchored in the Nationally Determined Contributions of over 120 Parties to the Climate Convention. The announcement also comes only two years after the New York Declaration on Forests, an ambitious multi-stakeholder commitment to cut deforestation in half by 2020 and striving to end natural forest loss by 2030. Forest Action Day at the Marrakech Climate Change Conference ( COP 22 ) is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, an initiative by France and Morocco to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. ""Conserving, restoring and managing forests is essential to meeting global sustainable development goals, including combating desertification and water security,"" said Abdeladim Lhafi, High Commissioner for Water, Forests and the Fight against Desertification of Morocco, co-organizer of the event. ""That is why the Moroccan government is announcing a new initiative ""Strengthened Action in Favor of Forests in the Mediterranean-Sahel Region in the Context of Climate Change"" (AFMS) to help countries meet multilateral commitments to forests, including the adaptation and mitigation actions under the Paris agreement, and facilitate climate change investments to Improve forest management and build the resilience of forest-dependent communities. ."" ""Forests are one of the largest and most cost-effective responses we have to climate change,"" said Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), event co-organizer. ""Countries, civil society, the private sector and indigenous peoples are working powerfully together to protect forests to limit global warming to below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement."" Healthier forests will not only help combat climate change but also contribute to many other global development goals by providing food, income, fuel and shelter, said Ren\'e9 Castro Salazar, Assistant Director-General, Forestry, of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which also co-organized the event. ""The Zero Hunger goal of the SDGs cannot be achieved by 2030 without addressing climate change, and climate change cannot be addressed without managing the world's forests in a sustainable manner,"" he said. Deforestation and forest degradation currently contribute up to 12 percent of carbon emissions - more than the entire transport sector combined. Yet, by halting deforestation and reducing and reversing forest degradation, forests could contribute significantly to the climate solution in the coming decades. More than a dozen announcements were made at today's session, including: - Moratorium on Indonesian Peatland Clearing: The Government of Indonesia announced it is implementing a moratorium on clearing super-high-carbon intact peatland. Today's action builds on Indonesian President Joko Widodo's announcement at last year's Forest Action Day in Paris, to end new and review existing peat concessions. - Forest Planning for Peace in Colombia: Over the past three years, deforestation has been reduced by 50% below the average during 1990-2010. Now, linked to the peace process, Colombia has announced plans to close the forest frontier as a key component of a post-conflict future. Efforts include focusing development on non-forest lands, implementing strong tenure reform, and placing very large areas of forest under indigenous peoples' control. - African Leadership on Sustainable Development: The public-private partnership Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 announced the African Palm Oil Initiative, a new regional declaration of principles charting a path for responsible development of this commodity in one of its fastest-growing producer regions.

Several sovereign issuers including France, Nigeria and China have stated intentions to issue green bonds, but Poland has seized first mover advantage. It named HSBC as sole-structuring adviser alongside JP Morgan and PKO Bank Polski as joint lead managers. A benchmark five year euro-denominated green bond may follow as early as Monday or Tuesday next week. The issuer began meetings in London on Wednesday before taking in Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Munich over the course of the week. Though some are sceptical of the coal-reliant nation's dedication to going green, two dedicated green funds toldGlobalCapitalthey were excited by the prospect of sovereign issuance in their market. ""It caught a lot of the green bond community by surprise,"" said a socially responsible investments (SRI) analyst. ""I'm curious to see the final product, especially with the reputation they have. But this is the next frontier for green bonds"""" the next product """"so we welcome it in principal."" Poland published its green bond framework on December 5 and has also secured the support of sustainability research and analysis firm, Sustainalytics, to verify the green credentials of the proposed five year euro benchmark bond. Sustainalytics also noted that the deal will help Poland achieve its objective of becoming a low emissions economy """" something that SRI investors are keen to see. ""The main thing for me,"" said a second green-focused investor, ""is that, yes, Poland is reliant on coal but the idea that this bond will help them with their energy mix is critical."" He was not disappointed either by the prospect of a juicer spread than that offered in higher rated agency green bonds from the likes of KfW. ""We could pick up a good bargain,"" he said.Coal undermines green claims ""This is a government which hasn't exactly been on the front foot for climate change so investors will be looking for a strong assurance as to the use of proceeds,"" said Sean Kidney, CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative. ""Poland has indicated that they will continue to be a coal nation and nothing will change that. ""The ruling party has done little to prove itself [in respect of climate change]. We hope that this is the sign of a major shift in Polish policy to a low carbon and climate resilient economy. We hope investors will use the roadshow to grill the government for further plans to grow a pipeline for green investment, and that this deal won't be a one-off."" In a letter dated September 26, Jan Szyzko, Poland's minister of the environmentwrote that Poland is willing to implementthe emissions reduction goal of 40% by the year 2030 agreed for the EU, ""but only on terms that take into account the specificity of the Polish economy."" He added that ""hard coal and lignite is the foundation of Poland's economy and sustainable development."" The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to below two degrees. It entered into force on November 4 with 115 countries having ratified the agreement. Poland's ratification was accepted on October 7. Piotr Nowak, Poland's deputy minister of finance, noted that hard coal and lignite remain very important to Poland's economy but re-emphasised that sustainable growth and green energy was high on the agenda. ""During [the] COP22 conference in Marrakesh, [Poland's environment minister, Jan] Szyszko said that climate policy is of priority to Poland,"" he said. ""Our involvement in this area may be perfectly exemplified by among other [things] implementation of our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. Poland reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by 32% compared to the required 6% and simultaneously progressed its economic growth. And in 2018 Poland will host COP24."" He added that said that Poland had no intention of the bond being a one time offer. ""Our intention is to be regular issuer in this segment,"" he said ""However, we are not making any plans at the moment on how much we would like to raise in green format. Let's wait for the final outcome of this trade."" While EM bankers on and off the deal acknowledged that issuing a green bond is very much a public relations exercise and an important tool in reputation management, it is an important step for both setting a benchmark for other sovereign trades, and for Poland's corporate issuers. Bankers hope around 40%-50% of the trade will be sold to dedicated green investors. Diversification of funding sources is also important to the sovereign, according to a banker on the deal. Nowak added that the deal ""allows us to capture a new source of funding for eligible projects funded from the state budget offering environmental benefits."" The deal is expected to be sold with no premium paid over the borrower's conventional curve. Five year euro debt from Poland was trading at 35bp over mid-swaps on Thursday. \"

Several villages in rural areas have been identified to participate in the first phase of this pilot program, prior to deployment on a larger scale. The kits include a solar panel connected to a battery that can be used to provide domestic appliances with electricity. They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralized source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones. This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment. ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via ""Orange Money"". The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. Access to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimize the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa. During the COP22 conference, Orange and ENGIE reaffirm their commitment to leveraging their technological expertise to stimulate sustainable progress and economic and social development on the African continent.

""Drylands are absolutely key to global food security for the whole planet,"" said IFAD President, Kanayo F. Nwanze in a press release on the report, which was launched today in Marrakech, Morocco, where the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP 22 , has been under way since Monday. ""Environment friendly and water efficient agriculture for smallholders is key to reducing poverty, boosting smallholder adaptation to climate change, and rehabilitating degraded lands. We look to empower more rural farmers to sustainably manage their land, so that while they feed their families for generations to come, they can also get out of poverty,"" he said. Drylands typically refer to arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. They are present on every continent and are home to more than two billion people. They support up to 44 per cent of the world's cultivated agricultural systems. The report, The Drylands Advantage: Protecting the environment, empowering people, explains how drylands support ecosystems and a wide variety of biodiversity as well as their vital role in the livelihoods and cultural identities of many people. In Swaziland, for example, IFAD has supported communities in rehabilitating gullied land and introducing sustainable land management practices for 68,000 hectares of land - thus generating a new source of livelihoods for the people who live there. In China's Yanchi county, where drylands are becoming deserts, farmers have increased their incomes by 20 per cent thanks to a programme which generates alternative and sustainable livelihoods. Without it, desertification would likely worsen and drylands would be non-arable. IFAD backs projects that both help smallholders thrive in drylands and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the 2030 Agenda - particularly to ""protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."" However, Margarita Astralaga, Director of IFAD's Environment and Climate Division, warns that ""despite their importance, drylands are being degraded with enormous economic consequences."" ""Desertification of drylands could lead to some 50 million people being displaced within the next 10 years,"" she said. But IFAD's investments are proving promising: ""By investing in drylands, IFAD is seeing significant human and environmental dividends. Environment-friendly and water-efficient agriculture for smallholders is key to reducing poverty, boosting smallholder adaptation to climate change, as well as rehabilitating degraded lands.""

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK357","-Nuclear key to a clean energy future, IEA World Energy Outlook","November 17, 2016 Thursday","ENP Newswire","Nuclear energy is an important pillar of a future energy system aimed at meeting the world's growing energy needs and avoiding the worst effects of climate change, according to a new report published today by the International Energy Agency. The World Energy Outlook 2016 450 scenario, aimed at limiting an increase in global temperatures due to climate change to less than 2 degrees C, shows global nuclear generation output increasing by almost two and a half times by 2040, compared to the present day, from 2535 TWh to 6101 TWh. In this scenario low carbon energy sources dominate the generation mix. Hydro generates 20%, nuclear 18%, wind 18% and solar PV 9%. Fossil fuel generation declines sharply, with gas supplying 16%, coal 9% and oil 1%. The remaining 9% is supplied by a range of other low carbon sources. World Nuclear Association Director General, Agneta Rising said, 'We must meet the world's growing energy needs and protect the planet. We will need all low carbon energy options to work together to achieve this, and nuclear will make a major contribution, because it is scalable, reliable and competitive.' The high efficiency and stable supplies produced by nuclear plants means they are able to generate more electricity from the same capacity of plant, in comparison to intermittent renewables. For example, under the 450 scenario nuclear and wind generate virtually the same amount of electricity, but nuclear does so with just 820 GW of installed capacity, while wind requires 2321 GW. Nuclear generation is a cost-competitive low-carbon generation option according to the IEA report. The cost per unit of electricity produced from wind or solar PV being 22-40% higher than that from nuclear generation, even without counting the additional costs of adapting the grid and providing the back-up generation required to compensate for their intermittent supply. The IEA's report states that even further decarbonisation will be needed to meet the goal of the UNFCCC's Paris Agreement, which aims to hold the global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C and to pursue a target of 1.5 degrees C.

Federal Minister for Climate Change Zahid Hamid also announced that the cabinet had approved the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and Climate Change Bill. Briefing the media over the background of the Paris agreement, Hamid said that an expert study group was constituted to formulate the INDCs report. ""This report forecasts how much emission is expected as a result of future development till 2030,"" he said explaining that the country's current carbon emissions were 405 million tons, 135th highest in the world. ""We intended to reduce our carbon emissions by 20 per cent but that will depend upon the availability of funds from the Green Climate Funds (GCF),"" Hamid said, adding that Pakistan has demanded $42 billion to meet the country's target. The minister further said that Pakistan would send the INDCs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat before COP-22 , likely to be held from November 7 to 18 in Morocco. Hamid also informed the media that the cabinet had approved the Climate Change bill. Shedding light on the salient features of the bill, he said that according to the proposals a 'Pakistan Climate Change Council' would be established. The body would be a high climate change decision making body which will either be chaired by the prime minister or a person nominated by him. The federal government may appoint federal and provincial ministers, chief ministers, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan chief secretaries as members of the council. Different projects will be prepared under this authority and will be implemented by the provinces. ""We are among the few countries that will have this authority. It will also be responsible to implement Kyoto protocol and Paris agreement,"" he added. He also highlighted Green Pakistan Programme and told the media that 20% target has already been achieved. He said that this is a red-letter day to achieve three major climate change developments. The bill, he said, has addressed 24 areas. According to the minister, a section of the bill deals with the cost of litigation. Currently, it is mandatory to pay the cost of litigation to the winning party. Hamid said that further legal reforms were on the cards and soon electoral reforms would also be introduced. Source: Express Tribune website in English 0000 gmt 3 Nov 16 \"

By doing this, the bank is consistent with the International Energy Agency's 2DS scenario, which aims to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Societe Generale is pursuing its commitment to energy transition, and is announcing that it will no longer finance the coal-fuelled power plants or related infrastructure anywhere in the world. This decision will take effect on 1 January 2017. This announcement reinforces the decision made in 2015 to stop project financing for the development of coal mines and coal-fuelled power plants in high-income OECD countries. These changes have been incorporated into the Group's sector policies on Mining and Coal-Fuelled Power Plants. The sector policies set out the framework governing the financial services Societe Generale offers in the business sectors in which it operates. The bank will also scale back its outstanding loans to the coal industry, with a goal of reducing the proportion of coal-fuelled share in power production financed by the bank to 19% by 2020, in line with the International Energy Agency's 2-degree scenario. The shift in the energy mix will also result from increased financing for renewable energies. Societe Generale is continuing to ramp up project financing in this sector. In 2015, it announced it was doubling project financing in the renewable energy sector, with a EUR10 billion of funding allocated to the renewable energy sector by 2020. In 2016 Societe Generale maintained its position among the world leaders in this area. For example, it was involved in 100% of offshore wind farm projects financed in Europe this year. Severin Cabannes, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Societe Generale said 'A year after the pledges we made for COP 21, these latest decisions mark a new step forward for the bank in favour of the climate. They reflect Societe Generale's commitment to responsible financing as a way of developing a low-carbon economy. With a long-standing and established presence in the energy sector, the bank intends to be a major financer of the energy transition and undertakes to support its clients in this necessary area.'

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK361","Rehabilitating drylands key to global food security according to new UN report","November 14, 2016 Monday","M2 PressWIRE","November 11, 2016 A new report released today by the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) reveals that drylands, which cover some 40 per cent of the earth's land surface, are critical in order to buffer the negative impacts of climate change, land degradation, and drought. ""Drylands are absolutely key to global food security for the whole planet,"" said IFAD President, Kanayo F. Nwanze in a press release on the report, which was launched today in Marrakech, Morocco, where the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP 22 , has been under way since Monday. ""Environment friendly and water efficient agriculture for smallholders is key to reducing poverty, boosting smallholder adaptation to climate change, and rehabilitating degraded lands. We look to empower more rural farmers to sustainably manage their land, so that while they feed their families for generations to come, they can also get out of poverty,"" he said. Drylands typically refer to arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. They are present on every continent and are home to more than two billion people. They support up to 44 per cent of the world's cultivated agricultural systems. The report, The Drylands Advantage: Protecting the environment, empowering people, explains how drylands support ecosystems and a wide variety of biodiversity as well as their vital role in the livelihoods and cultural identities of many people. In Swaziland, for example, IFAD has supported communities in rehabilitating gullied land and introducing sustainable land management practices for 68,000 hectares of land - thus generating a new source of livelihoods for the people who live there. In China's Yanchi county, where drylands are becoming deserts, farmers have increased their incomes by 20 per cent thanks to a programme which generates alternative and sustainable livelihoods. Without it, desertification would likely worsen and drylands would be non-arable. IFAD backs projects that both help smallholders thrive in drylands and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the 2030 Agenda - particularly to ""protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."" However, Margarita Astralaga, Director of IFAD's Environment and Climate Division, warns that ""despite their importance, drylands are being degraded with enormous economic consequences."" ""Desertification of drylands could lead to some 50 million people being displaced within the next 10 years,"" she said. But IFAD's investments are proving promising: ""By investing in drylands, IFAD is seeing significant human and environmental dividends. Environment-friendly and water-efficient agriculture for smallholders is key to reducing poverty, boosting smallholder adaptation to climate change, as well as rehabilitating degraded lands."" \"

The Green Climate Fund is allocating US$ 378 million to support green investments by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) under the Bank's Green Economy Transition (GET) approach aimed at reducing emissions and combatting climate change. This is the Fund's largest approval to date. The Green Climate Fund was created in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It allocates its resources to low-emission and climate-resilient projects and programmes in developing countries. The contribution to the EBRD will be made in support of sustainable energy financing facilities the Bank is offering in Armenia, Egypt, Georgia, Jordan, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Serbia, Tajikistan and Tunisia. These frameworks provide loans and technical assistance to partner financial institutions for on-lending to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and climate resilience projects in the industrial and residential sectors. The government of Korea has pledged an additional US$ 3 million for technical support associated with the programmes. The programmes, which will have an overall value of more than US$ 1.4 billion in the 10 countries, are expected to leverage a five-fold additional financing by participating private sector banks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 2 million tonnes a year. They are expected to finance over 20,000 sub-projects to create employment opportunities through vocational training and enhance financial institutions' capacity to provide financial products for investments in energy efficiency. The EBRD has been investing in sustainable energy efficiency facilities for 10 years as part of its Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative, the predecessor of the Green Economy Transition approach. Under GET the Bank aims to raise the volume of green financing up to 40 per cent of the Bank's annual business investments by 2020. Josue Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change, said: 'This is a massive endorsement and significant boost of our activities. We are honoured and humbled by the Green Climate Fund's very significant contribution and we can guarantee that we will make the best use of it for the benefit of the economy, the environment and the citizens of the countries where we will be able to roll out new frameworks.' The decision by the Green Climate Fund was made in the lead-up to the COP 22 negotiations in Marrakesh in November about the implementation of the Paris Accord last year in globally reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Multilateral donors such as the Green Climate Fund play a crucial role in achieving these targets.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK364","Orange and ENGIE pursue their Commitment to the Electrification of Rural Africa","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","FinancialWire","Orange ( HYPERLINK http://www.Orange.com ) and ENGIE ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ENGIE.com www.ENGIE.com ) have today launched a plan to deploy nearly 1,000 solar kits in Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon. Several villages in rural areas have been identified to participate in the first phase of this pilot program, prior to deployment on a larger scale. The kits include a solar panel connected to a battery that can be used to provide domestic appliances with electricity. They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralized source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones. This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment. ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via ""Orange Money"". The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. Access to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimize the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa. During the COP22 conference, Orange and ENGIE reaffirm their commitment to leveraging their technological expertise to stimulate sustainable progress and economic and social development on the African continent.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK365","EU gives green light to activate Paris climate deal; EU ministers are expected to ratify the agreement, along with India and Cananda, next week meaning enough c....","September 30, 2016 Friday 3:44 PM GMT","The Guardian","EU ministers have agreed to ratify the landmark Paris climate agreement at an extraordinary summit in Brussels on Friday, all but guaranteeing that it will pass a legal threshold to take effect next week and sparing the bloc's blushes in the process. The European Parliament is expected to rubber stamp the decision in Strasbourg next Tuesday, allowing the EU to sign off on it as soon as the following day. The EU's president, Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""Today, the EU's member states decided to make history together and bring closer the entry into force of the first ever universally binding climate change agreement. We must and we can hand over to future generations a world that is more stable, a healthier planet, fairer societies and more prosperous economies. ""This is not a dream. This is a reality and it is within our reach. Today we are closer to it."" The Paris pact to limit global warming to ""well below 2C"" will enter into force 30 days after 55 countries, accounting for 55% of the planet's emissions hand their ratification papers to the offices of Ban Ki-Moon in New York. India is expected to ratify the deal over the weekend, with Canada next week also likely to join the 61 countries that have so far signed up. The EU's added weight should then tip the treaty into effect. The EU's climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, said that Europe's reputation had been ""on the line"" in the run up to today's meeting. ""We are reaching a critical period for decisive climate action,"" he said, ""and when the going gets tough, Europe gets going."" With global CO2 concentrations permanently passing the 400ppm barrier this week and some climate scientists predicting that the Paris deal's preferred threshold of keeping temperature rises to 1.5C could be broken as soon as 2020, calls for a greater urgency in Brussels have increased of late. ""We cannot miss this opportunity,"" Gianni La Via, the European Parliament's rapporteur on the file, told the Guardian. ""A timely EU ratification decision would send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its member states."" The EU was a core member of the ""coalition for high ambition"" in Paris which pushed a deal through. Ratifying it now will at least allow the bloc speaking and voting rights at a key COP22 summit on its implementation at Marrakesh in November. EU sources say that 80 or 90 countries have still not ratified the Paris agreement but that a fear of being counted among them focused minds in Brussels. ""We would not have been isolated but in terms of our global leadership it would have been politically embarrassing if we had not been able to show unity at this stage,"" the official said. The speed of today's extraordinary council decision was hailed as ""truly remarkable"" by the Economic Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank which includes MPs, peers and climate scientists on its board. One spectre haunting the summit though was the prospect of a victory for the climate-sceptic Republican candidate, Donald Trump, in US elections later this year. EU sources say that the bloc would aim to stick to its climate commitments if that happened. One told the Guardian: ""It can't be indefinite but our initial reaction would be to try to lead others in anticipation that this was a temporary aberration in US politics and that common sense would prevail, whether in four years time or sooner."" Europe's own intentions have been clouded for some by resistance from coal-dependant Poland to any review of the EU's existing climate pledge in 2018. In the Paris deal, this is seen as an opportunity to scale up ambitions towards a 1.5C target. The EU has not proposed any new climate actions in line with a 1.5C goal, but new legislation on renewables and energy efficiency is expected later this year, to help meet Europe's existing climate pledges. Officials believe the measures could have ""unpredicted but positive impacts"", helping Europe to go even further than its promised 40% emissions cut for 2030. Today's discussions in Brussels were dominated by Polish demands for an effective veto over future climate decisions, such as reforms to the EU's emissions trading system or national emissions cutting targets. Some environmentalists are concerned at the lack of deadlines for the EU's 28 members to individually ratify the Paris deal, or peak their emissions. These are currently forecast to continue rising until 2030 in some countries. Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe complained of ""a certain level of hypocrisy"" in calls from Brussels for other countries to implement the Paris deal's tenets. ""We can no longer follow the myth that the EU is acting alone or that it is a leader,"" he said. ""This ratification process shows that the EU is actually running behind [other countries]. It is important for the EU to know that they need to adapt to this new era of climate action, get their act together and improve their climate policies rather than think they can continue on a business as usual trajectory."" Several EU countries have formaly signed off on the Paris deal to date, including France, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Portugal and Austria. Theresa May has promised to ratify the agreement by the end of this year. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK367","Brunei Darussalam prioritises renewable energy to confront climate change","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","Although its dominant oil and gas sector will likely remain at the forefront of economic growth over the medium term, Brunei Darussalam has prioritised sector diversification and development of renewable energy projects in recent years, as highlighted by the 2014 ""Energy White Paper"", as well as a climate change plan released prior to the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change , hosted in Paris in late 2015. These policies outline an ambitious long-term renewables development strategy emphasising solar projects, private sector participation, and a significant reduction of domestic oil and gas consumption, benefitting the Sultanate by freeing up more oil and gas for export and petrochemical production, in addition to reducing the impact of climate change, and providing new investment and employment opportunities in burgeoning future industries. Energy White Paper As outlined in the government's ""Energy White Paper"", published in 2014 and encapsulating a host of long-term energy sector targets - including boosting oil production, investing in overseas oil projects, reducing primary energy consumption and development of renewable resources - climate change represents a significant threat both to South-east Asia and the Sultanate. The report notes that hydrocarbons production has contributed to higher levels of CO emissions in the atmosphere, and that the consequences of this - severe drought, major floods and heatwaves - present a particular challenge for small island developing states. It further argues that international commitments to limit the global temperature rise to 2\'b0C at the end of the 21st century are technically feasible, and that the energy sector, which contributes two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, should take steps to reduce its environmental impact. IEA\~Guidelines\~ The paper also takes note of International Energy Agency (IEA) suggestions for measures necessary to reduce CO emissions, including energy efficiency policies, limiting the construction and use of inefficient coal-fired power plants, minimising methane emissions from upstream oil and gas production and phasing out subsidies on fossil fuels. The IEA recommends that countries improve the resiliency of energy systems to climate change - meaning development of renewable energy projects, as well as encouraging the private sector to consider climate risks and impact in their investment decisions. Fossil Fuels Vs Solar At present, 99% of Brunei Darussalam's power is generated by natural gas, which emits 4.2m tonnes of CO equivalent every year, according to a December 2015 report in Times . Oil and gas production, which accounts for over 60% of GDP, emits 3.3m tonnes of CO equivalent annually, and Brunei Darussalam's total CO emissions are an estimated 10m tonnes annually. The Tenaga Suria Brunei Photovoltaic Power Generation Demonstration Project (TSB Project) is Brunei Darussalam's sole large-scale renewable energy project. The plant is located at the former Seria Power Station, and was jointly developed by the local government and Mitsubishi Corporation. The TSB Project's photovoltaic (PV) system offers a nominal capacity of 1.2 MW, and is capable of generating 1.3 GWh of electricity annually, saving the Sultanate 340,000 litres of crude oil each year, and reducing CO emissions by 2.1m kg. Construction of the TSB Project began in August 2009, was completed in 2010 and the plant was officially inaugurated in 2011. Renewable Targets Having embraced the idea that mitigating climate change is an important policy consideration, the ""Energy White Paper"" sets a number of ambitious renewable energy targets, with the goal of reaching 124 GWh of renewable power generation by 2017, and 954 GWh by 2035. The paper also hopes to see Brunei Darussalam renewables provide 10% of total energy demand, and reduce energy intensity from a base of 390 tonnes of oil equivalent per $1m of GDP in 2005, to 215 tonnes by 2035, in addition to emphasising the government's leadership role in development of land for utility-scale solar projects, as well as new waste-to-energy projects. Private sector participation will be critical for these targets, as will smaller-scale, private renewable projects, with the Energy and Industry Department of the Prime Minister's Office announcing plans in September 2013 to introduce a feed-in-tariff system which will encourage investment in projects such as personal, commercial and government PV solar panel systems. Any excess power generated by these projects would be sold back to the national grid. The government has also pursued a $1bn loan with the Export-Import Bank of the US, which would be used in part to finance new energy, including renewable energy projects, while private sector interest in Brunei Darussalam's renewables sector appears to be growing. In March 2016 Taiwanese firm KD Holding told local media that the company is interested in forming a public-private partnership for a renewable energy project. The company has already developed PV solar and biofuel power plants in Taiwan, China and the US, although further details of its proposed Brunei Darussalam project were not made public. Paris Plan In November 2015, ahead of COP21, Brunei Darussalam's Ministry of Development submitted an Intended Nationally-Determined Contribution (INDC) climate change action plan to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, restating its ambitious plan to reduce energy consumption and bolster renewables development, in addition to new CO emissions reduction targets. The plan was developed in partnership with global environmental consultancy Ricardo Energy & Environment, and joined 150 other INDCs issued by countries representing 90% of global emissions. At COP21, hosted in Paris in December 2015, 195 countries including Brunei Darussalam adopted by consensus a global action plan which seeks to limit global warming to 2\'b0C or less, and which comes into force in 2020. Brunei Darussalam's INDC takes into account specific initiatives including the ""Energy White Paper"" and the Heart of Borneo rainforest conservation plan, a trilateral agreement signed with Malaysia and Indonesia in 2005 in which signatories agree to share responsibility for the remaining intact band of forest in the centre of the Borneo. Under the INDC, the country plans to reduce the rate of total energy consumption and emissions from morning peak-hour vehicle use by 63% and 40%, respectively, as previously stated in the ""Energy White Paper"". Brunei Darussalam also aims to increase the total area of forest reserves in the country to 55% of its total land area (from 41% in 2008), as well as increasing the share of renewable energy sources generating power to 10% by 2035. Conservation Progress Climate action and conservation efforts were a priority prior to COP21. Brunei Darussalam has taken pains to protect its rain-forest, and in addition to signing the Heart of Borneo agreement, the Sultanate has opened just 1 sq km of Ulu Temburong National Park to tourists out of a total area of 500 sq km. Although illegal logging of agar-wood trees remains a concern, the Sultanate's limited forest resources are harvested under stringent guidelines encapsulated under the Forestry Master Plan. Export of logs and timber is banned, according to a 2012 report by the European Forest Institute, with the Sultanate implementing a reduced-cut policy with a quota of 100,000 cu metres per year, of which sawn logs production accounts for just 15,000 cu metres. The Brunei Times reported in December 2015 that under the new INDC plan, logging activities will be restricted to an area of just 300 sq km, or 5.2% of the Sultanate's total land mass. Authorities are also making progress in reducing energy consumption - at the UN Climate Summit, hosted in New York City in 2014, His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah announced that Brunei Darussalam had already managed to reduce energy consumption by 13.9% in 2013 - although plenty of room for improvement and reform remains, particularly in transportation emissions and biofuels development. Challenges For example, Brunei Darussalam's plan to significantly reduce morning peak-hour vehicle emissions will require authorities to implement the Land Transport Master Plan, which outlines measures to limit the net increase in CO over 2012 to 67% in 2035, compared to a projected 178% under current circumstances. In January 2016 the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, of which Brunei Darussalam's National Energy Research Institute is a member (see analysis) published a report which noted Brunei Darussalam is the only ASEAN country that does not currently have a target to incorporate biofuels into the transportation sector, in contrast to neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, which aims to replace at least 5% of diesel with biodiesel by 2030, and Thailand, which aims to replace 12.2% of transportation energy with biofuel. \"

This is the main converging point of the African Francophone MPs gathered in Bamako. The parliamentarians also advocated for a mastery of the stake of the Conference of the Parties 21 [COP 21] by facilitating Africans' access to financial compensations. Alhouseini Toure has more details on the second day of the works. [Toure] The 24th Francophone Assembly of Africa Region closed on a hopeful note; notably the hope to see the African Francophone states adopt a substantial legislation on social media control. It is a double-edged sword that Communication Minister Choguel Kokala Maiga described before the parliamentarians. [Maiga] The use of social media, as all the other forms of liberty, includes the concept of responsibility that cannot go without duty. We have therefore established a link between the three concepts and indicated that we can currently not imagine the world without social media that are an essential element for democratic expression for the citizens and the governments. The same medium is used to inform the citizens, it can also be used to disseminate bad news, false news, to cause discord, rebellion and even destabilize the institutions and states. [Toure] From Burkina-Faso to Niger via Cote d'Ivoire, Morocco, Senegal, Burundi, the DRC, Cameroon, all have denounced the side-effects of social media while recognizing its advantages for the users. [Youssef Gharbi, Moroccan MP] What we should do is to pass laws that give people liberty to access information which is sacred, and also make the comment they want. So if we find this balance I think that we start moving in the right direction. [Khady Mane, Senegalese MP] We should draw the attention of the administration and MPs on how to find an improved solution, and arrest the criminals. [Toure] The same goes for the COP 22 that should be hosted by Morocco very soon. The Africans want to take the opportunity to express all their concerns. Another not less important concern was terrorism, this scourge that ignores the borders. The 24th Assembly was a full success that was praised by the various speakers. [Issiaka Sidibe, national assembly speaker] I welcome the quality debates made possible through the expertise of the conference speakers and the participants who are all highly educated. I also note that we are henceforth better informed on the issues debated and mostly on the strategic and international interests that they carry. After this 254th meeting, I hope that each one will feel strongly warned on his role and responsibilities regarding the concerns that we have raised. [Toure] The issue relating to the designation of the host country for the 25th Assembly has not been resolved during this meeting. Source: ORTM TV, Bamako, in French 2000 gmt 27 May 16 \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK369","Millennials put ESG on par with returns","December 13, 2016","Investment Adviser","Sustainable investing has become a more mainstream issue for many investors, particularly millennials, in the wake of the landmark agreement at the UN Climate Change conference COP21 in Paris last year, solidified at COP22 in Marrakech last month. Schroders Global Investor Study 2016 shows the millennial generation ranked environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors equally as important as investment outcomes when considering investment decisions, with 91 per cent of millennials more likely to stay invested in a positive ESG investment for longer than usual compared to those aged over 36. Jessica Ground, global head of responsible investing at Schroders, says: Investor interest in ESG issues looks set to grow given its prevalence among millennials. While returns are still the main issue, ESG s importance to end investors means these factors are too big for any adviser to ignore. It is important investors recognise the value of being invested for the long term and this is especially relevant when considering ESG factors. With growing demand for these types of investments, it is unsurprising that more tools are being developed to help advisers and their clients choose the right investment. <strong>Expert views</strong> <strong>Reginald Stanley, president and chief executive at ImpactUs, adds</strong>: There are so many financial advisers whose clients are interested in impact investing, but getting started can be overwhelming. Identifying and sourcing products, keeping abreast of the status of each holding, and integrating with client reporting has long been a challenge. Fortunately, new developments in technology and the emerging infrastructure around impact investing have given the industry an opportunity for scaled growth for mission-driven institutions, advisers and their clients. These include the Morningstar Sustainability ratings, launched in January 2016, while MSCI expanded its ESG research into the mutual and exchange-traded fund spaces with its MSCI ESG Fund Metrics, which rolled out from March this year. The Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings shows there are 605 products globally that provide indices, ratings or rankings using ESG factors. Jon Hale, director, sustainability research at Morningstar, says: Increasingly, investors are looking for insight into the sustainability performance of companies because it makes sense to consider these factors from a material, financial standpoint. Many investors also want to align their portfolios with their preference for companies that treat the environment and their workers well, produce safe and useful products, and govern themselves with transparency and a long-term view. We created the Morningstar Sustainability Rating because of this rapid growth of interest in sustainable investing and because investors needed a tool to help them evaluate, select and monitor funds. Many of the world s largest companies now explicitly consider sustainability as part of their long-term business strategies and a growing body of research suggests correlations between better company ESG performance and higher quality management, higher growth and lower cost of capital. We also have evidence that sustainable investing can deliver good investment performance. The term sustainability, however, can cover a broad range of issues, and the different approaches that investors can have means not everyone agrees with the methodologies of the tools currently available. Meg Brown, director at Impax Asset Management, notes: We welcome any new developments that take account of ESG metrics and raise awareness of these issues with investors. However, it is critical new methodologies are comprehensive to give investors a meaningful picture. The ESG ratings by some of the leading agencies are a step in the right direction but they fall short of providing investors with an optimum methodology with which to assess the true sustainability criteria of their funds. Their approach is oversimplified and has not created a level playing field. It appears to favour a best in class approach with its significant reliance on negative screening but totally overlooks positive inclusion criteria. Sustainability opportunities do not receive enough weight with this one size fits all approach. Lewis Grant, senior portfolio manager, global equities, Hermes Investment Management, points out the team has been working on including data on ESG factors for a number of years, highlighting back in 2008 it was pretty much impossible to do, there was nothing that had comprehensive coverage or history . He adds: It wasn t until 2012-13 that we felt we had sufficient data from commercial providers to produce a score. Even then what we found was there was no one provider that had all the answers. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses. We tend to combine data from lots of different providers. <strong>\£3678m </strong>- Net retail sales of ethical funds in IA sectors for the 10 months to end October 2016 <strong>63%</strong> - Percentage of the UK public that support the idea of a kitemark for sustainable products <strong>\£31.5trn</strong> - The size of the sustainable market in the UK, according to UKSIF <strong>63%</strong> - Percentage of millennials who are unaware sustainable and ethical financial products exist <strong>46%</strong> - Percentage of under-35s who want a fossil-free option for their savings or investments <strong>1971</strong> - Launch of Pax World, the first US mutual fund that described itself as socially responsible One of the things a lot of commercial providers, indices and tools haven t captured as much is companies that are trying to get better, with management that are starting to appreciate ESG issues. Mr Grant continues: The methodology isn t perfect, but people will always be trying to improve the way it s done and provide more transparency to investors. Once we can get beyond a single rating that says a fund is good or bad and give investors more granularity on why a fund is good or bad that will be fantastic for everyone. <strong>Nyree Stewart is features editor at Investment Adviser</strong> \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK370","EU Commission's winter package gets lukewarm response","December 2, 2016 Friday 10:49 AM GMT","Parliament Magazine (Online)","Campaigners and industry representatives have given a mixed response to the Commission'swinter package | Photo credit: Fotolia The 1,000-page so-called 'jumbo' package contains no less than eight different legislative proposals, including revisions of two EU energy directives. With the main aim being to overhaul the EU energy market, the package has been described as ""one of the most significant legislative proposals in years."" Elements of the strategy recognise the role of increased efficiency and renewable energy in creating jobs, cutting energy use and tackling climate change. RELATED CONTENT Campaigners unimpressed with Commission's winter energy package EU-Ukraine agree to strengthen energy partnership Much still to do following COP22 , says Ca\'f1ete The package specifically includes a binding energy efficiency target of 30 per cent by 2030 and a focus on what is called ""community-owned and managed"" renewable energy. Campaigners say that if ""community energy"" - the right to store and sell energy - is allowed to fulfil its potential, over half of European citizens could be producing their own renewable energy by 2050. The new strategy sets out common rules for ""better integrating"" the EU's disparate energy markets in order to combine the growing share of renewables into the power mix, as well as empower consumers and increase energy efficiency. It also contains limits for standby power ""capacity mechanisms"" and there are plans for more biofuels in transport fuels from 2021. The winter package, which aims to complete the EU's so- called energy union, will now go to Parliament and Council for final approval, a process that could take up to two years. One of the first MEPs to react, the EPP group's Krisjanis Karins, ""In Europe, we have high energy prices which hurt our businesses and competitiveness. ""Removing existing barriers and market distortions in the electricity market to increase competition will get the best deal for our consumers."" Karins supports ""important"" new proposals on energy market design - notably the directive on electricity - included in the package. ""Europe needs jobs and growth. For the industry to invest and create new jobs, it needs certainty. Therefore we need clear rules and vision on how the energy market will look in the future"", he said. Another EPP group deputy, Peter Liese, welcomed the Commission's priority on energy efficiency, saying, ""Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""The increased target of 30 per cent will help us achieve our commitments under the Paris agreement. Moreover, energy efficiency initiatives will create a lot of jobs. ""I welcome the balanced approach on ecodesign. It is fully in line with EPP priorities."" Reacting to the news on Wednesday, campaigners immediately called on MEPs and member states to strengthen the package. This is necessary, they said, ""if Europe is serious about tackling climate change and making European climate policy work for people."" Friends of the Earth Europe, in a statement, said the package ""fails to tackle the over-supply of energy or address the urgent need to cut fossil fuel extraction and consumption."" The group said the package was ""insufficient and out of step with the Paris agreement."" Molly Walsh, community power campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe said, ""Seeing citizens placed at the heart of the energy transition is a beacon of hope among an otherwise gloomy, fossil-fuel-heavy package. ""The Commission has recognised the benefits of community-owned renewables and cooperatives, but is failing to kick its fossil fuel addiction, at the expense of the climate, and the Paris agreement."" Her colleague, Brook Riley, the group's climate and energy campaigner, said: ""The Commission's decision to increase the 2030 energy efficiency target will lift millions of people out of energy poverty, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and create jobs - but why stop at 30 per cent? ""It's disappointing that the Commission is so clear on the benefits of efficiency yet fails to come forward with proposals that meet its full potential."" The group was among those who wanted the target to be increased to 40 per cent. Further criticism of the Commission came from Roland Joebstl, climate and energy policy officer with the European Environmental Bureau, who said, ""By proposing a mere 27 per cent goal for renewables by 2030, the Commission is proposing to slash their roll out by half the current rate in the next decade, at a time when the rest of the world is picking up speed. ""Worse still, no effective measures are proposed to ensure that the bio-energy part of the energy mix is sustainable."" However, the European Solar Thermal Industry Federation said it ""warmly welcomes the unprecedented focus"" on renewable heating in the renewable energy directive which, it says, will boost deployment of renewable heating technologies such as solar thermal. The Federation added, ""To be effective enough, this obligation scheme on heat suppliers must be carefully implemented by member states so that it really promotes renewable heating technologies such as solar thermal."" Elsewhere, Oliver Rapf, executive director of the Buildings Performance Institute Europe, said that renovation of buildings across Europe could cut energy consumption by well over a third by 2030, reduce import dependency, tackle fuel poverty and create jobs. ""The winter package should create more transparency around the energy performance of buildings and related indicators such as comfort and wellbeing, provide access to fair and effective financing, and support the transformation of the building stock to become highly efficient, smart and decarbonised,"" he said. More comment came from Jean-Marc Jossart, Secretary General of the European Biomass Association, who was critical of EU's ""general lack of ambition."" He called the package ""a missed opportunity"" to develop different renewable sources of energy, including those capable of decarbonising the heating and cooling sector. However, Paolo Falcioni, the director-general of home appliance industry association CECED said he was happy that the European Commission had considered consumers in its energy policy plans and welcomed the 30 per cent energy efficiency target as an encouraging sign for the sector. ""[The 30 per cent binding energy efficiency target] gives our sector the certainty that it needs to keep investing in innovative energy efficient but also smart technologies that will benefit all EU consumers"". \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK371","This is not normal - climate researchers take to the streets to protect science; Scientists stepped outside their comfort zones to protest the attacks they face....","December 16, 2016 Friday 11:00 AM GMT","The Guardian","Desperate times call for desperate measures, and for scientists, these are desperate measures. Tuesday in San Francisco's Jessie Square, approximately 500 people gathered for a ' rally to stand up for science.' Many of the attendees were scientists who had migrated to the rally from the nearby Moscone Center, where some 26,000 Earth scientists are attending the annual American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference this week. This was an unusual activity for scientists to participate in; after all, they're often accused of remaining isolated in the ivory towers of academia. Scientists generally prefer to focus on their scientific research, use their findings to inform the public and policymakers, and leave it to us to decide what actions we should take in response. In fact, one of the keynote speakers at the rally, Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes made that exact point: We don't want to be here. We want to be doing the work we were trained and educated to do, which is science... but we are at a moment in history where we have to stand up. As Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb noted, with the appointments made thus far by the incoming Trump administration, science is under attack and scientists feel compelled to protect their research, and their ability to keep doing it. Cobb also called on more of her scientific colleagues to step outside their comfort zones and engage in activism: The rally followed other recent efforts by scientists to advise the Trump administration and reassure the public. For example, over 800 Earth scientists and energy experts signed a letter urging the President-elect to take six key steps to address climate change: 1) Make America a clean energy leader; 2) Reduce carbon pollution and America's dependence on fossil fuels; 3) Enhance America's climate preparedness and resilience; 4) Publicly acknowledge that climate change is a real, human-caused, and urgent threat; 5) Protect scientific integrity in policymaking; and 6) Uphold America's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. Over 11,000 women scientists also signed a pledge committing ""to build a more inclusive society and scientific enterprise."" The leaders of 29 scientific societies signed a letter encouraging Trump to appoint a ""nationally respected"" science advisor with sufficient expertise. And more than 2,300 scientists, including 22 Nobel Prize recipients, published an open letter with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) urging the Trump administration and Congress to set a high bar for integrity, transparency, and independence in using science to inform federal policies. UCS plans to act as a watchdog protecting science and scientists during the Trump Administration, as it did during the Bush administration. Scientists under attack, win the first battle These scientists have been motivated by concern stemming from President-elect Trump's decision to fill the key powerful positions in his administration with an oil industry dream team of climate deniers. Some of those selections include individuals who have harassed and intimidated climate scientists, like David Schnare and Chris Horner, whose tactics forced the creation of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF) five years ago. The CSLDF began in an effort to assist Michael Mann with the legal attacks documented in his book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars (Mann also has an excellent new book co-authored with cartoonist Tom Toles, The Madhouse Effect ). Over the past five years, CSLDF has provided legal assistance to over 100 scientists, and has helped coordinate counsel for approximately 20 scientists facing litigation. The Legal Defense Fund has had a significant presence at the AGU conference, assuring scientists that their organization can answer basic legal questions, or help with potentially costly legal attacks and litigation. Adding to scientists' alarm, the Trump Department of Energy transition team submitted a questionnaire that raised serious concerns about the incoming administration's plans to influence or curtail DOE's research, potentially engage in a witch-hunt, and perhaps even tamper with or destroy scientific data. After much public and media backlash, the Trump team now denies that the questionnaire was authorized. This retreat was the first victory for science in an impending battle with the incoming administration. Scientists also have any ally in California Governor Jerry Brown, who spoke at the AGU conference and promised : If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellite. We've failed to hold up our end of the bargain On the issue of climate change, it's been decades since scientific research first identified the threats and dangers resulting from human-caused global warming. A growing number of climate scientists had already begun to speak out about the need for much more aggressive global efforts to cut carbon pollution if we're to avoid its worst impacts. Finally, nearly all of the world's countries signed last year's agreement in Paris, creating a framework to limit global warming below the dangerous level of 2\'b0C hotter than pre-industrial temperatures. Less than a year later, the world's largest cumulative carbon polluter elected a president who promised to do what he can to reverse that landmark Paris agreement. Trump's 100-day action plan for energy #climate# cop22 ""cancel Paris Climate Agreement"" and stop payments ""to U.N. global warming programs."" pic.twitter.com/p0BvVXzyrf - Graham Readfearn (@readfearn) November 9, 2016 Though he has since claimed he will keep an ""open mind"" about climate change and the Paris agreement, at every opportunity Trump has hired individuals who deny climate science, work for the oil industry, and/or have spent years harassing and attacking climate scientists. As author Robert Fulghum once wrote : It doesn't matter what you say you believe - it only matters what you do. Scientists have reached a breaking point In the AGU conference, many scientists have voiced their grave concerns about these events, about the relevance of science in a post-truth world, and about the attacks they seem to be facing from the incoming government. Scientists have expressed emotions ranging from bewilderment and fear, to the defiance exemplified in their rally. In order to protect science, more such defiance will likely be needed, and scientists will also need public support to help protect their critically important research. \"

""Water is one of the most impacted resources, but water also provides solutions to these challenges,"" stressed the President of the World Water Council, Benedito Braga, who said today in a news release issued by the meeting, formally known as the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Water is critical for successful climate change mitigation, as many efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depend on reliable access to water resources. The Action Day for Water is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, an initiative of France and Morocco to boost cooperation between governments, cities, companies, investors and citizens on climate change. In an interview with the UN News Centre, Hakima El Haite, the Minister in charge of Environment of Morocco and one of the 'Climate Champions' tasked with carrying forward the Agenda, stressed the importance to include water in the discussions on climate change. ""Water and climate [are] linked. At school, all of us studied the water cycle,"" she said. ""Water connects everything. To produce energy, some countries have 97 per cent renewable energy from water. So it affects everything. It is crucial for human development, it is crucial for education, it is crucial for health, it is crucial for stability and food security."" Ms. El Haite noted that the water community would like to be included in the discussions. She stressed that she and her fellow Climate Champion, Laurence Tubiana, the French Ambassador on climate change, would work to facilitate the dialogue between the [UNFCCC] parties and water stakeholders. Wednesday, the Moroccan Government and its partners launched a Blue Book on Water and Climate, which includes recommendations by the international water community.

The map is based on a collection and analysis of land-use information in Africa's drylands in order to improve resilience to climate change. ""The Great Green Wall initiative is Africa's flagship programme to combat the effects of climate change and desertification,"" said Eduardo Mansur, Director of the FAO's Land and Water Division, as he presented the map yesterday during a high-level event at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). During the event, held at the African Union Pavilion on the theme 'Resilient Landscapes in Africa's Drylands: Seizing Opportunities and Deepening Commitments,' Mr. Mansur explained that so far, the Great Green Wall initiative has shown that degraded lands can be restored, but ""these achievements pale in comparison with what is needed."" According to Mr. Mansur, the tools used to create the map are vital in providing critical information to understand the true nature of restoration needs throughout drylands in North Africa, the Sahel region, and the Horn of Africa. Through the Global Drylands Assessment, a study conducted by FAO and its partners from 2015-2016, an estimated 166 million hectares of the Great Green Wall area offer opportunities for restoration projects. The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative supports local communities in the sustainable management of drylands. Photo: FAO/Giulio Napolitano The Great Green Wall covers both arid and semi-arid areas in the north and south ends of the Sahara Desert. Its core area consists of 780 million hectares and is home to 232 million people. In order to halt and reverse land degradation, some 10 million hectares must be restored each year. Such an achievement would provide critical support to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In order to obtain the data, experts behind the project analyzed 63,000 half-hectare sample plots spread across drylands in North Africa, Sahel, and the Horn using FAO's Open Foris Collect Earth tool and extremely high resolution satellite images from Google Earth Engine and Bing Maps. A variety of restoration approaches are possible and necessary in order to implement the Great Green Wall initiative. These include natural regeneration that allows farmers to protect and manage the natural regeneration of forests, croplands and grasslands; large-scale land preparation and enrichment planning, especially in areas where degradation is severe; mobilization of high-quality seeds and planting materials; and involving communities in the selection of native species to be used. In areas closer to the desert, sustainable management of oases systems and use of native woody and grassy vegetation can help fight sand encroachment. The data collection is a collaborative effort on behalf of FAO, the African Union, the CILSS/AGRHYMET Regional Centre, the Directorate General of Forests in Tunisia, Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia, Google, and the World Resources Institute.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK380","Morocco government mulls response to criticism of waste disposal deal with Italy","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political ","Text of report by Ahmed Larqam entitled ""Upheaval at government council over Italian waste"", published on Moroccan privately-owned newspaper Assabah website on 4 July A scandal has shaken the foundations of the Abdelilah Benkirane government as the end of its mandate is drawing nearer. The scandal has an international dimension and is related to the climate. It is about the shipping of Italian toxic waste and it coincides with the approaching international Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech. Assabah sources said that a restricted government council meeting will be held today Monday [4 July] under Benkirane's chairmanship and the participation of Salaheddine Mezouar, minister of foreign affairs and cooperation; Hakima El Haiti, minister [delegate to the minister of energy, mines, water and the environment, in charge of] for the environment; Charafet Afilal, minister [delegate to the minister of energy, mines, water and the environment, in charge of] for water, as well as major public institutions and cement companies officials, to discuss ways of responding to the resounding scandal about Italy's getting rid of its waste by shipping it to Morocco despite the danger it represents to human health and the environment. The sources stressed that the ministers had been very embarrassed by the extent of civil society objection to the hazardous waste, and, in order to avoid any escalation on their part or that of political parties, they had decided to hold a restricted council meeting to respond to the accusations made by civil society associations against the government. The sources added that the political parties had asked their parliamentary groups to ask questions in parliament tomorrow Tuesday [5 July] to embarrass the government over this case, and if they did not get answers then they would be speaking at the end of the government meeting to prompt the government to give more details about this type of agreement on importing toxic waste. In this context, the Moroccan coalition for climate justice has asked for details of the deal that has provoked protests, related to the import of waste from Italy, accusing the government of violating Article 31 of the Constitution that guarantees life in a sound environment. The coalition also called for the publication of the partnership agreement concluded between the Ministry for Environment and the professional association of cement manufacturers in order to assess its implementation and its compliance with the law no. 28-00, as well as with the international Basel convention on trans-border waste movement. The activists of this national coalition also called for the publication of the information given by Italy during the announcement of the shipping of waste, as provided by the Basel convention that in fact recommends that hazardous waste should be eliminated in the country where it is produced through a reasonable, efficient ecological management. Similarly, the Moroccan coalition for climate justice called for the publication of the import permits granted by the authorities concerned, as well as the results of the tests and controls carried out by the ad-hoc bodies concerning the compliance with transparency standards by locations and enterprises where waste is managed, incinerated or used. The extent of the compliance by the concerned enterprises with the rules and measures related to the protection of the climate and people's health should be made public, says the coalition.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK381","Morocco works to solve agricultural challenges posed by a constrained water supply","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","The water supply in Morocco is coming under increased strain as consumption rises on the back of demographic growth, urbanisation, an expanding industrial and agricultural sector, and climate change. These factors could lead to the potential depletion of an estimated 80% of the country's extant water resources over the next 25 years, according to the World Resources Institute, which in 2015 ranked Morocco in 19th place out of the 33 countries threatened by water scarcity by 2040. In 2014 the country's water resources stood at 22bn cu metres, equivalent to under 500 cu metres per inhabitant and down from 2500 cu metres in 1960 - well below the 1000-cu-metre minimum threshold recommended by the UN. With demand expected to rise even further, from 14.5bn cu metres in 2010 to reach 25.5bn cu metres by 2030, the issue is becoming more urgent and is expected to feature prominently during the UN Conference on Climate Change to be held in Marrakech in November 2016. Expanding Irrigation With agriculture swallowing up a significant share of the country's water, the government, under the Green Morocco Plan (Plan Maroc Vert, PMV), instituted a 10-year development project entitled the National Irrigation Water Saving Programme (Programme National d'Economie et de Valorisation de l'Eau en Irrigation, PNEEI), with the view of equipping 550,000 ha with modern drip irrigation systems by 2020 and saving up to 1.4bn cu metres of water per year. By the end of 2015 the irrigation system had already been extended to 460,000 ha of land. The impact this has had on output is clear - irrigated agriculture has come to account for 45% of the sector's value added and 75% of exported agricultural goods, according to data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Minist\'e8re de l'Agriculture et de la P\'eache Maritime, MAPM). This can in large part be attributed to significant efforts and resources mobilised under the PMV to disseminate the practice and promote water efficiency. For instance, under the PNEEI, the government subsidises 100% of the cost of equipment for farmers operating on lands of five ha and under and 80% for those operating on farms exceeding five ha. Resources to support irrigation have been primarily mobilised by the Agricultural Development Fund, which allocates an estimated 40% of its budget to developing the irrigation system. Between 2008 and 2015, it mobilised Dh20bn ((EURO)1.8bn) in public funding. A number of direct foreign investment projects are also helping improve the situation. In July 2015 the World Bank approved a scheme worth $150m to improve access to water in the Doukkala, Gharb, Haouz and Tadla regions. The project's goal is to ensure uninterrupted access to irrigation water for farmers, enabling the improved management of resources and boosting productivity. Pressure Ahead Irrigation, however, is likely to meet with increased pressure as the mismatch between demand and supply, exacerbated by climate change and sporadic rainfall, increases. While the network of modern irrigation systems has been significantly expanded since the launch of the PMV, irrigated areas still only account for 15% of agricultural land, according to the MAPM and demand for water within these same areas is expected to increase by 7% to 12% in the coming years due to rising temperatures and, as a result, increased evapotranspiration. However, while irrigated goods now provide the majority of the sector's revenues and exports, the bulk of agricultural activity - driven in large part by smallhold farmers - is reliant on rain-fed agriculture, which continues to occupy 85% of agricultural land and employ up to 80% of the rural population. The impact of this can be seen in the drought of November 2015 through to February 2016, one of the worst episodes the country has experienced over the past 30 years, with rainfall in 2015/16 down 42.7% from its annual average. While spring rains have since picked up, cereal production - which is heavily reliant on rainfall - is expected to drop by 70% for the 2015/16 cycle compared to a year earlier. Broadly speaking, cereals and legumes were the hardest hit by the latest episode of drought. Areas supplied by dams were less exposed thanks to accumulated rainfall from previous years, filling, for instance, 80% of reservoirs in 2014/15. Through a project to extend irrigated surfaces using dam water, Morocco aims to expand water access to another 160,000 ha of land. Today, the country has 139 dams with a combined capacity of 17.6bn cu metres. Desalination\~ Morocco is also exploring alternative solutions to secure its water resources in the long term. Desalination is one project in the making with a number of plants under development. The first, located in the Chtouka Ait Baha region, represents an investment of Dh2.5bn ((EURO)229.2m). Famous for its fruit and vegetable production, the region is increasingly struggling to meet its needs for irrigation water. The new plant, which is being developed as a public-private partnership (PPP), will see the government, in collaboration with the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, finance up to Dh1.45bn ((EURO)132.9m) of the cost. Due to come on-line in 2018, the plant will irrigate 13,600 ha and produce 167,000 cu metres of desalinated seawater, daily. Another desalination plant is expected for delivery by 2020 in Dakhla, which is also grappling with depleting water resources to meet the needs of its extensive fruit and vegetable plantations, The plant, with the capacity to irrigate 5000 ha, is essentially intended to supply the local farmers of the region, and is expected to generate value added of up to Dh500m ((EURO)45.8m) per annum and create 10,000 jobs. Necessitating up to Dh1.3bn ((EURO)119.2m) in investment, it will be carried out as a PPP, with a call for expressions of interest to be launched in 2016. The plant will produce 100,000 cu metres per day and operate using the electricity generated by the Ouarzazate solar power station. Water Treatment Another alternative being explored by the authorities is water treatment, although development is still in the early stages. The number of facilities relying on this practice currently stands at 18, swallowing up 38m cu metres, or 8% of used water, per year. Almost 70% of this resource, however, is used on golf courses, while agriculture accounts for 13% and industry 16%. A new plan is currently being drafted with the aim of bringing the volume of recycled water to 325m cu metres by 2030. Adapting To Climate Change\~ While water security figures largely in the government's long-term strategy and its sustainable efforts to boost access to the resource, it is also highly contingent on the country's plans to adapt to climate change. Morocco has certainly taken some key steps in its response to climate change. It was one of the first signatories of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in 1996 and was also one of the first to sign the latest Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April 2016. Other achievements to mitigate climate change and shift to more sustainable development include the elimination, in 2012, of fossil fuel subsidies in favour of more green energy (see Energy chapter). This is in line with Morocco's ambitions - as an energy import-dependent country - to meet 42% of its energy needs through renewables by 2020. Research Morocco has also been making strides on the research front, led primarily by the country's National Institute of Agricultural Research (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, INRA). To improve irrigation practices and promote water efficiency, INRA has carried out extensive research to develop rain-fed agriculture and practices related to the preservation of water and soil. In semi-arid and arid areas, for instance, it has developed direct seeding technology, a practice that is increasingly gaining traction, according to Rachid Dahan, secretary-general of INRA. ""We have even engaged in a PPP to increase the number of no-till seed drills dedicated to this practice, making them available to farmers at reasonable prices,"" he told OBG. On the other hand, work is being carried out to develop seeds tailored to different types of soil and climates. ""We have developed chick-pea varieties, for example, which can be sown during winter, resist cold weather and diseases, and prove more productive than the usual spring-produced variety,"" Dahan told OBG. These efforts have earned the country support from various international development organisations. In March 2016 the Agency for Agricultural Development was granted access to the UN's $10.2bn Green Climate Fund. Projects approved by the agency are eligible for up to $50m in funding. In addition, in June 2016 Morocco signed an agreement with the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation for support in developing climate change projects. \"
"COP22","UK","COP22_UK382","-WB-How to Make the Tourism Sector More Climate Resilient","June 2, 2016 Thursday","ENP Newswire","The Mediterranean Basin, a cradle of civilization and top international tourism destination, attracts around 200 million visitors every year. This influx combined with climate change is posing a growing threat to the fragile ecosystems and natural resources on both sides of the Mediterranean. The World Bank is organizing a regional conference on 'Regional Development and Tourism Transition in a Changing Climate in the Mediterranean' to discuss this issue in the lead-up to the 22nd Conference of the Parties on climate change ( COP 22 ). The conference will be held in Marrakech on June 1 and 2, 2016 in association with the Hassan II Academy of Science and Technology and a number of Moroccan universities and Mediterranean and international research centers. Recent climate change studies report that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has been hard hit by the effects of climate change and will face a growing climate threat if nothing is done to make the region more climate resilient. These studies warn that the price of inaction will be high with a 10% reduction in the supply of running water by 2050 combined with increasing recurrent droughts and a surge in temperatures. The Maghreb countries, with their particularly tourism-dependent economies and especially acute water shortages in the summer, call for more sustainable, rational water resource management to guarantee a constant supply in tourism destinations, especially in the high season. In the face of this alarming situation, tourism sector experts and climate change scientists from both sides of the Mediterranean are meeting today to consider how to make sector policymaking more climate smart. As Taoufiq Bennouna, World Bank Senior Environment Specialist, puts it, 'We are seeing a huge gap between the knowledge acquired on climate change and its use in public policies and decision-making. This conference aims to raise stakeholder awareness to mainstream climate change into regional development policies and make this sector a driver for virtuous development that will reduce the pressure on natural resources and form a real source of income for the populations and economies.' The conference will also explore the role of climate finance in setting up ecotourism projects, especially in remote areas with the natural capital to be able to generate green jobs. It will seek to pinpoint the main climate and environmental constraints on tourism destinations in the MENA region and identify the possibilities for sustainable finance. In Morocco, which aims to attract up to 20 million tourists by 2020, the sector's development policies are increasingly responsive to climate change constraints, especially in their water management. Morocco will be well placed at the conference to share its experience and success stories in this area, especially with the Qariati program to promote responsible rural tourism. As Marie Francoise Marie-Nelly, World Bank Country Director for the Maghreb and Malta, concludes, 'Climate change is a growing threat that could eventually damage the Mediterranean Basin countries' economies, and the tourism sector is just one example of this. So there is an urgent need for a wake-up call and especially for climate change to be mainstreamed into the Basin countries' regional development and decentralization strategies.'

The second in line to the throne reflects that, ""There is something very calming and warm about his programmes. There is something very reassuring about seeing David Attenborough on BBC1 doing his documentaries. It is part of the national psyche now. ""He's a national treasure, and it is very fitting that he is having his 90th birthday only a few weeks after the Queen. They are two incredible national treasures who have done so much over the years."" The (male, non-regal) national treasure is sitting across the table from me in a smart hotel room in Richmond overlooking the Thames. So I ask him how he feels about the title with which he is habitually labelled. ""What does 'national treasure' mean?"" he replies, with a twinkle in his eye. ""Nothing, except that people are favourably disposed towards you. You're not being elected. You haven't got the power to become prime minister. The problem is that you are credited with more wisdom and apprehension than is the case - which is quite easy actually. People think you know everything, but of course you don't. It's a TV image and a very one-dimensional image at that. You certainly don't get more money for being a national treasure. There is no national treasure premium."" A pause, before he bursts into infectious laughter. ""It's a national scandal!"" They say you should never meet your heroes, but I'm delighted to have met this one. In person, Attenborough is exactly the way you'd hope he would be: charismatic, compelling and charming. Eruptions of jollity such as the one above punctuate our hour together. At one point, he reflects on the fact that both he and the Queen are 90 this year. ""Have we exchanged notes about geriatric moments? No."" Attenborough is rare in the world of television in that he actually seems interested in what other people are saying. He leans forward and listens, intently yet politely, to your thoughts. He is as much a receiver as a transmitter, and that is what makes him such a superb communicator. As Attenborough reaches this great age, he is clearly still fired up by the same tremendous curiosity that has powered his career for the last seven decades. He possesses a contagious lust for life that shames people 40 years younger. Attenborough is reckoned to have travelled further than any other human being apart from astronauts, and yet his trademark passion shows no sign of waning. What is most appealing is that even after such a stellar career, he does not take anything for granted. He continues to be commendably modest and grateful for all the opportunities he is offered. Attenborough, who in 2006 was voted the Greatest Living British Icon by viewers of BBC2''s The Culture Show, observes that, ""I can think of an awful lot of my own contemporaries who got into jobs where after 10 or 20 years, they were thinking, 'I've had enough of this'. But they're stuck with it because it's what their career is and they have a pension. They're counting the years off till they get to 65, and then they do nothing but play golf."" By contrast, he continues, ""I'm fantastically lucky. I think, 'Oh, I'll go to the Amazon next year - why not?' I'm more grateful than I can say that people still want me to do things."" Some 62 years after presenting his first natural history programme, Zoo Quest, Attenborough's documentaries continue to inspire successive generations. His fans include Prince William (see above), President Obama, who last year invited the presenter to the White House to interview Attenborough about the future of the planet and Australian rugby star David Pocock, who used to unwind between matches at last year's World Cup by watching Attenborough documentaries. That is because he has never lost his magnetic sense of wonder about the natural world. ""Experience has taught me how amazingly big and unpredictable the natural world is. When you're young, you think you know it all about the natural world - 'Yawn, yawn, everyone knows about that'. ""But in fact we only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. Wherever you look, there are still things we don't know about and don't understand, as recent discoveries about, say, the behaviours of pufferfish and peacock spiders prove. There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. They will last me out."" The presenter responsible for nine seasons of the landmark Life series still believes in the power of television to educate, inform and entertain. ""Our job as natural history filmmakers is to show that the natural world is unbelievably amazing. The world is unimaginably varied - quite beyond our comprehension. ""But the paradox is that according to the UN over half of the human race is now urbanised. We're out of touch with nature in a way that my great great grandfather, who was working in the fields, never was. And yet now the population know more about animals and how varied they are and why they do what they do than my great great grandfather ever did. That is something natural history TV programmes can claim credit for. If you can show the natural world on television, people will be fascinated by it."" He adds that, ""These programmes have changed people's minds. There is now a bigger sympathy for the natural world among city-dwellers than there ever was. Our comprehension of the animal kingdom has changed beyond recognition. Now taxi drivers talk to you about biological concepts. 'What's all this about altruism, David? Don't you think that it will affect evolution?'"" Attenborough is also very engaged with environmental issues, making an impassioned and influential speech at the UN conference on climate change in Paris last year. ""It's never been more important. We are completely dependent on the natural world and yet we are wrecking it and endangering ourselves. If we are going to care for it, people have to change their behaviour, and to do that they have to know about what goes on in the natural world. That's one of the things TV can do. ""I certainly embrace conservation causes. You have to be very, very dogmatic and have a closed mind not to see the overwhelming evidence about climate change. It would be amazing if we hadn't had an effect on the climate. The time comes when you have to look at the evidence and make a stand."" Attenborough has long since passed the age when most of us would be reaching for the pipe and slippers. However, as he prepares to make more documentaries, including Planet Earth 2, BBC1's eagerly anticipated follow-up to the hit 2006 series, he shudders at the very word 'retirement'. ""You never tire of the natural world. Putting your feet up is all very well."" Casting me one last smile, Attenborough concludes: ""but it's very boring, isn't it?""

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK386","UN climate summit ends with last-gasp plea to Donald Trump: 'Save us'","November 19, 2016 Saturday","The Independent - Daily Edition","""Save us"": that was the message issued to President-elect Donald Trump by the rest of the world at the close of the UN climate summit in Marrakech. It was fittingly voiced by the summit's next hosts, Fiji, where rising sea levels as a result of man-made global warming are already causing islands to vanish beneath the waves. As the imperilled nation was unveiled as hosts of COP23, the Fijian Prime Minister conjured up the image of America coming to the rescue as it did in the Second World War - a plea which, it is hoped, will appeal to Mr Trump's penchant for a grand gesture. ""We in the Pacific, in common with the whole world, look to America for its leadership and for its engagement and assistance on climate change,"" Frank Bainimarama said. ""Just as we looked at America during the dark days of World War II... I say to the American people 'you came to save us then, it is time for you to help to save us now'."" Even the US delegation here joined in the applause that followed. So much of this year's summit has been given over to considering how best to deal with the looming threat of a climate change denier in the White House, when it was supposed under different circumstances to have been about implementing last year's landmark Paris Agreement. But activists here say that only really tells half the story and that in the background, big strides have been made towards combatting climate change. Mr Trump's election victory has been a wake-up call. It tells the global community it has been over-reliant on the good intentions and leadership of a single state or person. So this will be remembered as the COP where the most vulnerable states started to take control, instead of focussing on what deals they could get out of the richest nations. On the last day of the conference, a coalition of 48 developing states threatened in the near term by climate change - including the Marshall Islands, the Philippines and COP22 hosts Morocco - vowed to go beyond the commitments of the Paris Agreement and derive 100 per cent of their energy from renewables ""as rapidly as possible"". Former US Vice President Al Gore said the commitment of the Climate Vulnerable Forum was ""a bold vision that sets the pace for the world's efforts to implement the Paris Agreement and move even more quickly to solve the climate crisis"". There was good news too on one of the most difficult elements of the negotiations here and in Paris - how countries which are already suffering the impacts of climate change get compensated for the damage, and the measures they need to take to hold back the tide. These are the people - 40 million in Africa alone - who have to turn to charities like Oxfam when rising temperatures and record droughts destroy their livelihoods. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's lead climate expert, told The Independent: ""It looks like there will be a positive outcome [here] on the adaptation fund, and an \£380m funding goal was reached thanks to the support of Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Italy. ""But in saying that, I want to underline the fact that the establishment of funds doesn't deliver action. Money delivers action, and the amounts we are talking about are really small when compared to the amounts that are needed. Thankfully, I don't think Trump is going to be that interested in the adaptation fund."" The President-elect's shadow has loomed over every positive stride made at the summit - given Mr Trump's promise to ""cancel"" the US's involvement in the Paris Agreement. And so this COP will also be remembered as the year when non-state actors - local governments, regions, cities and businesses - started to harness what departing Secretary of State John Kerry called ""the people all over the world who are working for victory in this"". Earlier in the week, more than 360 US businesses including Kellogs, Mars and Starbucks signed a joint letter calling on President-elect Trump to join them in ""re-affirm[ing] our deep commitment to addressing climate change"". Representatives of individual US states attended the conference here to highlight their ability to push ahead with green initiatives - with or without the blessing of the federal government in Washington. And across the world, regions and cities are uniting in initiatives to share knowledge and represent the voices of progressive urban communities. Schemes like the EU-US Global Covenant of Mayors and the Under 2 MOU have members as disparate as Greater Manchester, Catalonia and Piedmont in Italy, and go beyond the state-level commitments of the Paris Agreement. Until the election of Mr Trump, the heads of every state except Nicaragua agreed to the terms of the Paris climate deal. But Wael Hmaidan, director of the Climate Action Network, told The Independent that the recent wave of populist political uprisings across the West showed just how those leaders had lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. He said the deal agreed here in Marrakech was ""rich"" with positive developments - and one of the most important was a recognition that climate activists have to get better at ""increasing awareness. We are seeing in different elections around the world that we are not engaging enough with various parts of the public. We have our followers, we have those who understand climate change, but we don't engage the other side enough,"" he said. Not every measure taken here in these two weeks can be said to be entirely Trump-proof. The US is among the countries to have set out ambitious long-term goals to drastically cut their emissions by 2050 - a goal which only stands a chance if the new President can be brought on board. That's why appeals like Fiji's are still being made. In spite of everything, people here still believe that Mr Trump can be made to see the opportunities available in reimagining the world's energy consumption, and the risks if nothing is done. US climate veteran and director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, Alden Meyer, told The Independent the greatest achievement of the summit had been a world speaking as one ""with a loud and clear voice"". ""They see the impacts of climate change mounting on their populations, and they also see the benefits of decarbonising their economies and enjoying the fruits of the clean energy revolution. ""Not one country has said that if President Trump pulls the US out of Paris, they will follow,"" he said, adding to the repeated suggestions here that America will become a pariah if it reneges on its climate commitments. For all the measured arguments and cautious words over these two weeks, the climate activists here have a hard side - and when it comes to saving the planet, you are either with them, or against them. \"

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK388","Africa must tackle dependency and profit from feeding the world; COMMENT","November 30, 2016 Wednesday","Financial Times (London, England)","By 2050, the world will need to feed 9bn people, 2bn more than we feed today. In order to meet this demand, global food production must increase by an estimated 70 per cent in the next 30 years. Africa - which contains 65 per cent of the world's unexploited arable land - has a key future role in delivering global food security. Yet less than a third of Africa's arable land is under cultivation, resulting in African food imports that total $35bn a year. To meet future demand, this equation must be reversed. Supporting farmers and their local ecosystem is critical to unlocking the full potential of African agriculture. To be successful, African farmers need a reliable supply of agricultural products that increase the efficiency of their land. They also need better education and training to boost soil fertility and access to financing to provide stability for their operations. Transport and storage infrastructure is also essential to allow access to markets and support any increased agricultural output, whether its destination is local, regional or international. However, Africa's fragile arable lands are at risk of further depletion in the next decade, a threat that is exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Achieving the goal of securing our global food supply must be achieved in a way that protects our continent's most precious resource, our land. A challenge is the lack of a secure and affordable supply of fertiliser that meets the needs of local soils and crops. Africa currently has the lowest fertiliser consumption rate in the world - representing only 2 per cent of global consumption despite holding 20 per cent of the world's population by some estimates. When African farmers do use fertiliser, they pay two to six times more than the average world price. OCP Africa is backed by OCP, our parent company and phosphate supplier. We are committed to programmes aimed at tackling soil degradation. The solution starts with soil mapping, which enables farmers to know which nutrients their specific soil needs, and then requires the application of correct and affordable supplements to boost crop yields. However, boosting soil quality is just one challenge tackled by the Initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change, one of the priorities of the Moroccan presidency of the COP 22 round of talks and actions on the global threat. Water scarcity is the most important challenge facing agriculture in Africa. Roughly two-thirds of African lands are located in arid or semi-arid areas made even more vulnerable by climate change, while lands endowed with water often lack storage and delivery systems to effectively irrigate. If solutions can be found to reduce water waste and improve supply, Africa could massively increase the agricultural potential of its land. Investment in logistics and good governance is also required to ensure supplies and produce flow easily and surplus production is stored efficiently. Private and public institutions around the world need to join efforts to provide resources and expertise, help with technology transfer and capacity building, and share best practice. Smarter approaches to agriculture could increase the annual value of the continent's production from $280bn to $880bn by 2030, helping boost global food supply, creating new jobs and improving other economic sectors. This challenge of delivering investment and good governance required is immense, but it is a prize worth chasing. Karim Lotfi Senhadji is chief executive of OCP Africa \"

At an official UNFCCC side event organised by IMO today, ICS Director of Policy and External Relations, Simon Bennett, said: ""We are very optimistic that initial CO2 reduction objectives can now be developed by IMO for the sector by 2018. The shipping industry thinks these should reflect the spirit and ambition of the Paris Agreement while being appropriate to the circumstances that apply to international shipping - just as the commitments made by governments to UNFCCC reflect the circumstances of different national economies."" ICS says that the IMO Road Map (agreed by the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee at the end of October) will build on the mandatory CO2 reduction regulations for shipping already adopted by IMO - four years before the Paris Agreement was adopted - which will ensure that ships built after 2025 will be at least 30% more efficient. However, ICS believes the IMO Road Map will actually will go much further than the Paris Agreement. ""The final stage to be enacted by 2023 should establish a global mechanism for ensuring that these initial IMO commitments - which the industry wants to see agreed by 2018 - will actually be delivered."" said Mr Bennett. ICS says this IMO mechanism could potentially include a legally binding Market Based Measure. ""This remains very controversial and is not yet universally supported throughout the shipping industry"" said Mr Bennett. ""But if this is what governments eventually decide, the clear preference of the majority of the industry would be for a global levy based on fuel consumption."" Mr Bennett added ""Key to next steps is the mandatory global CO2 data collection system which IMO has now adopted. This will enable any initial CO2 commitments agreed in 2018 to be further refined using the very latest data on ships' emissions which will become fully available from 2019. ""But most importantly, the IMO data system will inform the development of a mechanism by IMO for ensuring that agreed CO2 reduction commitments are indeed fully met. This will no doubt include deciding the extent to which technical and operational measures alone might be insufficient to deliver the IMO CO2 reduction commitments that we hope will be initially agreed in 2018."" ICS says that the international shipping sector actually reduced its total CO2 emissions by more than 10% between 2007 and 2012, despite an increase in maritime trade - while the rest of the world economy, even taking account of the commitments made in Paris - will probably continue increasing emissions at least until the 2030s. ""But the shipping industry fully recognises that society expects more, and we therefore think it is vital that IMO Member States agree some truly ambitious CO2 reduction commitments by 2018."" said Mr Bennett. ICS and its member national shipowners' associations expect to come forward with some firm ideas about what these IMO CO2 reduction commitments might entail before the next IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting in 2017.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK390","'Great Green Wall' initiative offers unique opportunity to combat climate change in Africa - UN agency","November 18, 2016 Friday","FinancialWire","At the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP 22 ) under way in Marrakech, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) participated in the launch of a ground breaking map of restoration opportunities to combat climate change in Africa, an area being called the 'Great Green Wall.' The map is based on a collection and analysis of land-use information in Africa's drylands in order to improve resilience to climate change. ""The Great Green Wall initiative is Africa's flagship programme to combat the effects of climate change and desertification,"" said Eduardo Mansur, Director of the FAO's Land and Water Division, as he presented the map yesterday during a high-level event at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). During the event, held at the African Union Pavilion on the theme 'Resilient Landscapes in Africa's Drylands: Seizing Opportunities and Deepening Commitments,' Mr. Mansur explained that so far, the Great Green Wall initiative has shown that degraded lands can be restored, but ""these achievements pale in comparison with what is needed."" According to Mr. Mansur, the tools used to create the map are vital in providing critical information to understand the true nature of restoration needs throughout drylands in North Africa, the Sahel region, and the Horn of Africa. Through the Global Drylands Assessment, a study conducted by FAO and its partners from 2015-2016, an estimated 166 million hectares of the Great Green Wall area offer opportunities for restoration projects. The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative supports local communities in the sustainable management of drylands. Photo: FAO/Giulio Napolitano The Great Green Wall covers both arid and semi-arid areas in the north and south ends of the Sahara Desert. Its core area consists of 780 million hectares and is home to 232 million people. In order to halt and reverse land degradation, some 10 million hectares must be restored each year. Such an achievement would provide critical support to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In order to obtain the data, experts behind the project analyzed 63,000 half-hectare sample plots spread across drylands in North Africa, Sahel, and the Horn using FAO's Open Foris Collect Earth tool and extremely high resolution satellite images from Google Earth Engine and Bing Maps. A variety of restoration approaches are possible and necessary in order to implement the Great Green Wall initiative. These include natural regeneration that allows farmers to protect and manage the natural regeneration of forests, croplands and grasslands; large-scale land preparation and enrichment planning, especially in areas where degradation is severe; mobilization of high-quality seeds and planting materials; and involving communities in the selection of native species to be used. In areas closer to the desert, sustainable management of oases systems and use of native woody and grassy vegetation can help fight sand encroachment. The data collection is a collaborative effort on behalf of FAO, the African Union, the CILSS/AGRHYMET Regional Centre, the Directorate General of Forests in Tunisia, Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia, Google, and the World Resources Institute.

The Climate Institute has released a report called "" COP 22 - Getting to Zero"" in the lead-up to an international climate conference next week. World leaders are meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7 to 14 November to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions. Related: Climate change solutions: 65% want Australia to be world leader - study The goal was set in train by the Paris agreement in December, which produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, to limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C. Australia is heading to the meeting in Morocco without having ratified the Paris agreement, which comes into force on Friday. But Guardian Australia understands the Turnbull government is likely to ratify it by the end of next week. If that occurs, it means Australia will have ratified it before the international meeting ends, allowing it to formally take part in the decision-making process at the meeting. The Climate Institute's chief executive, John Connor, said Australia needed to drop the culture wars on climate change so it could take part meaningfully in the global movement to reduce emissions. Related: Climate change: Australia falling behind rest of world on emissions cuts, says report ""The Australian government will be in the spotlight in Marrakech and will need to step up efforts to help achieve commitments central to the Paris agreement,"" Connor said. ""Domestic action hasn't kept pace with unprecedented global momentum in clean energy and emissions reduction. The 2030 target Australia set itself in August 2015 is not consistent with the Paris objectives. Nor is our emission reduction policy framework. These weaknesses leave Australia exposed,"" he said. ""At a minimum Australia needs to ratify the Paris agreement, release its 2030 emission projections and incorporate achieving net zero emissions into domestic policy processes, like Coag energy reviews and the upcoming 2017 climate policy review."" Connor said the speed with which the Paris agreement had come into force had caught the global community by surprise, including Australia. He said the long-term implications of what the agreement was meant to achieve had not yet sunk into Australia's mainstream political discourse, or into domestic policy making. But other countries had acted quickly in the past 12 months to pursue long-term emissions reductions targets, he said. The UK has agreed to reduce emissions by 57% by 2030 and the Canadian government is imposing a nationwide carbon price floor. In August 2015, he said, Australia put forward an initial target of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions, below 2005 levels, by 2030, but if other countries followed that example it would lead to warming of 3C to 4C above pre-industrial levels. Related: New South Wales unveils plan to reach zero emissions by 2050 He said in a "" landmark"" paper published last month, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, had advised investors to incorporate climate change risks into their portfolios. On Thursday the New South Wales government said it had set an objective to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Connor said the state's premier, Mike Baird, and his government should be congratulated. ""Because of the federal vacuum, we seeing state governments realising that it's in their long-term interests to have good renewable energy in their jurisdictions,"" he said. \"

Today's vote also means that the EU remains a climate leader"" said European Parliament President Martin Schulz who signed the letter of transfer for Parliament's consent to the EU ratification in the presence of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, French environment minister and COP21 President Segolene Royal, Slovak State Secretary Ivan Korcok, representing the Presidency of the Council, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and EP rapporteur Giovanni La Via (EPP, IT). ""The European Union has a long track record of leadership against climate change"", noted Mr Ban Ki-moon before the vote. He thanked MEPs and stressed the importance of the EU's ratification. He also added that fighting climate change is not only one of the most important challenges of our times, but also an opportunity to build a more sustainable and competitive economy and more stable societies. Most speakers from political groups stressed that today's vote also shows that cooperation and tackling issues together are the only solution to global problems. They also insisted on the urgent need to implement the agreement, and to pursue negotiations on the global stage. ""This is the outcome of a great work together"" showing that ""Today we can!"" said Mr La Via. Videos of the ceremony and speakers Now that it has Parliament's consent, the Council can formally adopt the Decision via a written procedure, so that the EU, together with the seven member states that have completed the ratification process, can deposit the ratification instruments in the UN headquarters in New York by this Friday 7 October. MEPs will also vote a resolution on Thursday setting out their priorities for the next round of talks to start in November in Marrakesh to focus on the effort-sharing among the Parties that will be needed to meet the Paris targets. Note for editors Seven member states have completed their national domestic processes so far: Hungary, France, Slovakia, Austria, Malta, Portugal and Germany. These 7 MS account for some 5% of global emissions. Ratifications representing at least 55 Parties and 55% of global emissions are needed for the Agreement to enter into force. To date, 62 Parties, accounting for 51.89% of global emissions, have formally deposited their instruments of ratification. The European Union accounts for some 12 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Against this background, and thanks to the EU ratification, the Paris Agreement will enter into force in time for the COP 22 Climate Change Conference in Marrakech from 7-18 November 2016.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK396","Crowding the private sector into Africa's climate action","December 12, 2016 Monday","M2 PressWIRE","December 12, 2016 The global community for climate action was spooked by the November 8 election of Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. The US President-elect had earned the sobriquet of ""climate denier,"" for his claim that climate change is a hoax. However, there is cautious optimism that his presidency will not overturn the global agenda on climate change. Hopefully, his views on climate change will change and align with reality when he settles into the Oval Office. Policymakers also believe that global climate agreements cannot be reversed easily. In the meantime, stakeholders are pressing on with formulating strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations' agency on climate change held on November 7 - 18 in Marrakech, Morocco. At the climate talks, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, Pakistan and seven other countries ratified the December 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A total of 111 countries, including the United States, China and Member Countries of the European Union ratified the agreement by the time COP 22 concluded. Since the Paris accord entered into force on November 4th, quite earlier than anticipated, global action against climate change has effectively shifted to strategic programming. Therefore, in Marrakech, Canada, Germany, Mexico and the United States published their plans to significantly decarbonize their economies by 2050. A group of 47 developing nations also committed to running entirely on renewable energy sources ""as rapidly as possible."" Some of the plans are already gaining traction. Investments in renewable energy totalled $ 286 billion in 2015. This surpassed by 3% the previous high of renewable energy investment achieved in 2011. Data gleaned from Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2016, a joint publication by United Nations Environment Programme and Bloomberg, further revealed that last year, coal and gas-fired electricity generation drew less than half the record investment made in solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. The trend in renewable energy investment is a mixed bag, even in developing countries. China alone accounted for 55% of total investment last year; Africa's share was less than 5%. As climate change mitigation is being driven by investment in green energy, Africa is already taking the familiar position at the back seat on the 'green energy train'. This was not unanticipated by climate policymakers. Although China is the clear leader in investment in renewables, other developing countries, in particular the low-income countries, are not expected to be able to keep pace without international assistance. But the advanced countries appear to be reneging on their pledges to help finance both mitigation and adaptation frameworks in the developing world, including Africa. This generated some rumblings in Marrakech, with regard to the commitment by the developed countries to raise $ 100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate actions in developing countries. Disappointing as this is, the prospects of improvement in international assistance at the required scale are not assuring. One, virtually all the advanced countries have been bedevilled by over half a decade of weak economic growth. This has put investment in infrastructure below ideal levels, suggesting near-term pressure on the fiscal regimes to close the infrastructure gap, create domestic jobs, and boost economic growth. Two, the economic malaise is also driving populist nationalistic sentiments in Europe and the United States. The backlashes for the emerging isolationist regimes are expected to include decline in international trade, further political uncertainties, shrinking and closed borders, and volatility in financial markets """" acting together to further put downward pressure on economic growth and constrict foreign aid. Three, the developing world has ceased to be monolithic. A handful of the countries have recently made significant economic and financial advances. These countries, including the BRICS economies, and the countries of the Gulf States that have amassed huge reserve savings, are expected to underline their climate strategies by investment. The less fortunate countries will continue to rely on overseas development assistance, although the gap between pledges and delivery will continue to widen. Without a united front, commitment to pledges for climate change mitigation and adaptation will continue to slack, with consequences for vulnerable populations. Africa that is left behind in the transition to the green economy will be worse off than it is today. As the drive towards decarbonisation gathers pace, Africa's oil economies will face more intense fiscal challenges. Given the strong link between government balance sheets and private sector balance sheets, this will result in serious constraint for business growth and profit. Therefore, it is in the enlightened self-interest of African private sector to begin to mobilise investment capital for Africa's climate action. For starters, the private sector is best suited to take the lead role in innovating climate solutions and green development. In Africa, the frontiers for the innovations are in power and agriculture. These are sectors that have been far less developed, compared to services sectors. Happily, countries including Nigeria have recently enacted reforms in both their power and agriculture sectors. These reforms are geared towards mobilising private sector resources, having relaxed statist control and incentivised investment. Accordingly, the private sector can leverage reforms that have relaxed the centralisation of the power grid to innovate and finance off-grid electricity solutions. Opportunities for Public Private Partnerships are also opening up as subnational governments are seeking to accelerate improvement in the power sector. These are happening in the region that is well endowed with solar energy and wind resources. Similarly, various reforms in the agriculture sector have factored the need for climate resilience in national food security policies. But there is significant knowledge gap in Africa's agriculture which cannot be left to the smallholder farmers and governments to fill. Private investments across the agriculture value-chain are needed to help close the knowledge gap and support adaptation mechanisms in rural farming communities. Token actions towards building the green economy cannot remain an option for Africa's private sector. The risks are dangerously stacked. Without adequate climate action, African farmers could lose between 40% and 80% of their croplands for growing grains. Also, the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are dire for even urban populations. But the question remains: how will private sector resources be mobilised? No doubt, significant capacity lies with the African financial institutions, including the development finance banks and to a lesser extent the export credit agencies. But there has been risk aversion and shortage of risk-sharing market instruments. In the Nigerian banking industry, for example, aversion towards risk in agribusiness has hampered funding by financial institutions. And funding pooled at the instance of Central Bank of Nigeria for on-lending to agro-SMEs has historically under-performed. A further drag is the macroeconomic conditions, which are driving interest rates more and more beyond the affordability of agro-entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers. To unlock private sector funding, therefore, the blockades at both demand and supply sides of the credit market have to be addressed by smarter policies and more faithfulness with implementation. But this will not be enough. There has to be a framework for sharing expertise on the continent. The good news is that such frameworks that pool resources, help to mitigate risk, and share knowledge in mobilising climate actions already exist. At the supra-national level, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) was founded in 2012 as an agency of the African Union with the mandate to finance climate resilience and crisis response. In line with its mandate, the ARC is planning to roll out an Extreme Climate Facility, which will issue multi-peril, climate change catastrophe bonds. The securitization instruments will bring scale and knowhow to Africa's climate risk management and climate change adaptation efforts, with tremendous benefits to the agriculture sector. XCF's catastrophe bonds are expected to attract not only investment from indigenous African banks but also from international financial institutions. One hopes that the XCF will soon be deployed, and the rigorous risk modelling it plans to have in place will serve other market initiatives. Necessary as it is for Africa to take responsibility for its resilience to climate change and to develop its adaptation mechanisms, the continent should not be denied 'climate justice.' The heavily-industrialised countries account for overwhelming proportions of the emissions that are heating the planet and are intensifying climate risks for vulnerable populations in less-industrialised developing countries. This makes the delivery of aid towards adaptation in developing countries quite mandatory. Foreign aid is also required to catalyse market frameworks in developing countries, and secure part of the moral planks on which the much-celebrated Paris accord rest.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK398","This is mankind's 'great urbanisation' era. We must act now, or the planet will pay; The world will never again build cities as rapidly as it does this century.....","November 8, 2016 Tuesday 1:18 PM GMT","The Guardian","Almost as staggering as the current enormous influx into cities across the globe is the dramatic slowdown in urbanisation that will follow it. The world is literally going to town on urbanisation - but it is a project that is both immense and historically fleeting. In less than 100 years, the world's urban population is expected to double to 8 or 9 billion - accounting for the bulk of a projected global population of around 11 billion. Yet in all the centuries that follow this one, cities may add, at most, another billion to their ranks. So if this century is the most urbanising in history, it will also mark the end of humankind's ""great urbanisation"" era. Thus the next few decades will be hugely influential in determining the patterns of production, behaviour and governance that humanity locks into, and the innovative efficiency with which it utilises the earth's resources. The future of the world's urban population will mostly be built in our lifetimes. The consequences of bad government and inaction over planning and urban design will last decades or centuries. Once the urban population is stable, and road, rail and utility networks have been laid down, it will be much harder to undertake reform or retrofit urban infrastructure. This is why the subject deserves the urgent attention of policymakers, academics and business entrepreneurs worldwide. This week, global leaders are meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd UN climate summit ( Cop22 ). They are discussing how to limit greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to hold global warming well below 2\'b0C, as was agreed a year ago in Paris. If new cities are built on a carbon-intensive, resource-hungry model, then all hope of meeting these ambitious targets will be lost. Humans work best in cities ... but urbanisation also creates pollution, congestion, poor health, crime and waste The good news, however, is that it is possible to meet these targets in a way that improves wellbeing and stimulates global productivity and wealth. Innovative, well-run cities are uniquely placed to solve these major global challenges, in conjunction with national governments. Humans work best in cities, that's why we're moving there. The clustering of people generates higher productivity and higher wages. A mix of specialisation and diversity generates a fertile environment for innovation in ideas, technologies and processes. But urbanisation also creates its own problems, in the form of pollution, congestion, poor health, crime and waste. Unregulated, unplanned urban sprawl is often the cheapest option in the short run - but the long-run costs to society, the economy and the environment can be dire. At the UN's Habitat III conference in Ecuador last month, global leaders and urban experts signed into force the New Urban Agenda, a blueprint for the next 20 years of urban transformation. It set out an ambitious and laudable vision of more compact cities and public transport-based development - but the real test will be in the implementation. Turning words into action requires overcoming domestic opposition and providing finance to the cities most in need. This means recognising that climate action can deliver local benefits to citizens, even in the short term - and it's why the Paris Agreement, which came into effect last week, set out to bring city actors together with national players through the Global Covenant of Mayors. Already, 7,100 cities from 119 countries have committed to the associated Compact of Mayors for Climate and Energy, pledging to support meeting national targets. With the cost of renewable and energy efficiency technologies having fallen to levels competitive with conventional fuels (even before accounting for the unpriced costs associated with the latter's use), the opportunities from urban action to reduce emissions becomes plain to see. Be it through investing in electric vehicles, building smart grids, constructing energy-efficient homes, planning limits on urban sprawl, investing in renewable power or providing integrated public transport, such action generates a number of important benefits - not least, tackling the growing and deadly problem of air pollution all over the world. Air pollution costs millions of lives every year. The European Environment Agency estimates that premature deaths resulting from a single particulate pollutant (PM2.5) totalled approximately 432,000 in 2012 in Europe alone, while around 75,000 people die each year as a result of prolonged exposure to NO2 air pollution. A recent study by the World Resources Institute put the health impacts in China of PM2.5 exposure (including premature deaths) at a shocking 10-13% of the country's annual GDP. Thus, air pollution is one key reason why the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate found that more than half of the reduction in global emissions required to meet an ambitious climate target could generate net benefits to the economy. Implementing policy action to reduce emissions is often easiest at the city level. This means increased effort is required to devolve administration to the urban level and empower cities through greater fiscal autonomy. Things like recycling schemes, energy from waste, broadband networks, integrated public transport systems, ""smart"" buildings and biking networks are easy to appreciate and can come with popular local support. Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate ... and risks rendering cities dysfunctional Local accountability is also a vital part of good governance. In large parts of the world, this means fighting urban corruption and supporting institutional capacity. Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate, undermining property rights and threatening to usurp the returns to productive activities. This offsets many of the benefits of urban clustering, and risks rendering cities dysfunctional. The tragedy is that some of the poorest cities in the world are also the fastest growing - and they lack the resources and capacity to prevent locking into structures that are inefficient, unreliable and polluting. Related: Climate change and cities: a prime source of problems, yet key to a solution But successful urbanisation is not just about infrastructure; it's also about skills. Mexico and Rwanda have invested heavily in urban vocational and technical training. Investment in talent and skills (from jobs training programmes to secondary education) helps raise wages, attract talent and promote urban growth. It also improves the flow of information vital to civic inclusion and effective governance. In other words, there must be continued innovation in governance and learning from best practice. To learn from each other and demonstrate the benefits of sustainable planning and decarbonisation, urban policymakers should develop and utilise city networks such as C40, the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives ( ICLEI ), the Compact of Mayors and United Cities and Local Governments ( UCLG ), which all facilitate the sharing of experience. Cities are at the heart of the process of human development, innovation and productivity growth. The world is moving to cities, and those we build over the next few decades will broadly define the urban centres we are stuck with for generations to come. Cities that are poorly planned risk leaving humanity with a hostile and potentially deadly climate. The clock is ticking. Humanity has a narrow window of time in which to plan and design its future. That opportunity must not - and need not - be squandered.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK399","If you want to tackle carbon emissions let indigenous people control their land; Global leaders must acknowledge that land and forests owned and managed by loca....","November 16, 2016 Wednesday 10:16 AM GMT","The Guardian","In my native Colombia, the cloud forests of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta have been described as holding the most important concentration of threatened wildlife on Earth. These forests are also the ancestral home of the Koguis, an indigenous group now numbering around 10,000 individuals. In their cosmology, Koguis are the elders of humanity, living in the heart of the world, while outsiders are the ""younger brothers"" who were banished because of how they abused the land in the past - an accurate description of a planet where 160,000 acres of tropical rainforest are destroyed or damaged every day. For centuries, the Koguis have strived to care for their land in a way that will preserve it for future generations. If we listen to them and other indigenous peoples, if we respect their rights and honour their traditions, I think we ""younger brothers"" still have a chance to get it right. At the COP 22 In Latin America, for instance, there are around 40 million indigenous people. Altogether, indigenous and community-owned lands represent around 23% of the region's total land mass. This is an immense territory, roughly equivalent to the combined surface of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Related: Indigenous rights are key to preserving forests, climate change study finds Much of this land is still covered by forests and grasslands whose preservation is a proven and cost-effective way of reducing emissions. In my experience, there is no better way to ensure the careful stewardship of these assets - whether in the Amazon basin, the Andean highlands or the jungles of Central America - than to give indigenous communities full control over the land. Indigenous peoples have encyclopaedic knowledge about the landscapes they live in. They also have the strongest possible incentive to ensure the sustainability of those ecosystems. The World Resources Institute conducted a study of 80 forest areas in 10 countries in south Asia, east Africa, and Latin America which found that community-owned and managed forests delivered greater carbon storage, as when local communities have no legal rights, or very few, their forests are more vulnerable to deforestation. Indeed, evidence suggests that strengthening indigenous forest rights is associated with both better communities and healthier forests. When local communities have no legal rights, or very few, their forests are more vulnerable to deforestation In the past, governments and policymakers tended to undervalue the link between climate change mitigation and indigenous land rights. But the Paris Agreement explicitly recognised this, and some governments - including Bolivia and Guatemala - incorporated such considerations into their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Of course, land rights are no panacea. Even when they have control, communities need support when deciding how to most effectively use local resources, how to provide a decent livelihood for their people, and how to deal with illegal activities such as clandestine mining and poaching. Donor nations and development banks must also help to strengthen the institutions responsible for land tenure and expand climate finance options for investments that promote sustainable landscapes. Related: An indigenous community's battle to save their home in the Amazon - in pictures At the Inter-American Development Bank we are seeing a surge in interest from countries to prioritise infrastructure and land use programmes that will contribute to their NDCs.

In early October, the Paris Agreement cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for the accord to enter into effect. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and two specific thresholds. The Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change.

He added that over the past decade, a ""great global coalition"" for climate action, including government officials, scientists, faith leaders, business executives and civil society activists around the world was forged and it recognized that the future of people and planet was at stake. ""They made today possible,"" he said, highlighting: ""Today shows us what is possible when we join forces for our common future.""

In his remarks, Mr. Ban thanked the civil society for their courage, persistence and leadership in realizing the Paris Agreement and called on them to ""keep up the fight"", to press for action and to hold governments accountable. ""Your voices at the time were clearly heard by the leaders who attended the climate meeting [in Paris last year],"" he said. ""You showed the climate challenge stakes - and the solutions.""

In early October, the Paris Agreement cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for the accord to enter into effect. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and two specific thresholds. The Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change.

Further in his remarks today, Mr. Ban recalled that the present generation to really feel the effects of climate change and the last that can prevent its worst consequences. He added that over the past decade, a ""great global coalition"" for climate action, including government officials, scientists, faith leaders, business executives and civil society activists around the world was forged and it recognized that the future of people and planet was at stake. ""They made today possible,"" he said, highlighting: ""Today shows us what is possible when we join forces for our common future."" UN chief discusses role of civil society in the days ahead Also today, the Secretary-General chief held a meeting with representatives of civil society groups to discuss with them how their organizations could contribute to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as well as their visions and concerns. In his remarks, Mr. Ban thanked the civil society for their courage, persistence and leadership in realizing the Paris Agreement and called on them to ""keep up the fight"", to press for action and to hold governments accountable. ""Your voices at the time were clearly heard by the leaders who attended the climate meeting [in Paris last year],"" he said. ""You showed the climate challenge stakes - and the solutions."" The discussion with the civil society was moderated by David Nabarro, Special Adviser on 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and attended by a number of representatives of civil society groups from all over the world.

"COP22","UK","COP22_UK403","A renewed focus on sustainable construction practices in Morocco","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","COP22 ), the supreme decision-making body of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to ""achieve stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". The UNFCCC gathers together 196 states, along with the EU. Article 3-4 of the UNFCCC provides that parties ""have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development"". Sustainable building is an important aspect of sustainable development. According to Nabil Benabdallah, the minister of housing and urban policy, sustainable building is not only erecting buildings that are efficient in terms of energy. It also means designing buildings with a global view to preserving the environment, and with an architectural design that aims to reduce power consumption and answers the inhabitants' needs. Moroccan law already includes various texts linked to sustainable energy, even if there is no general law gathering provisions on this matter. Following is a summary of the main legal provisions on sustainable building that are applicable in Morocco. Principles & Philosophy The first legal provision to mention is (King's Decree) No. 1-14-09 of March 6, 2014, promulgating Law No. 99-12 providing for the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development. The law contains the main principles and philosophy of Morocco relating to sustainable development. According to this Dahir, all natural persons and legal entities shall refrain from undermining the environment. In addition, all public or private persons, natural persons and legal entities will contribute to individual and collective efforts to protect the environment, and to promote and broadcast a culture of sustainable development in Morocco. This law defines sustainable development as a development step based, in its implementation, on the link between the economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions of development activities, and which aims to answer present needs without compromising future generations in this field. This law presents sustainable development as a fundamental value that all components of society shall integrate into their activities. It consists in courses of action that are asked of all participants in the economic, social, cultural and environmental life of the country. Implementation of these principles consists in reducing pressure on natural resources, the use of production technologies that are favourable to the environment, and trying to continuously improve the accessibility of all social classes to the products and services of this field. Some sectors are considered by the law as having high potential for sustainability, construction being one of them. The law invites government authorities in charge of these fields to ensure effective durability rules are adopted in management methods and production, and to broadcast such principles. Energy Efficiency Two elements relate to sustainable buildings. The first relates to the energy impact survey. This shall be conducted for any new urban development scheme or any building construction programme, whatever its use, listed in a Dahir according to the thermal or electric energy consuming threshold for each kind of project. In addition, the law adds to legal provisions relating to town planning, in that any town planning zone will specify the zones where projects will require, according to their size or their nature, a preliminary energy impact survey. The second is also included in Dahir No. 2-13-874 of October 15, 2014 approving the general construction regulations establishing energy efficiency construction rules and setting up a national committee for energy efficiency in the construction field. Energy efficiency construction rules provided for in the general construction regulations are applicable to residential and tertiary buildings to be erected. A residential building is defined as a building where more than 80 % of the built surface area is for housing use, whereas a tertiary building is any public building and building which is for hospitality, health, education, commercial or services use. The provisions of Dahir No. 2-13-874 do not apply to: Buildings that existed before the date of entry into force of the Dahir (which is one year after the publishing of the Dahir in the official bulletin, i.e. October 15, 2015);   Buildings used for agricultural, craft or industrial activity (or housing premises located in the same buildings);   Buildings used for manufacturing, industrial and storage operations; Buildings requiring particular internal conditions, such as greenhouses and storage premises, and; Individual rural housing units. The purpose of the energy efficiency construction rules provided in the general construction regulations is to set out the characteristics the buildings shall comply with, depending on which climatic zones they are erected in, to reach the following results: Reduce the building's heat and air conditioning needs; Improve the thermal comfort in the buildings; Participate in the reduction of the national energy bill; and   Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Six climatic zones have been determined according to the temperature over the last 10 years in these regions. When the external temperature is below 18\'b0C it is considered that the premises need to be heated, and when the external temperature is above 21\'b0C there is a need for air conditioning in the premises. Technical minimal specifications are provided for each climatic zone and building type in two ways: a global approach (performance approach) and a OBG would like to thank Lef\'e8vre Pelletier & associ\'e9s Protection Of The Environment The third set of provisions to have in mind is Dahir No. 1-03-59 of May 12, 2003 promulgating Law No. 11-03 relating to protection and enhancement of the environment. Article 6 provides that building or allotment permits are delivered in conformity with the applicable laws and regulations in view of the possible impact on the environment. Building and allotment permits may be refused or subject to specific rules if they may have damaging consequences on the environment, the safety, wellness and health of the inhabitants, or constitute a risk for the neighbourhood. From a legal point of view, Morocco has basic sets of provisions supporting sustainable building activity. A choice may then be made on the legal details that Morocco is willing to add to either encourage the actors to reach a certain performance level or to comply with strict methods targeting sustainable construction. In the real estate market, many private initiatives have emerged to direct the efforts towards sustainable building. Nevertheless, a cultural change shall also occur in the behaviour of developers that currently integrate the sustainability of their building only as a marketing tool: such marketing tools shall become the reality of the construction. Ultimately only the sophistication of the real estate purchaser's market will completely ensure that all buildings will become sustainable. \"

CUPE's delegation will be part of 35 Canadian trade unionists coordinated by the Canadian Labour Congress and the International Trade Union Congress (ITUC). On December 3, Fleury will be among the speakers at the ""One Million Green Jobs"" forum sponsored by the Canadian Labour Congress and the Climate Action Network at the Le Bourget conference centre in Paris. Several of Canada's premiers and environment ministers have confirmed their attendance at the Canadian forum. On behalf of CUPE, Fleury will argue for world governments, including Canada, to adopt ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets for 2020 that meet scientists' recommendations. According to Fleury, we can no longer rely on states acting in good faith: the final accord must include a mandatory review process for all countries. ""However, the fight against climate change cannot be waged at the expense of workers, communities or developing countries. The final accord should involve a just transition to a carbon-free economy, including financial incentives for the poorest countries,"" explained Fleury. For CUPE's National Secretary-Treasurer, the fight against climate change also presents an excellent opportunity for the creation of new green jobs. ""Public services are a main source of green jobs. A growing public sector and public infrastructure will help us reduce the effects of climate change. Private companies have created the problem; governments and the public sector need to be part of the solution,"" said Fleury. CUPE is a signatory of the Leap Manifesto advocating that environmental protection, economic development, and a fairer society go hand in hand. ""We'll make sure that the Leap message is heard loud and clear in Paris,"" concluded Fleury. CUPE is Canada's largest union, representing 634,000 workers.613-894-0146 HYPERLINK mailto:pgagnon@scfp.capgagnon@scfp.ca\l"

The conference, starting at 6:30 at the U of A is sold out, but there's a live webcast( HYPERLINK https://livestream.com/accounts/3923053/events/4407075https://livestream.com/accounts/3923053/events/4407075 ).Some of the panellists met with journalists in advance to offer samples of their presentations. Passages are condensed and edited.Eddy Isaacs, CEO of Alberta Innovates - Energy &; Environment Solutions: I'm introducing some of the key innovations of the 21st century that have made a huge difference in the way we think about energy and climate change. You have the development of two parallel universes, one that is with the innovation that's happened in renewable energy - just think about where wind and solar were at the beginning of the century and where they are now. The other one is the whole issue of unconventional oil and gas resources, which has made access to fossil fuels much more available. You've got these two parallel things and, as a result, you've got people that want to be out of fossil fuels and other people that see this as an opportunity for economic perspective.You've got these two separate paradigms and I think COP21 is a very good process to bring these two parallel universes together. The focus will eventually have to be on innovation because there's no other way to get us where we need to be without technology and innovation.Emilson Silva, chair of Campus Alberta Innovates Program and business economics professor at U of A: My topic will be to describe the economic benefits, the challenges and the risks of a transition to a low-carbon economy. That is going to require major structural change because, just to quote President George Bush, 'America is addicted to oil.' We could actually say that the world economy is addicted to fossil fuels. Moving away from fossil fuels is a major challenge, but doing nothing is not a sustainable option given the pace we have seen of emissions of greenhouse gases growing. We have to do something. The time is running out.If we were to think in terms of a transition to a low-carbon economy, what is the best practice that we have nowadays? The European Union, in my view, might be the best practice.To move toward a low-carbon economy, there are three essential pillars: carbon pricing, more emphasis on energy-saving technologies and we would have to consider the other options such as climate engineering, to clean up the atmosphere.Simon Dyer, regional director for Alberta and the North at Pembina Institute: I'm going to talk about the Alberta context. There's a six-point plan. The first one is to phase out coal-fired electricity. Rapidly deploying renewables. It's important we consider a cap on oilsands emissions. A sleeper issue is addressing methane. We need to invest in energy efficiency. Alberta is the only jurisdiction in North America that doesn't invest in consumer and industrial programs for energy efficiency. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, carbon pricing needs to be part of the package. Alberta has a carbon pricing system, but it's currently pretty anemic.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada10","Opinion: Climate justice, Canada and COP21","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","Postmedia Breaking News","PARIS - Climate justice refers to the idea that some groups make greater contributions to greenhouse gas emissions than others, and that some groups are more greatly affected by climate change than others. The geographical coincidence is that the wealthy countries of the (mostly) north have historically made greater contributions to GHG emissions, while the poorer countries of the (mostly) south are more greatly adversely affected by climate change.However, climate justice also refers to a number of different social dimensions beyond geography. They include:Income: generally speaking, people with higher incomes, consume more, and have a larger carbon footprints. Yet, they are also better able to adapt (e.g. move, buy new technology to help them cope), than lower income people. They also have more power in political arenas.Age: older cohorts (and dead cohorts) have contributed the most to the problem (GHG emissions), while youth (and the not yet born) will be disproportionately affected by climate change. On this note, Canada's youth delegation, which has had a significant presence at The United Nations climate conference in Paris (COP21, or the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties), has complained that the Prime Minister and Environment and Climate Change Minister have failed to meet with them, and to hear their concerns.Gender: throughout much of the world, a gendered division of labour, and gender inequality persists. Men tend to be disproportionately economically advantaged, but in many gender-typed roles (obtaining water, growing food, caring for children), especially in developing countries, women bear a greater share of the burdens. And women in these roles disproportionately faced the negative consequences of global warming.Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal people: in Canada because they have been dispossessed from their traditional lands and resources, and have historically been substantially excluded from the economy, Aboriginal people have not benefited to the same degree as non-Aboriginal peoples by the economic development that has spewed greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Yet, Indigenous peoples will be disproportionately affected by climate change (in Canada, and elsewhere in the world). Indigenous peoples living in Canada's north will be severely affected by melting permafrost (which will upset transportation), and by other changes that will affect flora and fauna, and in turn, traditional lifestyles. Throughout the rest of Canada, Aboriginal peoples are disproportionately likely to live in rural and remote locations, and will be more greatly affected by severe weather, forest fires, and other manifestations of climate change (e.g. decl"

The aim is to come to a binding agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.What is Canada doing?Fighting climate change was a main plank in Justin Trudeau's election campaign and he wasted little time taking action after becoming prime minister. After first recognizing that climate change is a global problem, Trudeau met with provincial and territorial leaders last week to discuss how Canada can better take action on climate change.Trudeau's Liberal government has also promised to invest in clean energy and clean technology across the country, as well as fulfilling G20 commitments to phase out subsidies to fossil fuel industry.The government has also pledged to contribute $2.65 billion to help developing countries deal with climate change.What are three things you can do about climate change?. Rather than driving to work, take public transit or, better yet, walk or bike to work.. Be more energy efficient by switching to LED light bulbs, washing clothes in cold water and limiting use of your clothes dryer.. Try to cut down on the waste you send to landfills, which produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas.For more ways to help fight climate change, go to davidsuzuki.org( HYPERLINK http://www.davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/top-10-ways-you-can-stop-climate-change/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/top-10-ways-you-can-stop-climate-change/ ) !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada19","Opinion: The carbon dioxide emissions reduction agreement proposed for COP21 in Paris will hurt all Canadians","August 7, 2015 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","The consequences to Canadians if carbon dioxide emissions are sharply reduced are never discussed. Neither are they discussed on the world stage.This is strange because the consumption of fossil fuels, which are really concentrated sunlight, is the reason Canadians live better than ever before - they are living longer, healthier and are better nourished. In Canada, 74 per cent of our energy comes from coal, oil and natural gas and it is these energies that provide us with:Clean water and air, safe and abundant food, sanitation, protection of the environment.Health care including medicine, hospitals, doctors, nursesShelter including houses, apartments, cottages, parks.Schools, factories, heating, air conditioning, lighting, pets, clothing.Communication including telephones, computers, TV, movies, cameras, email, newspapers.Transportation including cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, roads, bridges, airports.You can probably add many more items to that list.Reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 28 per cent below the 2005 level by 2025 was the plan submitted in May by Canada to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21) to be held in December 2015.By thinking carefully about your choices, you can begin to understand why there is a very high cost to the welfare of Canadians in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Any removal or shrinkage of any of these items will hurt many Canadians. And, Canadians are generous people who help others in less fortunate parts of the world.Renewable energies are a false hope for replacing fossil fuels and their benefits. Renewables were virtually 100 per cent of the fuel supply as wood, concentrated solar energy, in 1700 and are currently approximately 11 per centy. For reference, today, three quarters of renewable energy is hydro because it is concentrated energy and can provide electricity constantly or virtually instantly when needed.There were 600,000 people living in London in 1700 and forests were being guarded to prevent the theft of trees for fuel. The conversion to coal was not going well because mines were flooding. Thomas Newcomen invented the steam engine to pump water out of the mines. James Watt later made the steam engine more efficient and it was widely adopted.Today, there are many examples around the world where the environment suffers when fossil fuels are not the source of fuel. For example, witness the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic where there are no trees on the Haiti side. When people use wood and animal dung for fuel, there are no trees and nothing grows because of a lack of soil nutrients. In the U.S. there are as many trees today as there were in 1850 when the railroads and steam boats were burning wood faster than it could grow. The trees were saved by coal.Sometimes people forget that humans are as much a natural part of the environment as every other living thing. Humans and every living thing change their environment just by living. We must make the Earth work well for both people and the environment. To sacrifice people to the environment is just as wrong as sacrificing the environment to people.It is essential that Canadians recommend to their elected representatives that Canada must not sign the COP 21 treaty in Paris in December 2015. Canada must provide leadership in this area, even though currently it can be unpopular. And, at some point, we must realistically address the question of future energy supply.H.

Following the commitments to carbon reduction made at COP21, public and private stakeholders are targeting the complete decarbonisation of the sector, with an immediate focus on existing technologies that offer environmental and economic efficiencies.The historic commitments made at the COP21 in Paris are aimed at limiting the global temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution to 2 degrees Celsius - the point beyond which scientists believe catastrophic climate change will occur. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that it will require $16.5 trillion of spending on renewables and energy through to 2030 to achieve this goal.Unique opportunities for new services and products stemming from the renewable energy and energy efficiency streams in the buildings sector are further being supported by global shifts in policy. The European Union has committed to eliminate the negative climate impact of buildings, targeting GHG reduction opportunities of up to 95% by 2050.

So far, all of the 125 INDC submissions (which cover more than 150 countries) confirm that by including coverage of energy sector emissions, and many include targets or actions to address them.The most common energy-related measures are those that target increased renewables deployment (40% of submissions), IEA says.Seven out of every ten units of additional electricity generation through to 2030 is projected to be low-carbon, bringing the share of total electricity generation from low-carbon sources from one-third today to nearly 45% in 2030.This will ensure that while global power sector emissions stay broadly flat, electricity demand increases by more than 40% to 2030.In essence, at the global level, the link between rising electricity demand and rising related CO2 emissions will be broken - an important step towards further decarbonisation.(USD 1 = EUR 0.899)\l"

Many citizens are disillusioned with your climate change pronouncements right now. On March 18 your government failed its first real on-the-ground climate test.By quietly approving a new fossil fuel industry for Canada - LNG for export - you have locked Canada into a massive new fossil fuel paradigm for decades to come. How can you possibly justify this and simultaneously attempt to transition Canada to a new low-carbon economy? We thought ""real change"" included real action on climate change.By approving the Woodfibre LNG project in Howe Sound, B.C.'s iconic and world renowned fjord, your government has broken faith with thousands of hopeful citizens who voted for your party in the last election.COP21 that ""Canada is back."" It was an exciting message. Under Harper we gave up hope that we could leave a safe and sustainable future for our children. Mr. Trudeau, you have no idea how hard so many of us worked to put you on that world stage!In addition to the climate issues of approving Canada's first LNG export project - two egregious components under your government's control remain unaddressed: 1. The once-through seawater cooling system: cheap - but also banned in California and Europe as hugely destructive to marine ecosystems. After decades of industrial abuse Howe Sound is actually returning to life. The salmon fishery recently reopened. Herring have rebounded. Whales, orcas and dolphins have reappeared.Approving Woodfibre's discharge into the ocean of 400 million litres per day of hot chlorinated water for 25 years is simply unacceptable. 2. The hazards of LNG as a dangerous cargo: LNG tankers are classified as the second most dangerous ships on the ocean, next only to ships carrying explosives. Designation of LNG plant and LNG tanker hazard zones are compulsory in the U.S. We have no such regulations in Canada. This is also unacceptable.Unless these shortcomings are addressed head-on, impacts on marine life and people will come back to haunt you. A very large community of B.C. voters have not given permission for Woodfibre LNG. Your words are eloquent, but approval of this project is not!Jackie DeRoo West Vancouver\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada30","Canada has yet to do its part in fighting climate change; If this country is truly 'back' it will need to show it at the COP 21 United Nations conference in Par....","November 25, 2015 Wednesday","The Gazette (Montreal)","""Canada is back!"" federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna proudly proclaimed earlier this month.COP21 United Nations climate change negotiations that will begin in a few days, in Paris.I was excited to hear those words. As someone who has been following Canada's behaviour at nine of these conferences, I was ecstatic finally to be able to shed the shame I had typically experienced under the Harper government. The Canada intent on stalling the UN process, a country that disregarded the threat of climate change and the impact of fossilfuel extraction on First Nations communities - a Canada that was very much un-Canadian - is gone.We are back.But, are we, yet? We have had a change in government, but have we had a change in climate policy?Each country within the UN climate process was required to submit its own national contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So far, it looks as if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is still planning to take Harper's plan to these climate talks - a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.6 per cent based on 1990 levels by 2030. When pressed on this plan earlier last week, McKenna said, ""You can't just come up with targets out of thin air."" She's right - but there has already been a wealth of research that has been conducted to inform better targets. A report by McGill and UNESCO's Sustainable Canada Dialogues found that Canada could source 100 per cent of its energy from ""low-carbon electricity"" by 2035. Another study conducted by Stanford University found that 139 countries - including Canada - could transition to 100 per cent solar, wind and water energy by 2050.And Canadians want this change. An Oraclepoll Research survey conducted this month found that 70 per cent of Canadians want the federal government to ""legally enforce limits on carbon pollution,"" while more than 84 per cent want the government to help stimulate the renewable energy economy.Our elected leaders are starting to take notice. On Sunday, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley unveiled a plan to limit the province's oil production and to invest in renewable energy jobs. The province - the largest consumer of coal in the country - also announced it would phase coal out of use by 2030 and implement a carbon tax. Members of civil society acknowledged the initiative is a significant first step - but this at a time when we need a marathon on these issues.Nonetheless, Notley's announcement was significant: the province, which contains the world's third-largest oil reserves, in effect acknowledged that fossil fuels don't have a future. This is the kind of ambition we require from our leaders: an acknowledgement of the severity of climate change, and an understanding that renewable energy sources are already profitable and on their way.Moving into the COP21 talks this week, Canadians will expect more of this type of leadership from Canada. We will expect cooperation - no more bullying or backroom deals of the past.We expect more ambition on the part of our prime minister and federal environment minister.The current plan being delivered to the UN falls short. Trudeau can do more. Canada is taking nowhere near its fair share of responsibility for climate change.We also expect Canada to pledge to stop subsidizing fossil fuels. There is absolutely no reason why we should be spending $2.74 billion taxpayer dollars on subsidies, including tax breaks, for an industry that is among the most profitable in the world.It is clear that when it comes to climate change, it is time for our leaders to move beyond their rhetoric and walk their talk. As a young Canadian, I would love for the Canada I know - an international symbol of peaceful diplomacy, kindness and fairness - to be back. It's time Trudeau and McKenna play their part.Leehi Yona of Dollard-des-Ormeaux is a Senior Fellow at Dartmouth College and will be attending the Paris United Nations climate negotiations.

U.S. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz also will attend the event to promote the president's Climate Action Plan and the need for all countries to adopt ambitious emissions reductions targets.Morrisey and Paxton believe that U.S. officials have a duty to disclose to their peers in Paris the legal challenges facing the Clean Power Plan and that opposing states are likely to be victorious when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ultimately rules. Copies of the letter were sent to Obama; McCarthy; prominent members of the House and Senate; environmental officials in countries including Germany, Russia, China, France and India; and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.""The president's representations regarding his administration's CO2 emission reduction plans are based on unilateral executive action that is unlikely to be the law for very long,"" the letter said.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada32","Merry low-carbon-footprint Christmas","December 4, 2015 Friday","The Guelph Mercury (Ontario, Canada)","The fight to save the planet starts at home.But it's a message that has, of late, been getting more than its usual share of attention.It is very much the message of a new Canadian government at the United Nations in Paris - COP21. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said nations have a great deal to learn from indigenous peoples about caring for the planet, and from people offering solutions in our cities and provinces.It was also the message brought to Guelph's St. George's Square last Sunday afternoon, by 100 people participating in what was dubbed a Cool the Planet rally. It was one of thousands that were held around the world in support of the Paris conference.Local organizers urged participants to pressure governments. But they also reminded supporters that individual efforts matter, and challenged them to carpool or use public transit; to buy local, organic, fair trade foods; and to reuse, repair or recycle before buying new.Every little change an individual makes at home can only help.While most of these suggestions apply year round, there are also steps we can take at this time of year to help reduce Santa's carbon footprint.You can, for example, lower the impact of holiday lighting. It's as simple as reducing the size of outdoor displays and/or turning them off at bedtime. LEDs and some outdoor minilights use less energy than traditional lighting strings.Store-bought cards and wrapping paper can be beautiful, elegant or fun. But they are also expensive and forgettable. Instead, wrap in alternatives that include old maps or leftover fabrics. Families will treasure cards with a grandchild's original artwork.And of course, a real Christmas tree is better than artificial.Like many people, I recognize the lure of a fake tree. Pull it out of storage, set it up in a matter of minutes, no watering required or needles to sweep up, and you stuff it back into storage when the holiday spirit wanes.Since many fake trees now come with lights and other decorations built right in, what could be more convenient?But we tend to keep our fakes an average of six seasons, after which they clog landfills for centuries. Most are made of metal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and older models include lead. The manufacturing process and shipping from China burn fossil fuels.You'd have to keep your fake for 20 years before the environmental factors balanced out.Real trees, to begin with, help us breathe.Ontario farmers grow one million trees annually. Each tree scrubs carbon monoxide from the air, and less than a half-hectare of Christmas trees produces oxygen for 18 people.Real trees can also be treecycled. Left to decompose, they release nutrients back into the soil. They can be mulched or chipped for use in home gardens and public parks.Last year, the Children's Foundation of Guelph and Wellington picked up real Christmas trees for a minimum donation of $10. The trees were converted into wood chips, for use in an organic farming program for youth. The army of volunteers raised close to $24,000.This year, local resident Edward Jackson is running a live Christmas tree campaign. He's purchased 25 potted trees, which he will deliver by Dec. 21. He will then pick them up by New Year's Eve, so they can be planted on public lands.Each tree costs $85, which covers his expenses and helps fund an under-15 girls' soccer team.My husband and I are trying our first potted Christmas tree this year. Because we plan to enjoy it for years to come, we've already dug a hole in our backyard for the eventual planting.We envision adding one new tree each year, over time building our own carbon-scrubbing stand of Christmas trees - tiny though it may be.It is, in a very real sense, a tiny gesture. Just one tree per year.But if everyone started just one new climate-friendly tradition, the combined impact would be anything but small.\l"

The government, said Notley, is determined that its solution will keep capital in Alberta. We must do this, so that we have the means to diversify and broaden our economy in the years and decades to come, as the world evolves towards a decarbonized future. The new NDP government made a first move on carbon pricing in the spring when it tripled the net effect of the provinces existing rules governing the price of carbon, she said. The cost of excess greenhouse-gas output will rise to $20 per tonne at the start of 2016 from the current $15 levy with a further increase to $30 per tonne, at the beginning of 2017 ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/6/25/alberta-increasing-carbon-rate-30-tonne-it-renews-/#axzz3n2dqUsPiDOB, June 25, 2015). The net price of carbon in Alberta has increased but still remains relatively low, said Notley. But we have demonstrated that it is possible to act meaningfully on carbon pricing for sound economic and environmental reasons, without triggering economic hardship.The government, she promised, will phase in change prudently, as the economy recovers. We are listening carefully to Albertans about this issue [climate change and the environment] because Albertans feel strongly  as do many business leaders in the energy industry  that it is long, long past due for the Government of Alberta to get it right on the environment. Air pollution and poor air quality is a direct threat to the health of Albertas children and seniors, according to Notley.Albertans know all too well that environmental issues  and specifically, the issue of climate change  is a key global problem that every community and every jurisdiction must help address, especially energy producing jurisdictions like ours, she said. If we dont get it right on this issue, a solution is going to be imposed on us, sooner or later, by others. By the federal government, and by our markets, who will increasingly insist that energy products they buy be mined and processed responsibly. If we want a made-in-Alberta environmental policy that works for Alberta and keeps our capital in Alberta, then the time to act is now. The province also needs to act because doing so is going to be the price of admission to those energy markets, Notley warned. A climate change review panel chaired by Andrew Leach from the University of Alberta is currently consulting with Albertans, industry partners and experts and later this fall with the benefit of its advice, the Alberta government will set out its plan. The premier said that she expects that, in addition to the issue of carbon pricing, it will be looking at coal production, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Alberta currently relies on coal-fired plants for about 55 per cent of its power supply, burning more coal than the rest of Canada combined, she said. We will be looking for a strategy to phase out the use of coal as quickly as we reasonably can, without imposing unnecessary price shocks on consumers, or risking security of supply, or unnecessarily stranding capital.When it comes to renewable energy, a roadmap is needed, and we need to get the economics of that conversion right, said Notley. There is a lot of good news in the field of renewable energy, which is increasingly price-competitive. With a number of Alberta energy companies investing in renewable energy production, the province is accumulating some best-of-class experience with new energy alternatives, she noted. Alberta also is the only jurisdiction in Canada without an energy efficiency program which is unacceptable and the government will change that, said Notley, suggesting that the area offers some important opportunities for partnership between government and industry  and for job creation.And on all of these issues, there are excellent opportunities for partnership with manufacturers and investors in Quebec, according to the premier, who said she has been discussing these with Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard.Notley also said she is very much looking forward to being part of a delegation of Canadian governments at COP21, the United Nations climate change conference in Paris.\l"

Named for Ted Weatherill, a former head of the Canada Labour Relations Board who racked up $150,000 in meal expenses, the awards celebrate the ""best of the worst in government waste."" The trophies, which feature a golden pig, are reused every year since, in 18 years, no-one has yet shown up to accept their Teddy. ""Strangely enough, the people who receive our awards are generally not pleased with it,"" said the federation's federal director, Aaron Wudrick. The highlights are included below.Canada's 350-strong delegation to the COP 21 conference in Paris (Winner)A lot got done at COP 21, the 2015 United Nations climate-change conference, but almost none of it had to do with the fact that Canada dispatched everyone it could find to the December summit. An incredible 350 Canadian delegates made the trip, compared to 124 and 96 sent by the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. ""Canada is back,"" tweeted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ironically, among the first to sound the alarm about the Parisian love-in was B.C. Green Party MLA Andrew Weaver, a well-known climate scientist. He decried the showing as ""over the top,"" ""ridiculous"" and ""a waste of taxpayer's money.""Twitter/PMOA tweet from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showing the Canadian contingent at the United Nations climate change summit in Le Bourget, near Paris, France.The Canadian High Commission in London, England (Nominee)The Canadian Taxpayers Federation comes from the brown M&;Ms school of taxpayer waste. In order to test the technical diligence of its promoters, the rock band Van Halen famously requested bowls of M&;Ms picked clean of ""brown ones"" - and would order venue-wide audits if brown ones were found. Similarly, the CTF is fine with focusing on statistically insignificant spending outrages, since they may reveal a much bigger problem behind the scenes. That's why Canada's High Commission to the United Kingdom, headed by former B.C. premier Gordon Campbell, was nominated for throwing a $200,000 party, including spending $10,000 to ship in B.C. wine and $5,000 to have four Mounties in red serge.RelatedJen Gerson: Good money after bad and we're unwilling to let it fail - it's time to nationalize Bombardier( http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/jen-gerson-the-case-for-nationalizing-bombardierhttp://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/jen-gerson-the-case-for-nationalizing-bombardier )Robyn Urback: After all the scandals, Ontario Liberals manage to maintain a facade of moral righteousness( http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/robyn-urback-after-all-the-scandals-ontario-liberals-manage-to-maintain-a-facade-of-moral-righteousnesshttp://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/robyn-urback-after-all-the-scandals-ontario-liberals-manage-to-maintain-a-facade-of-moral-righteousness )Ontario spent $600,000 on pension plan ads during federal election: taxpayer group( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/ontario-spent-600000-on-pension-plan-ads-during-federal-election-taxpayer-grouphttp://news.nationalpost.com/news/ontario-spent-600000-on-pension-plan-ads-during-federal-election-taxpayer-group )Surprisingly little oversight when it comes to a prime minister's expenses( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/surprisingly-little-oversight-when-it-comes-to-a-prime-ministers-expenses )Bombardier Inc. (Winner)If winners were selected solely on their raw drain on the public purse, then ""corporate welfare"" would place first every year, Wudrick said. But Bombardier was handed a lifetime achievement award simply for being the most egregious offender. According to CTF's calculations, the transport firm has taken $3.8 billion in government handouts since 1966. And, just as the CTF was holding its Wednesday awards ceremony in Ottawa, Bombardier was seeking another $1 billion from federal coffers.Thunder Bay Biomass Plant (Nominee)These days, instead of racking up gargantuan steakhouse bills, governments are more likely to waste money on ill-advised economic development schemes - particularly if it involves something trendy like green energy, the CTF says. Thus is the case of the former Thunder Bay Generating Station, a former coal plant that was converted to burn biomass. But due to a technical oversight, it can only burn imported biomass from Norway.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Canadian Taxpayers Federation Federal Director Aaron Wudrick announces the winners of the 18th annual Teddy Government Waste awards during a news conference on Parliament Hill, Wednesday February 24, 2016 in Ottawa.P.E.I.'s 'uplifting' tourism guide (Winner)The government of P.E.I. had already printed 180,000 copies of its annual tourism guide before someone noticed that the cover appeared to feature a man lounging in a beach chair with a visible erection. But, unusually for a Teddy Award winner, P.E.I. showed admirable fiscal restraint in dealing with the oversight.

It comes at a critical juncture in the early days of the Liberal government.Trudeau called the meeting so the federal, provincial and territorial governments can discuss Canada's strategy going into the in Paris that starts Nov. 30.More than 190 countries from around the globe will try to finalize a post-2020 agreement for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.Trudeau also has invited the premiers and federal opposition leaders to join him in Paris, as the federal government promises to work with the provinces on a new national plan for tackling climate change.At Monday's meeting, the federal cabinet and premiers will receive a climate briefing by some of the country's top climate scientists, followed by a working dinner.Trudeau has said the dinner will see the leaders ""exactly discuss the kind of strong and cohesive message we will be delivering as Canadians in Paris at the very important COP 21 (climate-change) conference.""However, the federal government won't release Canada's updated greenhouse gas targets at the Paris conference, and will instead talk with the provinces over the coming months to craft what it hopes will be ambitious, but realistic targets, and a plan for achieving them.""This framework won't be imposed unilaterally.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada55","ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE A PRIORITY","January 21, 2016 Thursday","Canadian Government News","Ottawa: Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat has issued the follwoing news release: \~ \~Federal, provincial and territorial environment ministers today agreed that climate change will be on the agenda for the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) moving forward on an ongoing basis, with the Climate Change Conference in Paris as the topic of their meeting in 2015. After 2015, Ministers, in collaboration with senior officials, will decide the topic for the following years. ""Canadians attach the greatest importance to the protection and enhancement of the environment,"" said Janice Sherry, PEI\' s Minister of Environment, Labour and Justice, who hosted her colleagues at the annual meeting of CCME. ""As ministers, we are working together to ensure that environmental initiatives are effective and that they contribute to the well-being of Canadians."" Ministers agreed to work collaboratively within provincial and territorial jurisdictions to achieve real reductions in greenhouse gases, which will support economic competitiveness as Canada transitions to a low carbon economy. Ministers shared information about the various approaches jurisdictions are taking to address climate change. They also discussed the upcoming round of international negotiations starting with the United Nations in Lima, Peru in December 2014. They noted that as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Canada is expected to identify its post-2020 intended nationally determined contributions in advance of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015. Ministers also adopted a vision for waste management in Canada and committed to take action in their respective jurisdictions on waste. In keeping with the vision, many jurisdictions have already begun to identify sectors and waste streams where they will take action, such as waste from the institutional, commercial and industrial (ICI) sectors, construction, renovation and demolition (CRD) waste, and organic waste.  While we have made progress on waste management in Canada over the last several years, we must do better, said Minister Sherry.  The vision we have adopted today is to make Canada a world leader in waste management. CCME will develop tools to support jurisdictions in their efforts to achieve substantial reductions in waste disposed that will help improve Canada\' s record on recycling and reducing waste. Ministers adopted four key objectives: \~\~\~ Improving Canada\' s recycling rates and reducing the amount of waste created; \~\~\~ Developing tools for environmentally-sound waste management in Canada; \~\~\~ Changing producer and consumer behavior; and \~\~\~ Addressing the challenges faced by remote and northern communities in managing waste. Governments will also continue to implement extended producer responsibility as agreed under the Canada-wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) adopted by ministers in 2009. EPR encourages producers to design products with consideration for the environment, creates economic opportunities, and supports local waste programs. Although Qu\'e9bec agrees with CCME\' s vision for waste management and supports collaboration in this area, it does not endorse a common evaluation mechanism, since it is already implementing its own Qu\'e9bec Policy on Residual Materials and will report on progress to the National Assembly and to Qu\'e9bec\' s population. Ministers considered progress by jurisdictions in implementing the Air Quality Management System, adopted in 2012. Officials reported work on the AQMS is ongoing by all jurisdictions, except Qu\'e9bec, which has already implemented its own regulation. Jurisdictions will work to identify opportunities to address emissions from mobile sources and noted that Environment Canada has published the first industrial emission requirements. Ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter and ozone have also been established, while standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide are currently being developed. All jurisdictions will collaborate on developing other elements of the system, notably air zones and airsheds. Ministers agreed on the importance of cumulative effects management and have committed to identify lessons learned and develop best management practices to support sound environmental decision-making. A cumulative effect is a change in the environment caused by multiple interactions among human activities and natural processes that accumulate across space and time. Ministers noted the linkages between many environmental and energy issues that could benefit from cumulative effects management to control, minimize or prevent adverse consequences. Ministers share the public\' s concerns about prevention and response to spills associated with the transportation of hazardous goods. They agreed to review the state of spills prevention and response in Canada and to work together to identify best practices and emerging issues. Manitoba will host the next meeting of CCME. CCME is the primary minister-led intergovernmental forum for collective action on environmental issues of national and international concern. \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada57","Opportunities And Challenges Face Governments And Investors Post-COP 21: Carney, McKenna","April 15, 2016 Friday","Daily Oil Bulletin","Its crucial for the global private financial sector to have access to the right information that it currently does not have regarding the recent Paris environment agreement in order to take informed action, says Mark Carney, chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and governor of the Bank of England.There are some specific initiatives under the FSB and the G20 that France has also helped to push that we want to complete this year which will help change that and ensure the private financial sector has the information necessary not just to act on policy today, but to anticipate policy tomorrow, he told a panel discussion during the World Bank Group Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition inaugural High Level Assembly in Washington, D.C.The private sector and regulators must build up expertise in managing the financial aspects of carbon risk, suggested the former governor of the Bank of Canada. It is not something we have had to do outside of insurance, because those risks from a financial perspective have largely been over a horizon much beyond that of private actors. COP 21 starts to change that, and delivery on COP 21 will truly change that.Late last year, delegates at the United Nations 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) reached an agreement that strives to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and calls for a transparent system to account for climate action while strengthening countries abilities to deal with climate impacts, recover from climate impacts, as well as support nations in building clean, resilient economies ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/12/14/environmentalists-support-paris-agreement-call-can/#axzz45Wlyst75DOB, Dec. 14, 2015).According to Carney, an important ongoing G20 initiative aims to get the necessary carbon disclosure information published for all major companies. Another important G20 initiative works to build a true green bond market on private-sector terms.That means standardized terms, that means standardized disclosure, standardized certification, it means integrating green considerations into credit ratings, credible dispute resolution mechanisms \£6 and moving towards the global standards for all of that so you can move green finance from niche to the mainstream.He added that last years international climate agreement certainly has the attention of the private sector  a private sector constantly on the lookout for opportunities.Addressing the issue of energy and climate change is a challenge, but it is also a potential area of growth for business looking towards the greater inclusion of renewable technologies, noted Catherine McKenna, Canadas environment minister.It is a huge opportunity  a $3 trillion opportunity, she said, adding: If you are in oil and gas, then you should be thinking about renewables. That is a huge opportunity for you and your shareholders. That is what I keep on repeating  this is the way of the future. Jim Yong Kim, president of World Bank Group, told the panel that as the world comes together to deal with climate change, the only losers from the investment realm will be those who do not have the vision to see the great opportunities the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy can mean.We need people \£6 who will think more broadly about what it means to be an energy company. For countries who are specifically focused on exporting fossil fuels, I think we would be very happy to help them think about ways of diversifying their economy.He added: I think the losers in all of this are going to be those people who refuse to look at the science. I think that the losers are going to be the people who refuse to understand the implications for human beings on the planet of climate change.McKenna noted that the Canadian government and its working-group process certainly feels the pressure to act on the Paris agreement in order to deliver on international targets as the country looks sector by sector at how to best tackle climate change. She said her country is certainly committed to helping less-developed countries shift to renewables.We would not have had an ambitious Paris agreement without developing countries feeling that they were going to be supported\£6. In particular, [Canada] announced $2.65 billion that will go to support the least developed countries as a focus, because it is quite clear the cost to shift to renewables and adapt to the impacts of climate change is huge.However, McKenna added, governments alone cannot handle the massive issue of climate change and adjusting to a less carbon-intensive energy economy  private investment is vital to successful climate change mitigation. There simply is not enough government money, and so that is why we absolutely have to leverage private sector investment.If governments step up grants and provide money so that development banks or private institutions are willing to also help out, then governments can leverage the financing, she told the panel, and that is how Canada intends to approach the issue. I do feel quite confident that we are going in this direction and we recognize that we need to take action. Now we need to be very thoughtful on how we prioritize and really leverage the money.Kim said that if grant funding is available, then the big question is how to use that to leverage multilateral development banks and ultimately the private sector to make the sorts of investments that will reach the desired environmental outcomes.We have found that even in very difficult settings you can reduce the risk of investment so that you actually attract otherwise very conservative investors, he said, adding a triage approach is important, whereby governments and the investment community consider the most important, immediate actions that must occur, followed by other actions.I think, of course, that mitigation issue is huge, but I think we also must be very serious about getting projects going around adaptation. For Africa and for many of the poorest countries, they are being absolutely battered already with the impact of climate change \£6 and we need to start building climate-resilient infrastructure.Ultimately the decision of private players to invest in renewables will be a commercial decision, Carney said. The actual and prospective technology crossover points are crucial to such an investment decision from the massive pool of potential investment dollars, he noted. There is a US$100 trillion of fixed income assets in institutional hands. Less than one per cent is invested in anything that would approximate a renewable or green finance. \l"

It also makes sense, in the context, to speak of tides turning, or sea change.Montreal cellist and activist Rebecca Foon is on the phone excitedly talking up her climate-change consciousness-raising Pathway to Paris show, Sunday at the Rialto Theatre, with Thurston Moore, Brad Barr, Anne Waldman, AroarA and Sarah Pag\'e9. Foon wears two hats, playing and having co-organized.""I'm a musician,"" she says, ""and I've never been involved with anything that feels so powerful and moving, tapping into what I believe is the defining issue of our time.""Co-founded with Jesse Paris Smith, the Pathway to Paris project was launched last year. Foon first met Smith (Patti's daughter) at the Meltdown Festival in London seven years ago. They launched the shows Sept. 22, 2014 in a New York venue called Poisson Rouge with Moore, Patti Smith and Lenny Kaye, and R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, in the wake of the People's Climate March. That was held in 150 cities last September, and while crowd counts will vary (they always do), Foon says it drew 400,000 in New York alone.""We were just so inspired by that, but realized there was no celebration of it post-climate march."" She and Smith committed themselves to using their energies to ensure that did not happen again. ""We're trying to create a wave of music, and show that the public at large does care about this.""The POP Montreal event is part of a drive to a final show, Dec. 4 at Le Trianon in Paris, which will feature Thom Yorke, Patti Smith, Dhani Harrison (George's son), Flea, Jane Fonda and a cast of other luminaries including key players Bill McKibben and Naomi Klein. That is the Big One, timed to coincide with the United Nations (or COP21), taking place in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11.""The intention is to raise awareness around the talks, and to establish a legally binding agreement on climate change,"" Foon says.

""The number 350 means climate safety,"" the website says. ""To preserve a livable planet, scientists tell us we must reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from its current level of 400 parts per million to below 350 ppm.""Foon is engagingly enthusiastic. She's also considerably accomplished. Since relocating from her native B.C., she has played in the chamber-rock ensembles Thee Silver Mt. Zion and Set Fire to Flames, and won a 2014 Juno for best instrumental album as part of the post-drone group Esmerine. She also plays under the name Saltland.Similarly, ""everyone involved in Pathway to Paris really cares. That kind of really honest energy translates onstage in a spiritual way. There's no money or ego involved. I think we've tapped into something people have been looking for. It's kind of magic. It's art and politics - and love.""Among the star attractions here: Thurston Moore, whose Osheaga gig this summer was a near-perfect primer in structured, elegant noise-rock; Brad Barr and harpist Sarah Pag\'e9, of local sensation the Barr Brothers; AroarA, the dreamy duo of Andrew Whiteman and Ariel Engle; poet Anne Waldman, with musicians; and special guests.Politically, ""we've got to take this to the next level,"" Foon says. ""It's sometimes easy to get jaded in the music business.""The United Nations Framework on Climate Change has picked up on this concert. We're getting requests for co-operation all the time.""Locally - in the broadest sense - ""I think there's an opportunity with the Montreal show to bring up the election, with Harper, and touch on that."" Well, that's one way to get the world, and pop/rock stars, to know we have an election going on here - and with the growing sense that Canada's long-standing rep as the White Stetsons of peace and environmentalism is in the sewer, one way to jumper-cable it back to life.""Maybe this will have zero impact,"" Foon concedes, meaning both the POP Montreal initiative and the larger movement. ""And that's depressing, and a risk. Our hope is that, by bringing together strong voices, at least it's affecting the people. That people like Thom Yorke and Patti Smith care, it's creating a ripple in the music industry and making it cool, and that's important.""AT A GLANCEPOP Montreal presents Pathway to Paris Sunday, Sept. 20 at the Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave. Performers include Thurston Moore, Anne Waldman and Fast Speaking Music (Ambrose Bye, Devin Brahja Waldman), Jesse Paris Smith, Rebecca Foon, AroarA, Brad Barr and Sarah Pag\'e9.

Turning a trip to Alaska into a clarion call for change, U.S. President Barack Obama has made a compelling case for bold and urgent action on reducing greenhouse gases.No Canadian leader has managed to do quite the same thing - even with an election underway and a crucial United Nations climate change conference coming in a matter of months.Obama's Alaskan tour included visiting the state's melting glaciers, hearing concerns from local residents, participating in a television survival show, and flying into communities hard-hit by changes wrought by a warmer climate.Through it all, Obama's message was the same: ""we're not acting fast enough"" to blunt the ravages of global warming. ""Climate change is no longer some far-off problem."" He acknowledged the role of the United States in creating that problem and assumed responsibility for helping to solve it.This is something the entire world - not just Americans - needs to hear. It's more than just talk. Sharp carbon emission cuts undertaken by the Obama administration are worth emulating, especially by leaders of this country. Ottawa has so far been notable only for its failures. The Harper government, frankly, has no credibility on this file.Each federal party has policies for dealing with climate change, some more specific than others. But the issue hasn't generated much attention in a contest dominated by the economy and Sen. Mike Duffy's corruption trial. It would be useful to know, for example, precisely how each party leader would handle future oilsands development. Expanded oilsands output is fundamentally at odds with reducing the country's carbon footprint.As Obama noted, climate change is ""a challenge that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other.""

Developing new government policies will take more time as Trudeau has committed to go to Paris with the provincial premiers and cooperate with them on a national strategy.""Canada is going to be a strong and positive actor on the world stage, including in Paris at COP 21McKenna, a rookie MP from Ottawa, has a background practicing international trade law. She founded Canadian Lawyers Abroad, acted as a negotiator for the UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor as well as serving as executive director of the public policy organization Banff Forum.""Every government does things differently and puts portfolios together in its own manner,"" noted Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""We'll be looking to work with the government ministries that overlap our responsibilities ... the minister of environment and climate change is one of those we will be reaching out to engage.""Another will be rookie Winnipeg MP Jim Carr, who was named natural resources minister.Under Harper, Ottawa developed a GHG policy for the transportation and electricity sectors - the two largest sources of emissions - but did not for the fastest-growing source of emissions, the oil and gas industry. Trudeau has pledged to ""establish a pan-Canadian framework"" to address the climate issue.The new environment, climate change and energy committee, to be chaired by Dion, includes, among others, McKenna, Carr, International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland and Science Minister Kirsty Duncan, a University of Windsor climatology professor who served on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Dion, who chaired the 2005 UN Climate Change Summit in Montreal, made the GHG issue the key theme of his 2008 election campaign as Liberal leader and was trounced by Harper.""Stephane Dion, love him or hate, you've got to give him kudos for sticking to his guns,"" said Greenpeace's Stewart. ""He believes strongly action on climate change has to happen ... he's not going to let it to be window dressing. You can't expect to appoint him to chair a committee and not expect it to rock some boats.""A carbon tax was a key element in Dion's Green Shift and Trudeau has already warned it's coming after Canada walked away from the Kyoto accord and is falling short of its 2009 commitment at Copenhagen to cut GHG emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. Ottawa has now set a 30 per cent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030.Canada accounts for about 1.6 per cent of GHGs worldwide, making it the ninth-largest emitter globally and was often dismissed as a laggard on climate action under Harper.""Make no mistake,"" Trudeau said in June, ""the Liberal Party will be putting a price on carbon.""He's also said setting an ambitious but arbitrary target to reduce GHGs without a credible plan to achieve it - working with provinces, given they own the natural resources - is essentially worthless. Alberta's new NDP government has a panel reviewing its climate change policies - including a levy on excess GHG emissions - that will report by December.""There are a lot of moving pieces right now federally and provincially,"" McMillan said.The challenge for CAPP members is they're moving away from the industry-friendly policies that have for so long defined the Conservative governments in Ottawa and Alberta.Stephen Ewart is a Calgary Herald columnist HYPERLINK mailto:sewart@calgaryherald.comsewart@calgaryherald.com( HYPERLINK mailto:sewart@calgaryherald.comsewart@calgaryherald.comtwitter.com/stephen_ewart( HYPERLINK http://twitter.com/stephen_ewarthttp://twitter.com/stephen_ewart\l"

Instead, think of our shared track to perdition as heading inexorably towards three per cent (or even four) over the next 50 years.The reasons are clear: Though the dozens of nations who gathered to fix a broken world vowed to clean up their various acts, no binding, legal agreement emerged from the multinational gab-fest to force their hands should they lose the courage of their latent conviction. Meanwhile developing countries, which have not yet played a major role in global warming, remain reluctant to carry a weight of environmental responsibility equal to those who have already compromised the ecosystem of this planet.And yet the hosannas issuing from COP21 were among the most fulsome since the Kyoto Accord in the early 1990s (from which, again, little durably reliable emerged). ""The Paris Agreement allows each delegation and group of countries to go home with their heads held high,"" said Laurent Fabius, President of the COP 21 UN Climate change conference and French Foreign Minister.

Hollande told the 53 countries represented in Malta that mankind has a moral duty to fight climate change as much as terrorism.India's Modi took a pass on the Malta summit, although his country the most populous in the Commonwealth. It's also seen as a significant impediment to a global climate pact, given India's refusal to rein in its greenhouse gas emissions.India, already the world's third largest emitter, has said its emissions could triple over the next 15 years as it expands coal-fired electricity generation to power a developing economy.Trudeau told reporters he remains optimistic India will come onboard for the next, post-2020 climate pact being negotiated over the next two weeks.Trudeau pointed to what he called evidence of a ""clear political will to move"" by the world's largest emitters, the United States and China - and the fact that India is at least engaging with the UN process - as reason to be optimistic.China and the U.S. signed a bilateral climate accord last November that was noteworthy because China agreed for the first time that its emissions would peak by 2030.None of that, nor the emission reduction targets countries have pledged in advance of the Paris talks, will keep global temperatures from soaring past the 2 C degree increase scientists say is a critical threshold for many parts of the world.But Trudeau argues citizens ""are going to look very negatively at countries that don't participate,"" in the latest global effort to find a framework to begin controlling emissions.""For a concrete example of that we need look not look much further than our own story and the difficulty we had getting pipel"

Most of them have already presented plans to slash or rein in greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, when the deal is supposed to take effect.Allianz investment chief Andreas Gruber told ZDF television that the company's decision was made partially out of concern over global warming, but also because it made good financial sense.He said the company is convinced climate-damaging investments won't pay off in the future and said Allianz will double wind energy investments to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in coming years.

For example: \£6\£6Global warming stopped 18 years ago despite a 10 per cent rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.Hurricane activity is at a record low.Medium to strong tornadoes have become less frequent.Antarctic sea ice cover has been increasing at about 1-2 per cent per decade.Rather than engage in a ""most disingenuous and deceitful distortion of established science,"" as Brophey charges, Harris and the ICSC are simply pointing out what is happening in the real world, not the flawed climate models held dear by the UN.And the ICSC is anything but a ""denier lobby group."" We explain that climate has changed continually since the origin of the atmosphere billions of years ago and so we need to help people adapt. Yet, because of pressure from people like Brophey, of the $1 billion a day spent worldwide on climate finance, only seven per cent goes to helping vulnerable people adapt to climate change today.This is immoral, effectively valuing the lives of people yet to be born more than those in need today.Of course, we must reduce pollution where it is a problem and conserve energy when it is scarce, but the idea that we know the future of climate decades in advance, let alone that we can control it, is pure fantasy.What is not fantasy is the fact that, because of unjustified concerns about climate, millions of impoverished Africans are prevented from using the one source of energy that is affordable and within their reach - fossil fuels which still provide some 86 per cent of the world's energy.Founding Chairman and strategic adviser, International Climate Science Coalition !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

The prime minister's wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, and two of their three children, daughter Ella-Grace and son Hadrien, have joined him on the trip.Trudeau's first stop was in London on Wednesday for an audience with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace, the site of his late father's iconic pirouette behind her majesty in 1977 during a G7 conference that sparked an international sensation. Trudeau met Her Majesty around lunchtime, his second time meeting her in his life and first as prime minister.In an emailed statement provided by the Prime Minister's Office, Trudeau recalled meeting her when he was young and his father, Pierre, was prime minister.""She was always lovely and gracious. She was very tall which points out how little I was at the time,"" Trudeau said. ""They were nice moments because I knew how much my dad liked her. You could tell my father was really proud to be introducing his son to the Queen.""The prime minister will then head to 10 Downing Street later Wednesday for his first official bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron.The agenda includes the coalition's campaign against the Islamic State, the situation in Syria, the refugee crisis, and Ukraine, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The escalating crisis between Turkey and Russia is almost certainly to come up, after Turkish aircraft shot down a Russian jet near the Turkish-Syrian border.Trudeau and Cameron will also discuss the implementation of the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which has been signed by Canada and the EU but still must be ratified and approved by both Parliaments.Trudeau will then head to Valletta, Malta, for the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting Nov. 27-29, where the 53 member countries - representing about 2.3 billion people - will chart a future course for an organization facing a bit of an existential crisis.Leaders will select a new secretary-general to succeed Kamalesh Sharma, a former Indian diplomat who has led the organization since 2008.But they will also discuss pressing global issues such as climate change, economic challenges and opportunities, terrorism and radicalization, the refugee crisis, and gender equality. They also expect to implement a planning framework titled ""Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.""""There is an opportunity for Canada to be there at the Commonwealth where some other countries like the U.S., like Germany, will not be, and we'll be able to push some of the countries that have been less enthusiastic about an ambitious resolution coming through Paris, and actually be an active proponent and player on that stage,"" Trudeau told reporters Monday evening.""It's not just about Canada stepping up itself on the fight against climate change. It's also about Canada engaging with the world community in a leadership role and encouraging the kind of actions that are going to be necessary across the entire world.""He'll also be raising the issues of human rights, democracy and good governance ""that I think are necessary at the Commonwealth,"" Trudeau said.""I certainly won't shy away from the necessary conversations to promote the kind of openness, responsibility and transparency that Canada has demonstrated,"" he said.On the margins of the Commonwealth meeting, Trudeau will hold bilateral talks with His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, and other Commonwealth leaders.Former prime minister Stephen Harper grew frustrated with the Commonwealth and specifically Sharma, the outgoing secretary-general, for refusing to move the 2013 meeting from Sri Lanka, plunging relations to their lowest point in Canadian-Commonwealth history.Harper boycotted the Sri Lanka gathering, saying that attending the meeting would have effectively endorsed the country's terrible human rights record.The former Conservative government also pulled $20 million in discretionary Commonwealth funding, arguing the organization was turning a ""blind eye"" to human rights abuses, undemocratic behaviour and religious intolerance. Canada is the second-highest contributor to the Commonwealth, next to the United Kingdom.Trudeau will then travel to Paris for a meeting with French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande to discuss the climate-change conference, CETA, the situation in Syria, the migration crisis in Europe, and undoubtedly the recent terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.Trudeau has invited Canada's premiers to join him, Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna and Foreign Affairs Minister St\'e9phane Dion with the Canadian delegation at the United Nations climate conference.According to the Prime Minister's Office, Trudeau ""will deliver a national statement highlighting Canada's commitment to working with international partners to reduce carbon emissions and grow a climate-resilient global economy.""The prime minister and Canada's premiers held a first ministers meeting Monday in Ottawa that was largely dedicated to climate change, ahead of the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) that starts Nov. 30 in Paris.""In Paris, a united Canada will demonstrate that we are serious about climate change,"" Trudeau told reporters late Monday.

But then, like the tobacco companies, evil Exxon chose to suppress their own science conclusions. Harvard's inimitable Naomi Oreskes described it all in a recent New York Times op-ed: ""Millions of American's wanted to smoke. Then they came to understand how deadly tobacco products were. Tragically, that understanding was long delayed because the tobacco industry worked for decades to hide the truth, promoting a message of scientific uncertainty instead. The same thing has happened with climate change.The story, as told at length by Inside Climate News, is that Exxon, like the tobacco giants, knew their products were killing people and/or the planet, but the companies suppressed their findings. According to Oreskes, if Exxon had been ""upfront"" at the time about the dangers of greenhouse gasses, the whole world might have tackled the carbon threat decades ago.Obstacles to a legally binding universal carbon agreement suggest no agreement is in sight for ParisThe idea is at best fanciful and in reality preposterous. Whether Exxon's internal science work led to any pioneer discovery on climate change is highly doubtful and certainly not proven in any of the research uncovered so far. But even if it had, so what? The world has not experienced a shortage of official and unofficial research claiming looming climate catastrophe. Nobody has been in the dark on the issue. Billions and billions of dollars have been spent over the decades by UN agencies, governments, foundations and others on an escalating campaign. The world has been awash in alarmism for 30 years, Exxon's role being all but non-existent by comparison.The Exxon conspiracy story, thin though it might be, is but one part of the massive build-up to the climate summit. New reports, studies, claims, alarming analyses, speeches, conventions, meetings, advocacy sessions, advance programs, manifestos and screeds will flood global media in coming weeks.

The speech expanded on five well-worn themes that were central to the Liberals' stunning upset victory in the Oct. 19 election.First and foremost, it reiterated Trudeau's pledge to cut the tax rate for middle-income earners and provide a more generous child benefit to those who need it, all paid for by a tax hike on the wealthiest one per cent.The speech did not specifically reiterate Trudeau's promise to run deficits of no more than $10 billion over the next three years and produce a surplus in the final year of his mandate. But it promised more generally - ""a fiscal plan that is responsible, transparent and suited to challenging economic times.""The speech highlighted Trudeau's democratic reform promises: to run an open and transparent government, reform the House of Commons to empower backbenchers, reform the Senate and replace the first-past-the-post electoral system.On the environment, it promised to continue working with the provinces to put a price on carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.It did not specifically repeat Trudeau's campaign promise to meet with the premiers to hash out a national climate change strategy within 90 days of the United Nations underway now in Paris.It also promised to introduce a new environmental assessment process.The government's agenda will reflect the belief that ""Canada's strength is its diversity,"" Johnston said.

His thesis project examined the impact of fossil fuel development on the health of Canada's northern indigenous peoples.He'll arrive in Paris just two weeks after terror attacks killed 129 people, but said that hasn't deterred him from attending the conference.""What's happening here is a huge step forward in mitigating climate change...you can't let things like this stop you.""French authorities Wednesday banned two climate change rallies planned to take place outside the conference.\l"

""In Canada, for example, we're seeing so much happening at the sub-national level in the same way we saw at the state level.""We're going to have these commitments. We're going to see how all of this knits together.""Environment Minister Shannon Phillips said Alberta wanted to send a strong message by releasing its climate change plan ahead of the Paris talks.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada95","Great powers remain at odds; U.S. and China maintain some relationships, but they are clearly at odds on many issues","May 28, 2016 Saturday","Kingston Whig-Standard","Rivalries between and among great powers have been grist to the mill of historians for centuries. In ancient times, it was Greeks versus Persians and Romans versus Carthaginians. In early modern times, the clashing imperial ambitions of Spain, France and Great Britain were at the centre of political events. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany found itself pitted against the United States, Great Britain and France. The second half of the century was dominated by a cold war aligning the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union and its allies, and producing proxy wars in Central America, Southern Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 apparently led some to believe that the era of contending great powers had come to an end. This certainly seemed to be the view of the distinguished American writer Francis Fukuyama, who proclaimed ""The end of history."" It also seemed to be that of the United States government, whose spokespersons began to speak of ""a new world order."" Unfortunately, they were wrong. Even an event as momentous as the fall of the Soviet Union was insufficient to totally alter the nature of international relations. Yes, the so-called bipolar world came to an end, but nation states continued to pursue their interests with or against each other. And nowhere is this more evident than in the policies and actions of the great powers.The two most significant powers on the world stage today are the United States and China. While they manage to maintain a mutually advantageous economic and commercial relationship, they are clearly at odds on many issues. Some of these are of very long duration. For many years, the United States has been highly critical of China's human rights record, and this is a question that can give rise to tensions in the bilateral relationship as it did at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. The Chinese, for their part, are profoundly hostile to the United States' continuing political and military support for Taiwan, which they regard as a form of totally unacceptable interference in their internal affairs.Other contentious issues have arisen in the China-United States relationship in recent years. Perhaps the most difficult and most dangerous concerns North Korea.That country's regime not only has the worst human rights record in the world, it is also the most threatening nuclear weapons proliferator. Its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests, accompanied by boisterous hostile rhetoric, have made it a source of serious security concerns for the United States and its Asian allies. The United States has been at the forefront of efforts (sanctions, boycotts) to cripple the regime of Kim Jong Un and to put an end to its nuclear adventures. China has been far more circumspect in its attitude toward North Korea for two main reasons. First, it fears that a collapse of the Kim regime would result in a vast flow of Korean refugees into China. Second, it is also deeply concerned that an eventual reunification of North and South Korea would bring to its borders a country firmly allied to the United States and host to tens of thousands of American troops. North Korea thus continues to be the subject of often testy diplomatic exchanges between the United States and China.China's maritime boundary claims in the East China Sea and the South China Sea are also sources of friction. While the United States generally tries to stay clear of the issues at stake in these claims, it is aligned with or allied to most of the countries involved in these disputes with China. What is more, the United States is vehement in asserting the right of freedom of navigation through some of the waters claimed by China, and has sent warships to affirm that right. These assertions and activities have been denounced by China as provocations, and China's increasingly aggressive actions in its littoral seas can only lead to more difficulties in the bilateral relationship.More generally, China and the United States are engaged in a competition for preeminence in the Asia-Pacific region. For many decades after the Second World War, the United States was the unrivalled power in the region. Its alliances, its naval deployments, its military bases and its economic penetration of so many countries meant that the United States could regard the Pacific Ocean as a mare nostrum. That total dominance has, however, been somewhat undermined by the rise of China as a political, economic, naval and military power over the past 20 years. The Chinese certainly make no secret of their desire and intention to challenge the position of the United States in the region. That challenge prompted President Obama to decree a ""pivot"" to Asia in American foreign policy, involving the deployment of more economic, diplomatic and military resources to the area. Both countries have also intensified their economic competition, with the United States spearheading the negotiations of a Trans-Pacific Partnership while China set about creating an Asian infrastructure bank.What is true of relations between China and the United States is also true of their relations with other major powers. China has what can best be described as an acrimonious relationship with Japan. Their disputes range from issues relating to the control of islands in the East China Sea to long-standing but acute differences arising from Japan's invasion and occupation of China during the Second World War. Nationalists on both sides of these divides are ever ready to exploit them to their advantage, to the detriment of regional stability. China also has a major territorial dispute with its neighbour India resulting from their brief war in 1962. India demands the return of territories occupied by China at that time. China refuses and lays claims to the entire Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh on the grounds that it was once part of south Tibet. While economic ties between the two countries have grown exponentially in recent years, their political relations continue to be marred by disputes that have festered for more than 50 years.The United States, for its part, enjoys what can only be described !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada104","COP21: 5 ways Canadians can help reduce climate change","December 15, 2015 Tuesday 5:00 AM GMT","CBC News","Nearly 200 countries have signed on to a historic agreement to limit climate change after years of negotiations.Despite the best intentions of the new pact and subsequent, expected government policies, some experts say citizens need to make changes in their day-to-day lives, too, to help reduce the world's greenhouse gas emissions.As governments determine what steps they'll take to reach the goals of the agreement, here are some of the things\'c2 Canadians can try to\'c2 reduce their carbon footprints, now and in the future: 1. MindsetPerhaps the most important thing Canadians can do\'c2 is to support policy on all levels\'c2 \'e2\€  municipal, provincial or territorial, and\'c2 federal\'c2 \'e2\€  as governments take action to curb emissions, says\'c2 Gordon\'c2 McBean, a professor at\'c2 Western University in London, Ont., and a research chair at the Toronto-based Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction.""If the politicians do not feel that the Canadians are behind them, then they will, of course, take less action,"" says\'c2 McBean.In Canada, government has been slow to implement climate change policy because of the perception that ""it wasn't at the forefront of the public's mind,"" says Simon Donner, an associate professor of climatology at the University of British Columbia.He suggests people write to their government representatives, like their local MPs or city council members, about what action they want to see happen\'c2 or even just as a show of support.""The more that your representatives hear about this, the more likely it is that ... policies will be put in place,"" says Donner.2. TransportationOne of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions from individuals rather than corporations is from people's use of transportation, McBean\'c2 says. Transportation accounts for 25 per cent of the country's emissions, according to the David Suzuki Foundation.People should re-evaluate how frequently they drive and look at alternative modes of transportation, like taking public transit, walking or riding a bike when possible.""Get out and enjoy the environment,"" he says.When planning a vacation, the David Suzuki Foundation suggests considering a staycation, or taking a train or bus to avoid flying. Air travel ""accounts for four to nine per cent of the total climate change impact of human activity,"" according to the foundation.People should plan to accept hybrid and electric vehicles\'c2 on the road and in their garage in the future,\'c2 says\'c2 Corinne\'c2 Le\'c2 Quere,\'c2 a professor and director of the Norwich, England-based\'c2 Tyndall\'c2 Centre for Climate Change Research. Similar to many of the bigger changes people can make, the cars may cost more up front, she says, but would likely save the buyer money over time.3.\'c2 HousingThere are small and big\'c2 changes that can be made at home, too, says McBean.People can heat their homes a little less during the winter and cool their homes less in the summer, he says. Other quick fixes to increase a home's efficiency, according to the David Suzuki Foundation, include:- Using compact fluorescent or LED light bulbs.In the long-run, paying to better insulate a home can lower the need to heat or cool it.\'c2 That could mean buying new windows or window coverings, according to a Canadian government list of how citizens can help reduce climate change,\'c2 or increasing insulation in an attic, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.4. ShoppingThere are important decisions to be made when shopping as well.Foods at the grocery store have produced different amounts of greenhouse gas emissions depending on where and how it was produced, and what type of food it is, says Donner.""In terms of bang for your emissions buck, the biggest impact in terms of your food shopping is eating less red meat,"" he says. It takes a lot more energy to raise one kilogram of red meat than the same amount of chicken, pork, grain or vegetables, he says.Buying locally also makes a difference, says Donner, as the food doesn't have to travel as far.5. Energy usePerhaps the simplest change to make to reduce energy use at home, says Donner, is to unplug devices\'c2 \'e2\€  like phones or tablets\'c2 \'e2\€  once they're fully charged. These gadgets tend to draw energy even when they're not being used, he says.Some other suggestions for quick ways to reduce energy use from the David Suzuki Foundation\'c2 include:- Hang-dry clothes.- Walk instead of watching TV or spending time on the computer.- Create a charging station for all electronics with a powerbar, and only turn it on when something needs to be charged.One bigger, more expensive change up-front could be investing in energy efficient appliances when buying a new fridge, dishwasher or other household appliance.People can also invest in renewable energy, says David Miller, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund Canada. Homeowners, for example, can pay to install solar panels on their roof.\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada105","Europe's diesel smog product of faulty policy","October 9, 2015 Friday","Windsor Star (Ontario)","When it was revealed that Volkswagen had been duping diesel-emissions tests on some of its high-end environmentally friendly cars, people were outraged. The CEO resigned.About the same time, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told the Alberta Chamber of Commerce that her province had better get its environmental house in order or it would have measures imposed upon it. She also said that Alberta has ""bad air.""Really? I challenge that statement. In 2011, Canada's air was judged to be the third highest quality in the world. In 2006, Environment Canada reported that Red Deer was an unusual hot spot for poor air quality related to fine particulate matter, but this was said to be due to the transportation corridor emissions, nothing else. Nav Canada's handbook on weather conditions for flying around Alberta confirms that weather and terrain play a big role in air quality.Likewise, transportation emissions, stagnant air and humidity are factors in making Paris - the site of the upcoming UN climate change talks - one of the dirtiest cities in Europe in terms of air quality.Episodes of stagnant, damp air led to Paris air-quality pollution levels as high as 180 micrograms of particulate matter 10 microns or smaller per cubic metre - more than double the safe limit of 80. This spring, during such an episode, the French government forced people not to drive. (Albertans only experience levels like that during wildfire smoke or weather inversions.But what is the real reason for this terrible pollution? Faulty climate policy, of course. As Bloomberg View explains in Climate politics and the Volkswagen scandal on Sept. 23, Europe made a push for diesel on the claim that it uses less fuel overall, but diesel emits more smog-inducing soot and more nitrogen oxides. Preferential tax rates led to Europe now having more than half its cars on diesel, and in France, now more than 80 per cent, thus creating a much larger public health risk and not saving the planet.Does it not strike you as hypocritical that 50,000 people, intent on saving the planet, will be flying, driving, taking a fossil-fuelled boat, train or car to COP 21 in December to reduce emissions?Shall Canada impose solutions upon them? Economist Ross McKitrick pointed out to me that Canada never gets credit for the advances we have made in addressing real pollution.From 1985 to 2011, our industrial carbon-monoxide emissions are down 26 per cent; industrial carbon particulate emissions are down 44 per cent; and industrial sulphur dioxide emissions are down 69 per cent. Total economic output: up by 89 per cent.When we go to Paris for the Climate Change Summit (COP21), we should demand that every other nation meets these standards and, until they do, they should have nothing to say to Canada on emissions.The UN is based on the principle of equal sovereignty. This is probably why Saudi Arabia can be elected to be head of the UN Human Rights Commission even though it has reportedly beheaded more people this year than ISIL. Point that out, if someone tries to impose environmental standards on us.As Google engineers recently revealed, renewable is not doable, so let's stop promoting it. Global warming has stagnated for over 18 years and eight months, with temperature rise being at values ""very close to zero,"" to quote German climate scientist Hans von Storch.The real push behind COP 21 is related to carbon trading - not climate change, not air quality, not saving the planet, but rather saving the financial backside of those who made rushto-renewables investments and, like Volkswagen, have been caught out. They're hoping to impose a global carbon-trading system on us. Their bad investment decisions should not require us to pay their piper.There's lots of foggy, smoggy hot air emitted by the whole climate change circus. Let's clear the air in Paris.Michelle Stirling-Anosh is communications manager of the Friends of Science Society and co-author of their report, Clear the Air in Paris, a submission to the federal and provincial governments. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

The federal government will instead step up its efforts to train local troops in the region.Trudeau and his Liberal government say they believe Canada can contribute more effectively in other ways to the coalition mission against the Islamic state than by conducting only two per cent of the bombing missions.Senior officials within the Prime Minister's Office say no leader has ever asked Trudeau to rethink his commitment to pull the CF-18s out of Syria and Iraq.

But it will take more than the measures discussed at this week's first ministers' summit to get Canada up to speed in tackling what U.S. President Barack Obama has called the greatest threat to future generations.Canada's previous Conservative government promised a 30 per cent reduction of greenhousegas emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. It gave no indication how we would get there.The fact that some provinces are now committed to climate action bodes well for hitting that mark. Quebec and Ontario are instituting cap-and-trade plans; B.C.'s 2008 carbon tax has shown results; and this month Alberta announced an economywide carbon tax, the elimination of coal-fired power plants and a cap on oilsands emissions.With those and other concerted efforts, especially the elimination of coal-fired electricity, we will be able to meet our 2030 target. The hard part comes after that. We will have to invest heavily in renewable energy and move away from fossil fuels starting in the next decade in order to continue to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions.In addition, exploitation of one of this country's greatest natural resources, Alberta's oilsands, will have to slow down significantly, if not stop entirely. That's because the process used to extract that oil uses fossil fuels that generate significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Almost 8 per cent of Canada's total greenhouse-gas emissions came from oilsands plants and upgraders in 2011. The oilsands are Canada's fastest-growing source of emissions.Alberta's newly announced cap on oilsands emissions will slow down that growth. But sooner or later, emissions will have to go down, not just stop growing. Even if there is some as-yetundiscovered technological solution, along the l"

Peskov's comments came less than 24 hours after Putin himself sounded hopeful notes at a meeting with Hollande in the Kremlin, where he said Russia ""was ready to co-operate with the coalition which is led by the United States.""But Russia has sought co-operation on its terms, providing diplomatic and now military shelter to Syrian President Bashar Assad and attacking rebel groups that include ISIL but also more moderate opponents of Assad backed by Western countries. U.S. President Barack Obama and other Western leaders have sought to bring Putin into a U.S.-led coalition instead, a force that Putin has called illegal because it is launching airstrikes in Syria without Assad's permission.Speaking in Moscow at a joint news conference with the Syrian foreign minister Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that peace talks for Syria cannot go ahead until all parties involved agree on a list of which groups should be listed as terrorist and which as legitimate opposition.""Vienna talks cannot go ahead productively without such a list of terrorists and a list of opposition groups,"" Lavrov said, adding that the lists should be vetted by the UN Security Council.Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem scoffed at those who call on Assad to step down, comparing them to ""those who dream of the devil in heaven.""""All those who demanded the resignation of Assad have left and Assad remained,"" he said, adding that elections will decide who stays and who goes.The opposing goals of Russia and Assad's opponents burst into conflict on Tuesday, when Turkey shot down a Russian plane that was allegedly in its airspace.

We have abused the gifts of God,"" said Miller, who oversees more than 400,000 Roman Catholics throughout Metro Vancouver the Fraser Valley.""The impacts of climate change are already taking place and are devastating,"" Robertson told the roughly 250 aboriginals, environmentalists, charity group members and faith leaders who attended the symposium Wednesday evening at the John Paul II Pastoral Centre in Vancouver.The event was organized to draw attention to Pope Francis' recent document on the environment, titled Laudato Si, which critiqued global capitalist greed and industry's wanton disrespect for the environment and the poor, whom it maintained suffer the most because of climate change.Robertson, who was the only Canadian among 60 big-city mayors to be invited to the two-day July forum with Pope Francis, told the Vancouver audience that 2014 was the hottest year on record in modern history and that 2015 is shaping up to be hotter still.Even though Robertson said the Pope had a devastating critique of capitalism and economic inequality, the mayor said he felt more hopeful after meeting the pontiff. He added he is encouraged by how green-energy industries are now contributing more to job creation and many economies than the fossil-fuel industry.The archbishop, who emphasized that Catholicism has been engaged in a fruitful dialogue with scientists for many years, said it's become painfully clear that humans are not meant to have ""dominion"" over nature, but to recognize they are ""inter-related"" with the Earth, which Pope Francis referred to as ""our Sister-Mother.""Both Robertson and Miller stressed that the world's politicians need to make a bold commitment to combatting fossil-fuel pollution at the 2015 United Nations , which is set to begin in Paris in late November.""We're trying to get 1,000 mayors from around the world to go to Paris, which would be unprecedented,"" Robertson said.

Ground crews are taxed, and new recruits are arriving from New Zealand, New Brunswick, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Mexico and the U.S.The intensity of this fire season should prompt a thoughtful, tangible response from provincial and federal governments. The issue is certainly in the wheelhouse of the fledgling Alberta government, and when the NDP MLAs get back to business in the fall, it's incumbent upon Premier Rachel Notley and her crew to take action on the environment, something they promised during the election campaign.""We will take leadership on the issue of climate change and make sure Alberta is part of crafting solutions with stakeholders, other provinces and the federal government,"" the party's platform said. Its first step was taken in late June, when it announced a phased-in doubling of the carbon levy by 2017 and more stringent emissions targets for large industrial emitters.More initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases are needed and should be identified by the committee reviewing the province's climate change policy. That committee will consult with the public and industry before producing a proposal that the NDP can take to the 2015 United Nations , Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 in Paris.While it's true wildland fires are a necessary, natural element of the life cycle of a forest, the process has been adversely influenced by humans on at least three fronts: encroachment, global warming and fire suppression.Humans cause climate change, and the warming of the planet's air has indeed sparked more and more intense fires this season. The staggering total of 3.02 million hectares burned is more than double the 10-, 15- and 20-year averages and triple the 25-year average. It could be a deviation, but researchers think otherwise; that incidence and intensity are trending upward.Entire housing subdivisions are built on the fringes of forested land. Those homes and the people in them are susceptible to wildfire, a fact that provokes suppression efforts in areas that might otherwise be left aflame, to burn off stockpiles of forest fuels like needles, branches and small logs. Instead, the fuel supply mounts and so does the intensity of the next wildfire.When settlements are threatened by wildfire, all levels of government place human life at the top of their priority lists, and rightly so.Those governments must take a more proactive role in mitigating the underlying causes of wildland fires, managing the forests accordingly and do what they can to reverse an alarming trend.This editorial originally appeared in the Edmonton Journal.\£9 Copyright (c) The Regina Leader-Post !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

The other one is the extension of the ITC/PTC in the US.China's National Energy Administration (NEA) recently said the country has installed 15.13 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity in 2015, reaching a cumulative 43.18 GW. According to GTM Research, 59 GW have been installed globally in the past year.""The COP21For Mr Lindstroem the fact that China is heavily promoting rooftop solar instead of large parks in the north west, where no one lives, is also one of the good news in 2015 ( HYPERLINK http://www.reuters.com/article/china-solar-idUSL3N0Y342620151207).From the perspective of utility-scale solar, the ITC extension ( HYPERLINK http://www.greentechmedia.com/squared/read/gtm-research-roundtable-the-itc-awakenshttp://www.greentechmedia.com/squared/read/gtm-research-roundtable-the-itc-awakens) and the accelerating grid parity are worth mentioning, according to Philip Wolfe.

China and the US occupied the first two positions in terms of investments by country, while the UK was third with USD 23.4 billion spent on renewables, up by 24% on 2014.Plamena from the SeeNews Renewables team is mainly focused on the UK market and, naturally, the most important topic for her last year was the significant drop in government support for the sector. Since coming into power in May 2015, the new UK government announced a number of measures to rein in green subsidies. One of those was a review of the feed-in tariff scheme, which supports small-scale renewables. The proposals, unveiled in the summer, included cutting the solar FiTs by up to 87% and caused an outcry in the solar industry. In its final decision announced on December 17, the government softened the cuts. According to its own estimates the move threatens 18,700 jobs in the sector.The Solar Trade Association (STA) recently said that despite reduced tariffs, solar remains good investment for householders HYPERLINK http://renewables.seenews.com/news/uk-domestic-solar-still-good-investment-after-fit-cut-industry-body-says-509130. This gives some hope for the future of the UK solar sector.In late 2015, UK energy secretary Amber Rudd drew much attention with her so-called policy reset speech that in spite of setting an end for coal generation and promising support for up to 10 GW of offshore wind appeared out of tune with the rhetoric and enthusiasm around COP21 in Paris: HYPERLINK http://renewables.seenews.com/news/uk-energy-secretary-promises-conditional-offshore-wind-support-in-policy-reset-502155ENERGY STORAGEThe whole SeeNews Renewables team agrees that the ""ascend"" of energy storage was one of the notable developments in 2015 too.Ever since the launch of Tesla's Powerwall, energy storage has been attracting growing attention and media coverage as the market develops -- from residential products, utility projects, government support for grid modernisation, supply deals, even innovative financing models.One of the interesting projects announced last year is for a 50-MWh storage system to be installed at a wind park in Yeongyang, South Korea. Lithium-ion battery maker LG Chem Ltd (KRX:051915) said this would be the world's largest wind energy storage project.Battery and storage companies have raised USD 397 million of venture capital (VC) funding in 2015, a bit below USD 431 million in 2014, according to Mercom Capital.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, delivers a speech during a conference at the COP21United NationsClimate Change Conference Thursday, Dec. 10, 2015 in Le Bourget, north of Paris.The panel, led by Canadian judge Marie Deschamps, found that UN staffers failed or hesitated to pass the children's allegations to more senior officials, sometimes because of political concerns with France involved; showed ""unconscionable delays"" in protecting and supporting the children; failed to further investigate the allegations; failed to properly vet peacekeepers for past abuses; and, overall, appeared more concerned with whether one UN staffer had improperly alerted French authorities.""The welfare of the victims and the accountability of the perpetrators appeared to be an afterthought, if considered at all,"" the report says.As of now, more than a year and a half after UN staffers first heard the children's allegations of sexual abuse, no one has been arrested.The report lays bare one of the most persistent and embarrassing problems for the UN and its member countries as tens of thousands of peacekeepers serve in some of the world's most volatile areas: Some vulnerable people are raped by their protectors, and often no one is punished.Many victims are children.Indeed, for victims of sexual violence, it is immaterial whether the perpetrator was wearing a blue helmet or notThe children in Central African Republic's capital, Bangui, reported the abuses in the middle of deadly chaos. The country had been ripped apart by violence between Christians and Muslims, and thousands of frightened people had sought shelter in squalid camps at the airport. French and other peacekeepers were trying to establish security.The children told UN staffers that they had been hungry and did what the peacekeepers asked in return for food.Almost a year passed before such allegations by a half-dozen children were made public in media reports this past April and May, leading Ban to order the independent investigation. Only then, the new report says, did the UN follow up with the children it had interviewed months ago and ensure their care.At that point, a new round of interviews found that ""some children alleged further cases of sexual abuse by peacekeepers,"" the report says. And additional children reported abuse.MARCO LONGARI/AFP/Getty ImagesVoters queue at the polling station at the Koudoukou school in the flashpoint PK5 district in Bangui on December 14, 2015 where voting operations for the Constitutional Referendum are still underway.One child, who a year earlier at age 11 had told UN staffers about watching peacekeepers rape his friends, ""now reported that he himself had been orally and anally raped.""The panel found it ""appalling"" that the children didn't receive immediate medical care. While UNICEF had referred the children to a local NGO partner for medical support, the panel found that in reality a social worker ""devoted a total of two hours ... to listening to the children and filling out forms required by UNICEF.""The report also calls UNICEF's failure to seek out other potential victims a ""serious breach"" of the agency's duty to protect children.Meanwhile, the children's allegations took months to reach top UN officials. The report says the head of the UN peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic, Babacar Gaye, was told several times about the allegations, beginning June 1, 2014, and did not act.In August of this year, in an unprecedented move, the UN secretary-general told Gaye to resign.The report says France ""took strong and immediate action"" to investigate after receiving a UN document with the allegations in July 2014, but it called that a ""stark contrast to the apparent failure of French authorities to react"" in May 2014, when the UN human rights staffer who had interviewed the children says she spoke with French military officials.Related'Peacekeeper babies' an unintended consequence of sending in the United Nations( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/peacekeeper-babies-an-unintended-consequence-of-sending-in-the-united-nationshttp://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/peacekeeper-babies-an-unintended-consequence-of-sending-in-the-united-nationsWildlife conservation in the Congo is like guerrilla warfare.

Information from the UNstarted flowing after the first media reports on the allegations emerged. And one year after French authorities first arrived in Central African Republic to investigate, the report says, the UN allowed the human rights staffer who had interviewed the children to participate in the French investigation as a witness.The long delay, the report says, has hurt the chances for accountability in a case involving ""the most vulnerable segment of society: unaccompanied, internally displaced and hungry, young children."" UN officials have pointed out that the French peacekeepers were not part of the UN peacekeeping force that later arrived in Central African Republic, but the panel said the UN's responsibility to protect human rights requires immediate action on such allegations, no matter what.""Indeed, for victims of sexual violence, it is immaterial whether the perpetrator was wearing a blue helmet or not,"" the report says.UN officials also have accused the human rights official who first handed French authorities the report describing the allegations, Anders Kompass, of breaching policy by not redacting the children's names. The report dismissed that argument and found that the former head of the UN internal oversight office abused her authority in improperly opening an investigation into Kompass in response to the ""single-minded determination"" of the UN human rights chief, Zeid Raad al-Hussein.If the concerns about redacting the names and protecting the children from possible reprisals were real, the panel said, the UN would have acted to offer protection.

Caisse Theatre in Bracebridge.Canada still has ""an opportunity to save itself from climate change,"" but it will need to take a brave leadership role, May said.As part of the Canadian delegation, May attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. She left feeling optimistic.Holding up drafts of the Paris agreement to the full auditorium, May said the deal got stronger and better each day. The final product is legally binding and countries can only change their targets if they set higher standards, she said.""Peer pressure and global shaming are the ways to assure countries meet their targets,"" May said.Canada still has a lot of work to do if it wants to meet its goals, but May thinks it's possible with cooperation and determination:1. Don't let politics get in the way""Canada can do much, much more than what's being considered (from the Paris Agreement),"" said May. ""We shouldn't limit our hopes or expectations to what we think (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau can do politically. It's time to start doing what's necessary.""2. Put a price on carbonThe Green Party is in support of a fee and dividend carbon system, where companies pay for emissions and the money is distributed to Canadians. There are other options too, like cap and trade or carbon tax, but at the end of the day, May just wants a system that works for the environment.""What matters is we stop subsidizing fossil fuels and put a price on carbon that's meaningful,"" she said.3. Transition to a fossil fuel-free energy grid by 2025Better distribution of hydro-electrical power between provinces is one place to start, said May. Opportunities exist between hydro-rich British Columbia and coal-dependent Alberta, for example.""Then we can focus our efforts on transitioning to electric vehicle-based transportation and move further away from a fossil fuel economy,"" said May.4. Get information about climate change and environmental policies in front of Canadians""Mainstream media has to catch up with the game-changing movements all around the world,"" said May, suggesting the public send letters to the editor as often as possible, in response to news stories.She also said to send in suggestions and ideas to Environment Canada.When it comes to convincing others to be more environmentally responsible, May said, ""Create a narrative and tell a story. Explain how we fought acid rain, for example. Tell them how many new jobs the green energy sector can supply.""\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada125","Let's clean up our backyard as well","December 7, 2015 Monday","The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)","The 2015 United Nations began a week ago today.Leaders from around the world and thousands of delegates are in France for a two-week summit to come up with a binding agreement on how to address climate change. There has been no shortage of skeptics about the event and the impact it will have, to say nothing of those who believe mankind has nothing to do with climate change.Canadians who harbour doubts about the impact the summit can have often cite the fact it's other countries who are the worst polluters. How can Canada, they ask, get the U.S., China and Russia, for example, to clean up their acts?The honest answer is not much.But the question skeptics should also be asking is this: while countries and corporations are the largest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions, do individuals have any moral ground to stand on? Not if a recent report from the University of New Brunswick is anything to go by.Jasen Golding, director of UNB's office of forest lands, says visitors to the university's woodlot aren't exactly behaving as stewards of the environment. A number of people are treating the privately owned, 1,500-hectare forest like a toilet ... in some cases literally.Camping in the woodlot is prohibited, but that hasn't stopped some from making themselves at home. Mr. Golding said some campers brought buckets with them to use as toilets and left them behind. Some day visitors haven't been much more courteous, as human waste isn't the only problem. Not only are dog owners not cleaning up after their pets, they're letting them wander off-leash.""I get weekly field calls from people who've been approached by aggressive dogs. There are no owners in the vicinity. I've been approached by aggressive animals,"" Mr. Golding said.This violation of the rules is particularly noteworthy given there's an off-leash dog park nearby next to the Grant-Harvey Centre.And to top it off, others are treating the woodlot like a dump, again, literally.""Here about six weeks ago we removed couches and garbage along the New Maryland highway and then on Monday afternoon we removed another half-ton truck filled with garbage from our Knowledge Park Drive entrance,"" Mr. Golding said.It would be unfair to suggest the majority of woodlot users are causing problems. The university has agreements with organizations that use the woodlot respectfully. It would also be unfair to compare Fido leaving ""presents"" to dumping nuclear waste in a river, but the heart of the problem is the same: lack of respect for the environment and other people, and no fear of being held accountable. Who doesn't know leaving your old couch and TV in the woodlot is illegal?Whether you believe mankind is behind climate change or not, one fact in undeniable: the world is getting warmer and the consequences if this trend continues will be devastating. It's hard to decry other nations' actions when our own forests are being used as toilets and dumps.Just as people hope other countries will be held accountable for their practices, we must hold our neighbours, friends and family accountable for theirs. The moral high ground can't be built on feces and garbage.\l"

It's part of uOttawa's existing commitment to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 34 per cent from 2005 levels by the year 2020 ""We're excited about this. We're proud of the progress we've made,"" said university president and vicechancellor Allan Rock.The University of Ottawa, like many other campuses in Canada, has been under increasing pressure to do more to battle climate change.Last month, a group of 90 current and retired professors signed an open letter demanding the university divest its endowment fund and pension plan of fossil fuel investments. In the letter to Rock and the board of governors, the group said that divestment ""is not only morally necessary, but also financially wise.""Making the Montreal Carbon Pledge ""goes way beyond divestment,"" Rock said. ""It's one thing to give up your holdings in oil companies - even assuming that has an impact - it's quite another to look across the entire economy and say: 'We're committed to measuring and disclosing and reducing our carbon content in everything we do. The whole economy is in play, not just oil companies. It's the entire portfolio and not just a part of it.""The Montreal Carbon Pledge was launched in September 2014 as part of the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment, which uOttawa has adopted. Its aim was to have at least $3 trillion in global assets assessed for their carbon footprint before the beginning of the Paris conference. To date, more than $8 trillion in global investments has been committed, said Stewart Elgie, a uOttawa law professor and founder of the Sustainable Prosperity research network.The University of Ottawa has already cut 23 percentage points of its 34-per-cent greenhouse gas reduction goal through such things as installing charging stations for electric cars, giving transit passes to its students and improving energy efficiency, Elgie said. Its 34-per-cent target is double Canada's national goal of a 17-per-centreduction, he said.Simply pulling the university's investments from oil companies wouldn't make much difference, he said. The largest oil companies are state-owned anyway, and for the others, universities are tiny players in the investment game.""Just divesting from oil companies isn't ambitious enough,"" Elgie said. ""To address climate change, we have to reduce demand for fossil fuels across the whole economy - energy, industry, transportation - all the sectors. As long as there is a growing demand for fossil fuels, they'll keep being produced. Ultimately, we need to bring down the demand, not just block production. This means moving to clean technologies as quickly as possible."" The only other school to make the Montreal Carbon Pledge is the University of California.Meanwhile, the University of Ottawa board of governors is continuing to examine whether to drop its fossil fuel investments completely, Rock said. A decision on divestment is expected in the coming months. HYPERLINK mailto:bcrawford@ottawacitizen.combcrawford@ottawacitizen.com\l"

I think it's just a very different world we live in. And we see the impacts of climate change. This is the warmest year on record in Canada. Our Arctic is melting and food security is a real issue up there.""When you have Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, saying that companies are going to have to explain to investors how they are moving to net-zero, and that if we do nothing the cost is going to be billions of dollars, I think there's a clear signal that there is going to be a change,"" she said.A reporter asked her earlier in the day whether the public will ""individually have to pay more or make specific changes to reduce emissions."" She answered: ""We're all in this together, and I was there - as I said, I was in Paris with big businesses like ATCO, like Suncor. I was there with youth representatives.

We have a reasonable plan, we are looking for your input and we are looking for your help. The renewal of Albertas Climate Change Strategy is a priority for the government with leadership by Premier Rachel Notley and Shannon Phillips, environment and parks minister, who plan to attend the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December, said Flint. Alberta wants to be a leader in environmental stewardship and resource sustainability, she said. Canada cannot be seen as lagging behind. PTAC has facilitated both fundamental and applied research to deal with the issue of solution gas flaring, in particular the inefficiency in the flaring combustion process, since the 1990s, she noted.The conservation of solution gas and recent technologies to help conserve and better use it is another issue of interest, said Flint. Broadening of the mandate to consider solution gas venting and associated controls is good public and environmental policy as longer chain hydrocarbons can be odorous and photochemically active, she said. Additionally, black carbon emissions [from flares] are significant in relation to air contamination and climate change. PTAC also has helped to facilitate research that has answered (and continues to answer) fundamental questions around venting and that information has been used to develop and implement environmental regulatory policy concerning solution gas venting. Although public concerns initially were raised in the Peace River area of northwestern Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator introduced new requirements for flaring, venting and incineration across the province ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2014/6/18/revised-aer-directive-flaring-venting-and-incinera/#axzz3p1Let9WhDOB, June 14, 2014). In terms of climate change renewal in Alberta, the government has demonstrated its commitment to address climate change through pricing tools with renewal of the Specified Gas Emitters regulation to increase greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, said Flint ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/6/25/alberta-increasing-carbon-rate-30-tonne-it-renews-/#axzz3p1Let9WhDOB, June 25, 2015). Though this is only one step forward, our increased reduction requirements and increased price represent the direction the province is heading. The government also appointed a climate change advisory panel chaired by Andrew Leach, a University of Alberta professor, to lead a public engagement process. The panel is gathering input from Albertans, industry leaders, municipal leaders and Aboriginal peoples on how Alberta can take leadership on climate change, she said. Later this fall, the government will use this advice to help develop a comprehensive new plan that demonstrates its leadership in addressing climate change, said Flint. This plan, she said, will include a long-term approach to moving towards a low carbon economy through carbon pricing, renewable energy, energy efficiency and a number of other opportunities. In the question and answer session that followed, Namsechi was asked by a PTAC member whether the cost of capturing vented solution gas that currently is not economic would be considered as a carbon offset.

She has pledged to buy an electric car and would install $21,000 in solar panels to her house if she received some provincial incentives. She and her husband have already switched from Epcor to Spark, a power co-operative that supplies electricity through solar and wind power rather than coal.""If we don't act quickly, global warming will exceed sustainable levels in our grandchildren's lifetime,"" said Hughes, as she sat at a table at the Chateau Louis Conference Centre for the second of two openhouses in Alberta set up by the province's new climate change panel. The panel, led by University of Alberta energy economist Andrew Leach and formed by the new NDP government, is tasked with studying climate change. Its report will inform a new climate change policy under Premier Rachel Notley. Notley will take that policy to Paris for the United Nations in December.The panel is meeting with industry, environmental and First Nations representatives, but opened the discussion to others during an open house in Calgary on Tuesday, followed by Wednesday's coffee-and-sweets chat-up in Edmonton.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada136","The pope's message on climate","July 22, 2015 Wednesday","The Gazette (Montreal)","A month after releasing a lengthy papal encyclical on climate change, Pope Francis is meeting this week with 60 mayors from across the globe to talk about where humanity should go from here.The two-day climate conference at the Vatican is expected to yield a formal declaration from the group - which includes Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson - calling on their national leaders to approve a ""bold climate agreement"" at the United Nations in Paris this December. The Pope says he is basing his support of these actions on hard, scientific evidence that proves the Earth is heating up, and that the world's poor will be in particular peril as floods, droughts and other natural disasters increase in frequency.It is refreshing to see a pontiffengaging so openly and frankly in this discussion. Facts alone have clearly not been enough to prompt the action needed to slow a catastrophic global warming trend. Recognizing this, Pope Francis has, in recent months, sought to inject a sense of moral authority and grandeur into the debate around how to deal with climate change.His decision to weigh in ahead of the Paris conference is especially welcome, as it puts additional pressure on the delegates to move forward with tough emissions-reduction targets.For countries like Brazil, which has a large Catholic population, the church's position could be used to justify unpopular policies that would cut emissions, but limit development.With his ongoing efforts to shake the world out of its indifference, Pope Francis is demonstrating that he understands the political influence he wields as the leader of 1.2 billion Catholics. And his comments on the environment have been extremely candid - and even poetic.""The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,"" Francis wrote in his encyclical, later noting that: ""rather than a problem to be solved, the world is a joyful mystery to be contemplated with gladness and praise.""It's hard to imagine any environment minister uttering these words. The lack of any hedging or equivocation is a welcome change.Of course, there will always be those who dismiss Pope Francis as a religious leader meddling in matters beyond his purview. Texas Rep. Joe Barton, a senior Republican on the United States Energy and Commerce Committee, responded to the encyclical by declaring that: ""I don't want to be disrespectful, but I don't consider him an expert on environmental issues.""U.S. presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was even less diplomatic, telling reporters that: ""I think religion ought to be about making us better as people, less about things (that) end up getting into the political realm ... I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope.""This is wrongheaded. Economic experts may not agree with everything in the Pope's encyclical; his opposition to market-based solutions like carbon pricing was a case in point. But political decisions - particularly ones that concern our ability to pass along a clean and safe planet to future generations - should be motivated by morality as well as by pure economics. Political leaders in Canada, which has lagged behind other developed nations when it comes to tackling greenhouse gas emissions and will be sending a delegation to Paris, would do well to remember this. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

They don't want any types of targets in there, so I think they are trying to make it as vague as possible at this point.""A key paragraph in the final draft declaration that remains unresolved is whether to specify a long-term goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the source said.Merkel is expected to push hard for a strong statement in the final text as the leaders convened to discuss climate change.Harper and Merkel held a bilateral discussion on Sunday, but the prime minister's office said they did not discuss climate change.Harper's office said in a statement that today's French-led climate talks focused on the ""collective response to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the advancement of energy security in the face of escalating threats.""Harper's office says the G7 leaders chose to devote a portion of the climate session to a discussion of global security threats posed by Boko Haram militants in Nigeria and the ongoing fight against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria.A senior Canadian government official, speaking on the condition they not be named, said Canada fully endorses a statement by the G7 that would support the December climate change talks in France, but did not say whether it should contain specific targets.""We support agreement in Paris that includes all GHG emitting countries,"" the official said, noting that in 2013 Canada's emissions dropped 3.1 per cent from 2005 levels.""We believe we have a fair and ambitious reduction target that is in l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada140","Common ground for church and state","June 24, 2015 Wednesday","Edmonton Journal (Alberta)","It's easy to forget the Social Gospel beginnings of the New Democrat Party.Long before he became medicare's prophet, Tommy Douglas was a Baptist preacher. Before he was Jack Layton's house leader, federal NDP MP Bill Blaikie was a minister of the United Church of Canada. So it's not entirely surprising that church and state appeared to agree last week, when Premier Rachel Notley's voiced concern over climate change the same day Pope Francis issued his new declaration touching on the same issue.The 78-year-old pontiff's new encyclical, Laudato Si', preaches to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. The state of ""our common home"" is a pressing moral and theological problem, said Francis, named for the patron saint of ecology. Planet Earth belongs to all of us.Francis' message is unavoidably political, a judiciously timed message in advance of November's United Nations Climate Change Conference.Alberta's new premier has more immediate dilemmas: a skittish energy sector, health and labour sectors hungry for royalty revenue dollars, and a watching world wary of what flows from Alberta's northern reaches. Yet Notley has begun to press a moral argument, saying she'll need to be there for the Paris talks, new prime minister or not, to represent a province perceived as a global laggard. ""Nobody trusts what we say on this issue,"" said Notley. ""We can't simply put out a press release saying that we have a world-class program when we don't.""Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips has promised a new strategy by month's end. Notley will press the issue at a premiers meeting next month. For a province that promised a strategy for years, then stalled and postponed repeatedly, this new government has shown remarkable urgency.Pope Francis and Notley are sharing some common ground. A pluralistic democracy might demand a separation of church and state, but that doesn't mean outright segregation.Conversations need to go further, reach wider and incorporate more of us. Katharine Hayhoe, a Canadian climate scientist named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people of 2014, devotes her energy convincing fellow evangelicals that the evidence demands a verdict. Similar voices can be heard in Islam, Judaism and other religions.Our new premier isn't one for sermonizing, unlike her Socred predecessors, but in one postelection interview, she remembered her devoutly Anglican mother's affinities with liberation theology. Argued from the perspective of the poor, the theology flourished in South America in the '70s and '80s, reaching Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Argentine chemical technician who became Pope Francis.The great argument of our time, argues New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, isn't religion or secularity or science. It isn't liberal or conservative. It's between ""dynamists"" and ""catastrophists"": those who see modernity as a success story, and those who believe in its imminent demise, barring a major transformation.In Douthat's scheme, Francis is the latter, the latest pontiff to emphasize destructive facets of capitalism, consumerism and a balkanized world. Notley would be the former, believing governments can still find answers through energy efficiency programs, improved carbon levies and other fixes. It's remarkable that both are preaching a similar message. Our future will not be salvaged by sitting idle, separating into factions and plugging our ears. Take it from Notley and Francis and the long history of the Social Gospel: We're in this together. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada143","OVERVIEW - Climate deal signals big investment push for renewables","December 16, 2015 Wednesday 4:32 PM EEST","SeeNews North America","December 16 (SeeNews) - After two weeks of negotiations, the COP21 summit in Paris ended in a historical agreement under which rich countries, developing economies and even some of the poorest countries would work together to curb emissions and push for more renewable energy investment.The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and pushes even further to try to keep temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It incorporates commitments from 187 countries to reduce emissions, which on their own would only hold warming to between 2.7 and 3 degrees Celsius.However, it also holds a pledge on climate funding of USD 100 billion (EUR 90.7bn) per year for developing nations by 2020 and five-year reviews of progress.ENERGY The necessity to align economic growth strategies with climate change mitigation brings a fresh perspective into investment in renewables.The energy sector accounts for\~more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore it makes perfect sense to look in that direction when searching for faster solutions to curb emissions.So far, it was always assumed that developing countries would industrialise using fossil fuels. The sustained development and growing maturity of renewable energy technologies over the last decade, especially wind and solar, have changed that view for good.The very political agreement coined at COP21 in Paris was made possible by the steep decrease in costs for different renewable energy technologies since the Copenhagen COP, back in 2009.Today, it is no longer assumed that emerging economies cannot leapfrog the fossil fuel era. In fact, economic development fueled by renewable energy and accompanied by increasing energy efficiency, is not only the most effective way to limit global temperature rise, it is the most sustainable path to improving standard of living around the globe. Business leaders have already realised that and besides country pledges, a series of business-led initiatives were announced at COP21 to spell a brighter future for clean power technologies.RENEWABLE ENERGY PLEDGES AT COP2139 French companies pledge EUR 45 billion to renewable energy till 2020Just a few days before the opening of the COP21 climate conference in Paris, 39 French companies announced a joint pledge to invest some EUR 45 billion in renewable energy and low-carbon technologies over the next five years. Accor, BNP Paribas, Socoete Generale, EDF, Total, Saint-Gobain, Orange and Michelin are some of the companies signing the pledge for contribution in the fight against climate change.""It is a commitment to a low-carbon economy, and these are all new funds that will be invested,"" the CEO of Total, Patrick Pouyanne, said at a joint news conference. ""Total intends to invest more than EUR 4 billion between 2016 and 2020, particularly in solar, but also in bio energy,"" he added.The companies said they also plan to provide bank and bond financing of at least EUR 80 billion for other climate change related projects.Six multinational companies pledge to use 100% renewable energyBMW Group, Coca-Cola Enterprises, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF), Nordea Bank AB, Pearson PLC and Swiss Post recently announced they will source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources.""Our analysis of the private sector's electricity consumption and carbon emissions indicated that a switch to power from renewable sources could cut global CO2 [carbon dioxide] by nearly 15%,"" said Emily Farnworth, RE100 Campaign Director.Cities from around the world embrace 100% renewable goalOn the sidel"

They will be paid between $15 and $20 an hour during the day and $11 to $13 an hour for night shifts effective Nov. 4 - the day Trudeau and his cabinet were sworn in.In modern life, nannies and child-care present a hot-button Rorschach test of socioeconomic and political values - touching as they do on the emotion-charged issues of parenthood, feminism, race, fair compensation and exploitation.

Using a competitive bidding process could have cut those costs in half, added Lysyk.""Not only did the government not follow the competitive procurement process ... it offered additional economic incentives along with the already attractive prices offered under the guaranteed-price renewable program to a foreign consortium,"" she wrote.The auditor found Ontario pays 3\'bd times the price for solar power than the average in the United States, and twice as much for wind power.""There's a cost associated with getting out of coal, of putting more renewables in place, and we've got other jurisdictions looking to Ontario as a model for how to do that,"" said Wynne.Eliminating coal-fired generation reduced the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, and will help lower health-care costs associated with air pollution, especially for kids with asthma, added Wynne.""You only have to look at other jurisdictions that are struggling with air quality, with particulate matter in their air, with families that don't feel they can let their kids play outside,"" she said. ""I know we weren't in those serious straits, but the fact is we have reduced our pollution in this province.""Wynne, who made two separate trips to the climate change talks in Paris, said Ontario is leading the way in the battle against greenhouse gas emissions, noting Alberta will take 15 years to stop burning coal to generate electricity.""That is going to be a transition for them and there will be a cost associated with that as there was here in Ontario,"" she said.

Phillips said the province's plan makes it clear to Albertans that the economy and environment go hand in hand.""Albertans want Alberta to lead again,"" she said. ""Previous government policies, whether federal or provincial, were leading us down a path where we would potentially have to accept climate change plans that were imposed on us.""So the choice is to follow and do nothing, or to lead - and Premier Notley chose to lead.""The plan has been praised by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and drew applause from several other provincial leaders who have taken a stance on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Another United Nations Foundation official said the message from Canada is coming across loud and clear.""Canada, in my mind, has been a world leader in sustainable development and climate,"" said Reid Detchon, vice-president for energy and climate with the foundation. ""There was perhaps a bit of a hiccup in that in the past several years, but you seem to be headed back to your position in the forefront.""Plans such as Alberta's could spur others to action in Paris, he said.""The biggest theme that again will be very robust in Paris will be action by sub-national governments - states or provinces and cities - and how the leadership is increasingly coming from that level as much as it is from national governments,"" said Detchon.Nearly 200 nations will gather in Paris for the climate-change conference, which aims to achieve measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the atmosphere.Kreider, who worked as an adviser to former U.S. vice-president Al Gore, said she's optimistic a global agreement can be reached.""In the end, what we envision is a durable agreement that will be reviewed over time and strengthened over time,"" she said.

They include the idea of progress: that the world our children inherit will always be better than the one we live in. And also that human ingenuity will solve any problem we create for ourselves.Art can also take big ideas of global complexity and ""craft them into a human story.""Hamilton's words are a powerful reminder that we don't just have one job to do when it comes to climate change. We have many jobs, and they all have to be done at the same time. Or we will run out of time.First, there is the individual action that we each have to take.Insulating your home better, so that it needs less energy to keep warm, will help. Driving a car or taking a plane as seldom as possible also helps. So does giving up meat because of the greenhouse gases produced by the animals so many of us consume.But, on top of that, we now need radical action from governments, Hamilton says.That includes regulating corporations. It includes changing the rules so that driving your car is so expensive and difficult that it's less trouble to take transit or cycle or walk. And ""we need to transform our energy systems"" so that electricity is converted from coal-burning and other carbon-based fuels to cleaner renewable fuels.The scale of the changes that are needed is monumental, Hamilton says.""We can't carpool our way out of this one.""She's right.Canada now has a government that promised ""real change"" as its slogan to get elected.

He told the Telegraph-Journal that ""balance is good, and sometimes you can make a more informed decision on your own stand if you listen carefully to the arguments of others.""It's a credo that ought to be tattooed on the foreheads of every member of the New Brunswick legislature as a reminder of the standard operating principles healthy democracies must eventually embrace.Still, on the subject of climate change, Mr. Keirstead allowed, ""We all come from different directions, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, if we get out of the conference what I'm hoping we will, we may find a path that works for New Brunswick . . . We can't have a cookie-cutter approach.""Maybe not, but neither can we afford to waste anymore time arguing about the shape of our response to global warming.This summer, the world's leading climate scientist, James Hansen, and his team of researchers released a new study, the abstract of which reads, in part, ""There is evidence of ice melt, sea level rise to +5-9 m and extreme storms in the prior interglacial period that was less than 1 \'b0C warmer than today. Human-made climate forcing is stronger and more rapid than (natural ancient trends).""What this paints, according to a report in the Washington Post, is ""an alarming picture of where the planet could be headed . . . The authors conclude that 2 degrees Celsius global warming - the widely accepted international target for how much the world should limit global warming - is 'highly dangerous.'""Moreover, Inside Climate News reported in June that ""the long-debated hiatus or pause in global warming, championed by climate denialists who tried to claim it proved scientists' projections on climate change are inaccurate or overblown, probably did not happen at all.""According to the report, ""A new study by researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds that the world's warming never really stalled during the last 15 years - it was just masked by incomplete data records that have been improved and expanded in recent years. 'The rate of temperature increase during the last half of the 20th century is virtually identical to that of the 21st century,' said Tom Karl, director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and lead author of the study. The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, is just the latest in a growing number of studies refuting the idea of a slowdown in global warming.""In fact, none of the actual science of climate change should be up for debate anymore. But principled concerns do remain about how world leaders equitably share the burden of a coordinated, global response to the problem - particularly, how societies graduate from staging conferences to meeting targets and commitments while managing to keep their economies intact.Messrs.

Unfortunately, it's an illusory goal.Consider, for example, a recent study by Yale University's Kenneth Gillingham and colleagues. Using a collection of so- called ""integrated"" models of climate and the economy, they seek to get a better handle on how various uncertainties-in weather, population growth and technological development-might affect the price that policy makers should put on carbon. Their conclusion: No matter what happens, the optimal price in 2020 would probably be no more than about $50 per ton.The paper's appearance may be timed to influence policymakers at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which begins at the end of this month. It really shouldn't, because it feigns certainty in areas where none is to be had.Climate scientists believe that, given the current state of the Earth, average temperatures should rise about 1 to 2.1 degrees Celsius for every trillion tons of carbon dioxide added.

Over the next 50 days, the prime minister-designate and his newly elected Liberal government will be tested repeatedly and vigorously on the international stage on major issues ranging from climate change to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Let's hope they're up for it.Trudeau performed brilliantly in the election, a gruelling campaign in which he confounded critics and exceeded almost all expectations. His first days in office have been bursting with optimism, energy and a kinder, gentler prime ministerial face than Canadians were accustomed to. But the real tests are coming quickly at a series of global conferences starting in November.While Trudeau has yet to commit himself to attending the Group of Twenty (G20) summit in Turkey on Nov. 15 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Philippines on Nov. 18 and 19, he has signalled interest in both. It is imperative that he appears on each of these stages and performs well.The G20, which includes the world's most advanced economies representing 85 per cent of global gross domestic product, is focused on something that should be close to Trudeau's heart - promoting robust, inclusive economic growth through collective action. Considering that many of Canada's NATO allies will be at that meeting, Trudeau may need to explain more about his decision to halt airstrikes against Islamic State insurgents in Syria and Iraq - neighbours of the meeting's host, Turkey. And what would Trudeau say to a fellow G20 leader, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose foreign military ventures have raised international tensions? Last week, Trudeau said he would tell off Putin ""directly to his face"" if he became prime minister. How will the courage of Trudeau's convictions meet the demands of global diplomacy?The APEC summit, a few days after the G20 gathering, will include the leaders of the 11 other countries that, like Canada, have signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. While insisting during the election campaign that he supports greater trade opportunities for Canada, Trudeau would neither give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. One of the leaders Trudeau most wants to impress, U.S. President Barack Obama, is bullish on the agreement and considers it one of his key legacies. What will Trudeau tell him?Then from Nov. 27 to 29, the heads of government of the Commonwealth of Nations will meet in Malta. The main session is expected to be on climate change in an attempt to build political support for dealing with this challenge before the United Nations in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11.Trudeau has committed to attending the Paris summit. It would be wise for him to fly to Malta, too. In the election he promised to do more than the Conservatives had done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to work with provincial premiers to achieve this progress. But how will this translate into Canada-wide action, particularly considering British Columbia has adopted a carbon tax, while Ontario is considering a much different cap-and-trade program? What will Trudeau tell the world in Paris, and Canadians in the months after?All this makes for a demanding agenda that would tax the abilities of the most seasoned statesman. While we acknowledge the steep learning curve Trudeau must climb, this is the job he asked for and was given by voters. He can make his job easier by selecting the best cabinet ministers to manage the trade, foreign affairs and environmental portfolios. That, in itself, is a massive job.Throughout the longest election campaign in recent Canadian history, Trudeau showed he could speak with eloquence and carry himself with the dignity of a national leader. Now he must prove he can deliver.\l"

Their projects have included tree-planting blitzes across the city, building solar lanterns to send to post-earthquake Haiti, and installing light sensors throughout the school. In December, a student will travel to Paris to present at the United Nations .""I think we really got recognition for taking students out of the classroom, taking their learning and applying it to real-world settings,"" Dublenko said.He was running the school's environment club several years ago when students were mainly focused on recycling projects. Dublenko pushed them to ""think bigger."" They thought of solar panels and it took four years before they arrived at the school.""There was a lot of red tape and questions and some political issues, like, what's the point of the solar panels, what are you trying to demonstrate?"" Dublenko said. ""People felt it was a challenge to our main economic driver, oil and gas. I pointed out that the most commonly used place for solar is in the oilpatch because they can't build the grid out far enough.""Queen Elizabeth was the first school in Edmonton to receive solar panels. At this point, the panels are dated and do not produce much energy, but students can still monitor the energy output in a real-time computer program. It's a glimpse at work opportunities in another energy industry.It was that attitude that drew the attention of the Canada Green Building Council, which named Queen Elizabeth and an Ontario high school as co-winners this year. The winning schools aren't necessarily built to top LEED-environmental standards, which would put new schools at a huge advantage.""It's not just about the physical schools, it's about the students' involvement in the schools and how they operate,"" said Mark Hutchinson, director of green building programs for the building council. ""Queen Elizabeth does a great job of incorporating environmental awareness into the curriculum ... It's not just done in clubs, or after school.""Dublenko was a longtime English and social studies teacher before becoming the leader of the Innovate program, which allows students to get high school credits for projects focused on sustainable development.""I see what's happening in our world and I believe it affects every one of us whether we know it or not.

He spoke of war and peace, nuclear arms control, dignity, social justice, poverty, girls' education, religious freedom, drug trafficking and more. He also touched on an overarching theme - the future of the Earth itself - threatened as it is by climate change driven by ""a selfish and boundless thirst"" for power and money, as he put it.In Francis's view, God's very creation is imperiled by the relentless ravaging of the planet's natural resources for profit, heedless of the consequences. Humankind ""is not authorized to abuse it (creation), much less to destroy it,"" he told the UN General Assembly. There's ""a certain sacredness"" to created nature, he said.That concern resonates strongly here in Canada, and not just among members of Francis's Roman Catholic flock.Early in his tenure Conservative leader Stephen Harper pronounced Canada an ""emerging energy superpower,"" and he has made this country an international pariah in environmental circles by spending the past decade encouraging aggressive exploitation of the western oilsands and dodging any responsibility for curbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet to a dangerous level.That abdication of responsibility doesn't sit well with a large majority of Canadians, four in five in one recent poll, who have come to share the Pope's view that we need to do better. They want whomever they elect on Oct. 19 - and that includes another Conservative government, if the party wins a rare fourth consecutive term - to show more leadership than Harper has to date in tackling climate change. It has become an issue of trust on the stump.In his years in office Harper has consistently decried carbon taxes as ""job killers."" While his government promises to cut greenhouse emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, it has no credible plan to curb oilsands output, our fastest-growing source of emissions, nor has it come up with regulations to meet its target.New Democrat Leader Thomas Mulcair, in contrast, favours a practical Quebec/Ontariostyle cap-and-trade system to price carbon, currently about $16 a metric tonne. He also vows to end fossil fuel subsidies and make polluters pay. Ambitiously, the NDP aims to cut emissions by 34 per cent below 1990 levels by 2025.Justin Trudeau's Liberals also propose to ""put a price on carbon pollution"" by working with the provinces. As well, he would invest heavily in clean technologies and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Elizabeth May's Green Party would also tax carbon, and rebate dividends to the public. She'd leave most of the oilsands in the ground and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. The Greens aim to cut emissions by 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2025.All three opposition parties come closer to subscribing to the Pope's view that political leaders have an obligation to put forward ""concrete steps and immediate measures for preserving and improving the natural environment"" from further despoilment.Of course, Francis couched his concern for the environment in religious language, invoking the Creator as a loving architect of the universe, the notion of humankind as stewards of creation, and the intrinsic value of life. But there was no mistaking his hard-headed, practical ""ask"" of political leaders in Canada and other energy-rich countries.At the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11, he challenged them to come up with ""fundamental and effective agreements"" to curb carbon use, and halt a damaging warming trend.It would be good to see Canada play a constructive, leading role at those talks after playing the spoiler for so long.\l"

Earth Day was created in 1970 to bring attention to an environmental crisis caused by pollution that was poisoning the air, water and land. Forty-six years later major advances have been made in banning toxics and reducing pollution. However climate change is now recognized as a fundamental threat to the stability of our world. It impacts billions in both the poorest countries and the richest cities. The United Nations Summit on Climate Change in Paris (COP21) adopted goals that are crucial for human survival. Those include a reduction in greenhouse gases to limit the rise of global temperatures to 2 degrees or less. For this to happen, every country has to radically change how energy is created and consumed - in buildings, transportation, workplaces and consumer products. Labour supports the COP21 document but wants to ensure there is ""just transition"" for workers whose livelihoods will be displaced as cities and nations transform their energy appetites. The Toronto and York Region Labour Council calls on every political and corporate decision-maker to commit to policies and programs that will achieve the COP21 goals. Investment is needed in public transit and alternative energy sources. All new buildings should strive to be net zero carbon, and existing building stock retrofitted to achieve this aim. Retailers should insist that suppliers take responsibility for the life cycle of their products. Carbon pricing should apply to every product sold in Canada. Finally, a nation-wide network of Workplace Environmental Representatives should be established to support these efforts. ""We could create a million climate jobs in Canada if there was the collective will to support clear, decisive action"" said John Cartwright, Labour Council president. ""From skilled trades to finance, manufacturing to design professionals, we can produce equitable access to good jobs to ensure every community benefits. Let us this Earth Day, remind our elected leaders and every Canadian of our shared responsibility to create real change.""

That's more than eight times as much carbon as the 2009 Copenhagen talks and twice that of the 2010 conference in Cancun, Mexico, according to the U.N.Organizers of the Paris conference, which runs until Dec. 11, say they'll limit COP21's carbon footprint to 21,000 tons of CO2 - but their calculation doesn't take into account transport - and with participants coming from around the world, this is the single biggest contributor to the conference's carbon emissions.The Paris conference will also be many times larger than Lima was, with 40,000 attendees forecast vs 11,000 in Lima.However large Paris' carbon footprint is, it will presumably be dwarfed by the reduction in carbon emissions that the leaders hope to sign. But the sight of massive convoys of black SUVs ferrying leaders to give speeches about how much they care about stopping global warming will be a symbol Paris' organizers could live without.To counter this and ensure that COP21 is ""carbon neutral,"" organizers are taking a variety of measures to offset the conference's emissions.Among these is the construction of a 2,000-seat assembly hall made from wood from sustainably managed forests.

For every dollar the Yukon government allocates toward finding ""energy solutions"" (i.e. ways of reducing energy consumption), they spend three dollars on their oil and gas department encouraging and wooing oil and gas companies to invest here. As COP21 made 100 per cent clear, keeping the global temperature rise below two degrees (above which there will be even more catastrophic effects) is absolutely essential. To have any hope of staying below that temperature, untapped oil and gas must remain in the ground.Yukon cannot divorce itself from this reality or its responsibility to do its part. The government should re-allocate funding entirely toward energy solutions. 2. By solutions we also mean a serious commitment - that is, funds and personnel - to the development of renewable energy such as micro hydro, biomass, wind, solar etc. Not only would these have a dramatically smaller impact on our environment and not endanger our water, they would generate jobs now and for the future.3. Abandon the diversionary strategy of massive hydro. The government's emphasis on a massive hydro project, with an estimated cost well in excess of a billion dollars, represents yet another instance of an oversized capital expenditure that would presumably be added to Yukon Energy's already substantial debt, burdening ratepayers and taxpayers now and well into the future. Given First Nations' resistance to massive hydro and its attendant devastation of a vast tract of territory and impacts on fish and wildlife, this notion is a nonstarter and a waste of time and money. Instead of being fossilized by an intransigence to old solutions and continuing down the road signposted ""oil and gas,"" the Yukon government can, and should, change direction. Make the move to renewable energy so we don't need to ask ""Where are we going?"" Help the Yukon ensure that all of the planet has a future.

The Albertan research lab is developing technology that uses the mechanism of photosynthesis to not only reduce carbon emissions but turn the carbon itself into value. Research on the subject could feature heavily in any shared agreement on climate change at COP21. With funding from Alberta's Climate Change and Emissions Management Corporation (CCEMC), Ingenuity Lab is developing a facility to demonstrate the economic viability of transforming CO2 emissions into high value products. Essentially the process uses artificial photosynthesis to manage industrially produced CO2 emissions through carbon capture and value creation. The demonstration project, at a total value of $1.3m, will support the Ingenuity Lab team to situate the cellular processes responsible for carbon fixation in living organisms into a scalable, engineered system to create value added chemicals. The project, as featured in The New Economy innovation series, will be entered into the Carbon X Prize: A $20m global competition to develop breakthrough technologies that convert emissions into valuable products such as building materials, alternative fuels and others. The winner of the competition will no doubt appeal to those attending COP21, as the gathered dignitaries look forward to lead the transition to a low carbon future. While representatives from over 190 countries gather in Paris to reach a shared agreement on climate change, The New Economy will be at the Sustainable Innovation Forum to expand on the role and responsibilities of business. The latest issue of The New Economy will be available there to any in attendance, complete with a supplement on the groundbreaking work Ingenuity Lab are progressing in carbon transformation.

Trudeau and the premiers are meeting with aboriginal leaders on Wednesday before a first ministers meeting on Thursday, Trudeau's second since winning last October's federal election.""I'm very much looking forward to meeting with the first ministers this week to talk about the shared commitment that we all made in Paris a few months ago,"" Trudeau said Tuesday at the launch of a cross-sectoral coalition looking to identify policies that spur innovation, generate jobs and boost the economy while improving the environment.At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, world leaders committed to take measures to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.Speaking about the first ministers meeting, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne stressed the importance of looking for points of agreement and shared goals in order to avoid the discussions immediately devolving into a disagreement over details.""Rather than beginning with a fractious conversation about which kind of carbon pricing (and) how it's going to work, I think we have to start with our objectives: figure out how we can come to some agreement on what those are. Then we talk about the mechanisms,"" Wynne said Tuesday in Toronto.Each province could bring a unique approach, she added: ""We don't all have the same role to play, but we all do have a role to play.""Wynne's strategy may prove useful in the face of Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall's vocal opposition to Trudeau's proposed national carbon tax.Wall has warned that putting a price on carbon emissions would ""kneecap"" his province's energy-heavy economy, already struggling under slumping global commodities prices. Instead, he suggested Canada focus on investing in technological solutions to reduce emissions, such as carbon capture and sequestration.British Columbia Premier Christy Clark said Tuesday she sees her province as a consensus-building force and hoped other provinces would follow its lead on introducing an economy-wide carbon tax. She echoed Wynne's comments on the importance of establishing common ground at the meeting's start.""Rather than spending all of our time talking about things we disagree on first, let's talk about the things we agree on, first,"" Clark said in Victoria.She said she's looking for financial backing from Ottawa for an estimated $1-billion project to install a hydro link between B.C. and Alberta.The talks this week are also happening under the increasing spectre of national discord over the Energy East pipel"

In our econometric world, forecasts like the one Yellen just made public will prove to be just as fanciful as all the previous predictions made by the world's central banks.Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said of the Fed's prognostication, ""They're no worse than anybody else and we're all terrible.""Whether phoney forecasts from central banks, International Monetary Fund President Christine Legarde being forced to stand trial on charges of negligence in connection with a financial scandal or pharmaceutical Grinch Martin Shkreli facing charges for allegedly misleading investors, it seems the experts we rely on are mere mortals with feet of clay.In my opinion, the financial media encourage the Ponzi scheme that is Wall Street and the shell game called globalization which are disconnected from the real economy and have been for more than 30 years, resulting in a middle class that is a shadow of its former self.It's not all doom and gloom. People are starting to catch on. Labour Party members in the United Kingdom, despite warnings from the Blairites, chose as their leader the social democrat iconoclast Jeremy Corbyn over his technocratic Third Way competitors.In the United States, the self-described socialist Bernie Sanders is giving Hillary Clinton a run for her money to become the Democrats' presidential candidate. If his popularity is measured by individual donations then he is catching fire, so far at two million contributions, double that of Obama in 2008.The agreement at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference has no binding targets, only unenforceable binding reporting, which may be a farce, but more importantly it is a signal that the people are tired of policy that panders to the one per cent.It's no accident that Corbyn is the new leader of Labour or that Sanders is beating Clinton with the independents who decide U.S. elections. These are men that stand for social justice, something that's been missing from our political discourse for too long.Greed and acquisitiveness are no basis for running a country, especially when it's the same small group that is doing all the acquiring. Instead of public policy that glorifies the wealthy, we need one that aspires to change the world for the better and that begins with an emphasis on the many, not the few.The American philosopher John Rawls published the essay ""Justice as Fairness"" that states changes to public policy must not make the least advantaged worse off. He asks what kind of policy would you want if you started from a position where you did not know your social circumstances nor what your innate abilities would be, and that you could be one of the disadvantaged. He believed those policies would be more egalitarian and ultimately more generous than the ones we have now.We have been willing for far too long to sacrifice the poor of the world to create more wealth for the wealthy. If we are not careful we will end up like Europe, where the elite craft policy that constrains action rather than empowers government to collectively solve problems.With the rise of the Islamic State, a flood of refugees, the scourge of inadequate incomes for millions and the growing pace of climate change, the world is a train wreck.To paraphrase Robert Reich, former Labor Secretary under Bill Clinton, markets do not appear fully formed in nature, but are created by regulations. Society and markets are a construct. We make the rules. If the rules are failing to achieve our goals then we must change the rules. We've done it before and if we want to keep the train on the tracks we'd better do it again.Cameron Adams is a writer and former Nortel employee who lives in the Preston section of Cambridge.\l"

Free trade in forest products will help the forest sector reach its ambitious Vision2020 goals of generating an additional $20 billion in economic activity and refreshing the workforce with 60,000 new recruits. These are well paying middle class jobs in communities right across the country. However, the TPP has the potential to do much more than that. It also gives us the opportunity to sell our green and sustainable forest products in more countries.Pending an international agreement on climate that may come out of the upcoming UN Climate Conference, our industry is well positioned to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging our world leading sustainability practices. Not only will this give us the opportunity to secure new markets, but it also gives us the chance to develop Canada's reputation as a global leader on climate change.Canada's forest products industry is working hard to be part of the solution to the climate challenge. Our vast renewable forests absorb the carbon dioxide (CO2) that causes climate change and this role of sequestering carbon continues in wood products.This includes everything from car parts to green chemicals to engineered construction materials that can replace items with a heavier carbon footprint such as plastics, concrete and steel. The sector has also reduced its dependence on fossil fuels as pulp and paper mills have cut greenhouse gas emissions by a remarkable 65 per cent since 1990.Overall, we feel that Canada's forest products industry is leading the world in its green practices. For example we have more than 160 million hectares of forests independently certified to follow progressive social and environmental practices (that's 43 per cent of the world or four times more than any other country). Canada's forest sector is also well on its way to reach its pledge to become carbon-neutral.At the same time, we are constantly developing new products for the growing bio-economy by extracting more value from each and every tree we harvest responsibly.FPAC wants to continue working in partnership with government to transform, innovate and produce ground-breaking products that will allow Canada's forest sector to compete and be a global leader in the sustainable resource industry.On Nov. 19, FPAC will host a climate change event at the French Embassy in Ottawa. It is our effort to continue the dialogue on how the forest products industry can help combat climate change while leveraging our world-leading environmental practices to secure a prosperous future for Canadians.Canada's forest products industry has come a long way over the last 20 years. As leaders both environmentally and economically, we understand that the two are closely intertwined as the move to freer trade and a green low carbon economy takes centre stage across the world. No industry in Canada is more committed to growing a greener tomorrow.David Lindsay is the president and CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada.$ID/[No paragraph style]NothingBlue !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton)\l"

Tears welled up in the prime minister's eyes.British Columbia Premier Christy Clark, Alberta's Rachel Notley, Saskatchewan's Brad Wall and Ontario's Kathleen Wynne visited the Bataclan later in the day with delegates from other provinces to lay a wreath.The concert hall was packed with mostly young people attending a show by American rock band Eagles of Death Metal when gunmen stormed the building.Trudeau said visiting the Bataclan was important to show solidarity with France.""Canadians as a whole were extremely touched and affected deeply by the attacks, and it was an important opportunity to demonstrate that we stand firmly in sympathy and in resolve with the people of France, indeed, with everyone around the world in the fight against terror, and the work to create peace and stability across the world,"" he said. Hollande told reporters that Trudeau reached out to him a day after the terrorist attacks to offer Canada's moral support.""He later went to the very places where the terrorists struck. And these are very dear to me, all these expressions of solidarity, and these messages, these symbols,"" Hollande said, highlighting that terrorism also struck Canada last year during the attack on Parliament and at the War Memorial.Speaking alongside Hollande, Trudeau said France has shown leadership on combating terrorism. He said Canada will be a ""very active member of the coalition"" against ISIL.""We'll make sure that we all play a role in order to curb this terrorist threat,"" Trudeau said.Hollande said ""we also have to act militarily"" in the fight against terrorism and ISIL, and thatCanada reaffirmed a number of principles important to France, including ""solidarity in the action against terrorism, each contributing their own means.""While some of Canada's key allies are looking to increase their bombing efforts against ISIL, Trudeau has promised that Canada will withdraw its CF-18 fighter jets from Iraq and Syria by March. The federal government will instead step up its efforts to train Kurdish and other local forces. The government has not officially decided what to do with the surveillance and refuelling aircraft Canada has also contributed to the airstrikes, but is consulting allies to see where its efforts can best be used, be it for humanitarian assistance, or at the diplomatic and political level.Senior officials within the Prime Minister's Office say no leader has ever asked Trudeau to rethink his commitment to pull the CF-18s out of Syria and Iraq. The attacks have ramped up fortress-like security for the United Nations climate-change conference that starts Monday. It is expected to attract more than 20,000 delegates, journalists and environmentalists to Paris. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada175","Energy agency blocking carbon reduction: official; Utilities commission on wrong side of green issue","December 11, 2015 Friday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","The B.C. Utilities Commission is standing in the way of society's move to low-carbon energy systems and needs to change its views, Vancouver city manager Sadhu Johnston said Thursday.By rejecting a franchise agreement between the city and Creative Energy Vancouver Platforms that included a ""carbon reduction rider,"" the commission is on the wrong side of society's efforts to reduce the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, he said.The rider, which would have required new buildings to pay a special fee to fund a future lowcarbon biomass plant, was considered ""unfair"" by the BCUC. Creative and the city argued the rider would help prevent ""rate shock"" when the proposed energy centre is built sometime before 2020. It would also start conditioning users to pay the true value of a low-carbon energy source.""To be honest, the disappointment is that there isn't greater recognition by the BCUC of the need to achieve low-carbon utilities,"" said Johnston, who has championed the city's carbon reduction efforts through its Greenest City Action Plan.On Tuesday, the utility commission allowed Creative Energy to proceed with construction of a new hot water heat distribution system in Northeast False Creek.But it rejected a neighbourhood energy franchise agreement between Creative and the city, saying parts of it - including the carbon rider - were inappropriate.Johnston said it wasn't so much the loss of rider that bothered him as the refusal of the BCUC to consider the need for low-carbon systems. He noted the commission had rejected a similar rider last year for Corix Multi-Utility Services' district energy system at UBC.With public attention focused on the United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris, the commission's ruling sets the goal of carbon reduction back a step, he said.""It is a bit of a shame, especially coming on the heels of Paris and the global recognition we need to address carbon,"" Johnston said. ""Here we have the premier recognizing B.C. isn't going to achieve their 2020 targets and the group at the BCUC not recognizing the need for this. When we see setbacks like this or folks who don't see the value, it is disappointing.""The BCUC said it wouldn't respond to Johnston's comments.The city has a lot at stake in the Creative Energy proposal. The heating system, formerly owned by Central Heat Distribution, is the city's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The city has been working with the company on a plan to make a ""fuel switch"" from natural gas to low-carbon sources such as wood waste.Trent Berry, chairman of Creative Energy, said the company is just finishing a feasibility study on an energy facility and will deliver it to the city later this month. He said the study looked at a variety of fuel sources as well as locations, including a piece of False Creek property the city has reserved. Creative is paying market rent on the land pending the city's review of the study.Johnston said Vancouver would not assume financial risk.""We are not expecting to finance their project. We would expect they would finance it. There may be opportunities for us to play a role in terms of the pipe going through city streets, or even the city owning the pipe, but we definitely don't intend to pay for the development and we don't intend to loan any money for the facility,"" he said.Michael Allison, a spokesman for FortisBC, which was an intervener in the case, said the company is reviewing the panel's decision but is still concerned about Creative enjoying a monopoly.""Our view is that people should be able to choose the right energy for their use, whether it is electricity or gas,"" Allison said.

He spoke of war and peace, nuclear arms control, human dignity, social justice, poverty, girls' education, religious freedom, drug trafficking and more.He also touched on an overarching theme - the future of the Earth itself - threatened as it is by climate change driven by ""a selfish and boundless thirst"" for power and money, as he put it.In Francis's view, God's very creation is imperiled by the relentless ravaging of the planet's natural resources for profit, heedless of the consequences. Humankind ""is not authorized to abuse it (creation), much less to destroy it,"" he told the UN General Assembly. There's ""a certain sacredness"" to created nature, he said.That concern resonates strongly here in Canada, and not just among members of Francis's Roman Catholic flock.Early in his tenure Conservative leader Stephen Harper pronounced Canada an ""emerging energy superpower,"" and he has made this country an international pariah in environmental circles by spending the past decade encouraging aggressive exploitation of the western oilsands and dodging any responsibility for curbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet to a dangerous level.That abdication of responsibility doesn't sit well with a large majority of Canadians, four in five in one recent poll, who have come to share the Pope's view that we need to do better. They want whomever they elect on Oct. 19 - and that includes another Conservative government, if the party wins a rare fourth consecutive term - to show more leadership than Harper has to date in tackling climate change. It has become an issue of trust on the stump.In his years in office Harper has consistently decried carbon taxes as ""job killers."" While his government promises to cut greenhouse emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, it has no credible plan to curb oilsands output, our fastest-growing source of emissions, nor has it come up with regulations to meet its target.New Democrat Leader Thomas Mulcair, in contrast, favours a practical Quebec/Ontario-style cap-and-trade system to price carbon, currently about $16 a metric tonne. He also vows to end fossil fuel subsidies and make polluters pay. Ambitiously, the NDP aims to cut emissions by 34 per cent below 1990 levels by 2025.Justin Trudeau's Liberals also propose to ""put a price on carbon pollution"" by working with the provinces. As well, he would invest heavily in clean technologies and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Elizabeth May's Green Party would also tax carbon, and rebate dividends to the public. She'd leave most of the oilsands in the ground and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. The Greens aim to cut emissions by 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2025.All three opposition parties come closer to subscribing to the Pope's view that political leaders have an obligation to put forward ""concrete steps and immediate measures for preserving and improving the natural environment"" from further despoilment.Of course, Francis couched his concern for the environment in religious language, invoking the Creator as a loving architect of the universe, the notion of humankind as stewards of creation, and the intrinsic value of life. But there was no mistaking his hard-headed, practical ""ask"" of political leaders in Canada and other energy-rich countries.At the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11, he challenged them to come up with ""fundamental and effective agreements"" to curb carbon use, and halt a damaging warming trend.It would be good to see Canada play a constructive, leading role at those talks after playing the spoiler for so long.\l"

But it is not, of course, an unexpected admission to come from Alberta's first NDP premier, particularly one who had been the party's environment critic.The watchdog has become the top dog and now Notley can put some of her environmental policies into action. That begins with a whack at the old PC government that for years claimed it was an international leader on environmental protection.During that time, Notley complained the government's duplicity was not only damaging Alberta's reputation but harming the province's ability to ship oilsands products to market.Now, she is vowing to improve Alberta's image but, like the first step in a 12-step program, says Alberta has to admit it has a problem: ""Nobody is going to listen to us if we continue to talk about things that those who are engaged in the issue understand to be untrue.""Notley has only been on the job a little more than three weeks and you get the impression during a half-hour one-on-one interview that she still wants to pinch herself. Understandably, she is more guarded than she was as an opposition critic, but there are flashes of the passionate watchdog when the interview touches on Alberta's environmental record.""Whether you're talking about markets in Europe or anywhere else, those folks are pretty apprised of the issues, so we can't simply put out a news release saying that we have a world-class program when we don't.""Environment Minister Shannon Phillips has promised to deal with the levy before June 30, but neither she nor Notley will say if they will simply continue the status quo or increase the tax.But the biggest step of all involves writing a comprehensive climate change strategy that is tough and believable, but pragmatic enough not to damage the provincial economy. That's going to take time.How long? Notley won't say. ""That is an issue that needs to be fleshed out more when we engage in the discussions around the climate change strategy, because on the flip side, we also need to consider the economic health of the province, we need to consider jobs, and we need to consider other strategies for making progress on climate change."" Notley said.Notley definitely wants to have something in place by the fall, well ahead of her trip to Paris, which will host the Climate Change Conference inDecember. A pro-environment Alberta premier turning up at an international conference on climate change? Now, that would be unprecedented.Does she think Alberta will be a lone voice in Paris given that the federal government is as famous a laggard on the environment as was Alberta's old PC government?Perhaps inadvertently, Notley slips out of premier mode and back into opposition mode with an answer unlikely to win friends with the Stephen Harper government.""Between now and Paris we're going to have a federal election. We could see a pretty significant change in terms of the country's representation in Paris with either of the other two opposition parties.""gthomson@edmontonjoural. com !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

Instead, the G7 agreed to a full-blown no-carbon economy, but not until 2100.""We commit to doing our part to achieve a low-carbon global economy in the long-term including developing and deploying innovative technologies striving for a transformation of the energy sectors by 2050 and invite all countries to join us in this endeavour,"" the leaders said in their final communique.""To this end we also commit to develop long term national low-carbon strategies.""Prime Minister Stephen Harper took part in the G7 leaders' shortened talks on climate change today as their summit entered its second and final day.He was expected to address Canadian reporters on the implications for Canada.Canada and Japan worked behind the scenes to water down the G7 statement on climate change.The Canadian Press has been told by sources who saw the working draft of the G7's climate change communique that the two countries blocked attempts at a stronger statement on binding greenhouse gas reduction targets.Merkel has placed the fight against climate change at the heart of her sweeping agenda.She wants the G7 summit to give France momentum when it hosts the United Nations this December in which it hopes to reach a breakthrough agreement in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Merkel had been pushing the G7 to endorse a pledge to reach zero carbon emissions, but Canada and Japan were holdouts.""Canada and Japan are the most concerned about this one,"" said one source who was privy to discussions but would only speak on the condition of anonymity.""The two of those countries have been the most difficult on every issue on climate.

Instead, Canada will now resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of year.Trudeau said Wednesday that the Paris terror attacks, which killed 130 people and injured hundreds others, changed the conversation around the Liberal commitment to welcome 25,000 Syrian refugees by Dec. 31, and sparked more questions among Canadians about security.The government did not want Canada's commitment to helping refugees to become a divisive issue and affect how Canadians welcomed the Syrians, he said.Canadians expect the government ""to do the right thing the right way,"" he said.""One of the things that changed with Paris was the perception that Canadians had: Canadians who have been extremely supportive and open to the idea of bringing in more refugees and demonstrating that Canada is there to help, had a few more questions,"" Trudeau told reporters in London, after delivering a speech about Canadian diversity to around 250 people packed into the Canadian High Commission.""We realized that the most important thing is to be able to reassure Canadians that absolutely everything is being done to keep Canadians safe, and therefore ensure that these refugees are welcomed as new Canadians and not a cause for anxiety or division within the population. That has been our focus. Getting this done right has always been what we are focused on.""Trudeau said his government has been encouraged and touched by the outpouring of support across the country for the refugees. Canada is not simply welcoming 25,000 refugees, ""we're welcoming 25,000 Canadians,"" he said.Of the 10,000 Syrians due to arrive by the end of the year, 8,000 will be privately sponsored. The government will screen thousands of refugees overseas before they arrive in Canada.Trudeau said his government remains committed to eventually resettling 25,000 government-sponsored refugees, on top of the privately sponsored ones.The large number of privately sponsored refugees in the initial group of 25,000 is ""because they are already in the pipes and already much easier to integrate,"" he said.Trudeau arrived in Europe earlier in the day for the start of a six-day trip to London, Malta and Paris that will see him hold bilateral talks with the British prime minister and French president, meet the Queen, attend the Commonwealth summit, and lead Canada at the United Nations' .It's the second foreign mission for Trudeau in as many weeks.

They also expect to implement a framework titled ""Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.""""There is an opportunity for Canada to be there at the Commonwealth where some other countries like the U.S., like Germany, will not be, and we'll be able to push some of the countries that have been less enthusiastic about an ambitious resolution coming through Paris, and actually be an active proponent and player on that stage,"" Trudeau said earlier.""It's not just about Canada stepping up itself on the fight against climate change. It's also about Canada engaging with the world community in a leadership role and encouraging the kind of actions that are going to be necessary across the entire world.""He'll also be raising the issues of human rights, democracy and good governance ""that I think are necessary at the Commonwealth,"" Trudeau said.""I certainly won't shy away from the necessary conversations to promote the kind of openness, responsibility and transparency that Canada has demonstrated,"" he said.On the margins of the Commonwealth meeting, Trudeau will hold bilateral talks with the Prince of Wales, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, and other Commonwealth leaders.Harper boycotted the Sri Lanka gathering, saying that attending the meeting would have effectively endorsed the country's terrible human rights record.The former Conservative government also pulled $20 million in discretionary Commonwealth funding, arguing the organization was turning a ""blind eye"" to human rights abuses, undemocratic behaviour and religious intolerance.

The new Liberal government has so far refused to set a carbon reduction target in advance of the COP21 international climate conference that begins at the end of the month, citing the need to consult with the provinces before putting in place a credible national plan.But with environmental groups loudly complaining that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will take Stephen Harper's climate plan to the world, McKenna moved Monday to put some parameters around Canada's position.McKenna is in Paris attending ministerial meetings in advance of COP21, where the international community hopes to set in place a post-2020 framework for global action on climate change.The Conservatives announced in May that Canada's contribution to this year's Paris talks would be a 30 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels by the year 2030. Canada, however, is not on track to meet its existing 2020 cuts under the 2009 Copenhagen accord, and the Harper government did not provide any policies to meet the more ambitious 2030 goal.""Yes, that will be the floor, but certainly we want to try to do better,"" McKenna said in a conference call after repeatedly skirting the question of targets.The key, she said, is ""to figure out what you can actually do. You can have a target, but you have to be able to meet the target and you have to take concrete actions toward those targets.""Canadian governments - Liberal and Conservative alike - have previously agreed to international carbon cuts, but failed to implement the policies needed to make those cuts a reality.The Conservatives famously failed to regulate the oil and gas sector despite promising to do so for the better part of a decade.""That is why it is so important to sit down with the provinces and territories and look at how we can all do our part,"" said McKenna. ""Much of this is in the jurisdiction of the provinces.""The premiers have been invited to join Trudeau in Paris at the beginning of December, but it remains unclear what specifically Canada brings to COP21.Federal-provincial dialogue after a decade of division is a good thing, said Stephen Guilbault of Equiterre, but he reminded the Liberals that at some point they'll have to make some tough decisions.Citing Saskatchewan's premier, Guilbault questioned whether ""Brad Wall is going to have an epiphany and say, 'Oh yeah, let's go ahead, I'm full in.' No, we have to be realistic about that. We won't get everybody on board.""\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada192","Game over for climate activists","February 12, 2016 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Environmentalists' faint hope that they can get international action on climate change gets fainter by the day. This week the United States Supreme Court added to their despair by kiboshing President Obama's pledge, at December's climate talks in Paris, to lead the world on climate change. ""This could be the proverbial string which causes Paris to unravel,"" The New York Times reported.At the heart of Obama's Paris pledge was his Clean Power Plan, an executive order hyped as ""the first-ever carbon pollution standards for existing power plants."" The plan, rolled out with much fanfare prior to the Paris meetings to create a sense of momentum, was designed to shut down America's fleet of coal-powered generating plants. The White House boasted its plan would help reduce CO2 emissions by 32 per cent by 2030 and lead to 30 per cent more renewable energy generation in 2030.Except it was an empty boast based on an unconstitutional plan, said 29 states and state agencies, which successfully argued that the Obama plan needed congressional approval to proceed. The Supreme Court agreed to an immediate halt of Obama's plan, sending it to a lower court and all but guaranteeing that, when Obama leaves office in 2017, the plan will remain in deep freeze.India, China and other countries that were cajoled into making carbon-cutting commitments at Paris are now under no pressure to cut emissions either. As one adviser to China's Paris delegation put it, ""Look, the United States doesn't keep its word.Why make so many demands on us?"" U.S. environmental groups concur. ""If the U.S. isn't moving on climate action, it makes it really hard to go back to other countries and say, 'Do more, we're delivering,'"" admits the Natural Resources Defense Council.Not that any of the carbon reduction demands were binding, or even meaningful. The Paris talks succeeded only in continuing the pretence that the countries of the world were morally committed to action on climate change. Now even that pretence is vanishing. Seven years after Obama declared that, under his transformative presidency, the oceans would stop rising, it is dawning on environmentalists that his entire contribution to the debate amounts to no more than lofty rhetoric. Obama's climate change legacy will be remembered for two terms of hope without change.Environmentalists last year had more than a transformative president going for them - they had El Nino, the Pacific Ocean phenomenon that periodically brings unusually warm weather to us, and opportunities for propaganda to global warming enthusiasts. Yet the public yawned at the claims that the Earth was experiencing its hottest year in record - people have tired of this mantra, as polling consistently shows. And environmentalists must know that, if they can't be persuasive in an El Nino year, what are their chances in subsequent years, during which La Nina typically brings unusually cold weather?The presidential election season can only add to the environmentalists' funk. With the Democrats fielding either an unpopular Hillary Clinton or an unelectable, socialist Bernie Sanders, the Republicans are widely believed to be favoured to win, landing a death blow to climate change activism. With both Republican front-runners, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, considering global warming claims to be outright shams, funding for the climate change industry will dry up. Cruz promises to defund the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's premier global warming lobbyist, along with every other program promoting climate change alarmism. Trump likely would, too, given his belief that global warming policies hurt American business.Even if a Democrat should win the presidency, the climate change industry has no hope for a comeback. Republicans will still hold the purse strings through their control over the legislature - that's why Obama resorted to an executive order to impose his Clean Power Plan, in a faint hope of his own that he could further the agenda he so passionately believes in.So much hope in that fount seven years ago; so little left today. For those environmentalists still clinging to climate change beliefs, hope does not spring eternal.Lawrence Solomon is executive director of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based environmental group.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada195","Opinion: Canadians can prosper from environmental action","December 2, 2015 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","Canada headed to the United Nations climate change conference with a $2.5-billion fund to help developing countries reduce their carbon output and $300 million more to develop clean technologies here at home.The Alberta government's plan for a carbon tax, the proceeds of which will be used to fund cleaner-energy initiatives, has broad support in the general population and, perhaps surprisingly, in the energy-producing industry.For the first time in years, there's a national consensus on the need to take environmental action. The willingness of industry to be a part of this movement bodes well, not only for the effort itself, but also for Alberta's economy.Alberta depends on the energy industry. As Premier Rachel Notley recently acknowledged in a Toronto speech, thousands of Albertans rely on it for their jobs and standards of living, and she will fight to protect those jobs.Protecting jobs in the energy industry needn't conflict with preservation of the environment. In fact, if the premier follows her own party's platform, the environmental impact of the oilsands can be significantly mitigated.The New Democrats have always argued that more of our natural resources should be processed in Canada. The Alberta wing of the party has reiterated that approach with respect to Alberta's industry. More processing in this province means less carbon use in transporting the product to market and, combined with the new carbon-tax regime, gives provincial companies the incentive to develop new technologies to mitigate industry's environmental impact.My concern is that the province is squandering a significant part of this opportunity through the suspension of funding for new carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. CCS adds value to Alberta's oilsands product because it makes it more acceptable to North American markets. It's in its relative infancy as a carbon-control technique, but is already proving to be a feasible way of significantly reducing the carbon impact of the oilsands.Combined with the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line project, Shell's Quest CCS facility will eliminate the equivalent carbon output of 250,000 cars per year.There have been cost overruns and allegations of financial mismanagement surrounding the project. But as the first commercial-scale CCS facility designed for oilsands, difficulties could certainly have been expected. Once we have more experience building such facilities, costs should come down and efficiencies in construction will increase.The argument is made that we should invest in alternative forms of energy rather than existing fuels such as oil. To me, that's like saying we can ignore the problems of today and think solely about an electric-powered future that might take 50 to 100 years to arrive.If most people started buying electric vehicles tomorrow, we'd need huge investment to support the infrastructure electric cars would require. I'm not arguing it's impossible or undesirable to switch, but achieving it will take decades.In the meantime, much can be done to improve the environment right now. CCS is an example of something that can mitigate the carbon usage of our oil-based economy in the near future. It would be foolish to ignore its potential, despite the teething problems of the world's first few commercial-scale operations.Although it seems counterintuitive, pipel"

The evidence is there. And here's the thing about evidence-based policy making - sometimes it's going to lead us to a difficult place and to difficult choices,"" McKenna said in a keynote speech to the Canada 2020 conference.""We need to come to grips with the challenge we're facing - and we need to act. No more delays. No more denials. We need to act. None of this is going to be easy.""McKenna said that having Canada do its part to fight climate change ""does not mean sacrificing"" energy production or economic growth, but added that development projects must meet grittier environmental standards and have public support.She reiterated that the federal government will work with the provinces in the coming months, after the Paris conference, to come up with ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets and a ""clear and practical"" plan for achieving them.Couillard, meanwhile, is calling for a complete ""rebranding"" of how Canada sells itself on the international stage when it comes to energy and environment.Quebec alone is fourth in the world in renewable energy, and Canada as a whole is third, he said. ""But who knows that?"" Further, close to 70 per cent of the Canadian population lives in provinces that attach a strong pricing signal to carbon through a market or a revenue-neutral carbon tax, he said.""This should be our message in Paris. The fact that Canada is at the same time an important oil producer and also a leader in renewable energy,"" said Couillard. ""Obviously a serious exercise of rebranding is needed. A new narrative is needed,"" he added. ""Nobody knows the true picture of Canada's energy sector.""Wynne said the declaration signed by all provinces and territories from the Quebec climate summit this past April will be the ""launching pad"" for premiers going into the first ministers' meeting and will form a strong foundation for the Paris conference. The declaration included commitments to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050; to implement programs that reduce GHG emissions through measures such as carbon pricing, carbon capture and storage and other technological innovation; and to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, among other initiatives.Wynne says the declaration agreed to by the provinces shows the federal government that the ""kids' table has learned to work really well together,"" she said, ""so we're not going to take any nonsense.""Couillard noted provinces like Quebec and Ontario have achieved substantial emissions reductions in recent years, but that ""lowhanging fruit"" has already been collected in terms of cutting GHGs.""What's ahead of us is going to be extremely difficult,"" he said, specifically noting Canada's transportation sector that is responsible for about one-quarter of the country's emissions.Wynne agreed that Ontario's biggest GHG challenge ahead of it is from the transportation sector and tailpipe emissions, and that the province is faced with whether to build more roads or make the ""really difficult decisions"" about transit.

Such gatherings of first ministers were rare under the previous government.Before they even met with Trudeau, the premiers held their own afternoon meeting and boasted about the strides the provinces are making to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Many congratulated Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley, who on the weekend unveiled Alberta's new climate change.It includes $3 billion in carbon taxes, a transition from coal to renewable energy, and a hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions for the oilsands.Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne called it an ""extremely important"" development. ""Even with all of the work that Ontario and Quebec and British Columbia had done, there was always a question of where Alberta was going to fit into that story,"" she said.Quebec and Ontario have developed a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and B.C. has its own carbon tax.With Alberta's move, Wynne said the premiers will be able to join Trudeau at the upcoming United Nations in Paris ""with a very strong story to tell.""The premiers' arrival in the nation's capital for a meeting with Trudeau resumed a federal-provincial practice that had grown cold under Stephen Harper.Previous prime ministers such as Pierre Trudeau, Brian Mulroney, Jean Chr\'e9tien and Paul Martin held first ministers' conferences on issues ranging from the Constitution to the economy and health care.But Harper preferred private one-on-one sessions with the premiers and the conferences went by the wayside during his decade in power.By contrast, Trudeau not only met them Monday, he will bring them to Paris for the climate change summit, then meet them again within 90 days.Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard also congratulated Notley for her climate change policy.""It's really a change in direction that has to be recognized as such. The fact that coal is going to be abandoned as a source of energy to produce electricity is going to have a major impact.""Moreover, he said there is an opportunity to adjust international perceptions of Canada.""Our country needs a serious effort in rebranding on this theme of climate change and energy. Not only are we an important producer of oil, which we should be happy with because it's a source of wealth for Canada, but we're also the third-largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world.""Couillard said that with Alberta's announcement, about 80 per cent of Canada's population will be living in a jurisdiction where a ""strong price on carbon"" has been established.""So that's a very significant message. Nobody knows that in the world, by the way. It has to be known. It has to be said. It has to be repeated.""B.C. Premier Christy Clark said the nation's leaders are now ""lifting the curtain on Canada's success to show the world. And we can only do that if we have a strong voice on the international stage.""""So that is a big change for us. We have had a black eye for a long time on environmental issues and we have not deserved it.""She the provinces and Canada will now get a chance to show the world what has been happening in this country.""I think they'll be a little bit surprised. But I hope it will be a pleasant surprise.""

The Queen is the official Head of the Commonwealth.Several government leaders of Commonwealth nations, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were looking for more leadership in the organization.In accepting the position, Baroness Scotland said climate change is an ""existential threat"" to small island states, and said in a news release the United Nations starting Monday in Paris is an opportunity to ""put the Commonwealth on a different path.""She promised to prioritize human rights and gender equality and combat domestic violence.Former prime minister Stephen Harper grew frustrated with the Commonwealth and specifically Sharma, the outgoing secretary-general, for refusing to move the 2013 CHOGM from Sri Lanka, plunging relations to their lowest point in Canadian-Commonwealth history.Harper boycotted the Sri Lanka gathering, saying that attending the meeting would have effectively endorsed the country's terrible human rights record.The former Conservative government also pulled $20 million in discretionary Commonwealth funding, arguing the organization was turning a ""blind eye"" to human rights abuses, undemocratic behaviour and religious intolerance. Canada is the second-highest contributor to the Commonwealth, next to the United Kingdom.Trudeau, however, seemed to be a big hit at the summit and, as the newest head of government, delivered a toast to the Queen. He also held a handful of bilateral meetings over the past couple of days before leaving Malta on Saturday.Here is an explanation of the role of the secretary-general and biography of Baroness Patricia Scotland.BackgroundThere is no formal job description for the post of Secretary-General. Candidates must be citizens of Commonwealth countries and can only serve two terms of four years. The role is to promote and protect Commonwealth values and principles set out in the Commonwealth Charter, represent the Commonwealth globally and manage the Commonwealth Secretariat and its various programmes.The Secretary-General facilitates consultation and is responsible for convening the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, Commonwealth Ministerial Meetings and a range of other meetings. The Secretary-General maintains contact with Commonwealth governments as well as with civil society and other leaders. Another important function is to exercise 'Good Offices' when the Commonwealth's fundamental values are threatened or when political tensions arise in member states.The post of Secretary-General was created together with the Commonwealth Secretariat at the 1965 Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference in London. Since then there have been six incumbents: Kamalesh Sharma (2008-2016) of India; Sir Don McKinnon of New Zealand (2000-2008); Chief Emeka Anyaoku of Nigeria (1990-2000); Sir Shridath 'Sonny' Ramphal of Guyana (1975-1990); and Arnold Smith of Canada (1965-1975).Baroness Patricia Scotland, Sixth Commonwealth Secretary-GeneralBaroness Patricia Scotland was born in Dominica in 1955, then moved with her family to Britain. She obtained her LLB in 1976, was called to the Bar in 1977 and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1991. She received a life peerage and was created Baroness Scotland of Asthal in 1997. Baroness Scotland has held the position of Attorney General (2007 to 2010), Minister of State (Home Office) (Crime Reduction) (2007 to 2007), Minister of State (Home Office) (Criminal Justice and Offender Management) (2003 to 2007), and Parliamentary Secretary (Lord Chancellor's Department) (2001 to 2003) in government.

Flood mitigation is only one of several hot-button issues now on the horizon for the Notley government as it deals with the incoming Trudeau government.

The partying had barely subsided following Monday's vote celebrating four massive Liberal wins on P.E.I. when other priorities quickly appeared. Speculation is already turning to possible cabinet posts and provincial priorities for federal dollars.While some Islanders were still absorbing the results of the election, others were already starting to lobby the new majority Liberal government. P.E.I. Premier Wade MacLauchlan was quick to offer his congratulations Tuesday to Justin Trudeau for his stunning victory. In almost the same breath, the premier said, ""To grow our province's economy in a strategic manner we will require federal support."" The premier said the province will dedicate whatever time and resources are necessary to achieve the best results possible in federal-provincial relationships and negotiations. And the province has pledged to work collaboratively with the new prime minister and his four Island MPs on priorities that benefit the Island, including the economy, infrastructure, healthcare, housing, workforce initiatives, energy and climate change. It's quite a shopping list for day one from the premier.Surprisingly, the premier did not offer an opinion - at least in his statement Tuesday - about a P.E.I. cabinet position. Atlantic Canada's 32 seats all went Liberal and the party's success continued westward without a hiccup into Quebec, Ontario, central Canada and B.C. There are 184 Liberal MPs to choose from and P.E.I. will have to lobby hard to get at least one senior portfolio.Lobbying is underway and much of it supports Charlottetown MP Sean Casey or Egmont MP Bobby Morrissey for cabinet. Mr. Casey was critic for veterans' affairs and justice and could be tabbed for either portfolio. Mr. Morrissey is a fresh face on the federal scene and has experience in provincial cabinets. He has also attracted attention for defeating cabinet heavyweight Gail Shea.A possible obstacle in the way of Cardigan MP Lawrence MacAulay or Malpeque MP Wayne Easter is that both were in previous Liberal cabinets and have an association with former regimes. Mr. Trudeau is promising change and a new way of doing things and might prefer to promote newer faces to the inner circle.Charlottetown Mayor Clifford Lee is looking forward to getting a piece of P.E.I.'s share of promised billions for infrastructure. A new well field, fire station and water and sewer infrastructure are all on the city's list.With a Liberal premier and government in power provincially, and four Liberal MPs in a majority national government, there are expectations it will result in a beneficial relationship.The new PM has promised to work closely with the premiers so a first minister's conference will likely be one of his first priorities to develop a strategy for the United Nations in Paris Nov. 30 -Dec. 11. Mr. Trudeau has promised to invite the premiers to attend the conference - a welcome change from Mr. Harper who hadn't sat down with the premiers as group in more than eight years.The new PM has promised to fast track an additional 25,000 Syrians refugees to Canada this year and this province appears ready to welcome its share of new immigrants.This could also be the final federal election under the current first-past-the-post rules as Mr. Trudeau, the NDP and Greens are all supporting electoral reforms. This province is holding democratic renewal sessions so we could become a prototype for something greater on a national scale, although majority governments are usually reluctant to get involved in electoral reform ideas.P.E.I. and Ottawa recently signed off on the multimillion- dollar underwater cable agreement so let's hope the change in government won't delay this essential energy deal.And one more thing, Mr. Trudeau. This province would appreciate having its senate vacancy filled, preferably after consultations with the province and Opposition, to get a qualified candidate working as soon as possible for the province in the upper chamber.\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada202","High expectations for change","October 22, 2015 Thursday","The Star Phoenix (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan)","Smith is an assistant professor in the department of political studies at St.Thomas More College in the University of Saskatchewan.After an exhausting 11-week campaign Canadians cast their ballots on Monday night, handing Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party a sizable majority government. While pundits had been speculating for several weeks on whether the Liberals had enough support to win government, the story of the campaign is as much one of Conservative and NDP defeat as it is of Liberal resurgence and victory.Unlike campaigns of the most-recent past, the 2015 campaign really boiled down to a referendum on Stephen Harper's record in government. Moreover, with polls showing that 70 per cent of Canadians were ready for ""change,"" both the Liberals and the New Democratic Party struggled to cast their leaders as the agents of this so-called change.While campaigns based on ""change"" are generally banal and hollow, they often resonate with voters who are looking to replace governments that have slipped into passive forms of entitlement or, in the case of Harper's government, used the organs of the state to openly transform Canadian society based on its own interpretation of modernday conservatism. When the Conservatives openly embraced xenophobic and racist campaign tactics in order to hold on to power, it became clear that the government had lost both its practical and moral authority to lead Canada.For the NDP, this election has to be one of disappointment. Not only did the party fall far short of expectations, it also lost much of its regional support in Quebec. The party also lost many of its key architects from previous elections, including stalwart members in Nova Scotia, Ontario and Manitoba.While many will speculate on why the party fell so far so fast, it's obvious that part of the problem lay with NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair's inability to connect with progressive voters through his overly risk-averse policy promises. Given the ambiguity in its platform alongside its partial embrace of the Conservatives' austerity budgets, the NDP lost a great deal of credibility as the agents of change.Although the party made some last minute attempts to appeal to its base by opposing the massive and yet unexplained Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, they came too late for the party to capitalize on.The fading of the NDP's fortunes proved to be a political opening for the Liberals. When Trudeau took a calculated risk that Canadians were ready to embrace more flexible forms of economic forecasting in order to kick start a sagging economy, he correctly read the mood of the electorate.Almost overnight, the Liberals began to rise in the polls. Coupled with Trudeau's tireless campaign performances and solid, if scripted, debate performances, the Liberals vaulted into a commanding lead in the polls. On election night, 39.9 per cent of Canadians handed Trudeau's Liberals 184 seats and a majority government.Now that it's in government, the party faces immediate challenges. During their campaign for ""real change"" the Liberals made 32 promises that ranged from making information on government more publicly accessible to ending omnibus legislative practices to giving the parliamentary budget officer real teeth to hold legislators accountable. They promised to introduce more proportional forms of voting and save home mail delivery, while generally incorporating a more open and democratic policy making process.When combined with Trudeau's more controversial policy proposals on legalizing marijuana and running three successive budget deficits, the party has an active policy agenda to implement its promised change.Meanwhile, the Liberal government faces an ailing economy and western provinces demanding fast tracking of oil and gas pipel"

That number is forecast to increase to 39 per cent by 2020.\'c2 Phillips said the effects of climate change can be seen in Alberta with wildfires,\'c2 drought and shrinking glaciers.\'c2 She told the conference that governments have been setting ambitious climate change goals for years without achieving them. She suggested that will change with her government.Action is 'integral'Phillips said\'c2 the people who say now is not the right time to deal with climate change never think there is a good time and are ""turning a blind eye to reality.""\'c2 ""Action on the environment is integral to Alberta's economic future. In order to remain competitive, ensure market access for our energy products, Alberta must and will improve our environmental performance.""\'c2 Chief\'c2 Allan Adam of the Athabasca\'c2 Chipewyan\'c2 First Nation told the conference about how dropping water levels are having an effect on his traditional land.\'c2 He told reporters he was optimistic about working with the new NDP government, but suggested they don't really have a choice at this point.\'c2 ""Right now the Alberta government is being forced to the table,"" he said. ""They have no choice to deal with this ever-growing problem. If we don't deal with it, and we don't sit down and talk with each other, it's only going to increase.""Bruce Nilles, senior campaign director with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, told the conference the effects of climate change are having an impact on health and insurance rates.\'c2 He said Alberta has to move away from using coal-fired power plants.\'c2 ""Coal-fired power plants are really one of the worst public health menaces we have,"" he said. ""So there's a huge opportunity to address public health concerns, climate concerns and really\'c2 diversify how electricity is produced in Alberta."" \'c2 'Pretty clear'Nicholas Rivers, the Canada Research chair for climate change and energy policy at the University of Ottawa, said Alberta's biggest challenge is convincing the rest of the world that it has a meaningful climate change policy.\'c2 Many people don't understand what the\'c2 province's current rules\'c2 \'e2\€  the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (SGER)\'c2 \'e2\€  actually are. He said the province should either do a better job communicating or change what it does.\'c2 ""Something that Alberta could do to get the buy-in from people\'c2 outside of the province\'c2 \'e2\€  that it was really doing meaningful action on climate change\'c2 \'e2\€ \£6 would [be to] transition to something that has more international understanding, like a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.""\'c2 Chris Severson-Baker, managing director of the Pembina Institute, said the forum is possible because the conversation on climate change in Alberta has become more open with the change in government. ""The government has been pretty clear that they're interested in hearing from all segments of civil society on a variety of issues, whereas in the past, the conversation around\'c2 climate change was not open,"" he said.""It wasn't very transparent. There were few opportunities for environmental organizations to make representations directly to government in a public forum.""Phillips announced last summer that\'c2 large emitters will have to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gases by\'c2 20 per cent in 2017 and carbon levies will double from $15 a tonne to $30 a tonne.Last week, hundreds of Albertans attended public sessions in Edmonton and Calgary to provide input on the new strategy.\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada205","Embrace a revenue-neutral carbon fee; Strong economy, vibrant energy sector crucial","August 24, 2015 Monday","Edmonton Journal (Alberta)","Within a year, more than 80 per cent of Canada's economy is expected to be covered by carbon pricing. This may come as a surprise, given that some environmental groups will have you believe that we here in Canada are carbon policy laggards. Even more surprising, Alberta was the first-mover on carbon pricing in Canada nearly a decade ago. But first-mover advantage aside, the current regulatory system has not resulted in significant emission reductions, and emissions have continued to climb. This is a problem that Alberta's climate change advisory panel must address.With carbon taxes, fees, and cap-and-trade regimes expanding across the provinces and other sub-national and national jurisdictions around the world, it is clear that carbon will be priced. But Albertans must ensure that this isn't done at the expense of the economy. Even as we transition to a low carbon economy, oil and gas will be significant economic drivers for many years to come, and Alberta should have the opportunity to benefit from our resources. Rather than ""leaving it in the ground,"" as some politicians would have us do, Canadians for Clean Prosperity believes that with a balanced carbon policy in place, Alberta can have both a strong economy, including a vibrant energy industry, and a clean environment.It all comes down to good policy. Striking the appropriate balance, particularly during difficult economic times in the province, is something Alberta's climate change panel will have to consider over the coming months. The panel recently announced its membership and released a discussion document for public sessions, which are expected to begin the week of Aug. 24. The panel, chaired by respected University of Alberta economist Andrew Leach, is tasked with delivering policy recommendations to Premier Rachel Notley before the United Nations' in Paris - a steep order given that the conference commences on Nov. 30. The panel is well balanced and experienced, and brings together collective expertise from the energy sector, environmental groups, and the aboriginal community. Notley should be commended for making climate change policy a priority for her government, and for the open and transparent consultation process that she has initiated.This policy review gives Alberta a historic opportunity to bring in the most effective and economically sound approach to emissions reduction: a revenue-neutral carbon fee. It's administratively simple and boasts results: A fee is charged based on carbon emissions and every dollar raised is returned to Albertans in the form of tax cuts. This type of fully refunded carbon fee is about reducing emissions, not increasing government spending, and focuses the revenue generated on easing the tax burden on Albertan families and job-creators.And the results? Corporate and consumer behaviours change, real emission reductions are seen, costs to the taxpayer are lowered and money is reinvested in the economy. Both the environment and the economy are safeguarded. This proven economic policy has been working for years in British Columbia, one of Alberta's closest trading partners. Under its revenue-neutral carbon fee, B.C. has seen its greenhouse gas emissions drop even as the province has enjoyed Canada's strongest GDP growth.If Alberta has the courage to follow B.C.'s example, Alberta can reduce emissions while also bringing in significant tax cuts to restore the ""Alberta Advantage"" and boost our economic growth.As a global leader in energy production, we have pride in our energy resources that afford us key economic and social benefits. We are justly proud of our technological innovations that have made a major contribution to fighting climate change. Now, with this policy, we can also be proud to be the first major energy producer in North America to implement these proven solutions to reconcile our economy and the environment.

An additional 23 subnational governments are also envisioning ways to price emissions.

There is little chance of our federal government imposing a national ""one-size-fits-all"" pricing system, while the emergence of a single international system is also highly unlikely.Our federal government remains committed to a sector-by-sector regulatory approach to reducing emissions (like emission standards for vehicles and regulations for coal-fired electricity generation).

Canada and 200 other nations will try to agree on a global deal to cut fossil fuel use from 2020 onwards, to prevent Earth's temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius over the pre-industrial average.""The ocean provides us with food, energy, minerals, drugs and half the oxygen in the atmosphere, and it regulates our climate and weather,"" Dr. Carol Turley of Britain's Plymouth Marine Laboratory told the BBC. ""We are asking policy-makers to recognize the potential consequences and raise the profile of the ocean in international talks where, up to now, it has barely got a mention.""The scientists warn that ""the business-as-usual scenario would put all ecosystems we considered at high or very high risk"" by the end of the century. By 2100 the ocean surface temperature would be 2 degrees Celsius higher, the sea surface would be 30 centimetres higher, oxygen content 2 per cent lower and acidity 70 per cent higher. ""These impacts will be cumulative or synergistic with other human impacts, such as overexploitation of living resources, habitat destruction, and pollution.""This call to action is an implicit rebuke to climate laggards, including Canada under Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government. At the federal level, at least, we have come to embody the reckless ""business-as-usual"" attitude that the marine scientists rightly decry. The Conservatives may scoff at New Democrat and Liberals proposals to curb carbon pollution, but they have failed utterly to live up to their own modest commitments and have nothing to brag about in the coming federal election.Without forceful action Canada will come nowhere close to meeting Harper's 2009 Copenhagen pledge to match efforts by the United States and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent by 2020 from their 2005 levels of 749 megatonnes. That implied a cut to about 622 megatonnes by 2020. Yet in 2013 we were still spewing 726 megatonnes, and on track to emit 727 megatonnes by 2020.Last year President Barack Obama promised to sharply cut U.S. emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025, putting Harper squarely on the spot.In May, with the election looming, Ottawa set out yet another moving target, promising a 30 per cent cut from 2005 levels by 2030. That implied a cut to 524 megatonnes or less. But as the Pembina Institute's Amin Asadollahi put it, ""given Canada's history of setting climate targets while failing to implement regulations to meet them, the announcement doesn't mean much."" Canada can't meet the new target without sharply reining in production from the Alberta oilsands, he noted.

""We are asking policy-makers to recognize the potential consequences ... and raise the profile of the ocean in international talks where, up to now, it has barely got a mention.""The scientists warn that ""the business-as-usual scenario ... would put all ecosystems we considered at high or very high risk"" by the end of the century. By 2100 the ocean surface temperature would be 2 degrees Celsius higher, the sea surface would be 30 centimetres higher, oxygen content 2 per cent lower and acidity 70 per cent higher. ""These impacts will be cumulative or synergistic with other human impacts, such as overexploitation of living resources, habitat destruction, and pollution.""This call to action is an implicit rebuke to climate laggards, including Canada under Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government. At the federal level, at least, we have come to embody the reckless ""business-as-usual"" attitude that the marine scientists rightly decry. The Conservatives may scoff at New Democrat and Liberals proposals to curb carbon pollution, but they have failed utterly to live up to their own modest commitments and have nothing to brag about in the coming federal election.Without forceful action Canada will come nowhere close to meeting Harper's 2009 Copenhagen pledge to match efforts by the United States and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent by 2020 from their 2005 levels of 749 megatonnes. That implied a cut to about 622 megatonnes by 2020. Yet in 2013 we were still spewing 726 megatonnes, and on track to emit 727 megatonnes by 2020.Last year President Barack Obama promised to sharply cut U.S. emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025, putting Harper squarely on the spot.In May, with the election looming, Ottawa set out yet another moving target, promising a 30 per cent cut from 2005 levels by 2030. That implied a cut to 524 megatonnes or less. But as the Pembina Institute's Amin Asadollahi put it, ""given Canada's history of setting climate targets while failing to implement regulations to meet them, ... the announcement doesn't mean much."" Canada can't meet the new target without sharply reining in production from the Alberta oilsands, he noted. And that hasn't happened.Meanwhile, the Earth continues to warm and the seas acidify.\l"

When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gathers Monday in Ottawa with the 13 provincial and territorial premiers it will be the first such meeting since Jan. 16, 2009.Stephen Harper, the prime minister at the time, had little use for group confabs with the premiers and shunned the sessions after that brief summit on the economy.But with Harper's defeat, Trudeau hopes to usher in a new era of federal-provincial co-operation - and get Canada's political leaders on the same page as they head to the UN conference on climate change in Paris next week.During his first foreign trip, the new prime minister called climate change an ""urgent and pressing reality that we need to address.""""I was glad to highlight that not only is Canada here to do its part, but our part includes putting pressure and encouraging other countries to step up in their commitments so we can ensure that the outcome of Paris is as ambitious and as optimistic as we need it to be,"" Trudeau said Thursday in Manila.Since taking office, Trudeau has signalled the environment will be a priority for his government.With so many Canadian representatives - from Ottawa, provinces and cities - headed to Paris, the prime minister said one goal of Monday's meeting is to make sure that message gets delivered on the world stage.""One of our desires is to ensure that all the different Canadians speaking from all different perspectives pass a very similar message, that Canada is going to step up and do its part to ensure that we reduce climate change causing emissions and that we continue to encourage all other countries and partners to do their part as well,"" Trudeau told reporters.The leaders will receive a briefing by top climate scientists Monday afternoon followed by a working dinner and then an evening news conference.Trudeau is hopeful he and the premiers will be able to reach some sort of national consensus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to craft a ""strong and cohesive message we will be delivering as Canadians in Paris.""Premier Kathleen Wynne, the prime minister's closest political ally among the provincial leaders, said she's ""hoping ... we'll have some consensus around the table.""\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada219","Opinion: Canada's forest industry ready to help fight against climate change","November 26, 2015 Thursday","Postmedia Breaking News","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with Canadian premiers and top climate scientists from across the country Nov. 23 to develop a strategy and cohesive position that Canada will take to the upcoming United Nations in Paris. The political symbolism of this meeting cannot be overstated.This was the first time in seven years that all of the premiers gathered together to meet with the Prime Minister and it is fitting that the topic they discussed was one of the defining issues of our generation - climate change. The message Canada sends to the rest of the world at the upcoming UN conference will lay the foundation for sustainable and responsible economic growth for decades to come. However, Canadian leadership must not only come from our government, but from industry as well.The Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC) strongly believes that Canada has an opportunity to establish itself as a world leader on climate change. As a resource and manufacturing industry that directly supports 230,000 well paid jobs across Canada and is a world leader in green, sustainable forest practices, we believe that no other sector is better positioned to help advance Canada's climate goals and establish itself as a world leader in that field.FPAC, in partnership with the Canadian Climate Forum, hosted a panel Nov. 19 with experts from industry, conservation and climate science to discuss how the forest industry can be part of the solution to a changing climate. At the event, climate scientist Dr. Stephen Colombo released a compelling research paper documenting the important role the forest industry plays in addressing climate change. The paper identifies how wood can support climate mitigation through both storage of carbon and as a substitute to more energy intensive materials, such as metal, concrete and plastic.""The best long-term strategy for climate change mitigation using forests is to harvest a sustainable supply of wood for use as timber, fibre or energy, a strategy recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading body on climate change science,"" states Dr. Colombo in his report. ""As noted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 'wood products from forests that are sustainably managed contribute to climate change mitigation through (1) carbon sequestration stored in wood-based and paper products, which represents an expanding net carbon sink; and (2) avoid emissions when substituted for more energy intensive material.'""Dr. Colombo also recognized Canada's forest products industry as a leader in reducing greenhouse gases, stating: ""Since 1990, the pulp and paper industry in Canada has reduced emissions by about 65 per cent."" Led by FPAC, the forest sector has also pledged to be carbon neutral across the supply chain by the end of 2015.There is no doubt that with four times more certified forests than any other country, Canada's forestry sector has emerged as a global environmental leader. However, there is much more that we must and will do. For example, the industry is working with environmentalists to explore evolving practices of sustainable forest management to increase forest resilience, which can be a long-term investment in reducing atmospheric CO2. The sector has also pledged to further improve its environmental credentials by 35 per cent by the end of the decade.As the forest industry continues to do its part, we want government to make sure that any revenue generated by a price on carbon be allocated to a carbon reduction fund, that any scheme be national in scope to avoid duplication and that early adopters such as the forest industry be recognized. FPAC also works closely with our colleagues in the International Council of Forest and Paper Associations. Together we are calling on governments and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to establish a clear policy structure for the use of forest biomass that reduces the risk of investment, and encourages innovation and the future competitiveness of our industry. We are also calling for market-based mechanisms capable of valuing mitigation actions that will incentivize the industry to continue taking action on climate change.The message Canada takes to Paris must clearly demonstrate that Canada, supported by its forest sector, is willing, able and ready right now to not only tackle climate change within our borders but will help other countries reduce GHG emissions and meet their responsibility by selling sustainable wood products and working with our international counterparts on sound climate policy. We believe this approach will further establish and solidify Canada as a respected and proactive global leader in addressing climate change.Prime Minister Trudeau, Environment and Climate Change Minister, Catherine McKenna and to provincial governments as well: As an industry that represents 12 per cent of Canada's manufacturing GDP, we are here to help. No other sector is better positioned to growing a greener tomorrow. -Curt Stevens is Chair of the Forest Products Association of Canada and CEO of Louisiana-Pacific.\£9 Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

CANADA AM 7:08:00 ET","THOMSON: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the United Nations climate change conference in Paris that Canada will do its part to fight global warming.JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Prime Minister): Canada is back, my good friends. We're here to help, to build an agreement that will do our children and our grandchildren proud. Merci beaucoup.THOMSON: Right now in Paris, it's day four of negotiations as nearly 200 countries try to reach a new climate agreement. So what is Canada's role at the bargaining table? Joining us now is environmental policy expert Mark Winfield. Great to have you in talk to about this.MARK WINFIELD (Environmental Studies Professor, York University): Good morning.THOMSON: It's such a key part of, you know, not only Justin Trudeau's campaign, but obviously Canada on the world stage right now, that speech was just in part of what he said. When we look at what Canada's role is in terms of contributing to climate change, 1.6 percent of global emissions, it's a relatively low number. So, how much weight do we carry?WINFIELD: I think, actually, a great deal, partially because our, our positioning is changing so much with the arrival of Mr. Trudeau, relative to where we've been over the last eight years with the Harper government, which was, which was disengaged, was, was very clear that it wasn't really interested in working on climate change. Indeed, was identified as playing a fairly active role in trying to stop international agreements. We kept getting awarded the fossil of the year by the environmental organizations working on the file. So there's a profound change in tone that we saw just there from Mr. Trudeau. But, but we're also a very important actor in all of this as well because we're, we're somewhat unusual among the industrialized countries, that although our emissions are small, we're actually projected, on a business as usual basis, for our emissions to grow quite substantially, which is not the situation with most other rest of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.THOMSON: And is that, you know, attributable to the oil sands.WINFIELD: Principally because of the oil sands. I mean, that, that is the major source of projected growth in greenhouse gas emissions from Canada.THOMSON: So, what about, when you look at the role that the United States plays, I mean, when you look at the power countries, the United States or, you know, whether it's China or India. You know, typically in an agreement like that, or if there should be one...WINFIELD: Yeah.THOMSON: ...that everybody would kind of follow what they say in terms of you know, is it going to be binding? Well you need the power structure behind it. Where's our role in that?WINFIELD: Our role in that is, is a number of different places. Part of it has been traditionally, Canada's traditional international role, has been to, to be the intermediary...THOMSON: Right.WINFIELD: ...to, to sort of be the broker, to, to sort of find the potential compromises that allow the conversation to move forward. I mean, in this case you've got the (inaudible) situation, China and the United States have already agreed in some broad strokes in terms of where they want to go. But there's a lot of detail and a lot of negotiation that has to happen, as to an actual agreement that everybody's going to be able to live with.THOMSON: There's been so many conferences...WINFIELD: Yeah.THOMSON: ...over the years...WINFIELD: Yeah.THOMSON: ...on climate change. And, and really, relatively little coming out of it. This time, there seems to be an enormous amount of discussion on what will be binding. Is it going to be the process? Or is it going to be the target?WINFIELD: Well, this is, this is the unknown at this stage, is what, what exactly are the firm commitments that are going to emerge? Is it going to be a broad commitment to price carbon on the part of the parties? Are there going to be specific numbers from individual countries? It sounds as if there may well be. But then the question is going to be how are those targets going to be enforced? Because we, we had targets 20 years ago, more than 20 years ago, coming out of Rio. We had even more specifically binding targets through the Kyoto protocol. And yet we, we failed to make any significant progress. So, one of the questions here is how do you, if you agree on targets, how do you make them enforceable?THOMSON: That'll be the ongoing question...WINFIELD: Yeah.THOMSON: ...for the, for the short term and the long-term, potentially. Thank you so much for coming in.THOMSON: Well, now the dangers of drug resistance.Load-Date:\~December 2, 2015\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada222","Mandryk: Wall's CO2 plan won't fly in Paris","October 30, 2015 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","REGINA - As Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall prepares for next month's United Nations in Paris, it is becoming apparent how little he has to offer.As a provincial leader, he only gets to attend the sub-nations element of the gathering, although provinces like ours do have a lot to say on environmental policies.And as a conservative leader representing the views of a jurisdiction reliant on the burning of fossil fuels for its economic well-being, his views may be offside with virtually everyone else in Paris - even among the Canadian leaders who will be attending.In fairness, Brad Wall is the elected representative of an oil-and-coal-producing jurisdiction and he does have a duty to speak up for the viability of fossil fuels.We are dependent on fossil fuels here. We need them to keep warm in minus-40 temperatures, to power the farm machinery needed to grow our food and the vehicles we need to cover vast distances.It may be a lonely task to make this point in Paris, but maybe it still needs to be made.But even if we argue that this is his role, Wall can only succeed in Paris if he can demonstrate what Saskatchewan has accomplished to address global warming.Heaven knows, we've had ample opportunity and resources to do a lot.As one of the world's great grain-producing regions, we could have made more inroads into the production of cleaner-burning ethanol. Similar to lowly North Dakota, Wall could be telling a much better Saskatchewan story on wind power. With all the wind we have, most farmers with a turbine could be selling power back to the grid.We are already a world leader in much cleaner natural gas. We could have developed more hydroelectric power in the north. And while this is a cold, frozen province for almost half the year, it is also a sunny place with solar power potential.However, Wall finds himself headed to Paris with really only one environmental initiative his Saskatchewan Party government is proudly promoting - the province's $1.5-billion carbon capture and storage initiative at Boundary Dam.The problem is, he's now struggling to sell carbon capture even at home.While Wall tweeted on Oct. 1, 2014 ""Sask, we're fully operational and making history,"" highly confidential briefing notes obtained by the NDP Opposition show the Boundary Dam project has only been able capture 90 per cent of emissions for short periods and is only working at all 45 per cent of the time. (Right now, it's shutdown until mid-November.)Further internal memos from February obtained by the NDP show that there have been ""numerous construction deficiencies"" that will require more than $80 million to fix. SaskPower will be taking SNC Lavalin to court to recover costs.Wall's response to the NDP's claims this week was that the Opposition should go down to Estevan to tell the 400 workers there they are shutting down and leaving the province without enough power. This may be a local political debate for next April's election, but it's not a great argument for Paris.Come to think of it, it may not even be that great an argument for Saskatchewan ratepayers slapped with 40-per-cent higher electrical bills since the Sask. Party's arrival - and now wondering why we paid Cenovus $12 million in penalties last year when SaskPower failed to deliver it enough carbon dioxide.Cenovus may get another $5 million this year, which seems a sweeter deal for the oil company than it is for us. It remains worth nothing Cenovus donated to the Sask. Party - $14,618 in 2014, $16,852 in 2013, $16,020 in 2012. Moreover, in its previous existence as Encana, it gave the Sask. Party more than $30,000 between 2007 and 2009.What the Alberta Progressive Conservative government abandoned as ""science experiment,"" is now a billion-dollar Saskatchewan gamble, with CO2 sales of $25 million a year (which hasn't yet been achieved because the project can't run at capacity).In addition, the government argues we can make $25 million to $35 million a year ($500-$700 million over 20 years) in oil royalties from added recovery. But then you have to subtract added electricity costs of $20 million a year ($400 million over 20 years) for carbon capture and another $20 million in annual production costs ($400 million in 20 years). That's $800 million total costs plus $1.5 billion in capital costs - but only $1.2 billion in all potential revenue.This won't fly in Paris. It may not even be flying in Saskatchewan.Mandryk is the political columnist for the Leader-Post.\£9 Copyright (c) The Regina Leader-Post !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

And there is no hope for Miami or New Orleans, even if we halt greenhouse gas emissions today.Anders Levermann is a co-author of the study. He is also the lead author of the Sea Level Change chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.You are the guy who tells people that their homes, with gorgeous ocean views, will drown. That can't possibly be a pleasant job.I was trained as theoretical physicist and I'm searching for catastrophes on the planet, in a sense. I enjoy the physics so much. I've written on how the monsoon system can tip, I'm searching for instabilities on the Antarctica ice sheet, I'm exploring the evolution of global sea level. There is a lot happening at the moment and that is bad for society. I know there is never good news but while you are doing the science, you don't think about those things ... you don't see the tragedies.But my work is to inform the society so we can find a way to avoid the unmanageable. In the end, the society has to decide.Climate-change despair is actually becoming a thing among scientists ...I'm not depressed. It's exciting to do the science; I really enjoy being a scientist.You have said repeatedly that we don't have to be afraid of rising sea levels.Yes, I keep saying that. You don't have to be afraid, you have to be worried. It isn't killing people. It's slow, it's eating up land, it's eating up our cultural heritage. It's a thing to worry about, to tackle. It will cost a lot of money ...Let's talk about the impending loss of cultural heritage. Very few people talk about sea-level rise in those terms.Some people think of cultural heritage as really old stuff that was built in the past, way past. But we are currently building cultural heritage. People bring life to cities. Cities like New York, New Orleans, Shanghai - it is the cultural heritage of the future. But at the same time, we are also committing them to the sea by more and more emissions. For every degree of warming, eventually we get a sea level rise of two metres or more. Two metres is what our models say now, but if you look into the past, it could be more. So, basically, we could lose the cultural heritage we are building right now.Your recent paper created quite a stir: yet another study that said Miami is doomed. But what was striking was how much we have already committed to long-term sea-level rise.The emissions that we produce now will impact climate in about 15 to 20 years. Whatever (outgoing prime minister) Stephen Harper is deciding now is relevant for his grandkids.We are still determining what our kids and grandkids will experience. We are the last generation that can do something. I thought at one point that it would be enough to educate the next generation to solve the problem, but we have to solve it.Why is it still hard to predict the rate of sea-level rise? (The study estimates a rise of 2.3 metres over 2,000 years, but it could occur more quickly.)If I put a cube of ice on this table, we will all agree that it will vanish but we will not agree when. And that is exactly the problem here.What worries you the most?I know the most about sea-level rise, but I worry a lot about how society will deal with abrupt climate change and weather extremities.Societies aren't necessarily as stable as we like to believe. Abrupt climate change and weather extremities put tension on a society and change its wellbeing, and that may lead to a tipping (point) for societies, even in the industrialized world.What is your hope for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in December?If society wants to stay below two-degree warming, which we have agreed to, the most important thing is a message to all emitters that we will become a renewable-energy world in the next decades and nothing will prevent that. Nothing can prevent that. It isn't necessarily politics that will decide how fast this (move to renewable energy) will have to go.Once you have said 'It is going to happen,' I think the economies of the world have always been faster than anything we dreamt of. Remember the transition from typewriters to computers? It wasn't a catastrophe.\l"

The report was released as Alberta's new NDP government has appointed an expert panel to review its emissions policies ahead of the United Nations' in Paris in December that's expected to produce an agreement to address GHG emissions globally.""Alberta must and will improve our environmental performance,"" Environment Minister Shannon Phillips told a climate change conference hosted by The Pembina Institute on Wednesday in Edmonton.

""It was unreal. Like it came out of the clouds. Penguins and icebergs.""Today, as we conclude Head of the Class Spirit Week, we are continuing to visit with special student-athletes across the province at both the university and high school levels who best represent the ideals of athletics, academics and the quest to make a difference through their actions.Tourigny, a 2012 HOC valedictorian, is just such a person.As a two-time B.C. high school champion in the 400-metre hurdles, she not only came back this season from a devastating knee injury that robbed her of her first two seasons of university competition with the Thunderbirds, but she also qualified for the recent NAIA championships in her specialty event, finishing fifth nationally.And in the classroom, where she has nurtured her passion for the brain and all its inner workings through her behavioural neuroscience major, a new branch of fascination has now emerged, one which encompasses the study of our Earth and its oceans, and how changes to our environment will impact human health in the future.In the three years since she donned cap and gown, flipped her tassel and helped send her fellow Grey Wolves into the big world, Tourigny has worked in neuroscience research labs, done clinical studies at B.C. Children's Hospital, done outreach in the form of mentorships with elementary-aged students, and not only travelled to Antarctica, but also to Peru for a United Nations climate change conferenceIn and around all of that, she not only worked on her undergraduate thesis - using neuroimaging to study the effects that diabetes has on neuroplasticity in stroke patients - but also made an amazing comeback on the track, battling through two years of rust and rehabilitation to achieve some stunning results.In the lead-up to the national championships, having barely run the hurdles for the two previous seasons, Tourigny entered a meet in Seattle and posted a personal-best time of 1:00.86.""Having to mentally deal with the uncertainty of my injury for two years was so draining,"" she admits of the pain in her left knee, which remains undiagnosed despite numerous MRIs, bone scans, X-rays and medical opinions.

'We need to be ambitious now in Canada, too.""There were divergences of opinion, but it's a Canadian spirit that we could do that (reach a deal), bring people together, to find agreement that it's important to have friendship.""Experts and environmentalists tried to inject a practical note into the celebration over the agreement, pointing out Canada still doesn't have a national emissions target.The document doesn't set a target and Canada hasn't released one either, Conservative environment critic Ed Fast was quick to point out.He said all ""major emitters"" should be consulted before the government releases its targets in an effort to avoid ""massive taxes"" on emissions.""We're now seeing tens of thousands of jobs being lost in our energy sector,"" he said. ""That will continue, going forward. It's going to take realistic, prudent policies to allow us to meet our climatechange commitment, yet ensure that our economy continues to grow.""There has been concern that meeting the temperature reduction targets would prove too jarring a jolt to Alberta's petro-based economy, leading to a substantial loss in investment and jobs.But Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, who introduced her own greenhouse gas strategy last month, said she is confident the province can contribute and thrive under the targets. She said she is focusing on executing Alberta's plan and meshing it with the national framework.""I think ultimately within the overarching federal context, our plan will be good news for Alberta and will be able to make an appropriate contribution,"" Notley said in Edmonton on Saturday.The chief executive of Globe Series, an organization that runs corporate sustainability conferences, said the Paris agreement actually opens doors for economic growth in Canada.""We've been highly exposed to job loss because of Alberta, and the fact that our economy in Canada relies quite heavily on oil and gas revenues,"" Nancy Wright said in referring to the recent drop in oil prices.However, Fast noted the fact remains that Canadians can't know what's coming until the federal government comes out with its plan.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau previously said his government will meet with the provinces and territories to develop emissions plans once the climate talks in Paris concluded.Erin Flanagan, federal policy director of the environment think tank Pembina Institute, agreed that Trudeau should have a federal plan to fight climate change.""On their own, provincial commitments will not ensure Canada does its fair share to reduce emissions,"" she said in a news release.And the New Democrats said the government should ""enshrine"" its emissions targets in a climate accountability law, to keep the government accountable.NDP leader Tom Mulcair tweeted his support of the pact shortly after its release.""Excited that the world has reached a climate change pact.

Instead, the G7 agreed to a full-blown no-carbon economy, but not until 2100.""We commit to doing our part to achieve a low-carbon global economy in the long-term, including developing and deploying innovative technologies striving for a transformation of the energy sectors by 2050 and invite all countries to join us in this endeavour,"" the leaders said in their final communique.""To this end we also commit to develop long-term, national low-carbon strategies.""Asked what this means for Canada's energy sector, Harper said: ""Nobody's going to start to shut down their industries or turn off the lights. We simply got to find a way to create lower-carbon emitting sources of energy.""Harper took part the G7 leaders' shortened talks on climate change as the summit entered its second and final day.""All leaders understand that to achieve these kinds of milestones over the decades to come will require serious technological transformation,"" Harper said.The Canadian Press has been told by sources who saw the working draft of the G7's climate-change communique that Canada and Japan worked behind the scenes to water down the statement.Merkel placed the fight against climate change at the heart of her sweeping agenda.She wanted the G7 summit to give France momentum when it hosts the United Nations climate change conference this December, which aims to reach a breakthrough agreement in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Merkel had been pushing the G7 to endorse a pledge to reach zero carbon emissions, but Canada and Japan were holdouts.""Canada and Japan are the most concerned about this one,"" said one source who was privy to discussions but would only speak on the condition of anonymity.""The two of those countries have been the most difficult on every issue on climate. They don't want any types of targets in there, so I think they are trying to make it as vague as possible at this point.""Harper and Merkel spoke together on Sunday, but the prime minister's office said they did not discuss climate change.""It's shocking that Mr. Harper didn't even bother to bring up climate change as an issue for discussion during his bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel,"" said New Democrat foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar.He said Harper is out of touch and sidelining Canada internationally.Liberal environment critic John McKay said the prime minister ""has embarrassed Canada on the world stage.""""Unfortunately, Mr. Harper is fixated on ensuring that he obstructs all progress nationally or internationally.""Harper's office said in a statement that today's French-led climate talks focused on the ""collective response to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the advancement of energy security in the face of escalating threats.""A senior Canadian government official, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said Canada endorses a statement by the G7 that would support the December climate change talks in France.""We support agreement in Paris that includes all GHG emitting countries,"" the official said, noting that in 2013 Canada's emissions were 3.1 per cent below 2005 levels.While Canada's emissions did drop below 2005 levels during the 2008-09 global recession, Environment Canada data shows they have been on a slow, steady increase for four years in a row up to 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.""We believe we have a fair and ambitious reduction target that is in l"

J. Kirton, a political science professor at the University of Toronto (U of T) and director of the G7 Research Group.Kokotsis is the director of accountability for the G7 and G20 Research Groups based at U of T's Munk School of Global Affairs.The book's subject matter brought world leaders together for the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, or COP21/CMP11, which was held Nov. 30-Dec. 11.In light of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, Kokotsis' research group did not attend, so the local author instead spoke on climate change and the summit process at an international conference at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies in Belgium Dec. 9-10.""Every leader who had planned on attending the Paris conference before the attacks ended up coming, so they did nothing to deter heads of state and government from either attending or shaping the discussions,"" said Kokotsis.""In fact, it made them even more eager to personally attend the talks and show their collective resolve in the fight against terrorism.""Just before COP21 began, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada's contribution of $2.65 billion over five years to a climate adaptation and mitigation fund.On the first day, he pledged another $300 million to clean technology innovation as part of a 20-country project backed by France President Francois Hollande, U.S. President Barack Obama and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.Furthermore, Canada put $30 million towards a $250-million fund to help the world's poorest countries adapt to the climate threat.With the Liberals inheriting a $3-billion deficit in 2016 - more than double the Conservatives' forecast - the government's commitments to climate change were built on the party's platform of a need to invest in infrastructure, Kokotsis said.""With climate change causing extreme weather conditions, such as heavy precipitation in many parts of Canada, upgrades to existing infrastructure will be critical to handle the loss and damage,"" said Kokotsis.As Canada's new prime minister, Trudeau is attempting to restore the country's reputation on environmental issues, Kokotsis said, noting the leader stated in Paris, ""Canada is back.""""Under the Stephen Harper government, Canada was heavily criticized by the international community on its climate policy. By taking a number of his premiers and mayors with him, Trudeau was showing the international community Canada was once again engaged on the issue of climate change,"" said Kokotsis. ""Ratifying the Paris Agreement, accepting emissions reductions targets and making solid financial commitments to climate initiatives are now needed to further bolster Canada's position globally.""Though Trudeau's pledges were substantial, Kokotsis said COP21's biggest accomplishment was a unanimous agreement from almost 200 countries on curbing greenhouse gas emissions - ""something that hasn't ever been done before.""It also marks the beginning of a transition to a low-carbon world, she said, as countries recognize phasing out, and eventually eliminating, fossil fuels is critical if countries wish to keep the rise in global temperatures limited to 1.5-2 C.""This means an agreement to assess progress by 2018, with a review every five years to chart compliance. If implemented as agreed, it could mean a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero within a few decades,"" said Kokotsis. ""Important also was the agreement to provide $100 billion by 2020 to developing countries, so they can move off fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy technology.""Much of the research for Kokotsis' and Kirton's 420-page book came from scholarly works on summits and climate change, interviews, policy dialogues, discussions and biographies of G8/G20 participants, commentaries, media accounts and archives.She noted the pair wanted to offer the first-ever analysis of the G8/G20-UN relationship on climate change by exploring their connection.""With climate change and energy policy often being central themes of the summits over the past 40 years, we thought it was time to tell the story of the G7/G20's contributions to global climate change initiatives,"" said Kokotsis.Since the first G7 meeting in France in 1975, Kokotsis said it has often produced more ""definitive contributions"" to climate change than the UN - primarily through its voluntary consensus model. ""As early as 1979, the G7 was calling for the immediate need to halt the concentration of carbon and sulphur emissions in the atmosphere. This was long before the UN took up the challenge of climate change,"" said Kokotsis.""It was at the Toronto G7 summit in 1988 that leaders expanded their climate agenda and called for the creation of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).""While the G7 summit in Germany this year saw a commitment to reduce emissions 40-70 per cent by 2050, the Oakville resident said this is a ""medium-term goal"" that many climate scientists argue is too late.""The sentiment coming out of the Paris meetings is more immediate action needs to happen now, if the catastrophic impacts of a changing climate are to be stalled,"" said Kokotsis.""The Paris negotiations reflect this urgency, as more than 190 countries agreed to cut their emissions beginning in 2020.""Kokotsis works at the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) and is a wife and mother of two.\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada230","Ottawa Recognizes Albertas GHG Efforts And Key Energy Role: Phillips","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","Daily Oil Bulletin","If the federal government were to commit to emissions reductions implied by a more stringent climate change ceiling, it would do so recognizing Albertas recent efforts to tackle its carbon output, as well as the provinces important energy-resource role in the Canadian economy, says Shannon Phillips, Albertas minister of environment and parks.That respect for our unique position, and respect for the fact that our energy resources do power the Canadian economy to a large extent, that recognition is across the board in Canadian political life, she said in a media conference call today from Paris where she is attending the ongoing United Nations 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, which is stiffer than a binding and universal agreement on climate that aims at keeping global warming below 2 C.In opening remarks at Mondays high-level COP 21 session, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that while world leaders negotiating a climate change agreement must reach the conclusion that further global temperature increases will be less than 2 C, such an ambition must also be the floor not the ceiling for common efforts.For many, including low-lying small island developing states and least developed countries, even a 1.5 C rise will have grave consequences, he said. The ongoing COP 21 concludes on Friday.According to Phillips, while the focus for Alberta reductions is around oil and gas, there are a number of ways to reduce emissions that previous governments did not undertake. She said the federal government is currently involved in a large, complicated negotiation process. While Phillips is involved in those negotiations, she remains in constant contact with federal government officials and meetings with her federal counterpart.I will leave the science to the scientists and the negotiations to the negotiators. Our role as a sub-national organization \£6 is to do the doing.Prior to COP 21, Albertas NDP government unveiled its climate change management plan, based largely on an advisory panels final report, which includes a legislated emissions limit on the oilsands, a carbon price across all sectors, as well as pledges to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/11/20/alberta-new-climate-plan-includes-carbon-pricing-a/#axzz3sK8QXBNJDOB, Nov. 22, 2015).The architecture we talked about two weeks ago is quite ambitious. It has established us as leaders on climate change. What we have done is take the best available evidence from a number of different jurisdictions, and we are going to be able to implement it in ways that ensure economic growth. There is much done, but there is much left to be done, and many of the subsequent reductions targets and green economy initiatives will flow out of that architecture.The feds and provinces will hold meetings on emissions reductions within 90 days of COP 21, Phillips told the conference call. She noted that Alberta would set its emission caps as part of Budget 2016. Overall, she said, delegates at are receptive to Albertas new climate plan and surprised that such an initiative might come out of the province and country. What we have done here is signal our willingness to move forward in the way that the global economy is moving forward, ensuring that we are part of those new and emerging trade and investment opportunities that are accruing to jurisdictions who are exercising climate leadership.According to the climate change advisory panels final HYPERLINK http://alberta.ca/documents/climate/climate-leadership-report-to-minister.pdfreport, Climate Leadership, revenues from the incoming carbon price should be used to offset impacts on low- and- middle-income households, providing biannual consumer rebates equal to the expected annual carbon price for an average Albertan, as well as through measures to protect adversely affected small- and medium-sized businesses.Whatever comes out of the COP 21 negotiations, Phillips said, Alberta has put forward a credible, practical piece of policy leadership that will bend of curve on our emissions, keeping in mind that that Alberta is an energy-producing province, which is acknowledged throughout the country. Different provinces have different abilities to reduce [emissions], and I think the federal government understands that.In regards to implementation of Albertas newly-announced plan, Phillips told reporters that it would be unrolled over several months. Certainly, there will be ongoing conversations with Albertans on ensuring that low- and- middle-income working families will be insulated from having any negative effects from the new price on carbon.She added: There will also be a number of very robust investments in diversification, in green energy and in energy efficiency initiatives that Albertans will begin to see in their cities, in their homes, in their businesses, on First Nations, and in their communities.Phillips recently told the Bulletin that the government would also consider the advisory panels recommendations in tandem with our other ideas with what we want to do with [carbon price revenue], but that the revenue would be recycled back into the economy either through adjustments or investments ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/11/26/advisory-panels-final-report-integral-provinces-ne/#axzz3teY9Kvv4DOB, Nov. 26, 2015). \l"

The attacks immediately raised questions about Liberal policy planks on Syrian refugee acceptance and withdrawing Canadian fighter jets from bombing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Syria and Iraq.Those questions continue to tail Trudeau, but his immediate focus is on rebranding Canada as a helpful partner in the global push to combat climate change.Trudeau said in his meetings at the G20 and APEC last week he was encouraged to use Canada's clout within the Commonwealth to encourage some of its members to join the climate fight.""We'll be able to push some of the countries that have been less enthusiastic about an ambitious resolution coming to Paris and actually be an active player and proponent on that stage,"" said the prime minister.The Queen, who turns 90 in April, leaves Thursday for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Malta, which could be the last such Commonwealth CHOGM (as they are known) she attends. The elderly monarch is now restricting her international travel, and with the next two biennial CHOGMs scheduled to be held outside Europe, royal watchers in the United Kingdom are discussing Malta as a swan song of sorts.Canada under prime minister Stephen Harper skipped the last Commonwealth leaders' meeting in 2013 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, over concerns about that country's human rights record. The Conservative government also cut off millions in Canadian funding for the grouping of 54 countries formerly under British rule, waiting out Sri Lanka's two-year chairmanship.Trudeau said he'll be continuing to raise the issues of human rights and good governance among the fractious, 66-year-old Commonwealth organization.From Malta, Trudeau will arrive in Paris for the opening day of the two-week COP21 climate conference, where more than 160 countries hope to hammer out an international framework for addressing climate change in the post-2020 period.Canada gained a reputation as a climate laggard during the decade of Conservative rule. Trudeau's been getting a warm international welcome simply for repeatedly stating that his government is prepared to play a constructive role and do its part.""In previous years at the COP conferences, Canada has spoken with different voices that sometimes were contradictory,"" Trudeau said Monday night.""Some provinces said one thing, the federal government said another. The NGOs said something else altogether. Canada wasn't presenting a cohesive front.""The hard decisions on a detailed Canadian plan to actually start reversing emissions trends must wait for another first ministers' conference, to be scheduled within 90 days. In the meantime, Trudeau will ride Canada's unity tailwind to Paris. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Times &; Transcript (Moncton)\l"

""But it will not happen spontaneously. The playing field is still massively weighted in favour of the sunken investment in technologies which use fossil fuels.""The French hosts of COP21 have added a ""climate solutions"" component to this year's conference which will catalogue and highlight the practical technologies being developed to address cutting carbon pollution.The emphasis dovetails with campaign promises of Canada's new Liberal government, which has promised to support clean technology development through everything from direct investment and green bonds to export assistance and tax changes.The Liberals are also promising to phase out federal fossil fuel subsidies, which a Washingtonbased NGO pegged last week at more than $2 billion annually.Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said Sunday she takes heart knowing the Paris conference will proceed, despite Friday's devastating terrorist attacks.""I was just in Paris maybe three or four days ago and it's really shocking,"" she said. ""They will still be welcoming the world and I think that sends a message that we need to be strong; that we can't back down; and this is a very important conference, and we need a success there.""\l"

She did not elaborate. The recently elected federal minister said she is now touching base with provincial environment ministers, but the hard work of determining emissions targets and ways to attain them won't really begin until after the United Nations in Paris that begins Nov. 30.""We're going to sit down within 90 days of Paris and we're going to figure out what's a credible plan,"" McKenna said. ""We'll have a national target and each province and territory is going to contribute its part.""""Of course we have a large task ahead of us, but it's quite refreshing to have a productive relationship with the federal government who wants to exercise the same kind of leadership in the economy and the environment that we do,"" Phillips said.But Alberta's plan, which may include a carbon tax, is sure to generate a fierce debate within the legislature.On Wednesday, a group of 30 municipalities - representing communities such as Hinton, Hanna and Longview - sent an open letter to Premier Rachel Notley in newspaper ads to voice concerns about the NDP government's policy to accelerate the phase-out of coal-fired power plants.""We recognize and support the need for progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" the letter states. ""However, we feel a balanced and phased transition would have far less impact on the livelihoods of thousands of Albertans and their families.""Phillips reassured rural communities the government will be mindful of the impacts of measures like reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity plants.""Our approach on the coal-fired phase-out has always been that system reliability, affordability and the jobs transition are a part of the whole package,"" she said. ""It's an integral part of the conversation around what we do.""Alberta has more coal-fired electricity than all the other provinces combined, but the NDP campaigned last spring on accelerating the retirement of the province's coal power plants.Provincial figures indicate electricity production was responsible for 17 per cent of Alberta's emissions in 2013, with coal-fired plants making up 85 per cent of emissions from the power sector.""Albertans are worried about what the NDP plan means for them, their jobs and the viability of their communities,"" Wildrose Leader Brian Jean said in a statement.""With the NDP threatening a new carbon tax, an accelerated timel"

If we dont come up with solutions here at home in Alberta, then they will be imposed on us sooner or later by outside forces  whether it be our current markets, our potential markets, or our new federal government.On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in a letter to federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau, stated he expects the ministrys priorities to include formalizing a moratorium against crude traffic on B.C.s North Coast, leaving the future of Enbridge Inc.s Northern Gateway uncertain ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/11/13/trudeau-wants-moratorium-oil-tanker-traffic-bcs-no/DOB, Nov. 13, 2015). McCuaig-Boyd wants to impress upon federal counterparts the key role her provinces hydrocarbon resources play in the nations economy. We need to take a leadership role and stand up for our province,she later told reporters. If you sit back and let it, things will happen to you rather than you making things happen. And so we are taking that stance and trying to show some leadership and make an Alberta solution. Reviews to the rescueRegarding those made-in-Alberta solutions,Andrew Leach, a professor at the University of Alberta, is currently heading up the climate change policy panel, which is happening simultaneously as Dave Mowat, chief executive officer of ATB Financial, chairs the provinces royalty review panel.Premier Rachel Notley recently said that although Albertas royalty review likely would not be completed prior to the climate change conference in Paris, Nov. 30 to Dec. 8, the government would have some ideas as to where we are going with it, as the royalty and climate policy panels continue working together ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/10/27/something-substance-royalties-climate-will-be-read/#axzz3r0KytA8qDOB, Oct. 27, 2015).McCuaig-Boyd said: When it comes to energy and environment, we are being careful, but we are being deliberate, because what our government does on royalties and climate change affects the energy sector, and that affects all Albertans.

Wrong. Indeed, a cursory review of news in recent days suggests Trudeau may actually be behind the curve. Consider the list; it's instructive to pull it all together in one place, and appropriate for Halloween. The Senate has 22 vacancies and is stacked with Stephen Harper appointees, a horror for the newbies if ever there was one. Trudeau is the idealistic reformer who nearly two years ago put his senators curbside, yet now will rely on them to pass his laws. Logic suggests he must quickly find a way to get some new senators appointed, in a process that will be deemed impartial and transparent and merit-based, yet not appear as though it's been thrown together in a hurry, which it necessarily must be.For there are so very many laws that need passing, and un-passing, right away, it seems; not only a first budget, expected sometime in February, but also a string of past Conservative measures that are either philosophically at odds with various Supreme Court rulings or the Charter of Rights or figured in the Liberal campaign platform, such as the anti-terrorist bill C-51. The granddaddy of legislative challenges would have to be the new doctor-assistedsuicide law, mandated by the Supreme Court in early 2015 but then set aside by the Conservatives, more or less, this having been deemed too hot to handle in an election year.The incoming government will surely request and receive more time than the 12 months granted by the SCC for the drafting of this law, which will be tricky in the extreme. But that's a drop in the bucket, given the flood of other matters on the boil. An inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women must be convened and steps taken to implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the long-form census must be restored in time for Statistics Canada to prepare adequately for the 2016 census; and there's the United Nations in Paris at the end of November, to which Trudeau has invited provincial premiers, as well as the opposition leaders, guarantying this will consume large quantities of political oxygen in early December. Of course there's the disposition of Canada's C-18 fighters in Iraq and Syria, which Trudeau has promised to withdraw.In the midst of all this, with Parliament not yet reconvened - there have been reports of a resumption in December, though no date has yet been set, that I am aware of - the new government aims to effect the largest international rescue in this country's modern history. The Liberals have pledged to bring 25,000 refugees from the Syrian civil war to Canada by year-end, and have confirmed they intend to keep that promise. Pro-Trudeau partisans and refugee advocates observe this with approval but also trepidation, wondering if it's practically possible on such a tight timel"

He's greener than most secular greens, with a dose of capitalist critique thrown in on behalf of the poor.Given the monarchical structure of the one billion-member Catholic Church, the Pope, 78, has suddenly turned the global debate away from previous Vatican emphases on abortion, homosexuality and doctrinal conformity to protecting the Earth and its inhabitants.Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, who met with Francis this summer at the Vatican to discuss environmental devastation, teamed up with Archbishop Michael Miller Wednesday evening to press faith groups, businesses and politicians to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels.""We have a common desire and intention to address the harm we have inflicted on the Earth. We have abused the gifts of God,"" said Miller, who oversees more than 400,000 Roman Catholics in Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley.The event was organized to draw attention to Francis's June encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si, which lambastes capitalist greed and industry's disrespect for the environment and the poor, whom it maintained suffer the most because of climate change.""The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,"" said Miller, quoting Laudato Si.""The impacts of climate change are already taking place and are devastating,"" Robertson told the roughly 250 aboriginals, environmentalists, charity group and faith leaders who attended the symposium at Vancouver's John Paul II Pastoral Centre.Robertson, the only Canadian among 60 big-city mayors invited to the July forum with Francis, cited reports from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history and that 2015 is shaping up to be hotter yet.Even though Robertson said the Rome conference heard ""gut-wrenching"" stories about how climate change and inequality were wreaking havoc, the mayor said he felt more hopeful after being with the Pope, whom he referred to by his Spanish name, ""Papa Francisco.""Robertson, who has promised to make Vancouver ""the greenest city on Earth,"" also said he is encouraged by the way clean energy businesses are now contributing more to many Western economies than the fossil fuel industry.Even though the last two popes, John Paul and Benedict, sometimes expressed concern about the environment and economic justice, they were better known for autocratically denouncing sexual immorality, Catholic free thinkers, secular activists and supporters of liberation theology.For his part, Archbishop Miller said there are ""little bombs hidden in"" Pope Francis's new encyclical, including those that would impact ""our Alberta friends.""Miller suggested people who gain a living from Alberta's oil, coal and gas industries would find the document difficult.Emphasizing that Catholicism has long engaged in fruitful dialogue with scientists, Miller said it's become painfully clear humans are not meant to have ""dominion"" over the Earth, which Pope Francis refers to as ""our Sister-Mother.""With the immense technological power we now possess, Miller emphasized humans need to recognize they are ""inter-connected"" with the Earth and each other, in one family.In an interview with The Sun, Robertson said he's never belonged to any organized religion. But he is gratified to discover leading Christians are deeply engaged with scientists about climate change.Robertson has assigned Coun. Tim Stevenson, who is also an ordained clergyman in the United Church of Canada, to work with faith groups to step up the fight against climate change.The Robertson-Miller event was supported by four Canadian groups devoted to the common good: the Metro Vancouver Alliance, the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace, Instruments Beyond Borders and A Rocha.Other global organizations are piggybacking on the pope's high-profile efforts on climate change, including through the book: For Our Common Home: Process-Relational Responses to Laudato Si, which has an introduction by environmentalist Bill McKibben.Both Robertson and Miller stressed politicians need to make a bold commitment to combating fossil fuel pollution at the 2015 , set to begin in Paris in late November.""We're trying to get 1,000 mayors from around the world to go to Paris, which would be unprecedented,"" Robertson said.""What kind of world do we want to hand to those who come after us?"" said the archbishop, noting people in well-off countries do most of the polluting.Despite rising temperatures, Miller maintained: ""All is not lost. Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves. There is a climate for change. Now we just have to do it.""

Then, some 16 years later, in the autumn of 2005, Montreal hosted the United Nations , which some 10,000 delegates attended. These are just two of many significant meetings held at Montreal's relatively new, state-of-the-art Palais des congr\'e8s.However, one of the very first truly significant symposiums held in Montreal took place many, many years ago. This summer will mark the 131(st) anniversary of the get-together in this city of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, a distinguished society known today as the British Science Association( HYPERLINK http://www.britishscienceassociation.orghttp://www.britishscienceassociation.org/ ).The learned academy was founded in 1831 as a reaction to the perceived elitist and conservative nature of Britain's Royal Society. The British Association for the Advancement of Science (commonly called BA at the time) held its first convention that same year in the English city of York, and it continued to hold its annual get-togethers within the British Isles until 1884. It was that year that the academic association came all the way to Montreal for its once-a-year reunion.Given the lengthy and expensive nature of a trek across the ocean to Canada's educational and financial centre, the very idea was initially a difficult sell. Nevertheless, some extremely generous monetary incentives helped get virtually everyone on board with the proposal. These enticements included discounts on travel, entertainment, and accommodation costs incurred during a delegate's stay in Victorian Montreal. While in Canada, many representatives also took advantage of free train transportation to the Canada Rockies, which was as far as the railway went in the summer of 1884.The BA president of the Montreal gathering was Lord John William Strutt Rayleigh, ""one of the most solid exponents of British science."" He was, at the time, a renowned professor of experimental physics at Cambridge University. There were 12 eminent vice-presidents as well, including both the governor-general and the prime minister of Canada serving in that honorary capacity.Several of the more celebrated individuals attending the convention in this city were even afforded lodging by prominent Montrealers. One of the latter was Richard Bladworth Angus (after whom the Angus Yards are named) who opened up his palatial residence on Drummond St. to members of the Rayleigh family.Most of the happenings associated with the illustrious meeting took place in Queen's Hall, an 1159-seat chamber that was used for both concerts and theatrical productions. It was located at the corner of Ste-Catherine and University Sts., where today is found Les Ailes de la Mode store (the old Eaton Building). The elegant edifice, which partially collapsed in 1899 and was later demolished, was often said to be Montreal's first true theatre and concert chamber.It was, in the 1880s, home to the Montreal Philharmonic Society and the Mendelssohn Choir of Montreal. It had the additional good fortune of being situated within a short distance of McGill University, where most of the British academics understandably were expected to venture between seminars.Many of the 1,691 delegates who attended (only 1,000 were originally anticipated) the acclaimed symposium arrived on steamers from Quebec City on the morning of Aug. 27, the very day the conference was set to begin. According to the Montreal Gazette, conditions were ideal with ""bright skies overhead, and weather not too warm, and tempered by a cooling breeze,"" and with the city showing ""an extra amount of life and bustle."" Indeed, that very afternoon an impressive welcoming reception was held in William Molson Hall at McGill University.The gathering opened officially that very evening with an address by Lord John Rayleigh, who was obviously front and centre at the conference. Only moments before, Mayor Jean-Louis Beaudry, speaking in French and wearing his chain of office, welcomed the influential and diverse group of scientists to Montreal. Later, God Save the Queen was sung with Mr. W. R. Spence of the Church of St-John the Evangelist playing the Queen's Hall organ.There were eight sections within the BA conference, each taking its turn meeting in the large assembly room: mathematical and physical science, chemical science, geology, biology, geography, economic science and statistics, mechanical science and anthropology.While for the most part the numerous presentations were of a serious nature, there was still time for some relaxing. In that regard, two colourful soirees were also held, one at McGill University and the other at the old Victoria Skating Rink on Drummond.Altogether, the historic happening was a great success and put Montreal on the map for future international conventions. It even paved the way for Toronto to host that same association on two occasions (1897 and 1924) and Winnipeg once (1909).Robert N. Wilkins is a local historian and freelance writer.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada243","Editorial Exchange: Trudeau to woo provinces at Paris climate conference; Editorial Exchange: Trudeau to woo provinces at Paris climate conference","October 28, 2015 Wednesday 01:42 PM EST","Canadian Press","An editorial from the Halifax Chronicle-Herald, published Oct. 27:The clich\'e9 is romance in Paris in spring but Canadians can be forgiven if they look to the French capital for something a whole lot more pragmatic this fall.For the UN conference on climate change beginning Nov. 30 near Paris has potential to at least reinvigorate Canadian climate change policy, which has languished under the Harper Conservatives.Prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau announced last week in a praiseworthy gesture of inclusiveness that he would invite the premiers and opposition party leaders, including the NDP's Thomas Mulcair, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May and a Conservative representative, to accompany him to the event.It is likely too close to the conference for Mr. Trudeau to alter the Harper government's goal, announced in May, to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 to 2030. Under the Conservatives, Canada was already far behind its promise to cut emissions by 17 per cent by 2020.But a national goal on emission reduction is not yet the big issue for Mr. Trudeau, who will soon govern a nation in which four provinces have already signed on to initiatives to reduce climate change. British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have set up economic measures on their own to reduce emissions.His challenge will be to get them, plus the other six provinces and three territories, to agree to a national strategy on the issue. Reaching a deal will be particularly challenging for some provinces, including Nova Scotia.Some 60 per cent of power generated here still comes from coal. The Maritime Link, forecast to transfer Labrador hydroelectric power into the grid by 2017, should put the province well on its way to its stated goal of 40 per cent renewable energy by 2020.Premier Rachel Notley of Alberta has said that the prosperity of the oil and gas sector, and its ability to export, depends on the province cleaning up its environmental image. However, the oil sands are the fastest-growing producer of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada.And Saskatchewan's Brad Wall is cautious, saying he'll attend the meeting to make sure any Canadian commitment ""doesn't kneecap our economy in the West.""Yet many Canadians signalled during last week's election that they want action to reduce emissions. Some 67 per cent of voters chose the Liberals, NDP, BQ or Greens, all of whom had climate change policies in their platforms.Sectors within the business community also support change. The Canadian Press reported last week that 98 per cent of delegates to the recent AGM of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce want some kind of carbon tax or cap-and-trade incentive to reduce emissions by 2050.For the growing cohort of Canadians who want leadership on the environment, there is reason to hope that this conference will produce a long overdue consensus.\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada244","Saskpower President Defends CCS Project; 'The plant is up and running well, post overhaul,' says Marsh","December 14, 2015 Monday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","SaskPower president and CEO Mike Marsh recently presented an update of the corporation's Boundary Dam carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to a couple of hundred delegates attending the COP21 Climate Change conference in Paris.Fortunately, Marsh had good news about the project, which recently completed an extended overhaul to fix some of the nagging problems and replace some of the faulty equipment at the $1.5 billion CCS plant.""Our role at COP21 was to make a presentation on our carbon capture facility at one of the COP21 side events,' Marsh said. ""Over 200 people came and listened to our story in addition to other panellists that were also speaking about other aspects of carbon capture and sequestration ... work that's being done in other parts of the world.' ""People were very excited to hear that the plant is up and running well, post overhaul. As I explained it, as I've explained here in Saskatchewan, the ramp-up time on this (project) is longer than people realized and something that we should have explained right upfront.'Marsh conceded that SaskPower should have been more clear about the startup problems that are common with large projects, especially ones using amine solvent technology never used on an industrialscale before.""Although we captured 400,000 tonnes (of carbon dioxide) in our first year, by a lot of standards that would be considered a success and we're just going to continue to push that bar up,' Marsh said in a recent interview with the Regina Leader-Post.In fact, SaskPower has been operating the plant at close to capacity for the past month and has been able to meet it contractual obligations to Cenovus Energy, which has contracted to receive 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes of CO2 per day for its enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project in Weyburn.""We've been very happy with the performance (of the CCS plant) post shutdown. The plant has been operating continuously at around 2,700-2,800 tonnes per day ... That serves (to provide) our requirement to Cenovus and Aquistore (SaskPower's deep geological CO2 storage project).' ""And we're able to move (the CCS plant) up to peak capacity, if and when we need it.' However, once Marsh got back to Regina, he was faced with more criticism about the project. The day after SaskPower released its operational update indicating the plant had operated at 90 per cent of full capacity (3,240 tonnes of CO2 per day) for three days in November and captured 60,000 tonnes last month - its best performance to date - an anti-fossil fuel group referred to the project as a ""carbon-capture debacle in Saskatchewan' and a ""failed coal industry experiment.""On Tuesday, Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis published a commentary by Bob Burton, editor of CoalWire, an anti-coal newsletter, saying the project ""managed to capture less than half of the 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide its promoters said it would contain from the power station's emissions, and glitches have shut it down time and again.""""Carbon capture in short, remains a pipe dream. It is not feasible in the new energy economy, and it won't save the coal industry.'Marsh conceded that the coal industry and power utilities, like SaskPower, that use coal-fired generating stations are facing big challenges. ""Some jurisdictions are moving to phase out coal. There's potential for new regulations around carbon emissions from both coal and gas, which could have a further impact on the industry.' But Saskatchewan, with its 200 to 500 year supply of lignite coal and its proximity to mature oilfields that can use CO2 to increase recovery rates and extend their life by decades, is in a different situation than most jurisdictions. ""Having an abundant supply of low-cost coal that we can use here, if we can clean it up and keep the (financial) impact to our customers low, that's a great solution,' Marsh said.Plus the world needs to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet its climate change targets, and it can't do that without capturing more carbon from its coal-fired generating stations. ""By 2050, 40 per cent of the world is still going to be on coal, and a large part of that in Asia. The U.S still has 40 per cent of their (electricity) generation from coal,' Marsh said.""So it's important that projects like this continue to improve upon the last one. That's how you drive efficiency in these operations. That's how boiler-turbine generator technology got developed over the years. Every time a plant got built, there were improvements, (and) more improvements until they got up to where they are today.' HYPERLINK mailto:bjohnstone@postmedia.combjohnstone@postmedia.com\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada245","Trudeau signals climate policy green light with new minister","November 5, 2015 Thursday","The Times & Transcript (New Brunswick)","OTTAWA  As signals go, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has put a big green light on his Liberal government's promised climate change agenda.Catherine McKenna, an international lawyer with an eye-popping resume, was named the new minister of ""environment and climate change"" Wednesday at Rideau Hall as Trudeau installed his new Liberal cabinet.But the signs of climate policy green shoots go well beyond a high-profile new MP and the semantics of a ministerial name change.Former Liberal environment minister and party leadership climate advocate Stephane Dion is Canada's new foreign affairs minister - a powerful post that will give him oversight on ensuring climate policy is integral to Canada's foreign policy.Dion was also named chairman of a new cabinet committee on ""environment, climate change and energy.""That committee will also include new Science Minister Kirsty Duncan, a former University of Windsor climatology professor who served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.With less than a month to go before the COP21 United Nations climate conference in Paris, their work begins immediately.""Canada is going to be a strong and positive actor on the world stage, including in Paris at COP21,"" Trudeau said outside Rideau Hall following Wednesday's swearing-in.""That's why we have a very strong minister - not just of the environment, but minister of the environment and climate change - who will be at the heart of this discussion.""McKenna, whose background includes practicing international trade law in Indonesia, founding Canadian Lawyers Abroad and acting as a negotiator for the UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor, brings more to the table than simply knocking off NDP stalwart Paul Dewar, the party's high-profile foreign affairs critic, in a downtown Ottawa riding.The 44-year-old rookie MP also has backup.""We have an amazing team of strong cabinet members who will lean in with the kind of engagement, both with the provinces and municipalities and countries around the world, to demonstrate that Canada is doing its part to address climate change impacts,"" said Trudeau.The cabinet climate and energy committee includes new Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, the founding CEO of the Business Council of Manitoba, along with Hunter Tootoo, the former Nunavut legislator who has been handed Fisheries and Oceans and responsibility for the Coast Guard. Also included are the ministers responsible for agriculture, infrastructure, First Nations and economic development.Combining the environment, climate change and energy policy under a single cabinet committee recognizes the inextricable links between Canada's resource policies and its environmental record. Including both Carr and Amerjeet Sohi, the rookie Edmonton MP who becomes Trudeau's infrastructure minister, suggests climate policy will include a diversity of perspectives.Dion, the committee chairman, led the Liberal party to defeat in the 2008 election on a revolutionary platform that proposed redrawing federal taxation by imposing significant carbon taxes, offset by income tax cuts. He famously named the family dog Kyoto, after the city where the original 1997 international climate protocol was forged.Environmental groups were quick to offer qualified praise of the new cabinet.Louise Comeau of the Climate Action Network singled out McKenna and Dion for leadership. ""We welcome today's appointments of two ministers with such a commitment to social justice and human rights, as well as United Nations and climate change experience,"" Comeau said in a release. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Times &; Transcript (Moncton)\l"
"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada246","Liberals accused of more motion than action","February 25, 2016 Thursday","Windsor Star (Ontario)","Kirsten Mercer was Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne's justice policy adviser at Queen's Park.When Justin Trudeau was elected prime minister, surrounded by a Praetorian Guard of former Ontario Liberals, it was natural that Mercer would look to Ottawa for her next career move.She joined the office of new justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould as chief of staff, just as her husband, Matthew Mendelsohn, became first deputy secretary at the Privy Council Office, a political appointment responsible for ""results and delivery."" He is widely tipped to be the next Clerk of the Privy Council, Canada's top public servant.Yet within months of relocating to Ottawa, Mercer has left Wilson-Raybould's office, to be replaced by Cyrus Reporter, a trusted Trudeau adviser, who was his chief of staff in opposition.To lose one chief may have been a misfortune; but to lose two looks like carelessness. Also gone is Maxime Dea, a lawyer who was appointed to head up the office of Maryam Monsef, the minister for Democratic Reform. This might usually amount to little more than a footnote in the Hill Climbers column in Parliament's house organ, The Hill Times.But Mercer's appointment, and subsequent departure, plays into a commentary on the greenhorn Liberal government that is gaining increasing currency.The first narrative is that ministerial offices are crammed with ""kids"" who used to work at Queen's Park, old friends hired by former McGuinty-era Liberals, Gerald Butts, now Trudeau's principal secretary in Ottawa, and Katie Telford, his chief of staff.The second is that behind the curtain, things are not quite as fabulous as the Liberals would have you believe. Policy is moving at the pace of coastal erosion and the blame for that is being placed on the slow appointment of staff. The loss of two chiefs in the first months in power has not helped matters.In sum, the knock on the Trudeau government is that it is a clone of the McGuinty/Wynne Ontario Liberals - inexperienced lightweights with a zeal for spending, only exceeded by their lust for spinning.There is some merit to these rumblings, even if they are coming from former ""senior Liberals"" whose voices no longer carry the weight they did.The Trudeau Liberals have been much more adept at selling their message than implementing it.Ministerial offices remain understaffed - the Government Electronic Directory System lists just three staff members in Navdeep Bains' massive Ministry of Science, Innovation and Economic Development (he has since added chief of staff, Elder Marques, a prominent Bay Street litigation lawyer).It's a mystery where the Liberals found the 283 people who needed to be in Paris for the United Nationsclimate change conference in November, beyond the immutable rule that the number of people required for these trips is in direct proportion to the number of Michelin three-star restaurants in the location. The lack of capacity has an immediate knock-on effect on policy. Stakeholders say they can't reach people in government, creating frustrations even among fellow travellers.On any given issue, in any given department, the daily mantra heard by the media is that ""no decision has been made."" A more accurate statement often would be that ""we're so overwhelmed, we haven't even had time to discuss it.""The Prime Minister's Office has taken its time to appoint chiefs of staff, nominally it seems so that it can hire people who will do what it says. In turn, those people have taken their time to hire the other staff needed to advise the minister.The toll is being felt not just at the staff level - Catherine McKenna, the climate change minister, was chair of a cabinet committee vetting major defence procurement but has been quietly replaced by Jim Carr, the natural resources minister, because she is so overloaded.Meanwhile, the Liberals tout a policy of openness and transparency, which is great. But it's less commendable, if, as Henry David Thoreau said of the advent of the Maineto-Texas magnetic telegraph, ""Maine and Texas have nothing important to communicate.""Where the narrative about the Trudeauvians as well-intentioned ingenues is overdone is the claim that senior staff are a cabal of like-minded Gen-Xers from Queen's Park.In fact, with Mercer's departure, there are more veterans of Quebec Liberal governments than former Ontario Grits among the 30 chiefs.The group is almost as diverse as the cabinet - 13 women - and from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. The only commonality, apart from their political values, appears to be the predominance of lawyers.Butts remains unapologetic about the human resources rule followed to staff ministers' offices - ""slow to hire, quick to fire.""Kate Purchase, Trudeau's communications director, said the Liberals did take their time hiring but it was a deliberate move to make sure there was a good fit between minister and chief of staff. ""There are always one or two that don't work out but we wanted to make sure we got it right, so that the government is more stable moving forward,"" she said.The expectation is that the government will be fully staffed within the next month or so, she added.Fair enough. But that may not mollify those caught up in the economic downturn. They might have expected the new Liberal government would move expeditiously, rather than repeatedly updating us on how bad things are getting.Talk, as the Chinese say, doesn't cook rice.National Post HYPERLINK mailto:jivison@nationalpost.comjivison@nationalpost.com\l"

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other top officials shuttled among high-stakes meetings all day Friday in hopes of coming to a final agreement on Saturday.China's deputy chief negotiator stood firm Friday on his nation's demand that rich countries should assume most responsibility for the costs and argued against an agreement that sets too-tough goals for weaning the world off using oil, gas and coal - the biggest source of carbon emissions.The talks, originally scheduled to end Friday, dragged into an extra day as the French hosts said they needed more time to overcome disputes. Negotiators from more than 190 countries are aiming to create something that's never been done before: an agreement for all countries to reduce man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and helping the poorest adapt to rising seas, fiercer weather and other impacts of global warming.The U.S. and European countries want to move away from so-called ""differentiation"" among economies and want big emerging countries like China and India to pitch in more in a final climate deal. But Liu Zhenmin, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, told reporters Friday that issue is ""at the core of our concern for the Paris agreement."" He said he wants different rules for different countries ""clearly stipulated"" in the global warming pact, and insisted the demand is ""quite legitimate.""China is among the more than 180 countries that have submitted emissions targets for the new pact but is resisting Western proposals for robust transparency rules that would require each country to show whether it's on track to meet its target.Liu also argued against sharply limiting the number of degrees the planet warms this century, because that would involve huge lifestyle and economic changes.""We need heating. We need air conditioning. You need to drive your car,"" he said.Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar also said differentiation was the biggest dispute and accused developed countries of not showing enough flexibility in the talks.However, signs of divisions among major developing countries surfaced Friday as Brazil joined an informal coalition of Western countries and some developing ones in a ""high-ambition coalition"" that is calling for a strong deal.Liu dismissed the coalition as a ""performance.""U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern said U.S. negotiators have been having lots of talks with India, saying ""hopefully we're making some progress.""The two weeks of talks are the culmination of years of UN-led efforts to create a long-term climate deal.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada251","READERS WRITE","November 20, 2015 Friday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","LRT just the beginningRE: LRT Better for all Hamilton (Nov. 12)LRT will benefit all of Hamilton dramatically when transit is improved city-wide, as is expected. This is just the beginning. It is being recognized that if you want to be a desirable city, you must have a first-class transit system.Downtown has very little to offer? Really? There is so much going on downtown. I don't know why you're not seeing it.It's time to recognize the importance of transit in this city. If there are infrastructure dollars coming from the feds and the province, they need to be put into our existing crumbling roads and sewers and transit, not by spending mega millions expanding the Red Hill and Linc, which provide clear sailing 85 per cent of the day.Bob Berberick, HamiltonTaxpayers foot bill for feds' climate policyRE: Climate change policyThe only green worth mentioning is that of the greenbacks Canadian taxpayers will be paying for the feds' new policy on climate change. Let's begin with the United Nations in Paris, France, that Trudeau and friends plan to attend between Nov. 30 and Dec. 11. As a seven-year resident of the French capital, I can attest to the fact that life there is very expensive.Nonetheless, early December provides a fantastic opportunity for the conference delegates and their administrative assistants to shop early for Christmas. It sounds like one big environmental holiday bash, and guess who's paying for it?What about the size of the carbon footprint left by the conference itself? Would it not have been a better idea to have participating countries simply conference call on Skype?Nanos Research reports that 78 per cent of Canadians want Ottawa to lead the way and reduce greenhouse gases. At the same time, how many people are willing to ride public transit, use a bike, car share, and reduce household refuse?So many Canadians talk the talk when it comes to climate change, but very few are willing to walk the walk, and pick up the tab while they're at it.David Patrick O'Connor, HamiltonRE: Remembrance DayI am a proud retired teacher who is pretty fed up with people going mental over red coffee cups, and teachers' recent job actions and their solidarity that have protected Ontario kids' learning conditions. But now, the straw that broke my camel's back ... an emotional outcry over ""disrespectful timing"" of school Remembrance Day ceremonies in Hamilton schools.I attended a Remembrance Day service at Charles R. Beaudoin Public School in Burlington that was the best service I have seen in over 40 years of teaching. Many classes practised and presented meaningful artistic and literary pieces that came from the kids' hearts and imaginations. Many families attended. A soldier spoke. Eight hundred kids filed SILENTLY from their classes, sat in a crowded gym, had two minutes of silence, and returned, wordless, to their classrooms! No one asked to go to the bathroom.The gym schedule was cancelled, and teachers missed preps to cover classes to cover for teachers who were organizing the ceremony. I was in tears for most of the service, and was honoured to be part of it. Oh, did I mention that the two minutes of silence was at 10:45? Was that a sign of disrespect? I think not. The deceased veterans I have loved throughout my life would have been moved and in awe if they had seen the sacrifice and respect that was paid to them by almost 900 people at 10:45 Nov. 11.Believe me! Integrity, respect, honour and professionalism is alive and well in our schools. Anyone can find some detail to whine about if you are looking for and proclaiming the flaws instead of looking for and celebrating the good.But it is in the control of each of us to decide what ill-informed spark of information we will fuel, whether aimed at Starbucks or our schools.Wendy Martynuik, Burlington Where are all the female veterans?RE: Remembrance DayWonderful coverage on the Remembrance Day celebrations around the city. We attended the Service at the Limeridge Legion. Very moving, and awesome to see the (aging) veterans, taking a moment to thank them for their service, then to see pictures in the paper.However, I'm curious, are there no lady veterans? Most pictures only show the gentlemen. At the Limeridge Legion their representative was a lovely ""tiny"" white-haired lady who was ""working"" the room and greeting some of the veterans with a salute, a handshake, and a beautiful smile. But, aren't there others?Donna Herman, Mount HopeThe readers deserve betterRE: Postmedia Harper endorsementThis was an extraordinary column given that for many years The Hamilton Spectator was a solid programmatic Hamilton newspaper befitting the city it featured.Then came the purchase by Torstar, this event changing the paper to a carbon copy of the parent company's social engineering, editorial and ownership mandate that has lessened the value of our paper to the community it represents.Jim Vennell, BurlingtonStraight female has bathroom rights, tooRE: Hamilton not friendly to many trans people (Nov. 14)I agree with you, Kurt Lewis, that you have the right to be comfortable while using washroom facilities. I am a straight female and I also have the right to feel comfortable while using washroom facilities and I'm sorry but having someone in there with parts that are of the opposite sex does not make me comfortable.Susan Catherwood, Brantford\l"

The hope of all humanity rests on your shoulders,"" Hollande said. ""Here in Paris, we will decide on the very future of the planet.""U.S. President Barack Obama told fellow leaders that the younger generations are watching what they do in Paris and paying close attention to climate change.The world faces a possible future of submerged countries, abandoned cities, fields that no longer grow, political disruptions that trigger new conflict, severe floods and desperate people if the climate keeps changing faster than efforts to address it.Political leaders ""have the power to change, right here, right now"" the fate of the planet, ""but only if we rise to this moment,"" he said.""Here in Paris, let's secure an agreement that builds in ambition,"" Obama said, as he kept speaking over a ringing tone that reminded him his allotted time was up.""Here in Paris, we can show the world what is possible when we come together.""The president said he came to Paris, as the leader of the world's largest economy and second-largest emitter, to acknowledge his country's role in creating the problem, but also embrace the U.S.'s responsibility to do something about it.One of the ""enemies"" leaders will be fighting at the conference is cynicism, ""the notion we can't do anything about climate change,"" he said.However, he also quoted the words of Martin Luther King Jr. that ""there is such a thing as being too late.""""When it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us,"" Obama said.United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reminded leaders they are in Paris to write a script for a new future, and that they ""have never faced such a test.""""You have the power to ensure the wellbeing of this and succeeding generations,"" he said, stressing that bold climate action is in the interests of all countries.The world needs to move much faster and go much further if the global average temperature increase is to be kept below the dangerous two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, he said.An agreement concluded in Paris must ""send a clear message to the markets"" that a low-carbon economy is beneficial, be able to adapt to a changing global economy, help poor and most vulnerable countries, and be a credible one with a high level of ambition, he said.""Paris must mark a decisive turning point"" to move toward a more low-emission and climate-resilient future, he said.""The future of the people of the world, the future of our planet is in your hands. We cannot afford indecision, half-measures or merely gradual approaches. Our goal must be a transformation,"" he said.Chinese President Xi Jinping also called on fellow leaders to act with a ""win-win"" agreement, saying a Paris deal needs to put ""effective control"" on atmosphere pollution but it must also put an ""emphasis on practical results.""He also called on developed countries to do their part to reduce greenhouse gases that they're responsible for emitting, as well as meet their commitments to contribute $100 billion annually by 2020 to developing countries to help them deal with the impacts of climate change.Individual countries should be allowed to seek their own solutions that ""best suit their respective national conditions,"" he said.Addressing climate change shouldn't prevent developing countries from being able to grow their economies, he noted.""(The Paris conference) is not a finish l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada254","Westbrook Circle: the canary in a floodplain?","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","The Times & Transcript (New Brunswick)","We think the long-running story of how chronic flooding has made life miserable for the residents of Westbrook Circle has run quite long enough.There have been far too many chapters in this epic saga and we wish we could say the most recent is that of the Hachey family, but sadly their latest misadventure is part of an ongoing series within the saga - they have been there before.Last Monday, Wayne Hachey and his daughter Jennifer were preparing their Westbrook Circle home for the joyful homecoming of his granddaughter from the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax, where the little girl has been receiving chemotherapy treatment for a brain tumour.Instead, they found themselves in the midst of a record-shattering 90-millimitre rainstorm, one among many features in another long series - that of a string of record-breaking months for warm temperatures all around the globe. Jonathan Creek rose a disquieting half a foot in half an hour in the midst of a powerful high tide on the Petitcodiac River, to which the Jonathan pays its watery tribute.Instead of throwing a party, the Hacheys found themselves frantically clearing the basement of furniture in expectation of yet another flood.Fortunately this time, the story ends with a small measure of satisfaction. Kudos to the Moncton Fire Department which, in the midst of pumping out another flooded house in the neighbourhood, caught wind of the Hachey family's predicament and saved the day, arranging for temporary accommodations for them at a local motel for the homecoming.In the end the Hachey home did not reportedly sustain any significant damage in this particular case, but we invite readers to reflect upon what 'everyday life' has come to for just this one family. Flood or no, they were forced to act assuming the worst with no point in hoping for the best. The Hachey home always gets hit first - a canary in a floodplain as it were - when a Jonathan Creek goes over the bank.Perhaps the Hacheys can take heart in the fact the City of Moncton has a plan in the works to finally deal with the flood-period choke-points on Jonathan that contribute routinely to the inundation of what at times seems the entire neighbourhood.But the people of Westbrook Circle are far from alone. We believe a newly free-flowing Petitcodiac has helped greatly, but there are at least a dozen hot-spots around Metro and surrounding area that can be flooded any time the rain is hard and the tide is high. A comprehensive plan for both city and region is needed, involving all three levels of government and the private sector as well. It isn't all about culverts and ditches either. While the firefighters have been great as emergency 'cellar-pumpers,' that is likely to get very expensive over time. A system using municipal 'outside workers' and a dedicated pumper-vehicle makes more sense.When federal and provincial leaders return from the ongoing UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris this month, it might be time to talk about funding shares and a change in 'green' priorities, from sewage treatment to flood control. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Times &; Transcript (Moncton) \l"

Former party leader like Ed Broadbent could also make the list.Mulcair said he wants a report on the party's defeat by the end of January.The NDP, which held 95 House of Commons seats before the campaign began,emerged with just 44 seats - a crushing result, considering the party was topping most polls at the beginning of August.In 2011, Jack Layton won 103, seats thanks in part to the so-called Orange Wave that swept Quebec.Defeated parties usually have a traditionof inviting defeated MPs to the inaugural caucus meeting following the election, but Mulcair said that won't be happening in the case of the NDP.He did, however, speak personally to defeated candidates the day after the election and also reiterated that he intends to stay on party leader and lead the NDP into the next federal election in four years.""Absolutely, I am here with a strong delegation, the second strongest in the party's history,"" Mulcair said. ""Three-and-a-half million Canadians, despite the (Liberal) wave, put their trust in the NDP's vision.""He intends to hold the Liberals to their numerous promises.""The tone for us, from the start, is going to be: 'This is what you said you would do. Will you do it?""' Until then, Mulcair intends to champion the issue of Syrian refugees, of which prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau has promised to bring some 25,000 to Canada by the end of the year - a colossal logistical challenge. The Liberals will be measured by what they can actually deliver, he added.A former provincial environment minister, Mulcair will also be active on the climate change file.Mulcair said he read that prime ministerdesignate Justin Trudeau has invited opposition parties and provincial premiers to attend the UN Conference on Climate Change, taking place Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 in Paris.The NDP leader said he hasn't received an invite - formal or informal - but would be delighted to participate and lend his experience.Mulcair wants to see Canada adopt a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\l"

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada258","Has global warming become Montreal's guilty pleasure?","December 14, 2015 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","It took them an extra day of negotiations (never a good sign), and it possesses more sub-clauses, parenthetical observations and conditions than your average credit card agreement. But after two weeks of fanfare and photo ops the 195 nations that attended COP21, a world class climate change conference in Paris, managed this weekend to cobble together an agreement U.S. president Barack Obama describes as our best chance to save the planet( HYPERLINK http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/cop21-ministers-keep-the-world-waiting-for-ratification-of-historic-climate-change-target-a6770821.htmlhttp://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ HYPERLINK cop21 -ministers-keep-the-world-waiting-for-ratification-of-historic-climate-change-target-a6770821.html ).The Paris Agreement is essentiallya 31-page do it yourself manual( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/ HYPERLINK cop21 /eng/l09.pdf ) for participating nations on how to limit global warming. It calls for those participants to make an effort within their jurisdictions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and diligently (and honestly) report their progress to the world at large in the hope the effects of climate change can be slowed if not eliminated. It's a document that doesn't fit easily into a video clip or soundbite and is aimed at governments rather than citizens. All of which means we'll be seeing nearly 200 political sales campaigns across the planet aimed at convincing those citizens that it's time to re-think our attitude toward the status quo, if only because environmentally speaking, that status quo seems to lead straight off the edge of a cliff.Problem is, it's a big planet, and Paris wasn't the only city to produce a document on climate change over the weekend. In fact you may have noticed a few of them on your Facebook feed - photos of Montreal on Dec. 11 of last year compared with pictures taken this weekend (if you're having trouble remembering that date, check out this news report( HYPERLINK http://globalnews.ca/news/1720782/montreal-returns-to-normal-after-first-wintry-weather-hits-city/http://globalnews.ca/news/1720782/montreal-returns-to-normal-after-first-wintry-weather-hits-city/ ) on how this city was coping after being hit with a 20 centimetre dump of snow backed up by 70 kilometre an hour winds on Dec. 10, 2014). As you can imagine, those pictures provoked far more comments than are usually found on a post from an ordinary user, hundreds more in fact. And the debate seemed to have been split into three camps. First and, as far as I could tell, most common, was the ""if this is climate change bring it on"" school of thought, a predictable reaction given how much time we spent last winter hearing the words ""polar"" and ""vortex"" used in the same sentence. That was followed by the move-along-nothing-to-see-here crowd, people who presumably leafed through their back copies of the Farmer's Almanac to point out that mild and snowless Decembers were not so much aberrations of nature as relatively commonplace events people simply can't be bothered to remember. And finally (and frankly, in a distant third place) were those who observed that as pleasant as all this may seem, what we're seeing here is pretty much the equivalent of getting snow flurries in June, and just how normal is that?And it seems these comments speak far more eloquently to how tough a sales pitch politicians in this country have ahead of them than any amount of closed door discussions in Paris. We may feel a vague pang of guilt or even concern when we feel a breeze just this side of warm waft down a Montreal street at the same time they're playing ""White Christmas"" at the shopping mall. We may commiserate with ski hill operators watching their livelihoods evaporate under a pale December sun and even hope for a small dusting of snow in time for Christmas Eve. But after generations of shoveling, pushing out stuck cars, turning our faces away from the wind chill as we wait for a bus that never seems to come and squinting through ice caked window panes at blizzards so severe the snow seemed to be falling sideways, our concern, however sincere, will be brief.Between the two entrenched extremes in the debate over climate change, I suspect there is a vast middle ground of people - including many Montrealers - who are quite willing to admit that while Something Is Going On, they're just not just sure of what it is or whether anything they're called upon to do can stop it (or indeed, if it can be stopped at all). They're ready to listen and perhaps even to be convinced. But in the meantime, and even though they're being warned the hurricanes and tornadoes will become more frequent and severe, they find it difficult to get ready to batten down the hatches when the days say October and the calendar says Christmas.Face it, weather in Montreal has usually been a matter of extremes - bitterly cold winters suddenly disappearing into a 48-hour long spring and replaced by steaming, hazy summers that sometimes hang around until Thanksgiving. Given that crap shoot meteorology and memories of an ice storm none of the experts saw coming, Montrealers can be forgiven for reveling in any break from that environmental ""norm"" no matter how earnestly we're warned that We Just Can't Go On Like This.In the end, those triumphant Facebook posts don't mean we're indifferent to the effects of global warming, they just mean we're far too intimate with those of a local deep freeze.Montreal Gazette news columnist James Mennie can be heard weekdays at 4:35 p.m. on the Aaron Rand Show on CJAD 800. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

The Oklahoma senator sent a letter dated March 10 to McCarthy after the EPA administrator said her agency will ""keep moving the Clean Power Plan forward"" and the stay ""didn't mean that anything on the ground had really changed."" The Supreme Court on Feb. 9 voted 5-4 to stay the Clean Power Plan while challenges to the rule are being litigated.""The agency's public response to the [Supreme Court] decision has ranged between muddled reticence and outright defiance, leaving impacted stakeholders and resource-strapped states confused and in limbo,"" Inhofe said.COP21 commitment to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 would be ""impossible to achieve."" He pointed to an analysis indicating that 45% of the promised emissions reductions under the Paris deal are ""unaccounted for"" and that the gap that would grow to 60% if the Clean Power Plan is ultimately struck down by the courts. Inhofe, who is a vocal critic of the Clean Power Plan and the U.S. pledge to the COP21 agreement, said the shortfall is undermining other countries' faith in the U.S. meeting its Paris obligations, which could cause major emitters such as India and China to weaken their commitments.""I believe that you and the Administration are painfully aware of the challenges to fulfilling this pledge following the Supreme Court CPP stay,"" Inhofe said.

"COP21","Canada","COP21_Canada260","David Tindall: The Paris agreement and Canada's involvement","December 16, 2015 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","Is the Paris agreement on measures to curb climate change a success or failure? It is the first major international agreement on climate change in 18 years (since the Kyoto Accord in 1997). Evaluating the success of COP 21 involves a is a classic case of whether you think the glass is half full or half empty.Some of the key elements of the agreement include:. Money has been committed to help developing countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change.. There is language in the text to acknowledge the need to minimize and address loss and damage from climate change to the poorer nations.. There is an agreement for all countries to submit updated plans, that would ""rachet up"" efforts to reduce GHG emissions by 2020 and every five years afterward.. The agreement requires all countries to monitor, verify and report their greenhouse gas emissions.. There is an agreement on mechanisms to enable developing countries to be more transparent in their monitoring and reporting of emissions, and progress to meet goals.Many see these parts of the agreement as a positive indication of progress.On the glass half-empty side of the ledger, the temperature targets that have collectively been agreed to, and the individual country commitments are not legally binding. So there are no consequences to anyone if they fail to live up to targets. Also, for most countries, there are no concrete plans as to how they will achieve their emissions targets. Further, there is no legally binding commitment to compensate developing countries for the losses and damages they will incur from climate change.Let's turn to varying assessments of the agreement, from leaders from different sectors.U.S. President Barrack Obama said: ""I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world,"" and added that this is ""the best chance we have to save the one planet that we've got.""Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the agreement is ""historic, ambitious and balanced.""On the other hand, Bill McKibben, one of the world's leading climate change activists, said: ""Every government seems now to recognize that the fossil fuel era must end and soon. But the power of the fossil fuel industry is reflected in the text, which drags out the transition so far that endless climate damage will be done.""And James Hansen, of the world's leading climate scientists, as reported in the Guardian, stated: ""It's a fraud really, a fake ... it's worthless words, no action, just promises ... as long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will continue to be burned.""Not only was COP 21 the most important international climate change meeting since the failed Copenhagen meetings in 2009, it was the first meeting that Canada's new federal Liberal government has participated in, after 10 years of limited involvement by the former federal Conservative government. So how was Canada's role assessed?I attended COP 21I asked Claire Martin, a Canadian Green Party delegate, about Canada's role. In talking about the Canadian team, and about Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna, Martin said: "" I am more than thrilled [with] McKenna. I think the team has been brilliant so far. Ask advice when they think they need it, gone ahead and made great decisions.""I also asked Martin about the significance of McKenna being asked to be a co-facilitator of the negotiations for the second week of the COP 21 meetings. Her response was: ""Massive. Oh, huge because now we are actively participating. We're not just being 'Canada's back.' We're taking on the role of being 'Oh we'll even help you with the process.'""Yet there was also concern about Canada's lack of a concrete plan.I asked Torrance Coste, a youth delegate and representative of the Wilderness Committee, about Canada's role, and he replied: ""The analogy that I've heard floating around the hallways here a little bit that I really like is that the prime minister and the climate change minister announced that they're interested in a trip to Hawaii but they've yet to book flights or hotel rooms and they've yet to tell us when they are gonna make those plans, those purchases. So you know I think most people can get their head around that. You don't sort of tell your friends and your friends don't start getting excited about your upcoming vacation until you have those details sorted out.""Mike Hudema, another delegate from Canada, and an activist with Greenpeace, offered pluses and minuses on Canada's role at : ""I've definitely heard a lot of people comment that they are really refreshed at the change of governments and surprised by a lot of announcements that Canada has made, especially committing to stabilizing the climate at 1.5 degrees which is vitally important especially for low-lying nations.""""And then also their commitment to including indigenous rights in the text, really pushing for that. So I think the Canadian government is really to be credited for that.""On the opposite side, we've heard that they've been real bullies when it comes to really talking about mitigation and compensation, when it comes to countries that have been already impacted by climate change and they were awarded second place Fossil yesterday.""In sum, Canada ""is back"" as Trudeau is fond of saying. Delegates were generally impressed and enthusiastic about Canada's role. Yet the federal government has not committed to new emissions targets at the federal level (though it pushed for 1.5 C at the COP 21 meetings), and the prime minister has said that rather than having a federal policy, he will work with provincial governments instead, and policy will vary from province to province.Some observers have questioned whether it is possible for the country to successfully meet carbon emission targets (when they are announced) when there is no federal policy. And Canada was recognized multiple times with fossil awards at this year's COP meetings, awards given by the Climate Action Network for behaviour that obstructs progress on climate change actions.So the general perception is that Canada, with our change in government at the federal level, has changed perceptions. But there are still challenges to Canada becoming a world climate-change leader.So, was COP 21 a success? Here is my analogy:Imagine you are travelling for a meeting of absolutely critical importance. But you are utterly lost in terms of directions, and you are late.We have now found our geographical bearings. We know roughly, but not exactly, how to get to the meeting. But we are still late, and will have to figure out a way to increase our speed to our destination. As stated in a number of headl"

The National Eco committee meeting will see 49 of Wales's platinum Eco-schools mirror the COP21 conference at simultaneous meetings in Ruthin, Carmarthenshire and Cilfynydd. The meetings will enable the young people involved to learn more about the implications of climate change, COP21 and its importance globally and to Wales' future. The meetings will feature Wales's track record of positive international action through the Welsh Government's Wales for Africa Programme and the links to Lesotho and the Mbale Partnership working with the charity Size of Wales. As part of the event, the children and young people will develop messages for the Natural Resources Minister to take with him to the negotiations in Paris and identify practical actions to help tackle climate change in their schools and their local communities. Carl Sargeant said: ""As we have done in Wales through the Well-being of Future Generations Act, the United Nations recently took the game-changing step of adopting a set of 17 Goals that are a blueprint for a better future. ""In doing so, the UN also underlined that one of the top three global challenges we must address is to solve climate change and I am therefore hopeful that COP21 will be a further step forward which will accelerate action through a global agreement.

The first of these will be an all-electric 4.5 t truck equipped with a fuel cell, displayed at the Bassin de La Villette, on the stand representing Symbio FCell, McPhy Energy, the Compagnie nationale du Rhone (CNR) and the French Post Office. The second innovation is a 16 t all-electric truck currently being tested under actual operating conditions by Speed Distribution Logistique on behalf of Guerlain. It will be presented by 'Climate Visits' on behalf of the Ile-de-France French Environment and Energy Management Agency. Renault Trucks will be attending the United Nations COP21 conference on climate change with two innovative all-electric vehicles: the Maxity Electric operating on a hydrogen fuel cell and the Renault Trucks D all-electric vehicle. These two trucks are currently being tested under actual operating conditions with the French Post Office at Dole (Jura) and Speed Distribution on behalf of Guerlain in Paris. Symbio FCell, La Poste, McPhy Energy and the Compagnie nationale du Rhone (CNR) have decided to display the hydrogen fuel cell powered Maxity Electric on their stand at the Bassin de la Villette, in order to highlight hydrogen-based solutions that combat climate change as part of their 'Paris in the Future' initiative. Since February 2015, Renault Trucks and the French Post Office have been operating a 4.5 t Renault T electric truck powered by a hydrogen fuel cell developed by Symbio FCell which doubles the vehicle's operating range, extending it to 200 km. This fuel cell solution makes it possible to overcome two of the major limitations which have so far hampered the development of electrically-powered vehicles: their operating range and recharging time, since the time taken to refuel a vehicle with hydrogen is comparable to that of a vehicle running on Diesel fuel. At COP21 , in association with the 'Climate Visits' presented by the Ile-de-France ADEME (French environment and energy management agency), Renault Trucks is also giving visitors the opportunity of discovering concrete solutions to combat climate change already underway in Paris. The Climate Visit N-degree 3 will therefore also take in the Guerlin Boutique and offices at 68, avenue des Champs-Elysees, where those taking part will have the opportunity of discovering the all-electric Renault Trucks D. This vehicle, which has been undergoing tests under actual operating conditions for the past 18 months by Speed Distribution Logistique, a specialised Ile-de-France carrier for Guerlain, generates no noise or polluting emissions during its nightly deliveries to Guerlain's boutiques in the French capital. It carries out full 200 km delivery rounds in all-electric mode, taking advantage of partial recharges carried out according to its battery capacity and the carefully planned delivery route. Renault Trucks has been testing several different technologies under actual operating conditions for some time, in partnership with clients having an assertive strategy with regard to zero emission vehicles operating in urban environments. Renault Trucks' aim is to prepare a cost-effective zero-emission solution for its clients by the year 2020.

Among the events was the launch of the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change & Call to Action. Endorsed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Energy Agency, as well as Tesla Motors and Michelin Nissan-Renault, it reportedly builds on commitments from companies, cities, States and associations that have undertaken decisive efforts towards sustainable transport electrification. ""Of course, I think the sector of transport is one of the most important to succeed in fighting climate,"" Segolene Royal, the French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy told the UN News Service. ""So I announced three concrete initiatives,"" she explained. ""First, an open bid about less expensive electric cars - less than 7,000 dollars [per car]; second, an initiative for towns to build a plan of mobility inside cities; and third, roads with positive energy which [would see thruways] covered with panel and would solve the problem between agriculture areas and road areas."" With energy-related CO2 emissions expected to jump from one quarter of total energy-related emissions today to one-third by 2050, the actors that are part of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) are underlining that significant changes can be made in transport to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. The LPAA was launched one year ago at the the previous UN climate change conference in Peru, and aims to strength climate action beyond COP21 . The effort comes as demand for public and freight transport is projected to grow rapidly, especially in emerging and developing countries. Yet, projections reveal a 50 per cent reduction of transport CO2 emissions compared to a ""transport-as-usual"" scenario can be achieved by 2050, without hampering sustainable economic growth. Moreover, according to the International Energy Agency, if global warming is to be limited to 2 degrees or less, at least 20 per cent of all road vehicles (cars, two and three-wheelers, trucks, buses and others) must be electric-powered by 2030, in conjunction with the low-carbon production of electricity and hydrogen. Other announcements today at COP21 , which centered around the themes of 'Transport' and 'Building,' included new efforts to stabilize emissions from the aviation industry by 2020. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said it has received 74 action plans to advance the implementation of mitigation measures by States, which accounts for 80.6 per cent of global CO2 emissions from international flight. \"

Some blew up large green balloons before letting them fly loose and deflate-a symbol of what their world could look like should an ambitious agreement on climate not be reached. Taking the stage, Mr. Alhendawi was greeted with cheering from the crowd as he wished young delegates a ""happy youth day."" ""This is one of the most important days-because what is at stake today is your present and future,"" he said. ""Nobody has the right to gamble with your future."" Following his remarks, in which he highlighted the importance of even little actions to tackle the significant challenges of climate change, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)-the organizer of COP21 -thanked youth representatives for what they have achieved in their respective communities. ""Thank you for what you're doing not just at the COP but also what you're doing back home,"" Christiana Figueres said. ""That is where the rubber hits the ground."" Echoing this message, Mr. Alhendawi said he is very proud of the youth movement around the world. ""Young people were the mobilizers and the volunteers,"" he exclaimed. ""And they took to the streets reminding everyone that it's time to take action on climate change."" During the event, a manifesto called ""Our communique: Act like a kid"" was presented, which urges world leaders to include climate education in the universal climate agreement expected to be adopted at the end of next week. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK15","COP21: efforts advance on reaching climate change agreement, says top UN official","December 10, 2015 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","December 9, 2015 A new stage in the development of a final agreement on climate change to limit global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius or less has been reached today, according to the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change. ""All the delegations have received the documents, they're reading them, they will be discussing the paper in their groups, and then there will be feedback provided to a new plenary organized this evening,"" said Janos Pasztor in an interview with the UN News Service on the sidelines of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ). ""Presumably, they will be working on it all night, because there are still many brackets, and they need to be removed so we can find solutions to those issues,"" he added. Following a long night of negotiations, the President of COP21 today held a plenary session, to release the new version of the draft agreement to government representatives who will continue meeting to settle the last outstanding issues, in view of its intended adoption on Friday. ""I am convinced we will be able to find an agreement but to achieve this we need to join our forces, we need to unite our efforts, and we need to be guided by this need to achieve compromises,"" Laurent Fabius, COP21 President and French Minister of Foreign Affairs, said during a meeting of the Paris Committee [Comite de Paris]. This Committee oversees the negotiations process and replaces the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) established in 2011 at the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP17). ""The text that you will be receiving in a moment strives to reflect as faithfully as possible the compromises that are emerging,"" Mr. Fabius explained. ""The rule we have followed in all of this has been not to prejudge the resolution of the most political points contained therein, and to maintain a balance between the various options that remain open in the text."" He called on delegates to continue discussions that will enable to reach a ""legally binding agreement"" that is also ambitious, balanced, durable and sustainable. However, he warned them this is not the final version of the document. ""In fact, it might still contain certain elements that are not quite precise yet or that are erroneously interpreted. Apologies in advance and we'll seek to remedy that,"" he said. Compared to the last draft, this one is 29 pages rather than 43. There has also been a three quarters reduction in the number of points that are left in ""square brackets."" ""That is substantially better of course, but it's still too many,"" the Minister insisted, noting the issues on which negotiators have almost completed their work, and for which the text is ""clean."" These include capacity building for mitigation and adaptation, adaptation to climate change impacts, issues of loss and damage, a transparency framework, and the development and transfer of technologies. Some initial progress has reportedly also been made on issues related to forests. ""Of course nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,"" he stressed, reminding delegates that certain political issues still remain to be decided upon and will be subject to in depth discussions, namely differentiation, financing, and the level of ambition of the agreement. ""On these issues we have sought to put forward clearer options which I hope will have reflected the diversity of the positions that have been voiced, and it is on these issues in particular that I will ask you to scale up your consultations, to speedily come to compromise solutions,"" he stressed. Finally, he said the situation can be summarized as follows: ""we've made progress but still a lot of work needs to be done."" He then gave delegates until 8:00pm today to study the document closely before reconvening in the same setting for further discussions. Meanwhile, the United Nations Secretary-General is studying the document as he returns to COP21 . ""He is reading the documents as we speak,"" said Mr. Pasztor. ""We will be advising him to engage with some of the countries and hear from them what their view is on the document, and strategize together with countries on what could be done to move the document forward."" \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK16","-ChargePoint - Reflections on Electric Vehicles at COP21","December 30, 2015 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","ChargePoint - Reflections on Electric Vehicles at COP21 . Electric vehicles were a hot topic at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 , in Paris this December. A parking lot full of COP21 branded Renault-Nissan EVs and bright green charging stations greeted delegates from around the world on their way in to the conference center at Le Bourget. Renault-Nissan's electric car service allowed conference attendees to book an electric ride from the conference center to select hotels, helping many passionate environmentalists try the climate friendly technology. Inside the conference center, electric vehicles were a prominent part of most transportation-related discussions at the plethora of side events. At the High Level Transport Day on December 3, Segolene Royal, the French Minister of Ecology, announced the Paris Declaration on Electro-mobilty and Climate Change and Call to Action. It calls for at least 20% of all ground transportation to be electrified by 2030 in order to keep global warming limited to two degrees or less. Twenty-four companies and organizations from around the world have signed on to support the commitment including Renault-Nissan, Tesla and ChangePoint. Segolene Royal also announced a global competition for an EV under 7,000 Euros, with a range of 300 miles and a charging time of under 30 minutes. With these criteria EVs would be accessible to all, including those in developing countries. The We Mean Business Coalition convened a roundtable conversation entitled 100% Electric: How Can We Accelerate the Transformation of the Transport System. The influential advocacy group's CEO, Nigel Topping, moderated a panel with ChargePoint CEO, Pasquale Romano and sustainability execs from BMW, Renault-Nissan, and Ikea. Things got really interesting at the end of the conversation when Topping pushed the panel on when we should expect the last internal combustion engine will be sold. Romano boldly predicted 2035, citing the transformative adoption of the smart phone as precedent. The auto representatives were hesitant to commit to a date, opting to reframe the question to when EVs would become dominant in the market. They put this at 2030 - 2035. Steve Howard, CSO of Ikea, agreed that 'EVs are the next smart phone' and predicted EVs would be dominant by 2023. A High Level Event on Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) in the Netherlands Pavillion brought together leaders in the private and public sector to discuss the opportunities and challenges ahead for ZEVs. Again, BMW and Renault-Nissan represented the auto-manufacturers and ChargePoint represented EV charging infrastructure. Senan McGrath from the Electric Supply Board provided the private utility perspective. Together, the automakers, ChargePoint, and the utility communicated that the market is ready for electrification of transportation. U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and California Governor Jerry Brown also stressed the importance of ZEVs for greenhouse gas mitigation in transport. Governor Brown made EVs a focal point of his messages at many speaking engagements throughout the week. Transportation emissions are 40% of all emissions in California - about 10% higher than the U.S. average. This stems both from the fact that Californians drive more than most Americans and that the state has a cleaner electricity mix than many others. Governor Brown and Tom Steyer convened a delegation of business leaders from across the state of California to communicate all that California is doing to foster innovation and action in mitigating climate change. ChargePoint's CEO Pasquale Romano was one of the 12 business leaders selected from across the state to participate in the delegation, which helped to bring EVs and EV charging into the conversation throughout the summit. EVs were also at the center of the Sustainable Innovation Forum at the Stade De France, and Solutions COP21 , at the Grand Palais, as well. BMWi, the electric transportation arm of the automaker, was a premier sponsor for the Climate Action Programme's 6th annual Sustainable Innovation forum. They positioned a BMWi3 alongside a ChargePoint charging station right at the entrance to the stadium's conference space and BMW executives spoke to all that BMW is doing to support sustainable mobility. At Solutions COP21 automakers from Nissan to Toyota displayed their latest and greatest alternative fuel vehicles under the grand glass archways of the Beaux-Arts palace. The United Nations' Momentum for Change Award also sent a strong signal about the important role EVs will play in keeping climate change at bay by selecting ChargePoint as one of the 15 Lighthouse Activities honored as an example of a transformative, innovative, and scalable information communication technology tackling climate change. The Momentum for Change Showcase Event on Thursday evening, right before the negotiations were intended to come to a close, was a celebration of the possibility that innovative technologies hold for enabling the world to achieve the ambitious targets set by world leaders in the negotiations. Along with renewable energy and energy efficiency, electric transportation is both a critical need for the fight against climate change and a market-ready technology. The many discussions about EVs at side events throughout COP21 (which were many more than I could capture here) prove that international high-level leaders from business, government and civil society are in agreement. Now it's up to us -as drivers, employees, legislators, and voters to bring EVs from center stage at a climate conference to center stage on our roads and parking lots.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK17","COP21: a 'green' UN climate change conference, from electric cars to the power of human energy","December 15, 2015 Tuesday","FinancialWire","With countries reaching a new agreement at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), the global meeting has been qualified as a ""monumental triumph"" by top UN officials. While many continued to hail the outcome document as the walls of COP21 were torn down on Sunday, the UN News Centre looked back on other aspects that contributed ""positive energy"" to the two-week event. Highlighting what made COP21 ""green"" was Fanina Kodre-Alexander from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), who manages communications on climate change, disasters and conflicts. She said UNEP worked with the organizers - the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Government of France - to ensure sustainability throughout the Paris-Le Bourget site located north-east of the capital. ""We work under our 'Eat, Think, Save' campaign in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and we believe that food waste is the third largest emitter after a couple of countries,"" Ms. Koder-Alexander noted. To reduce waste, all the food provided at UNEP events, including those during COP21 , is sourced from rescued food, resources that would otherwise have been destroyed. Ms. Kodre-Alexander highlighted that it's always provided in a ""very appetizing and lovely way."" Another exciting feature at COP21 related to food, which attracted a lot of attention, was the boulangers brought on premise to avoid trucking kilos of fresh baguettes ever day. They welcomed the UN News Centre into their lab, which is visible to all conference-goers through a thin see-through plastic tarp. Every day, COP21 bakers made 10,000 pieces of bread on the premises to avoid having to truck them in. Audio slide show by Stephanie Coutrix To go with the bread, of course there's cafe. ""We're very happy to see they're using recyclable cups,"" said Ms. Kodre-Alexander. ""The method which they've employed is that people are returning them to get a credit. It's quite successful and you don't see them left around and dropped in the garbage."" In addition, welcome packs handed out to all participants included water bottles to limit the number of plastic ones purchased. Water stations to fill these were abundantly found around every corner, similarly to the many recycling bins, clearly labeled to support the separation of paper, plastics and compostable organic waste. ""UNEP has also tried to be as paperless as possible,"" added Ms. Kodre-Alexander. ""There are certain documents that need to be printed and distributed but we believe in either providing links to our website or USB keys when available."" On Saturday, the printed final draft of the agreement was handed out to delegates to review before they reconvened hours later for its adoption. This was a rare time paper was seen throughout the venue, as negotiators met in all free spaces including the cafeteria. Meanwhile, several eco-friendly options were available to get to and from the site. In addition to free public buses, 300 electric cars were provided by Renault-Nissan to anyone seeking a ride. Reservations could be made online just hours in advance, or in person with a little extra wait time. Two hundred of the drivers were professional chauffeurs, while the rest volunteered to help limit COP21 's carbon footprint. According to Renault-Nissan, a total of 16.32 tons of carbon dioxide were diverted during the two weeks thanks to the initiative. While the cars recharged during the day, so did thousands of cell phones at power stations provided by a group called ""Solar Sound Systems."" Unlike a typical plug, participants had to pedal to activate the charging. Similarly, this applied to making one's own juice and contributing to power a DJ booth located in the Generation Climat hall, a space open to the public and dedicated to the exchange of idea, mainly between younger climate advocates. Despite all these ""green"" options, the UN News Centre asked Ms. Kodre-Alexander whether there was anything more she had wished to see at the conference. ""Personally for me it's always the heating/air conditioning issue,"" she answered. ""I always find that if you're overheating the venues and then air conditioning others, you're consuming a lot of resources that would normally be saved."" Perhaps this is an additional aspect to consider next year, when a new COP convenes next November in Marrakesh, Morocco.

""World leaders have expressed their support for the COP and have reaffirmed that they will attend the start of the Conference on 30 November,"" said Janos Pasztor, the UN Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change, noting that more than 120 have confirmed their participation in the 21st Meeting of the States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is expected to run through 11 December. ""The attacks in Paris, however, are affecting the preparations and activities planned for COP21 - especially those that are outside the formal conference location at Le Bourget,"" he continued. Mr. Pasztor said the decision of the Government of France to cancel the climate march planned on 29 November must be respected. ""We hope that leaders and negotiators will still heed the voices of civil society who will gather and march in their towns and cities around the world - now counting over 2000 - to show support for climate action during the weekend of November 29th through peaceful mobilization,"" the Assistant Secretary-General stated. Meanwhile, he stressed that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon remains committed to working with leaders to achieve a successful outcome in Paris, recalling that last week, he spoke to G20 leaders on climate change, and urged them to guide their negotiators to achieve ambitious outcomes in Paris. The UN chief is scheduled to meet with leaders at the ASEAN-UN conference in Kuala Lumpur this weekend, at the Commonwealth Heads of States and Government Meeting in Malta next week, and at the COP itself, to help unlock progress on what Mr. Pasztor said are ""several sticking points."" ""The preparatory process for Paris is showing results,"" he explained. ""Various informal ministerial meetings have achieved certain convergence on some key political issues - the details of which still need to be negotiated in Paris."" According to the latest figures, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 per cent of emissions, have now submitted national climate plans with targets, known as the INDCs. ""If successfully implemented, these national plans bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century,"" the climate expert said, adding that it is significant progress but is still not enough. ""The challenge now is to move much further and faster to reduce global emissions so we can keep global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. At the same time, there must be support to countries to adapt to the inevitable consequences that are already upon us."" Underlining that the two-week conference in Paris is not the end point, Mr. Pasztor said ""it must mark the floor, not the ceiling of our ambition."" ""We are optimistic,"" he told reporters, while adding that there is still a great deal of work ahead to be done before the global community realizes a universal, meaningful agreement, taking place in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by Member States in September. \"

""You are here today to write the script for a new future,"" Mr. Ban told around 150 world leaders attending the kick-off of the much-anticipated conference in Paris, France. ""We have never faced such a test,"" he continued. ""But neither have we encountered such great opportunity. You have the power to secure the well-being of this and succeeding generations."" Opening the floor alongside the President of France, Francois Hollande, the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, and the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Christiana Figueres, the UN chief recalled that last September, an ""inspiring"" new sustainable development agenda with ambitious goals was endorsed by all Heads of State and Government. ""You showed your commitment to act for the common good,"" he underlined. ""It is now time to do so again. I urge you to instruct your negotiators to choose the path of compromise and consensus. Bold climate action is in the national interest of every single country represented at this conference."" Insisting that Paris must mark a turning point, Mr. Ban stated that the world needs to know that it is headed to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future, and that ""there is no going back."" Ahead of COP21 , countries submitted voluntary climate action plans to UNFCCC, the UN entity organizing the conference. These are formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, and will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached in two weeks. The Secretary-General announced today that more than 180 countries have now submitted their national climate plans which cover close to 100 per cent of global emissions. ""This is a good start,"" he said. ""But we need to go much farther and much faster if we are to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius."" According to experts, even a 2-degree rise will have serious consequences for food and water security, economic stability and international peace, which is why a universal, meaningful agreement in Paris is crucial, Mr. Ban told the leaders. Turning to success criteria at COP21 , Mr. Ban said the agreement must be durable, dynamic, embody solidarity with the poor and most vulnerable, and finally, the agreement must be credible. ""Developed countries must keep their pledge to mobilize $ 100 billion dollars a year by 2020,"" he added. ""A new agreement must also include a single transparent framework for measuring, monitoring and reporting progress. And countries with low capacity should receive flexibility and support so they can meet the requirements of this new system."" Meanwhile, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres echoed that this past year has been a turning point for the climate agenda. ""After many years of hard work, we finally see irreversibility of direction, depth of engagement and boldness of action,"" she told leaders in her opening remarks. ""This turning point is remarkable, but the task is not done,"" Ms. Figueres continued. ""It is up to you to both capture this progress and chart an unequivocal path forward, with a clear destination, agreed milestones and a predictable timeline that responds to the demands of science and the urgency of the challenge."" She added that never before ""has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few,"" and that the world is looking at world leaders and counting on them.

These initiatives are taking place under the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), launched one year ago at the previous climate change conference in Peru, and aims to strength climate action beyond COP21 . ""Resilience is really important because the climate is already changing, and we need to be able to not just adapt to the changes but actually develop in a way that takes into account that in the future, climate will still change,"" Janos Pasztor, the UN Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change, told the UN News Service in an interview at the conference site in Paris. ""Even if we stop all the emissions today, there are already enough greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that the climate will continue to change,"" he continued. ""So we need to adjust our development process, adjust our economic approach [...] and be more resilient to future changes that will happen."" Bold announcements were made at COP21 today, which was dedicated to building more resilient societies and economies. According to the UN, extreme climate already impacts hundreds of millions of people every year, undermining or destroying their livelihoods, their homes and their environment. The Rockefeller Foundation estimates that over the last 30 years, one dollar out of every three spent on development has been lost as a result of such recurring crises, a total loss of $ 3.8 trillion dollars worldwide. In contrast, resilient societies and economies suffer less and recover more quickly from such natural disasters. ""Resilience-it is very important when we talk about climate change and its consequences,"" Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru's Minister of the Environment, told the UN News Service. ""When we talk about resilience, we are talking about how can we resist [...] and avoid negative consequences to our human population,"" he explained. ""To the wildlife, to the habitat, to the ecosystems, to the water, to the ocean-that is why we have the 'Resilience Day.' If climate change is going to bring us natural disasters, we should have the objective of resilience as a way to face those kinds of consequences."" Meanwhile, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) today launched a new 'Climate Risk Early Warning System,' (CREWS), while the governments of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed to give more than $ 80 million dollars to equip up to 80 countries with better systems to support countries most vulnerable to climate disasters. The plan was first proposed in March by France's Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan. ""Climate related disasters cause human losses and dramatic economic losses each year,"" said France's Secretary of State for Development Annick Girardin. ""We will first help the most exposed countries among [Least Developed Countries] and Small Island States which will be most at risk as the frequency and severity of such hazards are expected to increase in this part of the world,"" she added. News from COP21 also included the announcement from a broad coalition of nations, river basin organizations, business and civil society of the creation of the international Paris Pact on Water and Climate Change Adaptation to make water systems - considered the very foundation of sustainable human development-more resilient to climate impacts. Almost 290 water basin organizations are reportedly engaged under this new Pact. They say without improved water resources management, the progress towards poverty reduction targets, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and sustainable development in all its economic, social and environmental dimensions, will be jeopardized. According to a press release issued by the main actors of the LPAA, many other initiatives launched on 'Resilience Day' covered the ""full spread of peoples' needs"" as they face increasing climate impacts.""

Representing the global shipping industry, ICS has accepted its responsibility to sustain the CO2 reduction measures undertaken by the global community. The conference has also recommended the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) enforce further regulations to curb CO2 emissions across the global merchant fleet. According to the IMO, the carbon emissions from international maritime shipping could increase by 250% in the period up to 2050 if left unchecked. The present carbon emissions from maritime shipping represents up to 2.2% of the global total. ICS secretary general Peter Hinchliffe said: ""Mandatory regulations already adopted by IMO will ensure that all ships built after 2025 will be at least 30% more efficient than ships operating today. Combined with further technical and operational measures plus new technology, international shipping should be able to reduce its CO2 per tonne-kilometre by 50% before 2050. ""These dramatic further CO2 reductions will be genuine and real. We will have bigger ships, better engines, cleaner fuels and smarter speed management. The mandatory worldwide use by ships of low sulphur fuel to reduce air pollution will provide a further significant incentive to improve fuel efficiency."" In 2011, the IMO adopted the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) to regulate compulsory energy efficiency standards for new ships besides the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) to reduce emissions from the shipping sector. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK24","COP21: UN spotlights importance of protecting forests and agriculture to improve livelihoods, feed the world","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","December 1, 2015 The impacts of climate change on forests and agriculture were in the spotlight today at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), as new alliances among organizations and stakeholders were announced aiming to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation, and to prevent threats to sustainable farming and people's livelihoods. Many of the events on the second day of the global gathering in Paris, France took place in the context of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) - a joint undertaking by the Governments of Peru and France, the Office of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the organizer of the current conference, the 21st meeting of the Convention's States Parties. The Action Agenda was launched in December 2014 by the previous meeting of the UNFCCC parties in Lima, Peru. As highlighted in a press release issued by UNFCCC, the LPAA aims to strengthen climate action beyond COP21 , by ""mobilizing robust global action towards low carbon and resilient societies and providing enhanced support to existing initiatives."" During the two-week conference, 12 thematic focus events are being organized to expose how climate issues affect various sectors and to suggest relevant solutions to tackle them. On Tuesday, with forests and agriculture taking center stage, leaders from governments, the private and public sectors, civil society and indigenous peoples voiced their environmental concerns. This included how agriculture, forestry and other land uses are responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions - about half of that from deforestation and forest degradation, mostly driven by demand for food and wood products and inequities and inefficiencies in the use of land for their production. ""Forest countries in partnership with other governments, the private sector and civil society are set for an increased international effort to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation in a few decades,"" said Peru's Minister of the Environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal speaking at a press conference. ""The success of the LPAA and its action area on Forests relies on effective synergies between state and non-state actors, between investment and forest management - all together rallied behind sustainably managed forests as a common goal,"" he added. According to UN estimates, approximately one billion people depend directly on forests for their livelihoods and each year, approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. This loss of forest cover is said to be responsible for roughly 11 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, governments and organizations, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), announced six new cooperative initiatives that aim to protect the long-term livelihoods of millions of farmer and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The entities highlighted how agriculture is one of the sectors most seriously affected by extreme climate but it also accounts for 24 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change. The initiatives focus on four key areas: soils in agriculture, the livestock sector, food losses and waste, and sustainable production methods and resilience of farmers. The new partnerships are expected to deploy money and know-how across both developed and developing nations to help hard-pressed farmers become key actors in the global drive to achieve a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. UNFCCC said today's events reveal the ""effective and concrete progress"" that can be made when a wide, international set of stakeholders work together to build resilience and low-carbon systems of production in agricultural and food systems. \"

During the five-day climate talks in Bonn, Germany, the sectors were revealed to have been included in the Paris agreement draft to be signed in December. However, environmental groups including Seas At Risk and Transport & Environment (T&E) earlier speculated about the draft agreement having excluded the aviation and shipping sectors from targeted CO2 emissions cuts. ""Those parties calling for an ambitious agreement must insist that language on international transport be reinserted."" The environmental groups also claimed that previous calls for aviation and shipping CO2 reduction targets will be removed under the draft Paris deal. According to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), carbon emissions from international maritime shipping could increase by 250% in the period to 2050 if left unchecked. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which represents the global shipping industry, recommended the UN IMO enforce further regulations to curb CO2 emissions across the global merchant fleet. ICS secretary general Peter Hinchliffe said: ""Mandatory regulations already adopted by IMO will ensure that all ships built after 2025 will be at least 30% more efficient than ships operating today. ""Combined with further technical and operational measures plus new technology, international shipping should be able to reduce its CO2 per tonne kilometre by 50% before 2050."" With the least developed countries likely to suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, IMF and World Bank expressed strong dissent against such levies. \"

A new ICS fact sheet 'Delivering CO2 Emission Reductions: Shipping is Part of the Solution' can be downloaded at HYPERLINK http://www.ics-shipping.org/docs/shipsandco2-cop21 www.ics-shipping.org/docs/shipsandco2- HYPERLINK cop21 According to ICS, the global industry is already delivering carbon neutral growth having reduced total CO2 emissions by more than 10% since 2007, despite an increase in maritime trade. CO2 emissions from international shipping now represent just 2.2% of the world's total CO2 emissions compared to 2.8% in 2007 (UN IMO Green House Gas Study, 2014). ""These are genuine reductions through fuel efficiency, without the need for complex virtual measures such as carbon offsets,"" said ICS Secretary General, Peter Hinchliffe. ""With bigger ships, better engines and smarter speed management, the industry is confident of a 50% CO2 reduction by 2050 when the entire world fleet will comprise super fuel-efficient ships, many using clean fuels such as LNG."" But in the run-up to the Paris Conference, the shipping industry recognises that governments expect more. Shipping's global regulator, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already set a mandatory target whereby all ships built from 2025 (including those in developing nations) must be 30% more efficient than ships built in the 2000s. This applies to over 95% of the world merchant fleet, under new regulations which came into force worldwide in 2013. ICS says that IMO is the only place that can ensure that the entire world fleet will continue to deliver further CO2 reductions, regardless of a ship's flag, whilst respecting the United Nations Framework - Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principle of ""Common But Differentiated Responsibility."" ICS stresses that the 10% CO2 reduction achieved since 2007 is across the shipping sector globally, not just ships registered in richer countries which are the only nations required to make commitments for land-based CO2 reductions under the current Kyoto Protocol on climate change. ""The entire world fleet is about 20% more efficient than in 2005. With the support of the shipping industry, IMO has already achieved a great deal and is the only forum that can deliver further significant CO2 reductions from international shipping,"" said Peter Hinchliffe. Notes \'b7 The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is the global trade association for merchant shipowners. Its membership comprises national shipowners' associations from 37 countries representing more than 80% of the world merchant fleet. \'b7 ICS will be attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP21 ) from 30 November - 11 December 2015.

ACI Europe president Augustin de Romanet said: ""Europe's airports are fully behind the objective of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C - and they are urging States to come to a global, robust and legally binding agreement in Paris. ""For its part, the airport industry has already moved from words to actions a while ago. Throughout Europe and beyond, airports are effectively working to mitigate and reduce their own impact on climate change."" According to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the carbon emissions from aviation currently represent up to 2% of the global total. In 2009, the European airport industry as part of its commitment to reduce its carbon emissions launched carbon management standard Airport Carbon Accreditation to assess and recognise the efforts being made by airports to manage and reduce their CO\'b2 emissions. Airports will be certified at four different accreditation levels under the programme, which include mapping, reduction, optimisation and neutrality. A total of 137 airports across Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific have earned airport carbon-accredited status in the past year. Romanet added: ""At the moment, there are 93 airports in Europe that are certified under Airport Carbon Accreditation. These airports welcome 64% of annual European passenger traffic. 20 of these airports are carbon neutral and our commitment to bring that number to 50 by 2030 reflects both our resolve and our ambition to do more."" \"

Ewan Jones visited ahead of the UN COP21 climate talks, just weeks after terrorists slaughtered 130 people in multiple attacks across the French capital city. Earlier this week, US President Barack Obama said that the summit on global warming being held in the city was an ""act of defiance"" in itself. Dr Jones arrived in Paris last Thursday with Cornwall based group Climate Vision to make the case for a sustainable South West. He said: ""The Paris that we found was getting on with life with all of the insouciance that we would have expected, regardless of the criminal actions of a few bearing guns two weeks before. ""The Parisians with whom we four British cyclists shared a Metro carriage on the way to a welcome dinner with South West Green MEP Molly Scott Cato would not have had it any other way."" Dr Jones said that Ms Scott Cato made the case for public money leading the way in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ease the effects of climate change. Dr Jones and his fellow green cyclists also heard from speakers hailing from Costa Rica, Sweden, Luxembourg and France calling for urgent action at the conference. He said: ""The hardest thing was leaving Paris, not just because I had been reminded how much I love the city, but also because our train to Caen was an hour late - meaning that I almost missed the ferry back to Portsmouth."" The defining image of the protests ahead of the COP 21 summit was 10,000 shoes, including those of the Pope, placed on a Paris street where people were prevented from marching because of security concerns. On his return, Dr Jones attended a ""universally good humoured"" climate march in Bristol on Sunday. \"

""The Paris Agreement is a monumental triumph for people and our planet,"" said Mr. Ban in a tweet, immediately following its adoption. ""It sets the stage for progress in ending poverty, strengthening peace and ensuring a life of dignity and opportunity for all."" Gaveling the Agreement with a green hammer, the French Foreign Minister and President of COP21 , Laurent Fabius, announced the historic news - a moment greeted with loud applause and cheers, as the room stood up. Many delegates hugged, while others had tears in their eyes. For the first time today, 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and joined to take common climate action. This followed two weeks of tireless negotiations at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ). The Paris Agreement and the outcomes of COP21 cover all the crucial areas identified as essential for a landmark conclusion: mitigation - reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; a transparency system and global stock-take - accounting for climate action; adaptation - strengthening ability of countries to deal with climate impacts; loss and damage - strengthening ability to recover from climate impacts; and support - including finance, for nations to build clean, resilient futures. ""In the face of an unprecedented challenge, you have demonstrated unprecedented leadership,"" the UN chief said taking the COP21 stage just minutes later. ""You have worked collaboratively to achieve something that no one nation could achieve alone. This is a resounding success for multilateralism."" Recalling that he made climate change one of the defining priorities of his tenure as Secretary-General, Mr. Ban said that most of all, he has listened to people - the young, the poor and the vulnerable, including indigenous peoples, from every corner of the globe. ""They seek protection from the perils of a warming planet, and the opportunity to live in a safer, more bountiful world,"" he underlined. ""They have demanded that world leaders act to safeguard their well-being and that of generations to come."" Turning to the agreement itself, the Secretary-General said negotiators reached ""solid results on all key points,"" with an agreement that demonstrates solidarity and ""is ambitious, flexible, credible and durable."" ""All countries have agreed to hold global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. And recognizing the risk of grave consequences, you have further agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees,"" he announced. In addition, a review mechanism has been established whereby every five years, beginning in 2018, Parties will regularly review what is needed in line with science. ""Governments have agreed to binding, robust, transparent rules of the road to ensure that all countries do what they have agreed across a range of issues,"" Mr. Ban added. Meanwhile, highlighting the role of the private sector, the UN chief said business leaders came to Paris in unprecedented numbers and that ""powerful"" climate solutions are already available while many more are to come. ""With these elements in place, markets now have the clear signal they need to unleash the full force of human ingenuity and scale up investments that will generate low-emissions, resilient growth,"" he said, adding that ""what was once unthinkable has now become unstoppable."" ""When historians look back on this day, they will say that global cooperation to secure a future safe from climate change took a dramatic new turn here in Paris,"" Mr. Ban stated. ""Today, we can look into the eyes of our children and grandchildren, and we can finally say, tell them that we have joined hands to bequeath a more habitable world to them and to future generations."" Ending his remarks, the UN chief said that all Parties should be proud of the Paris Agreement and that ""the work starts tomorrow."" ""For today, congratulations again on a job well done,"" he concluded. ""Let us work together, with renewed commitment, to make this a better world."" Addressing the hundreds of delegates, Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, said ""we did it in Paris."" ""We have made history together. It is an agreement of conviction. It is an agreement of solidarity with the most vulnerable. It is an agreement of long-term vision, for we have to turn this agreement into an engine of safe growth,"" she exclaimed. Several other top UN officials joined the Secretary-General in welcoming the new Agreement. This included the President of the UN General Assembly, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft. ""Today's agreement signals nothing less than a renaissance for humankind as we collectively embrace the global challenge of climate change and endeavor to transition to a more sustainable way of living that respects the needs of people and our planet,"" Mr. Lykketoft said in a statement. Echoing this message, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Oh Joon, said the world has reached a key milestone in collective action for sustainable development. ""Bold action against climate change will contribute to poverty reduction. The United Nations Economic and Social Council will take part in follow-up efforts,"" he added. Earlier today, at a meeting of the Committee of Paris [Comite de Paris] - the body which is overseeing the negotiations at COP21 - the UN chief spoke alongside the President of France, Francois Hollande as well Minister Fabius. ""The end is in sight. Let us now finish the job. The whole world is watching. Billions of people are relying on your wisdom,"" the Secretary-General had told delegates. In an emotional address during which he held back tears, Laurent Fabius said the agreement ""will serve meaningful causes, food safety and security, public health, the fight against poverty and for essential rights, and therefore peace."" ""People worldwide, our citizens, our children, wouldn't understand if we didn't adopt it and wouldn't forgive us,"" he insisted.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK31","COP21: on eve of UN climate conference, Ban says 'time for action is now'","November 30, 2015 Monday","FinancialWire","On the eve of the opening in Paris of the United Nations climate change conference , widely known as COP21 , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is urging all countries and all sectors of society to act now to reach a new universal climate agreement. ""I'm reasonably optimistic and convinced that world leaders will adopt a very ambitious universal climate change agreement at this COP21 ,"" Mr. Ban told the UN News Centre in an interview on Sunday at the Parisian headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). ""We've been working very hard, very long - the time for action is now. I have seen growing political momentum among Member States. They know that they have to take action."" Ahead of COP21 , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - the UN entity organizing the conference - has already received some 180 voluntary climate action plans from countries. Formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, these will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached. As more and more INDCs were submitted, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said this shows nations are prepared to take meaningful action to address climate change. Many countries have also indicated they would like to see a mechanism in the agreement that will allow them to ramp up their ambition to reach the goal of limiting a global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. According to experts, a temperature rise beyond this level will cause irreversible damage to the planet by exacerbating droughts, floods, food and water shortages, affecting the most vulnerable countries first. Despite the scientific community acknowledging that the national pledges submitted so far will not limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius, Mr. Ban has underscored that a successful outcome at COP21 would allow the world to ultimately achieve this target. Tomorrow, around 150 Heads of State and Government are expected at the opening event at the Paris-Le Bourget site, an 18 hectare conference centre north-east of the capital. This space will be the main venue for the two-week meeting, with 32 ""negotiating rooms,"" working areas for delegations, civil society and journalists, as well as many venues dedicated to side events. Simultaneously, within the city borders, special events will be held - such as ""an afternoon with Robert Redford"" at UNESCO on 6 December, and the awarding of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Equator prize - often referred to as the Academy Awards of sustainable development - taking place at the renowned Theatre Mogador. At the conference, the interconnectivity between sustainable development and climate issues will be one of the overarching themes. In September, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is composed of 17 goals - the SDGs - to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years. Asked how a new climate deal and these SDGs are linked, the UN Secretary-General said a strong climate agreement backed by action on the ground will help the world achieve the global goals ""to make the world better and safer."" ""Goal number 13 [focuses on] climate change but if we do not implement the climate change agreement, then all the remaining 16 goals will be affected. Not a single goal can be implemented in isolation,"" Mr. Ban explained. ""Science has made it plainly clear - that this climate change phenomenon is caused by human behaviour,"" he continued. ""It's only natural that we human beings should change our behaviour in a sustainable way. We have to do it. We don't have any time to lose. That's why I am urging world leaders to demonstrate their moral and political leadership for humanity."" The UN News Centre asked the Secretary-General what makes him optimistic that, in a world full of disease, war and famine, world leaders can work together instead of in their own self-interest. ""[Climate change] doesn't care about national boundaries,"" he stated. ""This is a global phenomenon and [leaders] understand that investing wisely in climate change will help their national economy boost. There are many countries who are investing in sustainable energy including solar energy. It's skyrocketing."" The UN climate conference will officially open Monday when the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, is elected President of COP21 . Negotiations towards a final agreement are expected to conclude on 11 December. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General today met with French President Francois Hollande to discuss the status of negotiations and identify key issues still under discussion. A readout issued by Mr. Ban's spokesperson said they agreed that ""failure to reach an agreement was not an option and would have disastrous consequences."" The two leaders also exchanged views on the issue of counter-terrorism and shared their concern of a growing influence of Da'esh beyond Syria and Iraq. In addition, Mr. Ban stood in solidarity today with the people of Paris who were unable to join a climate march, after it was cancelled last week due to security concerns. Alongside scores of other people, he donated a pair of his ""marching shoes"" to be placed at the city's Place de la Republique near the scene of 20 November's terror attack, and where the climate march was due to start. ""As the world gathers in Paris to stand up for climate action, let us also stand in the shoes of all victims of terrorism, war and persecution - and respond with compassion,"" said a note he wrote and left at the scene. Following the event, the thousands of shoes contributed were donated to a non-governmental organization working with Syrian refugees.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK32","COP21: UN chief launches initiative to build climate resilience of world's most vulnerable countries","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","FinancialWire","On the opening day of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), dozens of announcements were made in Paris by Governments and leaders of the public and private sectors, all aiming to generate climate solutions and build a sustainable future. A new initiative to build climate resilience in the world's most vulnerable countries was launched by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and 13 agencies of the UN system. ""Three out of four humanitarian disasters are now climate-related,"" Mr. Ban told delegates attending a High-level meeting on climate resilience at the Paris-Le Bourget site, COP21 's main venue. ""Economic losses have increased by more than half over the past decade. Ecosystems, and food and water supplies are under increasing pressure. The hardest hit are the poor and vulnerable - including small farmers, fishing communities and indigenous peoples,"" warned the UN chief. According to the UN, the new initiative - called 'Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape' - will strengthen the ability of countries to anticipate hazards, absorb shocks, and reshape development to reduce climate risks. It is expected to help address the needs of the nearly 634 million people, or a tenth of the global population who live in at-risk coastal areas just a few meters above existing sea levels, as well as those living in areas at risk of droughts and floods. The world is now experiencing a strong El Ni\'f1o event, which could place as many as 4.7 million people at risk from drought in the Pacific alone. Over the next five years, the Initiative is set to mobilize financing and knowledge; create and operationalize partnerships at scale, help coordinate activities to help reach tangible results, catalyze research, and develop new tools. The Secretary-General also joined the launch of the International Solar Alliance, set up by the Governments of India and France. In the presence of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the UN chief said the Alliance will ""enable solar-rich developing countries to make the best use of an abundant, free natural resource."" ""The broad support for this international coalition is testament to the resonance of your vision of a solar-powered path to prosperity,"" said Mr. Ban. ""As the Prime Minister has said, we need 'development without destruction.' Solar energy offers major potential for reducing poverty and limiting greenhouse gas emissions."" He added that he counts on developed countries to partner with the International Solar Alliance by providing technology support, capacity-building and financial resources. Other news at the opening of COP21 included a pledge by 11 donor countries of close to $ 250 million dollars in new money for adaptation support to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), a climate fund hosted by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). ""I have seen for myself how people from across the developing world are leading the way to climate solutions,"" said Mary Robinson, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Climate Change. ""But the scale and international nature of climate change requires an unprecedented level of international solidarity and support. So today's announcement should be seen in that context: they are not just about dollars and cents and accounting. They are about supporting millions of people across the world,"" she added. Meanwhile, a new Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Communique was presented to Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), by the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. The Communique calls on the international community to increase efforts to phase out perverse subsidies to fossil fuels by promoting policy transparency, ambitious reform and targeted support for the poorest. In addition, the World Bank announced it has been working with four European countries - Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland - to set up a new $ 500 million initiative that will find new ways to create incentives aimed at large scale cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries to combat climate change. The initiative, called the Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, will reportedly help developing countries implement their plans to cut emissions by working with them to create new classes of carbon assets associated with reduced greenhouse gas emission reductions, including those achieved through policy actions. Twenty countries, all of them major economies, launched Mission Innovation, a landmark commitment to dramatically accelerate public and private global clean energy innovation, including doubling their current investments in the sector. According to UNFCCC, these national commitments ""are coupled with a major, independent private sector initiative spearheaded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in which entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses will deploy billions more dollars to drive innovation from the laboratory to the marketplace."" Finally, the opening of COP21 also included new partnerships forged between world leaders from major forest countries who today endorsed forests as a key climate solution. A press release issued by UNFCCC indicated that they recommitted to providing strong, collective and urgent action to promote equitable rural economic development while slowing, halting and reversing deforestation and massively increasing forest restoration. Additional initiatives and pledges are expected during the two-week conference, which is scheduled to end on 11 December.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK33","Is government putting enough effort into energy investment?; THE UK will focus on gas and nuclear power and aim to end renewable subsidies. Peter McCusker repor....","December 10, 2015 Thursday","The Journal (Newcastle, UK)","at the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference , near Paris at the COP21 , United Nations Climate Change Conference , near Paris Bill Gates, philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, attends a conference Bill Gates, philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, attends a conference MUCH has been made of Microsoft founder Bill Gates' address to the ongoing Paris climate summit when he said there needs to be a renewed focus on low-carbon energy research. Along with fellow billionaires Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg and others, he is calling for a multi-billion dollar push for new private and public investment in 'clean energy'. But previous pronouncements by Mr Gates - when he criticised the 'misleadingly meaningless statements' of some clean energy advocates - highlight the challenges currently faced in the quest for sustainable, low-carbon solutions. In an interview with The Atlantic Magazine Mr Gates said: ""They (the green lobby) have this statement that the cost of solar photovoltaic is the same as hydrocarbon's. ""What they mean is that at noon in Arizona, the cost of that kilowatt-hour is the same as a hydrocarbon kilowatthour. ""But it doesn't come at night, it doesn't come after the sun hasn't shone, so the fact that in that one moment you reach parity, so what? ""The reading public, when they see things like that, they underestimate how hard this thing is. So false solutions like divestment or 'Oh, it's easy to do' hurt our ability to fix the problems. Distinguishing a real solution from a false solution is actually very complicated."" Mr Gates' recognition of the limits of existing green technology, and of the need to develop improved renewable solutions, chimes with the shift in direction of UK Government policy. In last month's Spending Review, Chancellor George Osborne committed the UK to a doubling of investment in energy research from \£3250m to \£3500m. A Department of Energy and Climate Change press release issued at the time said this would 'help position the UK as an international leader in small modular nuclear reactors, and deliver commitments on seed funding for promising new renewable energy technologies and smart grids'. Mr Osborne also reiterated the previous announcement by Energy Secretary Amber Rudd that the UK would bring an end to the era of UK coal-fired power generation, by 2025. Ms Rudd says the UK wants to see a further 20 new gas-fired power stations built over the next 20 years (see panel) and see a new generation of nuclear power plants. This follows previous large subsidy cuts for onshore wind and solar power, while Mr Osborne went on to announce further cuts in subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable heating schemes, coupled with greater support for smart meters and demand reduction measures. One renewable technology which has so far survived the cuts is offshore wind which the Government favours as it can deliver large-scale, green energy without being visual intrusive like its onshore cousin. It also likes the fact offshore wind can create hundreds of visible new jobs, such as the 500-plus which are being created on Humberside, with the new Siemens turbine blade plant. The Government has consented to over \£310bn worth of projects by 2020. However It wants to see cost reductions of at least 30% and further contracts will depend on how successful this cost cutting is. One surprising U-turn, which has not gone down well, was the decision to axe the \£31bn available to the White Rise Carbon Capture and Storage project in Yorkshire, but this seems to fit in with the Government narrative of cutting subsides for all, but its favoured low-carbon options. This point was highlighted by prominent clean energy advocate Matthew Taylor, director of the GreenAlliance. He said: ""The Government needs to urgently address questions about the future of solar, onshore wind and energy efficiency, ""It (Mr Osborne's speech) did not resolve the glaring inconsistency between the Government's approach to renewables cost competition and its willingness to treat nuclear as a special case. ""But we now have more clarity on the principles this government aspires to for a secure, low carbon energy system: competition, cost discipline and innovation. ""We can work with that to get a more sustainable energy system, particularly as we now have a longer term frame for decision making to 2025. And we have a strong signal that the Government is in the market for new policy ideas on heat and demand side action. ""Most importantly, it starts to resolve the politics, which has been at the heart of the problem the past few months. The negotiation in advance of the speech required the PM and the chancellor to agree on the coal and offshore wind decisions. In doing so, they are now out of reverse gear on energy policy and heading in roughly the right direction."" Phil Taylor, professor of electrical power systems and director of the institute for sustainability at Newcastle University, says 'there is much to be welcomed,' in the latest announcements but went on to say 'gaps still exist in terms of a real transition to a low carbon future'. He wants to see some of the new innovation money spent on cost-effective, large-scale energy storage systems. ""Whilst it is positive to see that the Government is moving away from the high polluting coal-based model that has formed the basis of the UK's energy provision to date, it is essential that investment is now made in a sustainable, modern infrastructure, to tackle the inefficiencies in our energy sector and reduce energy usage. ""Whilst concerns have been raised about how secure renewable sources can be, there has been a failure to recognise the huge benefits electrical energy storage could bring. ""Capturing energy from renewable technology - biomass, wind or solar for example - would enable stored energy to be sold back to the grid at times of greatest demand. It also provides localised balancing services to alleviate distribution network congestion. ""The UK needs to play a key role in shaping the decarbonisation of the global economy, and should not shy away from taking a lead domestically on this matter,"" he said. It recently emerged that the UK is no longer on track to hit its renewable targets and this new direction for energy policy is to focus on hitting decarbonisation targets by deploying the lower carbon and zero carbon options of gas and nuclear. Consequently the result of months of policy upheaval by the first Conservative energy minister for 20 years is a more pragmatic approach to UK energy policy. This new direction, one which recognise the frailties of an electricity system based on intermittent renewables, will instead focus on security of supply and keeping prices down.

""The Paris Agreement is a monumental triumph for people and our planet,"" said Mr. Ban in a tweet, immediately following its adoption. ""It sets the stage for progress in ending poverty, strengthening peace and ensuring a life of dignity and opportunity for all."" Gaveling the Agreement with a green hammer, the French Foreign Minister and President of COP21 Laurent Fabius announced the historic news-a moment greeted with loud applause and cheers, as the room stood up. Many delegates hugged, while others had tears in their eyes. For the first time today, 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)-pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and joined to take common climate action. This followed two weeks of tireless negotiations at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ). ""In the face of an unprecedented challenge, you have demonstrated unprecedented leadership,"" the UN chief said taking the COP21 stage just minutes later. ""You have worked collaboratively to achieve something that no one nation could achieve alone. This is a resounding success for multilateralism."" Recalling that he made climate change one of the defining priorities of his tenure as Secretary-General, Mr. Ban said that most of all, he has listened to people - the young, the poor and the vulnerable, including indigenous peoples, from every corner of the globe. ""They seek protection from the perils of a warming planet, and the opportunity to live in a safer, more bountiful world,"" he underlined. ""They have demanded that world leaders act to safeguard their well-being and that of generations to come."" Turning to the agreement itself, the Secretary-General said negotiators reached ""solid results on all key points,"" with an agreement that demonstrates solidarity and ""is ambitious, flexible, credible and durable."" ""All countries have agreed to hold global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. And recognizing the risk of grave consequences, you have further agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees,"" he announced. In addition, a review mechanism has been established whereby every five years, beginning in 2018, Parties will regularly review what is needed in line with science. ""Governments have agreed to binding, robust, transparent rules of the road to ensure that all countries do what they have agreed across a range of issues,"" Mr. Ban added. Meanwhile, highlighting the role of the private sector, the UN chief said business leaders came to Paris in unprecedented numbers and that ""powerful"" climate solutions are already available while many more are to come. ""With these elements in place, markets now have the clear signal they need to unleash the full force of human ingenuity and scale up investments that will generate low-emissions, resilient growth,"" he said, adding that ""what was once unthinkable has now become unstoppable."" ""When historians look back on this day, they will say that global cooperation to secure a future safe from climate change took a dramatic new turn here in Paris,"" Mr. Ban stated. ""Today, we can look into the eyes of our children and grandchildren, and we can finally say, tell them that we have joined hands to bequeath a more habitable world to them and to future generations."" Ending his remarks, the UN chief said that all Parties should be proud of the Paris Agreement and that ""the work starts tomorrow."" ""For today, congratulations again on a job well done,"" he concluded. ""Let us work together, with renewed commitment, to make this a better world."" Addressing the hundreds of delegates, Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, said ""we did it in Paris."" ""We have made history together. It is an agreement of conviction. It is an agreement of solidarity with the most vulnerable. It is an agreement of long-term vision, for we have to turn this agreement into an engine of safe growth,"" she exclaimed. Several other top UN officials joined the Secretary-General in welcoming the new Agreement. This included the President of the UN General Assembly, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft. ""Today's agreement signals nothing less than a renaissance for humankind as we collectively embrace the global challenge of climate change and endeavor to transition to a more sustainable way of living that respects the needs of people and our planet,"" Mr. Lykketoft said in a statement. Echoing this message, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Oh Joon, said the world has reached a key milestone in collective action for sustainable development. ""Bold action against climate change will contribute to poverty reduction. The United Nations Economic and Social Council will take part in follow-up efforts,"" he added. Earlier today, at a meeting of the Committee of Paris [Comite de Paris]-the body which is overseeing the negotiations at COP21 -the UN chief spoke alongside the President of France, Francois Hollande as well Minister Fabius. ""The end is in sight. Let us now finish the job. The whole world is watching. Billions of people are relying on your wisdom,"" the Secretary-General had told delegates. In an emotional address during which he held back tears, Laurent Fabius said the agreement ""will serve meaningful causes, food safety and security, public health, the fight against poverty and for essential rights, and therefore peace."" ""People worldwide, our citizens, our children, wouldn't understand if we didn't adopt it and wouldn't forgive us,"" he insisted. ""It is rare to be given the opportunity to change the world,"" said President Francois Hollande, wrapping up the meeting. ""You have the opportunity to do that."" \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK36","IEA warns 2015 as the turning point for coal demand","December 22, 2015 Tuesday 03:12 PM GMT","IHS Fairplay Daily News","2015 may be the turning point for the coal market as Chinese demand shrinks, warned Fatih Birol, executive director of International Energy Agency (IEA). The coal market has been much linked to China's power generation demand which Birol described the relationship as ""coal and china go hand in hand"". This assessment is based on the fact that China has been the focus of the world's coal demand over the past decade. Data from IEA shows that China alone is responsible for 80% of the rise in coal use since 2000 and currently the country accounts half of the global use for the commodity. However, changes in this proportion are expected. ""We think that after experiencing ten years of relentless growth and a slowdown in 2014, the coal market has declined in 2015 for the first time."" said Birol in the recent IEA coal medium-term market report event, held in Singapore. In his opinion, the coal market after 2015 will either enter into a flat period or descend into a sliding market trend. The weakness of China's coal demand may indirectly impact the bulk shipping market which is hit by overcapacity, resulting in low freight rates. However, Birol observed the declining freight rates form a stronger correlation with the low oil prices and shipping glut rather than by demand of one commodity such as coal. There are also other telling signs on the future weak demand in coal. For instance, coal is currently priced at a decade-low due to the oversupply situation, prompting mass layoffs in the industry. Despite these signs, Birol believes that coal will still play an important role in the global energy mix, accounting for over 40% of the world's electricity generation and remains crucial for countries' economic and social development today. On the down side, the commodity has produced nearly 50% of the carbon dioxide emission of the world that acts as the chief source of air pollution in many countries. As a result, Birol predicted that coal market will face bigger challenges in moving forward. He highlighted that the rising concerns over pollution may reduce the coal usage and demand by 2020. Moreover, the shifts in policy landscape after the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) has indicated a push towards renewables that may again undermine coal usage for power generation. However, Birol explained that the participating 195 countries at COP 21 agreed by consensus, aim at a global pact against emission reduction rather than any particular energy product. ""In COP21 , the listed problem is not against coal or other energy usage. The identified problem is on emission,"" he clarified. Carlos Fern\'e1ndez Alvarez, senior coal analyst from IEA, thinks that technological improvement in carbon capture may be the key for coal demand in the future. ""It is important to use Carbon Capture and Storage for coal, so that we can use [coal] energy at competitive prices without harming the environment,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has initiated a series of projects for electricity generation diversification that may erode coal demand in the near term. According to Birol, there has been an increase in hydro-power plants built in China as well as greater investment in solar energy - China overtook Germany this year to become the number one solar power user in the world. ""There is also a push for nuclear power plants. China today accounts almost half of the construction of new nuclear plants in the world,"" he commented. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK37","Children will bear the brunt of climate change - UNICEF report","November 24, 2015 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","November 24, 2015 More than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million in high drought severity zones, leaving them highly exposed to the impacts of climate change, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in a report released ahead of the 21st United Nations climate change conference , known as COP21 . According to the agency, of the 530 million children in the flood-prone zones, some 300 million live in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty - on less than $ 3.10 a day. Of those living in high drought severity areas, 50 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty. ""The sheer numbers underline the urgency of acting now,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, in a press release. ""Today's children are the least responsible for climate change, but they, and their children, are the ones who will live with its consequences. And, as is so often the case, disadvantaged communities face the gravest threat,"" he continued. Climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions. UNICEF is underlining that these events can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. This can reportedly create a vicious circle according to the agency - a child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. The report, Unless we act now: The impact of climate change on children, finds that the vast majority of the children living in areas at extremely high risk of floods are in Asia, and the majority of those in areas at risk of drought are in Africa. Meanwhile, world leaders gathering in Paris for COP21 - held from November 30 to December 11 - will seek to reach agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which most experts say is critical to limiting potentially catastrophic rises in temperature. ""We know what has to be done to prevent the devastation climate change can inflict. Failing to act would be unconscionable,"" said Mr. Lake. ""We owe it to our children - and to the planet - to make the right decisions at COP21 ."" \"

It's also been over a month since the Size of Wales team were in Paris telling the world about why forests are so important and what Wales is doing in the fight against climate change. Rainforests are vital when it comes to preventing, and responding to, climate change. They are a major carbon sink, absorbing nearly a fifth of the world's man-made CO2 emissions every year. Keeping the world's forests standing, and planting more trees is the most effective and efficient way to tackle climate change. Since 2010 Size of Wales has been helping to fund projects that support communities in Africa and South America who depend on the forest for their livelihood. These projects aim to improve living conditions as well as protecting and managing forests. We were delighted that a global deal was agreed at COP21 , and that real importance was placed on forests, both from governments and businesses. Many Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) included important references to forest conservation. The UK, Norway and Germany have collectively pledged to contribute $5bn for forest conservation. This money will enable developing countries to improve law enforcement against illegal logging and land clearance. But that's only the beginning - now it's time for the hard work, as countries must implement their promises. Following COP21 , we now need to see real action from the international community to keep up the momentum and prove that it is taking this agreement seriously. All countries now need to continue to strive for the targets of the New York Declaration on Forests1, ie. to halve natural forest loss by 2020, and to end it altogether by 2030. We're pleased that an agreement to halt warming to two degrees was made, and glad that countries will push for 1.5 degrees. These goals must be achieved if we want to avoid massive changes to the Earth's climate. One of the countries that is vulnerable to climate change impacts is Uganda, where most of the population depends on agriculture, which again is prone to climate variability. The area has already suffered severe droughts and heavy hail storms in recent years, affecting agricultural yields. Rising temperatures, increased intensity and frequency of rainfall, floods, heatwaves and storms would all have a massive impact on the country. Uganda's Mount Elgon region has been ravaged by deforestation and agricultural expansion, leading to fatal landslides. Size of Wales is supporting the work of Mbale CAP to plant 10 million trees, which will help to improve climate-change resilience. Nearly two million trees have already been planted, and soil stabilisation is being restored thanks to these trees - this should help stop dangerous landslides. In Guyana, Size of Wales has been working with Forest Peoples Programme to support the Wapichan indigenous group. The Wapichan community aims to secure legal title to their customary forests by mapping traditional land and developing plans for forest conservation and sustainable livelihoods. The forests are threatened by deforestation from illegal timber and mineral exploitation. Indigenous groups are the best protectors of forest and were finally recognised as such during COP21 . Over the next five years Size of Wales is planning to double its impact and help to protect an area of tropical forest twice the size of Wales. We hope to help the global effort to protect the world's remaining rainforests - not by locking them up, but by enabling them to be used in a sustainable way by the communities that have depended on them for generations. We hope others will follow our lead. \"

The conference will cover the latest developments in market-based mechanisms to address climate change, carbon trading, climate finance, and low-emission development. Coming just months before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where countries are to adopt a new, universal climate agreement, the LACCF 2015 is an important opportunity for private and public-sector representatives to leverage market and finance opportunities for ambitious and effective climate action in the region. 'As countries are busy preparing and making public their intended contributions to a new universal climate change agreement to be adopted in Paris in December, the Forum offers a golden opportunity to explore the use of market-based mechanisms and approaches to increase emission reduction ambition and stimulate sustainable development now and over the years and decades to come,' said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a co-organizer of LACCF 2015. Aneffective response to climate change requires strong interlinkages between politics, finance, technology and execution strategies. Thus, the three-day event will cover the latest in climate policy, low carbon technology solutions, carbon pricing and climate finance options throughout 8 plenaries,12 thematic workshopsand 4 side events. Different mechanisms and sources that help to support low carbon development goals, provide access to climate finance, and to promote innovation and policies addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation will be discussed. Participants will also explore ways to leverage and scale up private investment in the region and business leaders will learn how to incorporate environmental considerations into their business planning while preparing for future 'clean' opportunities. Furthermore, since achieving clean development requires building the capacity in the public and private sectors to identify, adapt and deploy the most appropriate low carbon technologies, renowned climate change experts from both sectors will highlight the importance of innovation in the energy sector, Climate Smart Agriculture & land use, and transport, among others. As momentum grows for transition to carbon neutral economies, this year's regional carbon forum will also show how individuals, governments and the private sector can spur action through offsetting, featuring achievements of Latin American carbon offset projects, and showcase the experience of those who are already helping to create a climate resilient future.

Protests had begun peacefully, before a group of anarchists, allegedly led by the ""black bloc"" group, started launching projectiles at riot police who responded using batons and teargas. Around 200 arrests were made. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November, a blanket ban has been imposed on demonstrations as part of a new set of emergency powers. French parliament recently voted to extend the state of emergency until late February 2016, which also grants the state the power to impose curfews, conduct warrantless searches, and place individuals deemed a risk to national security under house arrest. Significance: Before the start of the COP21 , security forces placed at least 24 climate activists, accused of planning demonstrations, under house arrest and seized several computers and documents. The pre-emptive detention of activists is giving momentum to the idea that emergency powers are being used to curb the right of assembly in order to suppress dissent. The hashtag ""EtatPolicier"" (PoliceState) began trending on Twitter on Sunday. The fact that other large public congregations such as trade fairs, Christmas markets, and other profitable commercial events, are allowed to go ahead in Paris during the same period is further exacerbating the sense of injustice. As a result, the risk of protest and riots is likely to increase over the coming weeks, particularly in Paris. Protests will be predominantly peaceful, but it is highly likely that there will be violent clashes on the fringes between police and activists, increasing risks to individuals of minor property damage, such as broken shop windows. The risk of violence, and blockades affecting transport infrastructure and cargo, is most likely in the closing days of the climate summit (11-12 December), although the risks will be somewhat mitigated by the presence of over 9,000 armed personnel.

As the UK's first European Green Capital in 2015, Bristol is one of 88 cities and regions in 42 countries to present its ambitious sustainable action projects. A key focus of Bristol's agenda will be to discuss proposed targets for the city to become carbon neutral by 2065. Professor Pancost said: ' COP21 represents the vital next step in solving our greenhouse gas emission and climate change challenges, but the negotiations alone cannot provide all of the solutions. As a society, we will have to cut emissions faster and deeper than our current commitments. Cities are central to this challenge - they will be charged with delivering on pledges and providing leadership and innovation. Academics and scientists are key partners in helping to develop smarter future planning of cities. That is why I am excited to be participating in the Cities Pavilion with Bristol City Council and the Mayor.' Professor Pancost added: 'Our participation is not just about research collaboration, however. I am also representing the University's students, staff and leaders. We are all deeply committed to working with the city and others to address the challenge of climate change.' Other Cabot Institute academics are involved in COP21 . Professor Dave Gordon, from the School for Policy Studies, has signed an academic position statement for COP21 on behalf of the University's Townsend Centre for International Poverty Research. This position statement is being supported by the International Social Science Council (the world's governing body for the social sciences under the auspices of UNESCO) and aims to push the case for socio-political and socio-cultural issues to be given greater consideration in the global sustainability debate. Dr Jo House from the School of Geographical Sciences presented her research on land use and climate at the science-policy interface, and Professor Jonathan Bamber from the Bristol Glaciology Centre spoke on ice-sheet vulnerability at a press conference of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research/Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme and also in a side event for delegates. Dr House commented: 'We have had scientific consensus for a long time. Now we have political consensus, as 157 countries understand the immediate risks to all people of the world, and have come forward with plans to tackle climate change.' Bristol alum Kaia Rose is producing a film for a Climate Countdown web series that follows the people who are crafting paths toward a pivotal global climate change agreement at the COP21 . Professor Pancost will feature in this series. The University of Bristol will be covering COP21 throughout the conference period via the Green Capital website.

The target two degrees campaign calls on people to pledge their support for a worldwide commitment to limit the increase in global warming to 2\'b0C. Insurance Europe said climate change presents a major challenge for mankind and insurers will play a central role in helping society to adapt and mitigate its effects. However, the increasing frequency and severity of natural catastrophes is expected to increase the challenges insurers already face in providing protection to people and businesses throughout Europe. Torbj\'f6rn Magnusson, vice-president of Insurance Europe, commented: ""It has been recognised for some time that the world faces severe consequences from climate change if the global temperature rises by more than two degrees. The aim of this campaign is to increase support for this ambitious target, which we hope will be agreed by world leaders at COP21 ."" [ COP21 is the United Nations climate change conference in Paris taking place at the end of November]. Europe's insurers are encouraging everyone to pledge their support, from policymakers and insurance industry leaders to the general public. To do this, people are asked to sign-up on the target two degrees website then post pictures of themselves on social media holding a pledge card, which is downloadable from the web page demonstrating their support to the cause, using the hashtag #target2degrees. Magnusson added: ""Climate change is an issue that affects everyone and everything on the planet. That's why it is important for everyone to make their voice heard, because the more people show their support, the more policymakers are likely to listen and take action.""

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK49","-Ecoppia Agreement to Deploy Its Robotic Technology to 40 MW PV Site for EDF RE and Arava Ahead of COP21","December 4, 2015 Friday","ENP Newswire","PARIS-In time for the kick-off of the UN conference on climate change , Ecoppia has inked a deal to retrofit a 40 MW PV solar site jointly owned by EDF RE and Arava Power with its autonomous and waterless robotic cleaning solution. The agreement is significant because it lends increasing commercial clout to a technology that is disrupting the solar energy business. Dirt and dust cover (soiling, in industry speak) on solar panels are a significant challenge and can decrease energy output by up to 40%. Existing solutions - oftentimes labourers with water and brushes - can damage panels, use huge amounts of water and be cost-inefficient. Ecoppia provides a solution in the form of autonomous, waterless robots that are managed through the cloud and clean panels every night after production stops. 'It's the next step for the solar industry,' says Eran Meller, CEO of Ecoppia. 'We're seeing significant value creation in all the projects we're currently involved in, both here in the Middle East and in India. For many of the big industry players, a solution that can clean panels nightly, can respond instantly to weather and is waterless - we feel solutions like ours have the potential to become the industry standard.' The site is among the largest solar parks in the Middle East and is located in Southern Israel's Arava Valley - next to the Jordanian border and 20 and 60 miles from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The cleaning technology is so promising that Meller has been asked by Israel to attend COP21 as part of a special delegation of green technology companies from Israel. 'It's very exciting to see the progress Ecoppia is making in terms of winning large clients - it's because of promising technology like theirs that we believe Israel has a bright future in the International Solar Industry and why Ecoppia was chosen to take part in a side event on 'Israeli Innovation in response to climate change'. This special event which the Government of Israel has organized together with Israel Green Energy Association, is part of the COP21 ,' said Ron Adam, the permanent representative of Israel to IRENA (The International Renewable Energy Agency). About Ecoppia Ecoppia is dedicated to maximizing solar park value creation by increasing output and lowering production overhead. The company's autonomous, water-free, field-proven solar array cleaning solution cost-effectively keeps photovoltaic panels at peak performance, even in the toughest desert conditions, cleaning 5 million solar panels every month. Privately-held, Ecoppia is backed by experienced major international investment funds and led by energy and robotics experts, with broad and multidisciplinary experience and proven records of success in operations, management, engineering and product development.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK50","Last chance COP21","December 4, 2015","Utility Week","The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP21 , currently meeting in Paris, is deemed to be a make or break summit in the global effort to tackle and limit the impact of climate change. Following the failure to secure a binding agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, the need for action on greenhouse gas emissions is becoming acute. A report last year by the World Bank Group said that the globe had seen warming of 0.8C since pre-industrial times, and that with the emissions already released into the atmosphere, a warming of 1.5C has been ""locked in"". With global warming of less than 2C generally seen as a sufficient to avoid dangerous climate change impacts, the need to reduce current emissions to ensure this limit is not breached is pressing. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has warned of ""dire consequences"" if the 2C limit is surpassed, and that with current emissions rates, the globe is heading towards a 6C temperature increase. French president Francois Hollande and Pope Francis are among those who have labelled COP21 a ""last chance"" to save the world from the worst that climate change threatens. It is hoped COP21 The big issues With more than 190 nations represented at COP21 , some key points will have to be addressed before a legally binding deal on climate change can emerge on 11 December. Carbon reduction vs economic growth \~With coal remaining cheap, and developing nations seeking low-cost ways of generating electricity, weaning them off high carbon fuels will be difficult. A number of these nations take the view that they should be allowed to develop and press ahead, much as the wealthier nations have done. Financial assistance \~One of the key things to emerge from COP15 in Copenhagen was the pledge for financial help from the richer nations to those less able to fund expensive low-carbon technology. This emerged as the $100 billion (\£366 billion) annual Green Climate fund after COP16 in Mexico. Talks in Paris will look to reassure those developing nations set to benefit from this fund that the commitment will be met in full. \~The poorer nations will also seek for this pledge - or something similar - to be extended beyond 2020, but the debate will be over how this should be done. A legally binding target \~After the failed attempts in Copenhagen in 2009, the aim of COP21 is clear: to agree legally binding climate change and greenhouse gas reduction targets. The disputes will be around the degree to which targets are voluntary or mandatory. How the targets are split will also be up for debate. Some countries have already set out their targets (see below): What we already know \~\~The EU will cut its emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. \~The US will cut its emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2025 compared with 2005 levels. \~China will agree that its emissions in 2030 will be its peak, and will fall thereafter. COP 21 Key players USA As the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, the US will play a key role in the climate change talks and whether a binding agreement can be reached. While President Obama is a champion of cutting carbon, he narrowly lost a crucial vote in the senate in November when key pillars of his tough new climate regulations were blocked. This will weaken his negotiating hand in Paris. China China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases, driven by the rapid expansion of its economy in recent years, largely fuelled by coal-fired power stations. President Xi Jinping heads into the Paris talks on the back of a pledge that China will cut its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65 per cent from 2005 levels, increase its share of non-fossil fuel generation to about 20 per cent by 2030, which is when it also aims to peak its CO2 emissions. Despite the pledges, there is scepticism as to whether they will be honoured. India India is the third-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, but the country's environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, has said it will not bow into pressure from the developed nations during the Paris talks. He told Indian newswire IANS the country ""would not be bullied into accepting the position of developed countries"". India is dependent on coal for most of its electricity needs and has said it would reject a deal to phase out fossil fuels by 2100. Germany The Germans will play a key role in the talks as the major European economy. Karsten Sach, Germany's head negotiator, has already highlighted the government is looking for legally binding climate targets for all countries. Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledges the culpability of developed nations when it comes to climate change and says they should develop efficient low carbon technologies to help poorer countries reduce their emissions. UK The UK government has continually called for ""bold action"" on climate change, however the government has slashed renewbles subsidies. The UK is also is predicted to fall short of its EU obligation to get 15 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020. France French president Francois Hollande insists the summit will produce a legally binding climate change deal. He has ruled out the option of a treaty, similar to that agreed at COP15 in Copenhagen, and is keen to secure a Kyoto-style agreement. Hollande is also a proponent of the more developed countries driving low-carbon and energy-efficient technologies. Russia Historically, Russian president Vladimir Putin has sat firmly in the climate change sceptic camp, even saying in 2003 that climate change means Russians ""spend less on fur coats"". Oil and gas is also a significant part of the country's economy, with exports to Europe, with gas generating about half of its electricity. However, this stance may be softening, and Russia has pledged to cut emissions by a quarter, to 30 per cent of 1990 levels by 2030. \"

Speaking on behalf of the International Insurance Society(IIS) and the International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation(ICMIF) on the opening day of the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris(COP2!), an annual forum to address climate change on a global political level, McGavick told world leaders: ""I am pleased to be able to highlight our industry's enthusiasm for the potential of the A2R framework. As we work urgently to prepare the world's people for the impacts of climate change, it is obvious that much of the resilience work ahead is right in our industry's wheelhouse. Today, far too few of the world's people benefit from the resilience offered by risk sharing and transfer schemes. Our industry funds scientific research and works with governments to adopt advanced building codes and land use practices. Our products increasingly replace failing infrastructure with sustainable solutions, including efforts to use natural ecosystems where man made weather defences fall short. We also create products to accelerate the financial viability of alternative energy. I offer my personal commitment to work with you to ensure that the best of what our industry can offer is brought forward."" McGavick also announced that the insurance industry will join policymakers in the launch of an initiative to reduce the impact of natural disasters and climate change in emerging markets. The initiative, called the Insurance Development Forum, will be co-chaired by XL Catlin's executive deputy chairman Stephen Catlin. McGavick said ""The forum is a joint effort of partners such as the UNDP, the World Bank and member governments, who will convene adjacent to next year's IMF-World Bank Spring meetings and UN General Assembly. It is hoped this forum can help accelerate A2R efforts.""

The website showcases the scope of this mobilization under the Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), which brings both state and non-state actors together on the global stage to accelerate cooperative climate action now and into the future in support of the new agreement. The Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4All) is the lead organization for the action area on Energy Access and Efficiency under the LPAA, and is co-organising the thematic Energy Day during COP 21 . Cooperative climate action is essential for the international community to keep the global average temperature rise below 2-degreeC degrees, the internationally-agreed defense line against the worst impacts of climate change. On this website more initiatives are being added and will be added as information is gathered from the many groups which have come together to take cohesive and concrete climate action. The action areas covered are agriculture, forest, transport, renewable energy, energy access and efficiency, resilience, cities and sub-nationals, private finance, business, innovation, building and short-term pollutants. The website complements the Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (NAZCA) launched last year at the UN climate change conference in Lima by the COP 20 Presidency of Peru together with the UN, which registers individual and cooperative commitments to action by companies, cities, subnational regions, and investors to address climate change.

With this pledge, Avery Dennison is joining more than 140 companies who have voiced support for a strong outcome at the United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Paris from November 30 to December 11 and have underscored their commitment to reducing emissions from their operations. 'Signing the pledge was an easy decision because we're already doing the things that the pledge asked of us,' said Dean Scarborough, Avery Dennison's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 'We unequivocally support an agreement coming out of Paris that takes a strong step toward a low-carbon future. We are cutting our own carbon emissions and taking additional measures to tackle climate change.' The full text of Avery Dennison's pledge reads as follows: We applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for climate action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters and the health of the global environment. We put forth our pledges as follows: Building on a 2009 pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, indexed to net sales, by 15% from 2005 to 2015, Avery Dennison pledges to: Reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by at least 3% annually, and by at least 26% overall, between 2015 and 2025. Eliminate deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities by 2020, in alignment with the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests. Purchase 100% of our paper from certified sources by 2025. Purchase at least 70% of our paper from FSC-certified sources by 2025. Develop long-term business plans that align with the deep decarbonization necessary to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2-degreeC. Scarborough will speak in Paris next week as part of the Sustainable Innovation Forum, which will run concurrently with the COP21 climate talks. Avery Dennison supports an agreement that will cut emissions enough to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Scarborough said his company supports strong and immediate efforts to curb emissions for reasons both ethical and commercial. 'Climate change is an imminent global threat that demands urgent action from all segments of society-including business- while we still have time to act,' he said. 'It poses risks to people, communities, ecosystems and, obviously, our business. Responding to climate change by reducing emissions is, above all, a moral imperative. It's consistent with our company's ethics and guiding principles. And if we want to stay in business for the long term, then addressing the risks posed by climate change is simply sound strategy.'

The template of energy performance contract (EPC) will indicate important conditions of the agreement between a building owner and contractor who is retrofitting the building with energy efficient features, reported Channelnewsasia.com. The BCA and SGBC said that this is for ensuring 'building owners can better focus on the critical component in any EPC: The amount of energy savings guaranteed'. In an EPC template, a firm will have to specify the energy savings of a building over a certain period of time. These savings could be shown either in terms of monetary benefits or as a percentage, reported Channelnewsasia.com. This template complements BCA's Building Retrofit Energy Efficiency Financing (BREEF) programme, which provides financing options to building owners, EPC firms, Management Corporation Strata Titles (MCSTs), and special purpose vehicles for retrofits to bolster energy efficiency. The regular template will be available from SGBC by early next year. All the EPC firms that have been certified under Singapore Green Building Services labelling programme of SGBC will also use the contract for their building projects. Singapore had become one of the 18 nations to sign a pact at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris, to accelerate efforts to reduce emissions in the buildings and construction sector, reported Straitstimes.com. It had signed up the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction in Paris. It is estimated that if the buildings and construction sector embraces innovative technologies, it can cut down approximately 3.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050. \"

The UN health agency is attributing these deaths to shifting patterns of disease from extreme weather events - such as heat-waves and floods - and from the degradation of air quality, food and water supplies, and sanitation. ""The upcoming United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris offers the world an important opportunity to not only reach a strong international climate agreement, but also to protect the health of current and future generations,"" WHO stressed in a press release, adding that the agreement would have the potential to save lives worldwide. In 2012, the agency estimated 7 million people died from air pollution-related diseases, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 25 000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will reportedly be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps. Highlighting that not only are ways to combat climate change already known and well-documented, WHO said they can bring important health gains. As its new series of climate change and health country profiles illustrate, investments in low-carbon development, clean renewable energy, and strengthening climate resilience, are also investments in health. ""Implementing proven interventions to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane, for example achieving higher vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, would be expected to save approximately 2.4 million lives a year and reduce global warming by about 0.5\'b0C by 2050,"" the agency reported. In addition, placing a price on polluting fuels to compensate their negative health impacts would be expected to cut outdoor air pollution deaths by half, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 20 per cent, and raise approximately US$ 3 trillion per year in revenue - over half the total value of health spending by all of the world's governments. WHO is also insisting that strengthening health resilience to climate risks, including measures such as early-warning systems for more frequent and severe heatwaves, and protection of water, sanitation, and hygiene services against floods and droughts, would ensure that recent progress against climate-sensitive diseases, is not slowed or reversed. ""Nevertheless, the profound consequences for health are still not given sufficient attention in debates about climate change,"" it warned. In preparation for COP21 , formally the 21st Meeting of the States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), WHO indicated that countries have made important commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions and scale up adaptation to climate change, but more needs to be done. ""If countries take strong actions to address climate change, while protecting and promoting health, they will collectively bring about a planet that is not only more environmentally intact, but also has cleaner air, more abundant and safer freshwater and food, more effective and fairer health and social protection systems - and as a result, healthier people,"" the press release concluded. It further highlighted that the conference ""is the time for the health community to lend their voice to the international climate discussion and ask countries to come together and make bold commitments to protect our planet and the health of current and future generations.""

Barry Parkin, global sustainability director at Mars, said the company sourced much of its supply chain of products, from cocoa to sugar, mint and vanilla, from smallholder farmers who are threatened by rising temperatures. ""We're a food company, based on agriculture, and when you look at agriculture, we buy from the equivalent of about a million farmers, and most of those farmers, large numbers of them, are smallholder family farmers in the developing world, who are often subsistence farming, and they are the most vulnerable,"" he said.

Speaking at the high level opening, President Yayi Boni of Benin, was resolute that the Africa is not at the negotiating table with a begging bowl. He told the audience at the Africa high level event marking the launch of the Africa Pavilion that ""Africa did not come here ( COP21 ) to beg for money or assistance but to bring about commitment of all concerned to Africa's adaptation needs"" ""The adaptation and mitigation needs of the continent are not aid"" President Boni said, but an equity issue because climate change is a global phenomenon not caused by Africa. ""The time to act is now"" he said ""the house is burning."" In Africa, climate change constitutes a major threat to the continent's development, and has major implications and impacts on African economies. Climate extremes such as drought, flooding, heat waves and tropical cyclones are intensifying in frequency and intensity. Rising sea levels will threaten Africa's large coastal population with agriculture, tourism, cities, water levels, health, energy and fisheries all likely to be impacted by the adverse impacts of climate change. COP 21 marks a decisive stage in negotiations of the future international agreement on climate change. The high level panel at the official opening constituted the African Heads of State and Government, African Parliamentarians and the principals of the four pan-African institutions namely: the African Union Commission, (AUC); the African Development Bank, (AfDB); the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA); and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). ""Africa's message for this Summit is clear: we need a legally binding agreement with a global governance framework, applicable to all parties that balances the issues of adaptation, mitigation, provide adequate finance as well as technology development and transfer. The new Agreement must commit to reduction of greenhouse emissions to achieve well below 2 degree Celsius, ensure the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, social justice, equity and African must speak with one unified voice"", African Union Commission Chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urged the high level dignitaries. The Chairperson also noted the fact that Africa's commitment to define African development path for the next 50 years in Agenda 2063: The Africa we Want as a sustainable and low carbon path. ""Through Agenda 2063 we want to ensure not only that we mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also do so in a manner that build African capacities, researches, institutions and most importantly - whether it is in agriculture and agro-processing or in renewable energy - to ensure that these initiatives contribute towards development on the continent, creating the much needed livelihoods and jobs for our young people and women"", she emphasized. (The complete speech of the Chairperson is available on au.int. Mr. Adesina Akinwumi, President of the African Development Bank stressed that "" COP21 can only be considered successful if it meets the needs of our continent. Africa is the continent suffering the most from the scotching heat from rising temperatures and droughts have become more frequent and with greater intensity than ever before. Africa needs more money for adaptation. The continent has been short changed by climate change. But we must ensure that it is not short changed by climate finance. AfDB will triple its climate finance to $ 5 billion a year by 2020."" While the CEO of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA), Dr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, commended the collaborative approach of the four institutions for providing leadership in setting up the Africa Pavilion. The institutions should continue to work together in promoting Africa's socio-economic development. He emphasized that ""Africa must continue to advocate for an agreement that reaffirms the obligations of developed country Parties for the provision of climate finance which is additional, predictable and sustainable, with the agreement providing for a continuous assessment of scale of funding needed compared to climate finance available, particularly from public sources, and include a clear burden-sharing process for calculating the contributions to be made by developed country parties"". In Africa, renewable energy systems offer an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate the transition to modern energy services and to increase energy access. This has a ripple effect on job creation, women empowerment and economic development. This was reinforced by Mr. Carlos Lopes, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) who said Africa is well endowed with all forms of renewable energy resources - hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and even marine energy. ""Yet, today we are in a situation where the total installed electricity capacity in Africa is only about 160 gigawatts. By comparison, this is just over half of Japan's installed capacity. If we take out North Africa and South Africa, the installed capacity in the rest of Africa is less than that of South Africa. Given the abundant renewable energy resources of Africa, the energy mix of the continent is still dominated by fossil fuels (gas, coal and oil), with renewables making only 22% of the installed capacity, dominated by hydropower."" During the event, the African Renewable Energy Initiative, a transformative, Africa-owned and Africa-led inclusive effort to accelerate and scale up the harnessing of the continent's huge renewable energy potential was presented by Dr. Khaled Al Fahmy, Minister of Environment of Egypt and President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).

We believe the COP21 agreement will do little to change this fact over the next five years with governments remaining less inclined to address failing emissions strategies until after 2020. This is most obvious in policies concerning electric vehicles (EVs). Most developed nations and key developing nations, such as China and India, have announced ambitious EV stock targets by 2020 or sooner yet have failed to make the necessary progress towards these goals. For example, China will likely fail to reach its goal of having 0.5mn EVs on the road by end-2015 and we remain sceptical on its goal of achieving 5mn EVs by 2020. Germany with only 18,948 pure EVs and 107,800 hybrid vehicles, most of which are conventional hybrids, will also likely fail to reach its goal of 1,000,000 electrified vehicles on the road by 2020. Similarly, India's overly ambitious goal of having 6-7mn electrified cars on the roads by 2020, looks close to impossible with an EV stock of just 2,689 vehicles in 2014 according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Thus, we believe governments have stuck to transport emissions reduction proposals that are largely in line with previous rhetoric and policies on the subject. As such, we don't see any sharp changes in transport emissions-related policies over the next five years. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK70","""If we take action now, we can address climate change and build a sustainable future"" - Janos Pasztor","November 26, 2015 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","November 26, 2015 Just days away from the kick-off of the 21st United Nations climate change conference - widely known as COP21 - the UN is reminding its main actors that this conference must be a turning point for climate action. Beginning on Monday in France's capital, Paris, world leaders will be negotiating a new climate change agreement that aims to keep global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) - beyond which climate experts say there will be irreversible impacts. The two-week conference, the 21st Meeting of the States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also aims to send a loud and clear signal to citizens, markets and the private sector that the transformation of the global economy is inevitable, beneficial, and already under way. To find out more about COP21 and the UN's expectations, the UN News Centre met with Janos Pasztor, the UN Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change. Since January, Mr. Pasztor's work has focused on supporting efforts towards a new climate agreement and mobilizing global climate action on the ground. Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change. UN News Centre: What is the importance of the upcoming 21st United Nations climate change conference - COP21 ? Janos Pazstor: There are at least two major points. First of all, if we have a good agreement it will allow us to move towards a low-carbon, low-emission future, where there are lots of opportunities for new technology developments and new ways of organizing ourselves. That is an opportunity we must take. Secondly, climate change is already happening. The impacts are already visible. If we take action now, we can address climate change as we move toward a low-emission economy and build a sustainable future. The more we delay, the more we will pay. UN News Centre: Why do we need to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius? Janos Pazstor: If we allow warming to go beyond that, scientists tell us there are likely to be potential irreversible impacts on people, on natural ecosystems, and therefore, on the economies of the world. Now the 2 degrees is not a very hard level. Many are saying that it actually has to be much less than 2 degrees for the small island developing countries whose land might become completely inundating with a sea level rise. Already 2 degrees is way too much. So, it must be remembered that when we talk of 2 degrees, it is the maximum. It must be kept as much as possible below that. [embedded content] 10 Things You Need to Know About COP21 . Credit: United Nations UN News Centre: What is the best outcome possible from COP21 ? Janos Pazstor: We are expecting a package of outcomes and it will have four elements - they're interrelated but they're different. The first one will be the national plans for climate change of each country, for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Those are plans that are developed ""bottom up"" by the countries - this is what they can do. The second element will be the actual agreement. It will contain the rules of the game on how countries will assess the impact of the totality of the national plans on the objective to keep warming below 2 degrees. And then they will review and assess what it takes to raise the ambition to make sure that we keep below those 2 degrees of global warming. That will be the core of that agreement. The third part is climate finance. All of this will require financing, public and private finance, and there will be some parts of this package of finance that will go into the agreement. And the fourth is the action agenda - a collection of actions on the ground to do either mitigation or adaption, and it's to demonstrate that it's already possible, it's already happening and to showcase what are the good partnerships between private sector, public sector and civil society to actually do the work on the ground. UN News Centre: What are the main challenges ahead? If we take action now, we can address climate change as we move toward a low-emission economy and build a sustainable future. The more we delay, the more we will pay. Janos Pazstor: The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement. That's the bottom line. And we have very little time. In fact, the last negotiation week finished recently in Bonn [Germany]. What we now have left in terms of formal negotiation time is only that period during the actual Conference of the Parties [COP] in Paris, the first two weeks of December. UN News Centre: Can you give us an overview of key issues that are left to be negotiated - what different countries are claiming? Janos Pazstor: There are quite a few of those and the most important one seems to be related to what is referred to as the differentiation - the differentiation between the developed and developing countries. Some countries would like no formal differentiation and they would like all rules to apply to everybody, every country, with maybe a certain flexibility to reflect the capacities of different countries. [embedded content] Interview with Janos Pasztor, UN Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change. Credit: United Nations Other countries would like to maintain the existing grouping of countries in the Convention to developed and developing countries, and then have rules that refer to these different groups. So that's quite important because it has implications, not just on the conceptual issue of having divisions like that, but in terms of financing. But there are other challenges - such as climate finance. Developed countries have committed to providing $ 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 to developing countries. The $ 100 billion doesn't have to be on the table in Paris, but what does need to be on the table is a politically credible mobilization trajectory towards this $ 100 billion. Some progress was made in October, but there is still work to do and there are still announcements that hopefully will be made by some countries. So these are just two examples of difficult issues that still need to be resolved but there are others as well. UN News Centre: You mentioned the last round of negotiations in Bonn. What came out of those discussions? Janos Pazstor: What we have is a document that has grown in size. While the actual size doesn't matter - what matters is the content - clearly the longer the text, the more time it takes to negotiate and that's our biggest challenge. The text is some 55 pages long and it will take some time to go through the different elements. What we ended up with at the Bonn negotiation is that countries added into the original draft which was much shorter - specific things that they wanted to see in the final text and there wasn't enough time to negotiate all that in Bonn. So we still have lots of options in there and those will still need to be negotiated both in informal discussions and during COP21 . UN News Centre: What is the significance of COP21 in light of the new 2030 Development Agenda, and how predominantly does climate change figure in it? Janos Pazstor: The new Sustainable Development Agenda-or Agenda 2030 - is extremely important for the implementation of the climate agreement. First, we have a goal - Goal 13 - which focuses on climate change. But what the other goals are even more important. There are 12 goals [out of 17] that have very specific climate related targets on energy, on forests, on food security, on education - these are all things that will feed into successfully implementing the climate agreement. The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement. But what is really important is that if we don't achieve the 2 degree objective, then none of the Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved. And in order to achieve the less than 2 degree objective, we need to do all the things that are in the Sustainable Development Goals. That's the challenge but that is the beauty: these two different processes that are negotiated through separate processes are now coming together at the level of implementation. And this is where the UN system has a very important role also, because we are there to support Member States to help them to address these issues in a coherent and integrated way. UN News Centre: Just days ahead of COP21 , what is your message to world leaders? UN News Centre: What do you want to convey to the public? Janos Pazstor: Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change - all of us. We are all responsible for what we do in our daily lives - how we vote, how we engage, how we run our companies, how we run our civil society organizations. We all need to be conscious of this, and we all need to do our part. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK71","Indigenous peoples' voices must be heard at Paris climate change conference, UN agency says","November 19, 2015 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","November 19, 2015 Indigenous peoples own, occupy or manage up to 65 per cent of the Earth's land surface, yet they have largely been excluded from national plans prepared for next month's United Nations climate change conference in Paris, according to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which is working to address the issue. Together with the International Indigenous Peoples' Forum on Climate Change, UNDP is bringing indigenous leaders and high-level government officials together, often for the first time, to ensure that the priorities of indigenous peoples, whose lands are often seized for intensive greenhouse gas-emitting development, are embedded in national proposals for the conference, widely known as COP21 . ""This pioneering initiative, underway in 21 countries around the world, aims to ensure that the global climate agreement reached in Paris recognizes indigenous land and natural resource rights, and the crucial role of indigenous peoples in climate change mitigation,"" UNDP said in a news release. It highlighted research showing that secure rights to indigenous and community-held land protect against deforestation, which with other land uses represents 11 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change. It noted that a review by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 119 national plans to combat the problem submitted as of last month makes no mention of indigenous peoples. Forests owned and controlled by indigenous peoples and local communities contain about 37.7 billion tons of carbon, 29 times more than the annual emissions of the world' passenger vehicles, according to estimates by the World Resources Institute and Rights and Resources Initiative. But more than 80 per cent of all lands utilized or occupied by indigenous peoples lack legal protection, and are highly vulnerable to being seized by private companies, individuals, and governments themselves, in a non-stop drive toward carbon-intensive investments in agriculture, logging, mining, oil and gas, dams and roads, and tourism. ""The same development that fuels climate change, continues to rob indigenous peoples of their human rights,"" Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, said, stressing the need to protect those right and the traditional knowledge that has kept ecosystems healthy. \"

""I was very encouraged by what I saw and I heard during the opening days of COP21 ,"" he told a news conference at UN Headquarters in New York. ""World leaders did precisely what they were meant to do: give strong impetus to the negotiations. Almost all countries have submitted climate action plans, known as INDCs [Intended Nationally Determined Contributions],"" he said. ""Major economies have made significant commitments to cut emissions. Many developed countries have made new financial commitments to help poor and vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. Philanthropists and entrepreneurs are making exciting new commitments and investments,"" he continued, citing the Breakthrough Energy Coalition announced by Bill Gates. Mr. Ban, who warned some 150 world leaders on the opening day on Monday that they must move much farther and faster to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, is returning to the French capital tonight for COP21Action Day to showcase the huge number of climate partnerships and initiatives involving cities, the private sector, and civil society. Even the sought-after 2-degree rise will have serious consequences for food and water security, economic stability and international peace as climate change unleashes more devastating floods, disastrous droughts and violent cyclones and storms, and rising seas inundate low-lying island States and shorelines where many major cities are located. ""In the global economy, the transition to a low-emissions future is well under way,"" Mr. Ban said today, yet, he stressed that in the negotiating room, ""there is still a lot of work to do. Key issues remain unresolved, and there is not much time left."" ""I continue to press developed countries to recognize their responsibility to take the lead, while urging developing countries to do more in line with their growing capabilities. The world has gone too long without a universal climate agreement that includes all countries as part of the solution. We cannot delay any longer,"" he said. ""There is no perfect agreement. But our goal is clear: an agreement that truly addresses climate change, and puts the world on track for long-term prosperity, stability and peace. That is what the days ahead in Paris can and must deliver,"" noted the UN chief. Turning to the issue of terrorism and the refugee crisis, which has seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans flee to Europe, Mr. Ban said the conflict in Syria was a principal cause, citing plans to launch an initiative in early January involving both intra-Syrian political talks and a nationwide ceasefire. ""Closed doors and discrimination are worsening the plight of forcibly displaced people across the world,"" he said, adding: ""I am especially concerned about misplaced suspicions about migrants and refugees, and widespread anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry."" ""The world must also be united against terrorism. No grievances or cause can justify the atrocious violence we have seen in recent weeks. The world's response needs to be robust, and always within the rule of law and with respect for human rights. We cannot be ruled by fear,"" the Secretary-General stressed.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK73","Military support would ensure speedy government transition in Chad in event of president's death in office","IHS Global Insight"," ","Chadian president Idriss Deby was admitted on 25 November to the American Hospital of Paris. According to an official Chadian government communique, President Deby underwent a routine medical check-up. However, unconfirmed Parisian media sources reported that Deby had been admitted for an emergency operation. This comes after an earlier health scare in April, which had led to speculation in the local media about Deby's health and his ability to govern. The president left the hospital a day later and is due to attend the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) starting today (30 November) in Paris. Significance: President Deby's hospitalisation is likely to continue to fuel speculation about his health, especially in the run-up to the next presidential election scheduled for April 2016. Deby is likely to be the ruling party's candidate in the presidential poll, which he is very likely to win, making his health a critical factor for stability in Chad in the five-year outlook. There is no apparent successor who commands similar loyalty from the major power stakeholders in the country, especially the army and the ruling party. The government currently faces challenges from protests and strikes amid a challenging economic environment caused by a significant drop in government income following a fall in oil revenues, which account for over 70% of government revenues (see Chad: 20 October 2015: Chad's challenging economic environment raises protest risks in one-year outlook, despite new commitments by China ). Other challenges are the threat of terrorist attacks from Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region and an armed rebellion in the northern Tibesti region. Should Deby become incapacitated and unable to govern, a power struggle is likely to ensue between the president's family, with his son General Mahamat Deby the family's likely candidate for succession, and ruling party elites loyal to Haroun Kabadi, president of the National Assembly, who, according to the constitution, is mandated to preside over a transition period. Given the support of the army, Mahamat Deby is likely to win such a struggle, which is unlikely to persist beyond months due to the strength of the security forces vis-a-vis any dissenting groups in the country.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK74","Climate Deal Unlikely To Turn The Tide","December 24, 2015 Thursday","Business Monitor Online","BMI View: A climate change deal was reached at the UN Climate Change Conference (UN COP21 ) in December 2015. However, it is unlikely to have a major impact on halting climate change, owing in part to a lack of legally binding targets for carbon emissions. Being a low lying nation, Tuvalu will therefore continue to face growing climatic changes that will undermine its economic growth prospects and threaten its existence. The devastating impact that Cyclone Pam has inflicted on Tuvalu underscores the vulnerability of the country to ongoing climatic changes that result from global warming ( see '2015 Growth Downgraded On Cyclone Pam', June 29 2015 ). While ongoing rebuilding efforts by the Tuvaluan government, which are supported by its expansionary fiscal policy as well as the outpouring of humanitarian aid by the international community, will help the Tuvaluan economy to rebound modestly over the coming quarters, it nevertheless remains highly susceptible to weather-related disasters, posing immense downside risks to our real GDP growth forecasts for the country. Climate Change Threatens Tuvalu's Existence Tuvalu is a small and very low lying nation, with its highest point only about four metres above the sea level. Rising sea levels threaten the country's coastal resources, cause flooding in low lying areas, and result in salt intrusion that damages arable land and contaminates fresh water supply. In the future, the continued rise in sea levels could submerge Tuvalu, threatening the survivability of the nation. According to some estimates, a rise in the sea level by about 20-40cm could make the Pacific island uninhabitable. Historic Climate Change Agreement Has Been Reached... With the survivability of Tuvalu as well as neighbouring Pacific islands being severely threatened by climatic change, the governments from these countries pushed for stronger action from the international community to limit carbon emissions during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UN COP21 ) that was held in Paris from November 30-December 11 2015. An unprecedented climate deal has been reached between nearly 200 countries in Paris, and the agreement affirms many of the Pacific countries' long-held views with regard to climate change. ...But It Is Unlikely To Have Much Impact On Halting Climate Change However, we believe that the pact is still unlikely to have much of an impact on halting climatic change. While the climate change agreement on December 12 2015 outlines broad targets to reduce carbon emissions, such as limiting global temperature increase 'well below' 2degC, it fails to provide a clear indication of how these targets will actually be met. Most notably, the agreement lacks legally binding targets for CO2 reduction at a global level. It is only partially legally binding and partly voluntary. As such, the efficacy of the UN COP21 deal rests on the individual countries' implementation of climate change policy and financing availability. The lack of legally binding targets for carbon emissions significantly weakens the climate change agreement, which is therefore unlikely to have a significant impact on slowing the rise in temperature, and hence the increase in sea levels. As a result, Tuvalu will continue to face growing climate related challenges that will inevitably weigh on its long-term economic growth prospects and threaten its existence. Poor Business Environment, Fiscal Weakness A Drag On Recovery Efforts In addition to climate change challenges, the country's poor business environment and limited fiscal resources will act as a drag on efforts by the Tuvaluan government to rebuild the nation in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam. Indeed, the country has a severe lack of skilled manpower, while infrastructure weakness has been exacerbated by Cyclone Pam. Its remote geographical location, with poor transportation links for both sea and air, also makes it particularly difficult to gain access to foreign markets. Consequently, the lack of ability to export efficiently to overseas markets and attract foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will continue to place a lid on economic growth over the coming years. The country's small population size of about 11,000 and the limited scope for productivity gains as a result of a lack of a skilled labour force will also cap fiscal revenue growth. In combination with higher government expenditure for infrastructure rebuilding and disaster relief efforts over the coming quarters, Tuvalu's fiscal balance will remain strained. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK77","COP21: the climate case for investing in African livestock?; The economic significance of the African livestock sector grows as demand for livestock products in....","December 11, 2015 Friday 3:08 PM GMT","The Guardian","The potential of extensive livestock systems in African drylands is a topic buzzing in and around the United Nations climate change conference in Paris - COP21 . Livestock trade driven by pastoralism in the Horn of Africa is worth some \£3660m annually, in Burkina Faso and Mali at least \£3120m annually and in Kenya, livestock accounts for about 10% of GDP and about 42% of agricultural GDP. Livestock losses during the 2011 drought in Kenya caused an average growth reduction of 2.8% each year from 2008-2011. If pastoralists - livestock herders - had been able to sell their livestock or access forage and water to keep them alive, these losses could have been avoided and emergency aid reduced in the order of \£3260 savings for every 66p spent on reducing the quantity of stock held - a clear investment case for the public and private sectors alike. There is growing recognition that customary institutions that characterise pastoralism, not least mobility of herders, offer a climate resilient production system for drylands that are increasingly dealing with climate change impacts like drought. For the first time, a wide range of stakeholders are now coming together to find ways to expand opportunities for pastoralists. At Development and Climate Days, the organisation Pathways to Resilience in Semi-Arid Economies (Prise) brought together the private sector, government, civil society and researchers in discussions on unlocking the economic potential of livestock systems for climate resilience with a high-level panel on climate-resilient growth in the drylands. ""Pastoralism is a sustainable enterprise - economically, ecologically and socially,"" said Maryam Niamir- Fuller, former special advisor to the executive director on Post 2015 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), at a session on moving towards sustainable pastoralism and responsible consumption of livestock products organised by United Nations Environment Programme at the Global Landscapes Forum in Paris on Sunday. Governments are making important investments in the livestock sector: building abattoirs, livestock markets and water infrastructure. The private sector is also investing in pastoralist regions. In Kenya, insurance companies and veterinary manufacturers are extending their supply of goods and services to pastoralist regions, finding that pastoralists are willing to pay for products that improve their herds. But barriers to entry are still high for investors. Potential for adaptation The theme across these discussions is that adaption to climate change is synonymous with good development. In Africa's drylands, pastoralists have been marginalised from development for decades and live with climate variability every day; livestock is the most appropriate basis for climate-resilient, inclusive economic development. Adaptation finance and planning offers governments the means to create an enabling environment for a thriving livestock sector. While there appears to be general consensus among UN member states on the need for adaptation finance, there is growing recognition that subnational adaptation planning and finance can be just as important. Adaptation opportunities can be driven forward by appropriate allocation of resources to devolved government, such as counties in Kenya and states in Ethiopia. Climate change offers some development opportunities in these regions, but adaptation finance must be available to those decision makers closest to the ground for these to be realised. Countries in the Horn of Africa are also waking up to the fact that regional cooperation on drought risk management can reduce economic losses and build resilience, in part by supporting investment in markets, infrastructure and human capital. Such investments can put livestock markets on an equal footing with other primary sectors. From discussions in Paris, it is clear that countries in west Africa are keen to learn from the experiences of other regions. Potential for mitigation Livestock often gets a bad rap in emissions discussions. There has been no shortage of sound-bites in the past couple of weeks about the contribution of livestock production to global warming. However, there are few conclusive studies on the carbon and methane footprints of different livestock systems. Failing to recognise the difference in discussions of emissions gives a misleading, and frankly dangerous, picture of the livestock sector. What we do know, is that there is growing and compelling evidence that rangelands can store as much carbon in soils and vegetation as forest, if managed sustainably. Experience from carbon markets in forest ecosystems tells us that communally managed carbon stores are attractive to investors and enhance opportunities for inclusive adaptation and climate adaptation. The SDGs explicitly include pastoralists in the goal to end hunger, ""through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition"". Harnessing the potential of livestock in Africa's drylands sounds as close to a triple win as we are likely to get. Luckily for the world's 200 million pastoralists, politicians, investors and donors are finally beginning to see things the same way.

Renovate America also issued its first green bond securitization last November, which was certified green by Sustainalytics, a sustainability research provider. A subsequent deal issued early this year was also certified green. Braun was confident thatthe platform's position as the only green bond ABS platform in the US securitization space would be a strong selling point for the European market. ""In structured products, there are people who have issued ""~self-certified' green bonds, but in the ABS space, we're the leader,"" said Braun.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK79","COP21: The lowdown","November 30, 2015 Monday","Architects Journal","Five key questions on the Paris climate summit answered What is the purpose of COP21 ? COP21 is shorthand for The 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The framework was originally adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in\~Rio de Janeiro and led to the 1995 Kyoto Protocol, which legally binds developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. COP21 , which is meeting in Paris from today (30 November) to 11 December, aims to produce a new plan - this time including developing countries - to replace the Kyoto agreement when it runs out in 2020. What could it achieve? The 195 convention signatories will vote on the text of a new agreement aimed at keeping global warming below an agreed temperature rise. However, the timescale and level of rise is still to be agreed. All participating governments will also submit 'Nationally Determined Contributions' which will outline how they will reduce their emissions to a level they are happy with. What is the likelihood of success? The experience of 2009's COP15 held in Copenhagen, which failed to reach agreement on a universal agreement, demonstrated the difficulty in negotiating emission reduction targets. The key to achieving agreement will be to achieve wording that addresses the costs of implementation in a way that satisfies both developed and developing countries. In an article on the BusinessGreen website Anthony Hobley, chief executive of the\~Carbon Tracker Initiative, says that adopting a rigid legally binding agreement could be counterproductive. 'It is not unrealistic to contemplate that events and technological developments could change the climate change dynamic quickly,' he says. 'When that happens we do not want to be locked into a legally binding arrangement which lacks the necessary ambition.' What is the role of buildings in creating carbon emissions? Buildings are not specifically mentioned in the draft agreement text, but clearly any agreement to reduce emissions will require the built environment industry to play a huge role. Buildings account for a third of global greenhouse gasses, while commercial and residential buildings make up 40 per cent of the world's energy consumption. In addition, the property sector's importance within the global financial system could help it achieve positive action on investment decisions concerning climate change. Sean Tompkins, chief executive of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), says: 'We are living on a planet where our population is heading to 9 billion where 66 per cent of our future population will live in cities, where land and real estate will account for 70 per cent of the world's wealth. That brings an incredible level of responsibility into the built environment both ensuring that the way we deal with urbanisation is in a sustainable way that maximises the use of our limited resources but also recognising that the built environment is a significant underpin into the financial ecosystem of the world.' How are built environment organisations contributing to the debate around COP21 ? For the first time at a COP, on 3 December a 'Buildings Day' has been organised. At a special event, speakers will discuss the role of buildings in helping fight climate change. The buildings day will also feature the launch of an international 'Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction'\~aimed at increasing collaboration between gathering countries, cities and public and private organizations. Signatories already include RICS, The Prince of Wales's Corporate Leadership Group and the World Green Building Council. HYPERLINK ""http://The UK Green Building Council has also been asking its member companies to make 'climate pledges' ahead of COP on an online wall"" The UK Green Building Council has also been asking its member companies to make 'climate pledges' ahead of COP on an online wall . In addition, the Architects' Council\~of Europe (ACE), the International Union of Architects (UIA), the National Council of the Order of\~French Architects (CNOA), and the International Council of French Architects (CIAF) will today (30 November) attend a meeting entitled 'Architecture, the Climate of the Future' where they will present a Manifesto for Responsible Architecture. It concludes: 'To live better together tomorrow, we - architects of the world - call for the implementation of decisive policies to stop the uncontrolled growth of cities, to eradicate the injustice related to the allocation of resources, to slow down climate exodus, to anticipate exposure to natural or industrial risks and to put an end to the depletion of natural resources across the planet.'

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK81","UN agencies weigh in on climate change impacts ahead of Paris conference","November 30, 2015 Monday","FinancialWire","In the weeks leading up to the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), which begins in Paris on Monday and aims to reach a new universal climate agreement, many of the Organization's agencies and programmes announced their latest climate-related findings, bringing to light new data, major concerns, and underlining existing and potential opportunities to preserve the planet. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached yet another new record high in 2014, continuing a ""relentless rise"" which is fueling climate change and will make the planet more dangerous and inhospitable for future generations. Just days later, the agency shared more ""bad news for the planet,"" warning that 2015 is likely to be the warmest year on record, breaching the symbolic and significant milestone of 1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era. In addition, data from the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) revealed that over the last 20 years, 90 per cent of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 recorded floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other weather-related events. Echoing this message was the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which underlined that natural disasters triggered by climate change have risen in frequency and severity over the last three decades, increasing the damage caused to the agricultural sectors of many developing countries and putting them at risk of growing food insecurity. The World Food Programme (WFP) further insisted that without ""ambitious action"" to address the causes and consequences of climate change, hunger cannot be eradicated. During the global gathering in Paris, the agency will launch its Food Security Climate Resilience (FoodSECuRE) Facility, a new tool that will help respond to climate disasters before they occur based on climate forecasts. Ahead of COP21 , the World Bank said ""climate-smart"" development can keep 100 million people out of poverty. According to the Bank's latest findings, the poorest people are more exposed than the average population to climate-related shocks, and they lose much more of their wealth when they are hit. Noting the significant impact climatic activities have on African people and countries, the Bank also unveiled a $ 16 billion business plan to boost the continent's climate resilience, outlining actions required to maintain and protect its growth and poverty reduction goals. Raising awareness on groups most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said youngsters will bear the brunt. More than half a billion children reportedly live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million in high drought severity zones, leaving them highly exposed. Recalling that indigenous peoples own, occupy or manage up to 65 per cent of the Earth's land surface - and that their voices must be heard in Paris - the UN Development Programme (UNDP) expressed significant concern regarding the exclusion of their issues from national plans to combat climate change. Formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, these will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached at COP21 . Meanwhile, the important role that nuclear power could play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions was the focus of a new report released by the UN International Atomic Energy (IAEA). It highlighted that nuclear power is one of the major low-carbon energy sources currently available, and many countries believe that it can help them to address the twin challenges of ensuring reliable energy supplies while curbing emissions. From the UN entity organizing the conference - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - came a set of best practice climate policies from across the world. 'Climate Action Now' was introduced in Bonn, Germany, as a solutions guide, revealing a ""wealth of existing opportunities"" to immediately scale up reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, according to a report released by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the implementation of the national target plans will limit greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, but a new climate agreement can encourage further action that will be necessary to limit global temperature rise to 2 degree Celsius by 2100.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK82","COP 21: environment MEPs adopt mandate for Paris climate talks - Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety","September 23, 2015 Wednesday","FinancialWire","The environment committee said on Wednesday that Parliament's delegation to the COP 21 climate talks in Paris must call for a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a 40% energy-efficiency target and a binding 30% target for renewable energy. In a resolution adopted by 55 votes to 5, with 8 abstentions, the committee also says a share of the EU's carbon market allowances should be earmarked for climate finance and the aviation and shipping sectors should initiate measures to curb their emissions by the end of 2016. ""The stakes are huge. We must limit the global rise in temperature to 2 degrees C if we are to curb climate change and the resulting catastrophic droughts, floods and food crises. These natural disasters are behind an exponential growth of climate refugees who could number as many as 200 million in the coming years - even more than the number of war refugees,"" said Gilles Pargneaux (S&D, FR), who drew up the resolution, after the vote. In its resolution, which constitutes the mandate for the EP delegation to the COP 21 meeting in December, the committee proposes a reduction of at least 40% of greenhouse-gas emissions in the EU by 2030, and a phasing-out of global carbon emissions by 2050 or shortly thereafter. ""In this fight Europe must be the engine and the model. This is why we support a binding target of 40% energy efficiency and a binding renewable energy target of 30% of total energy consumption by 2030,"" said Mr Pargneaux. The resolution calls for ""a general reinvigoration of the EU's climate policy"" in line with the upper limit of the EU's commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050. MEPs also want EU member states to consider further commitments, over and above the agreed 2030 target. The committee says the 2015 Protocol must be legally binding and seek to phase out global carbon emissions by 2050 or shortly thereafter in a bid to keep global warming below 2 degrees C in a cost-effective way. If this looks too ambitious, work will have to start in 2016 to devise additional reduction measures, it says. It recommends that the parties to the COP 21 conference back five-year commitment periods in order to ""avoid locking into low levels of ambition"". Climate finance The committee wants climate finance to be included in any agreement reached in Paris in a way that reflects changing environmental and economic realities. It calls on the EU and its member states to agree on a roadmap to scale up finance towards their fair share of the overall target of $ 100 billion a year by 2020. It proposes earmarking some of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) allowances as sources of climate finance, as well as revenues from EU and international taxes on aviation and shipping emissions. MEPs also ask the Commission to promote links between the EU's ETS and other emission trading systems with the aim of creating international carbon market mechanisms. Transport The committee points out that transport is the second-largest sector generating greenhouse gas emissions and calls on the parties to COP21 to work through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on measures to cut emissions before the end of 2016. Second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol The resolution calls on the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including EU member states, to complete their Kyoto Protocol ratification processes for the period up to 2020by December 2015. Next steps The full House will vote on the resolution on 14 October. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \"

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reinforced its commitment to the improvement of energy efficiency and recognizing the importance of emissions reduction as a means of combating climate change and supporting sustainable development programs. This was conveyed by His Excellency Ali Ibrahim Al-Naimi, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of Saudi Arabia at the High-Level Segment (HLS) of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) currently in session in the French capital. ""The Kingdom is committed to the improvement of energy efficiency; the use of solar and wind energy; carbon capture and storage; especially for use in enhanced oil recovery; the shift from liquid fuels to gas; and the promotion of research and development in the field of clean energy,"" said the Minister when addressing the HLS.

H.E Al-Naimi however stressed the importance of the new Paris Agreement, expected to be signed at the end of COP 21 , to take into account the principles and provisions of the current Framework Convention on Climate Change. ""This includes, especially, the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), based on the national priorities and circumstances of each country. In addition, the new agreement must strike a fair balance between greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change, and must cover all sectors instead of focusing exclusively on the energy sector,"" he said. In this context, the Minister called for the adoption of emission reduction policies that do not discriminate against any of the energy sources, and that these sources be viewed as complementary to each other in a way that contributes to the achievement of sustainable development for all. H.E A-Naimi also reaffirmed Saudi Arabia's willingness to participate actively in the promotion and implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In this context, the Kingdom has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) on the economic diversification initiative in accordance with the economic diversification decision adopted during COP 18 in Doha. ""Through this, the Kingdom will take action, adopt plans and implement programs designed to accelerate economic diversification and achieve the common benefits of avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to the effects of climate change, and mitigation of the impacts of response measures,"" the Minister said. H.E. Al-Naimi concluded by pointing out that the global nature of climate change required an effective and adequate international response in accordance with the CBDR, and the success of such response lies in achieving climate goals in a way that makes it possible to proceed with economic development in a sustainable manner.

United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP 21 , in Paris, Buhari said climate change has continued to pose a threat to Nigeria's security and development. ""At the sub-regional level, we are saddled with the challenge of the drying up of the Lake Chad Basin, which is resulting in the total wipe out of livelihoods of many communities surrounding this transboundary natural resource,"" he said. ""Regrettably, the world is leaving behind millions of people who depend on the Lake for their survival. The Government of Nigeria welcomes the Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Plan, and the Lake Chad Basin Commission and international partners for designing this climate-based Plan."" He noted that in all, the experience of countries sharing the Lake Chad further illustrates the mutual challenge being faced today and which must be collectively addressed without further delay. On Nigeria's position on the climate change negotiations, Buhari said any meaningful and potential agreement on climate change in Paris, ""must draw extensively on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities."" The president, who shortly before his arrival to Paris approved Nigeria's Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC) to tackle climate change , said for any agreement in Paris to be durable, ""it must recognise not only the emission right but also the survival rights of the citizens of developing countries."" The president also used the occasion of his address to around 150 leaders, who attended the opening ceremony of the summit, to affirm Nigeria's position of a potential agreement that equitably addresses climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. He said the potential agreement must make provisions for adequate financing, technology transfer and capacity development in the developing countries. The president called for the establishment of an effective means of monitoring, reviewing and verification of availability as well as accessibility of funds to the developing countries in order to address the challenges of climate change. He assured world leaders that his country is ready to support a legally binding and all-encompassing Paris Agreement, which must be fair to all. Source: Huhuh Online in English 1 Dec 15 \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK87","UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Katy Perry calls for action on climate change in a special weather report","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","December 7, 2015 In an exclusive recording launched today as world leaders gather in Paris, France, for the high-level segment of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Goodwill Ambassador and global pop star Katy Perry read a unique weather report to draw attention to the devastating effects of the phenomenon on the world's children. ""Droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions are putting children at an increased risk of disease and malnutrition, as well as destroying their families' homes and livelihoods. The worst part about this is that some of the youngest and most vulnerable citizens of our world are bearing the most unfair burden of climate change,"" said Ms. Perry in a news release issued by UNICEF. In her weather report, Ms. Perry highlighted the extreme weather patterns that are emerging across the world and forcing millions of children and families to flee their homes. According to a major report launched by UNICEF in November, over half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million live in high drought severity areas. The report also revealed that of the 530 million children in flood-prone zones, some 300 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty, surviving on less than $ 3.10 a day; and of those living in high drought severity areas, 50 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty. UNICEF stressed that climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions, which can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. Further, the climatic activities can create a vicious circle. For example, a child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. In the exclusive weather report, Ms. Perry called on viewers to share their story on how they are helping reduce climate change as part of the #FightUNfair campaign.

""Such an approach seeks to reduce CO2 emissions more effectively by drawing on a full spectrum of solutions, whether this relates to the vehicle itself, alternative powertrains, faster fleet renewal, intelligent transport systems (ITS), improving infrastructure, de-carbonising fuels, or altering driver behaviour. ""The need for a comprehensive approach to further reduce CO2 emissions from road transport should be reflected in the EU's implementation of the COP21 agreement."" ACEA added it wanted the climate negotiations to form the basis of a new ""long-term and predictable"" policy framework, with the COP21 talks resulting in equivalent conditions for all major emitting economies and industrial sectors around the world. ""Only a level playing field between countries, as well as industrial sectors, will allow the EU automotive industry to make the long-term investments that are necessary to tackle the climate change challenge,"" noted Jonnaert. \"

Electric vehicles are currently at the higher end of pricing, although certain countries have put forward grants as a stimulus, but\~the Paris plan does not detail how it would drive down such a significant reduction in EV cost. Nonetheless, the idea comes as French Sustainable Development and Energy Minister, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, widely tipped as a future potential Presidential candidate, put forward a raft of proposals during the COP21 climate conference's Transport Action Day. France,\~traditionally a country heavily reliant on nuclear power,\~has set itself highly ambitious energy targets with for example 10% of energy consumed by all modes of transport originating from renewable sources by 2020, rising to 15% by 2030. A goal of 7m charging stations in France has been set for 2030, while the French State and its public institutions must conform to a minimum 50% share of vehicles with low CO2 and air pollutants emissions, such as electric vehicles, when renewing their fleets. France is also supporting the Paris Declaration on electro-mobility and climate change, which was presented by the 'Zero Emission Vehicles Alliance,' bringing together regions and states committing to electric mobility with 20% EVs by 2030. The declaration sets the objective for at least 20% of all world vehicles (including two\~and three-wheelers, cars, trucks and buses) to be electric-powered by 2030. The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in France, with 27% of total emissions. It is responsible for 23% of all global emissions. The Transport Action Day was organised by the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) Consortium, with the event also emphasising the importance of adapting transport to the effects of climate change, when there are still very few initiatives. Commitments were made to solutions for freight and long-distance transport,\~urban transport,\~fuel-efficient vehicles, electro-mobility and positive energy Roads.\~ Royal christened the EUR7,000 electric car target,\~""Deux-Chevaux Cop 21 ."" press release follows: Paris, 3 December 2015 COP21 - FOCUS DAY ON TRANSPORT SEGOLENE ROYAL ANNOUNCES 4 INITIATIVES FOR THE ACCELERATION OF CLIMATE ACTION IN THE FIELD OF TRANSPORT __________________________ On the occasion of Transport Action Day on December 3, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, and Head of the French delegation has launched four initiatives for an acceleration of climate actions in the field of transport. 1) Launch of a call for the development of an electric car accessible to all for less than 7,000 EUR 2) France's support to the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate change that was presented by the ""Zero Emission Vehicles Alliance"", and brings together regions and states that commit to electric mobility (20% of electric vehicles by 2030); The declaration sets the objective for at least 20% of all world vehicles (including 2 and 3- wheelers, cars, trucks and buses) to be electric-powered by 2030. For the first time, the world adopts a common vision on the effort required to make electric mobility a key driver in the fight against climate change. The higher volume of orders will help reduce production and marketing prices. 3) France's support, with 2 million EUR from the French Global Environment Facility, to the initiative MobiliseYourCity that aims at facilitating transport planning projects in 20 cities in developing and emerging countries, with the support of AFD (""French Development Agency""), CEREMA (French ""Center for studies and expertise on risk, the environment, mobility and planning""), CODATU (French ""Cooperation for Development and Improvement of Urban and Suburban Transport), and the German International Cooperation Organisation (GIZ). Other sectors commit to promising initiatives: - The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) on efficient vehicles: 65 countries now share the goal of dividing by two the average fuel consumption of new vehicles by 2030, 40 developing countries have joined the initiative launched in New York; - The Global Green Freight Action Plan with the commitment of 13 new countries to implement a program or join in a regional initiative on green freight. 4) A national plan for the deployment of positive energy roads that will incorporate photovoltaic cells to generate electricity: 1,000 km within the next 5 years. The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in France, with 27% of total emissions. It is responsible for 23% of all global emissions. This event brought together many States and Parties: Mr. Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Minister of Environment of Peru opened the day with S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, in the presence of Ms. Violeta Bulc, European Commissioner for Transport, the Swedish, Chilean, and Luxembourg ministers, and Ms. Hakima El Haite, Minister of Environment of Morocco. Civil society was strongly represented with several speakers: Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard (Michelin, CEO), Mr. Yann Ricordel (Blue taxis, CEO), Jean-Pierre Loubinoux (International Union of Railways - UICF, Director General), and Mr. Bernard Soulage (Rh\'f4ne Alpes Region, Vice-President). The day was organized by the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) Consortium. This event also emphasised the importance of adapting transport to the effects of climate change, when there are still very few initiatives in this field today. The Focus on Transport was an opportunity to make new commitments in five areas that are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: - Freight and long-distance transport, - Urban transport, - Fuel-efficient vehicles, - Electro-mobility, - Positive energy Roads. The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act aims at developing clean transport to improve air quality and protect public health. The France set itself an ambitious goal: 10% of the energy consumed by all modes of transport will originate from renewable sources by 2020, rising to 15% by 2030. The bonus for the purchase of an electric vehicle was extended and increased on 1 April 2015 when accompanied by the scrapping of a pollutant vehicle: the total bonus may amount to 10,000 EUR. Between September 2014 and 31 December 2015, private individuals who install a charging station for electric vehicles can get a 30% tax credit. The law sets a goal of 7 million charging stations in France in 2030. The French State and its public institutions must conform to a minimum 50% share of vehicles with low CO2 and air pollutants emissions, such as electric vehicles, when renewing their fleets. Local authorities are subject to the same requirement concerning 20% of their fleet. All new buses and coaches that shall be acquired for public transport services from 2025 onwards will have to be low-emission vehicles. Car rental companies, operators of taxis and transport vehicles with driver (VTC) will have to buy 10% of low-emission vehicles when renewing their fleets.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK90","COP21: Green Bonds Need Regulation","December 2015","Global Money Management","Green bonds, an asset class created to fund projects with positive environmental and/or climate benefits, need a more structured regulation platform, stressed Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the Brussels-based International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), which represents 180 million workers in 162 countries and territories, with some USD30 trillion invested in pension funds. ""[Green bonds are] just green wash now. Everybody can look like they have sustainability plans all over the map, but in fact a lot of our money is going into junk technology in an environment where we will see stranded assets,"" she spoke at the COP21 Lima-Paris Action Agenda conference in Paris. Green bond issuance is growing rapidly, having tripled between 2013 and 2014 to USD36.6 billion from USD11 billion. Last year's amount has been surpassed in 2015 to date, with almost USD40 billion in new green bond issuances, according to data from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Several European pension funds have an active investment in this type of assets. Danish pension company Pensionskassernes Administration (PKA) has EUR140 million allocated to green bonds, which is part of a strategy to invest in climate friendly assets (iiSEARCHES, 25/11). Folksam, a Swedish insurer, made a move into green bonds for the first time by adding the SPP Green Bond Fund to its portfolio, which is available for its customers to invest in (iiSEARCHES, 23/11). Burrow is not the only one asking for more disclosure and regulation in this area. A group of 11 of the world's biggest multilateral and national development banks, including EIB, released last week at COP21 a set of recommendations for green bond issuers. The document, available here, advises on the reporting of the environmental benefits of how the loan capital is deployed. The document outlines core principles and recommendations, proposes core indicators for two sectors""""energy efficiency and renewable energy""""and includes reporting templates. The objective is to provide issuers with a reference that they can adapt to their own circumstances as they develop their own reporting, a statement disclosed. For now, these recommendations do not cover reporting outside the energy efficiency and renewable energy fields. The group plans, however, to develop additional indicators for other projects in the future, the document stated. There are other industry officials that believe the green bond market needs to develop even further. Erik Jan van Bergen, member of the Green Bond Principles' executive committee and cio of Actiam""""a Dutch asset manager with EUR51 billion in assets""""argued that the green bond market needs to expand worldwide and diversify. To achieve the 2\'b0C scenario, an estimated annual USD500 billion will be required, he said, at one of the conferences at COP21 . \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK91","10 reasons why agriculture is key to combating climate change; Global warming's impact on food production is one of the hot topics to be discussed by world lead....","December 1, 2015 Tuesday 5:42 PM GMT","The Guardian","Governments of more than 190 nations will converge in Paris from 30 November to 11 December at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), with the aim of reaching a historic agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and averting the disastrous effects of climate change. As talks centre on smart ways to cut emissions, attention is turning towards the role of agriculture and the management of natural resources to ensure global warming does not exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 2\'b0C. Scientists believe that any greater temperature rise would be catastrophic for the planet, exceeding survival thresholds of crop, tree and fish species. Climate change threatens to derail efforts to end poverty and hunger, and achieve the sustainable development goals. Here are 10 reasons why a focus on agriculture is integral to action on climate change. The poorest are hit hardest Climate change disproportionately affects the world's poorest countries - particularly small island developing states, landlocked countries, arid and semi-arid areas - where people are most dependent on natural resources. In a cruel twist, these countries have contributed the least to causing climate change. Food producers are most vulnerable Drought, floods, sea level rises, and hurricanes destroy crops, livestock and fish resources and devastate ecosystems, irrigation systems and infrastructure. Family farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and foresters - the same people who provide the bulk of the planet's food - are those whose lives and livelihoods will be most affected. A threat to global food production Agricultural production needs to increase globally by an estimated 60% by 2050 to meet projected demands for food and feed from a growing and changing world population. However, scientists predict that production may fall by as much as 2% each decade for the rest of this century as a consequence of rising temperatures. The socio-economic impact could be devastating. Stressing the planet The expected increase in extreme weather events will only add to the challenge of current food production systems, which are already under stress through degradation of land and water resources and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services resulting from unsustainable practices. Today, a third of farmland is degraded, up to 75% of crop genetic diversity has been lost and 22% of animal breeds are at risk. More than half of fish stocks are fully exploited, and in the first decade of this century, some 13m hectares of forests were converted into other land uses each year. Reducing agriculture's carbon footprint Agriculture, forestry and fisheries can make a significant contribution to global mitigation efforts by reducing their carbon footprint, adopting low emission growth strategies and enhancing carbon storage in soils, forests and aquatic systems. While agriculture and deforestation account for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, forests retain as much carbon as in the whole atmosphere, and soil makes up the greatest pool of terrestrial organic carbon. The agricultural sector has considerable transformational potential as it is uniquely positioned to simultaneously address all three dimensions of sustainability. Agro-ecology schooling Sharing knowledge with farmers on agro-ecological approaches and how to adapt them to local conditions through farmer field schools and other networks can have a positive long-term impact on climate change. For some time now, FAO has been working with countries and partners in developing and promoting approaches that avoid deforestation, overfishing and focus on improving soil fertility and increased ecosystems services that lower emissions while ensuring human and ecosystem well-being. Transforming food systems Modern food systems are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Moving away from dominant input-intensive food systems and pursuing climate-resilient approaches to agriculture can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of shifting to sustainable agricultural practices will require long-term public and private investment and cannot be borne alone by poor farmers, fisherfolk, foresters, and indigenous communities. Saving energy One third of the food the world produces is lost or wasted. That amounts to about US$2.6 tn per year, including $700 bn of environmental costs and $900 bn of social costs. Reducing food losses through improved access to post-harvest technologies, and reducing waste through consumer education and initiatives like FAO-UNEP's Save food can help cut the energy bill. Ultimately, the agri-food value chain will have to gradually decouple from fossil fuel dependence to deliver more food with less and cleaner energy. The big picture Action on climate change must be part of the bigger picture of sustainable development, taking into account the fight against hunger and poverty while investing in renewable resources. Nearly 80% of the world's poor live in rural areas, and most depend on agriculture for their living. Achieving zero hunger by 2030 largely depends on ensuring that agricultural systems and rural communities are healthy, productive, sustainable, and resilient in the face of climate change. Measuring and monitoring A better understanding of the influence of a changing climate on agricultural sectors has to be the first step. Providing essential information for climate change adaptation planning and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, FAO has developed tools for assessing the impact of climate change, monitoring natural resources and harmful emissions.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK94","Global panic: art show Exit brings climate change to shocking life; Timed to coincide with the COP21 UN conference in Paris, this video installation is a stark ....","November 27, 2015 Friday 10:26 AM GMT","The Guardian","There are more than 19.5 million refugees worldwide, cities are emitting 70% of all greenhouses gases and around 3,500 languages are currently in danger of extinction. The statistics around the climate change debate may make for increasingly stark reading, but they suffer from one major drawback: that we, as humans, find it difficult to relate to data - no matter how shocking the numbers. This issue is central to a new exhibition, Exit, being staged at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. A vast 360-degree video installation, with viewers seated in the middle, Exit will bring to life - through a number of animated maps, visuals and text - all the data that shows the extent of the human and ecological cost of climate change. The show's curator, Herv\'e9 Chand\'e8s, says Exit offers a ""new aesthetic for how we can relate to the the destruction of our own planet"". The staging of Exit will tie in with the COP21 United Nations climate change conference taking place in Paris, which will see world leaders gather in a bid to create an agreement on global warming. By placing the installation within this context, Chand\'e8s says, makes it a ""call to action"". Chand\'e8s, director of the Fondation Cartier contemporary art museum in Paris, originally commissioned the installation in 2008, at a point when human migration began to take place on an unprecedented scale. The idea was born from a single question posed by the cultural theorist Paul Virilio: ""What is left of this world, of our native land, of the history of what so far is the only habitable planet?"" The Fondation brought in New York design studio Diller Scofidio + Renfro to work with climate change scientists, including Franc\'b8ois Gemenne, to create a work that spanned the disciplines of science and art to bring to life the current state of planet Earth. The installation shows that, in the years between 2008 and 2015, the global population grew by a billion and the number of refugees increased fivefold. Elizabeth Diller, director of the design studio that brought the data to life through geocoding, says: ""We wanted to tell poignant stories of the drama of uprooting people from their homes without resorting to narrative media, whose familiarity and realism is often desensitising. So we challenged ourselves to use only data - the driest and most abstract information - to create a strong, palpable effect."" The 45-minute installation displays the stark reality of population shifts and city growth, the global spread of political refugees and forced migration, rising sea levels, natural disasters, deforestation and the death of languages - all drawn from more than 100 different sources of scientific and ecological data. ""An alchemical result can come from combining the objectivity of science and the interpretive potential of art that can touch an unsuspecting audience,"" added Diller. ""The work makes no judgments - it simply allows data to speak for itself."" Climate change scientist Gemenne, who has consulted on the project since 2007, says that updating Exit has been a ""devastating exercise"". ""The situation, on all six of the maps, has deteriorated since 2008,"" he says. ""What I hope this show emphasises is the humanity - that we are all connected and that this is not a distant threat that only affects some of us. We are all already in the middle of this catastrophe."" Gemenne says he was most shocked by the part of the installation that engages with the numbers of internally displaced people. ""Everyone knows these numbers and usually migration flows are displayed using arrows on maps, as if it was a kind of invasion,"" he says. ""But here you see each person - and seeing people rather than arrows is extremely shocking and makes you realise the magnitude of the tragedy that is unfolding."" Gemenne says he sees Exit as a ""planetarium of the Anthropocene"" - referring to the epoch when human activity started to have a significant global impact on Earth's ecosystems. ""One of the key problems of climate change discussions today is that people cannot directly relate to them,"" he explains. ""They know that half of the world's languages are [becoming] extinct or that there are going to be millions of refugees. But they generally don't impact on their daily lives and they cannot experience them; the time scale of planetary change does not match the human experience."" Gemenne hopes that Exit will be a ""reality check"" for those attending the climate change conference, and will highlight in particular the human cost of global warming, which ""is so often neglected"". ""Typically in these kinds of climate change conferences, very often the negotiations seem disconnected from the realities,"" he says. ""They negotiate tons of CO2 emissions and billions of dollars of funding without realising what that means for people. Exit demonstrates to the negotiators what they are really negotiating about - and the human cost at stake."" \'b7 Exit is at Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 10 January 2016. Admission is free. \"

In a survey of sustainability experts released Thursday, 90% of respondents said that companies would need to play as big of a role as national governments in combating climate change to prevent environmental disaster. The 2015 Climate Survey, by research consultancy GlobeScan and thinktank SustainAbility, asked 624 sustainability experts from 69 countries about their expectations ahead of the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) taking place in Paris in December. ""Businesses are expected to lead on climate because they are seen to be able to deliver results,"" said Eric Whan, sustainability director at GlobeScan. ""Traditional institutions like governments and multilaterals have failed to do so, and more and more, experts are calling for collaborative solutions."" Related: Food industry executives call on Congress for climate change action The survey reflected a lack of confidence in governments' abilities to devise effective solutions to complex problems. While more than 90% of respondents said they expected COP21 would result in a global agreement, only a third believed it would have binding powers to implement any substantive changes on a wide scale. Moreover, only 4% of respondents expected the agreement would be sufficient to contain global warming below 2C (36F), which is the temperature level that scientists and world leaders have agreed will help to avoid environmental catastrophes like super droughts and volcanic eruptions. Respondents also revealed the businesses they saw as leaders in the fight to curb climate change, with 20% picking Unilever as the company that's achieved the most real, substantial advances. The survey lauded the consumer goods company - which has committed to achieving zero net deforestation by 2020 - for its Sustainable Living campaign, the ""bold statements and actions"" made by its CEO, and its commitment to published targets. Electric car manufacturer Tesla came in second, while Swedish furniture maker Ikea, technology giant Google and consumer appliances conglomerate General Electric tied for third place. Walmart, Toyota, Siemens, Apple and solar-energy installer SolarCity rounded out the leaders list. The survey results represent a notable shift from the last climate survey ranking, which was conducted in 2009 ahead of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. Back then, oil and gas giants Shell and BP made the list, during a time when large industrial companies were applauded for their commitments to reducing pollution and waste. Related: Major corporations taking climate change threat more seriously - survey Their more recent performances haven't lived up to expectations, most starkly illustrated by several high profile environmental disasters such as the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which led to a drop in public sentiment for petroleum companies. Large consumer and technology companies have since pulled ahead with ambitious sustainability agendas that extend across their value chains. ""The fossil fuel sector is widely seen as having failed to shift its business model to address climate change concerns and recently suffered huge losses to its reputation,"" said Aiste Brackley, research manager at SustainAbility. ""The new leaders such as Unilever, Tesla and Ikea are setting a high bar for corporate leadership."" Only three companies - General Electric, Walmart and Toyota - that were included in the 2009 ranking made it onto this year's list. For companies that want to boost their reputations, reducing their carbon emissions, increasing their use of renewable energy like solar and hydropower, and clamping down on deforestation are the best ways to act on climate change and prove their commitment to combating it, Brackley said. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK98","-University of Bristol - Consensus on consensus confirms 97 per cent of experts are convinced people are changing the climate","April 19, 2016 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Ninety-seven per cent of climate scientists agree global warming is caused by people, a new study by an international team of researchers, including Professor Stephan Lewandowsky of the University of Bristol, has confirmed. John Cook of the University of Queensland's Global Change Institute brought together the authors of seven previous research studies into scientific agreement on climate change. Their new study, published in Environmental Research Letters, found that the higher the scientific expertise in climate science, the higher the agreement that global warming is caused by humans. Mr Cook said: 'Global warming is ultimately responsible for increasing temperatures, more severe storms and drought, as well as everything that goes with that - we need to find ways to address it, so future generations can enjoy everything that we do. 'The progress made at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris late last year indicates that countries are now well and truly behind the scientific consensus too. 'It has been studies like this that have compelled politicians and policy-makers to act on climate change - and the Paris Accord is testament to that action.' A 2013 study, led by Mr Cook, showed that more than 97 per cent of expert climate scientists agreed global warming was caused by humans - a finding that was re-tweeted by US President Barack Obama to his 31 million followers. However, some climate contrarians and politicians continue to claim that there is a lack of scientific consensus. The point of the new work is to bring together all the scholars who have examined the question-and to show that, despite differences in approaches, the various studies find essentially the same result. Research co-author Professor Naomi Oreskes from Harvard University said that this latest work places it in the broader context of other research. 'What we've done is gather together many of the scientists who have studied this issue right back to my original consensus study in 2004,' she said. 'By compiling and analysing all of this research - essentially a meta-study of meta-studies - we've established a consistent picture with high levels of scientific agreement among climate experts.' Mr Cook said he hoped this latest finding, which he has termed 'consensus on consensus', will enable scientists to focus on the real work - addressing climate change. 'Global warming is the most serious issue of our age and scientists can now focus their efforts on addressing it,' he said.

A month and a half since 196 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted the Paris Agreement, the global community is already seeing signs of it being a decisive turning point, according to a senior UN official dealing with climate issues. ""Much has been happening since Paris - the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2015 was the hottest year on record, not just by a little but by a lot,"" Janos Pasztor, who was today appointed as Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Change, told reporters at a briefing in New York. For the past year, Mr. Pasztor had been leading the UN's climate change efforts as Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change, working towards last December's 21st United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ). Recalling that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has invited world leaders to a signing ceremony on 22 April - which coincides with International Mother Earth Day - the climate advisor noted that it will be the first day the Agreement is open for formal signatures. He said Mr. Ban is urging countries to quickly ratify the agreement so it can enter into force as soon as possible, adding that the event will also be an opportunity to discuss efforts to implement national climate plans, known as INDCs, and to generally ""maintain the momentum of the action agenda."" Meanwhile, he underlined the Secretary-General's recent call for a doubling of investments in clean energy by 2020, which he said was greeted ""very positively"" by many investors. ""The Paris Agreement sent a clear message to markets and investors that it's time to get serious about climate change. We're now seeing evidence that the signal has been received loud and clear,"" Mr. Pasztor stressed. Meanwhile, in a statement issued by the UN Spokesperson's Office, Mr. Ban expressed his deep gratitude for Mr. Pasztor's ""dedicated service and leadership"" over the past quarter of a century with the world body on the key global challenges of climate change, energy and sustainability. ""In his new role as Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Change, Mr. Pasztor will support efforts of the Secretary-General to mobilize world leaders and all sectors of society to implement the landmark Paris Agreement,"" the statement indicated. \"

This has been revealed as the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 Transport contributes one fourth of all the carbon emissions in Europe. Urban mobility accounts 40% of all the carbon dioxide emissions of road transport. Transport solutions such as fuel cell electric buses can play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions. In place of regular internal combustion engines (ICEs), fuel cell buses make use of electric motors for propulsion. These fuel cell units transform hydrogen fuel into electricity in order to power the motor. The process only emits water vapour as a by-product, reported Traffictechnology.com. Initiated in 2010, the project will continue until next December, reported the publication. Within the project, 56 fuel cell electric buses are currently operational in daily service. While other bus trials are underway, a major European programme to deploy hundreds of these buses by 2020 is also in progress. The next set of roll-out is expected to lower bus costs and ensure that the technology is commercially viable for the elimination of carbon emissions from road transport. The programme is a joint initiative by Europe's Fuel Cell and Hydrogen funding body FCH JU, bus operators, public authorities and industry players from the bus and fuel supply industry. CHIC project coordinator and Daimler Buses - EvoBus official Kerstin K M\'fcller said: ""The project has proven that fuel cell buses are far from being a research project and are nearly ready for commercialisation."" London deputy mayor for environment and energy Matthew Pencharz said: ""In London, we've prioritised transforming our buses into one of the cleanest and greenest fleets in the world. The hydrogen RV1 buses are proving hugely popular with commuters and drivers alike and are crucial as part of our wider work to reduce emissions and improve air quality across the capital.""

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK101","-Sanofi Announces Commitment to COP21","November 23, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","Paris, France - Sanofi announced today its commitment to COP21 , the United Nations conference on climate change, as an official partner, and its participation to Solutions COP21 , a public exhibition in the heart of Paris. Following the World Health Organization call to push the impact of climate change on human health to center stage, Sanofi has decided to actively contribute to COP21 in order to raise awareness on this issue, but also to take action to prevent its consequences. 'We need to urgently support the mobilization of the entire health community, public and private stakeholders, starting with life sciences companies, who are responsible for contributing to the advancement of health,' said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. 'If we act now, we can mitigate the consequences of climate change on the health of the world's population. Health must be part of the Climate debate.' Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress, between 2030 and 2050, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The direct effects of climate change on health include illness, death and morbidity during extreme weather events (heat waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes or storms). The indirect impacts go much further including the influence of climate on microbial populations, consequences on non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and distribution of vector-born diseases. As highlighted in the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change Report, published in June, 'the links between climate change, vector populations and hence malarial range and incidence may become significant in areas where the temperature is currently the limiting factor, possibly increasing the incidence of a disease that causes 660,000 deaths per year.' Sanofi is actively engaged in a number of activities whose aim is to address health issues exacerbated by climate change: Medications and Awareness: Sanofi provides medicines and vaccines but also raises populations awareness, strengthens surveillance and enhances diagnostic and treatment capacity. In the field of malaria, for example, Sanofi has pursued strategic partnerships with National Malaria Control programs in several African countries to provide affordable medicines and to support local stakeholders in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of malaria. Carbon Footprint: Implementing a low carbon economy requires a collective effort. The health sector as a whole contributes between 3% and 5% to OECD countries emissions. Sanofi is committed to achieving a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions stemming (industrial and R&D sites) from 2010 to 2020. By the end of 2014, Sanofi achieved a 15% reduction. Global Collaborations: As a global healthcare leader, Sanofi is in a unique position to program the impacts of climate change on health on the public agenda in a collective approach. That is why Sanofi is pursuing collaborations with governments, non-governmental organizations and the scientific community to find responses to limit the negative consequences of climate change on worldwide health. Additionally and within the COP21 , to mobilize the public and to help adapt to the consequences of climate change, Sanofi will launch a social networks campaign #HealthCOP21. From December 4th to 10th 2015, Sanofi will also host public on its booth at Solutions COP21 , located in the Grand Palais, a public exhibition in the heart of Paris.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK102","-Renault-Nissan Alliance employees go the distance for COP21","November 16, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","PARIS - Two hundred employees will promote Renault-Nissan's leadership in electric vehicles while driving EV shuttles during the global summit on climate change in Paris. Employees - who completed a one-and-a half-day training course to become drivers and EV ambassadors - will shuttle VIP negotiators, delegates and media at the 21st annual Conference of Parties (known as COP21 ), from Nov. 29 to Dec. 11. Renault-Nissan Alliance will provide 200 pure electric vehicles for COP21 - the world's largest electric-vehicle fleet ever to an international conference. The EV fleet - which is comprised of the Nissan LEAF, Renault ZOE and the Nissan e-NV200 - is expected to cover more than 400,000 km in two weeks, fueled with renewable and extremely low-carbon energy, without a single drop of petroleum. Delegates can request an EV shuttle through an online reservation system - cop21evshuttle.com - specifically developed for the event. Shuttles from Renault-Nissan will run to and from hotels to the conference venue. More than 20,000 U.N. participants from 195 countries are expected to attend the summit. 'As soon as Renault-Nissan decided to support COP21 , our employees started asking how they could be directly involved,' said Marie-Francoise Damesin, Renault-Nissan's global head of human resources. 'Helping negotiators get to their meetings, riding in quiet and smooth EVs that can be 100 percent recharged with renewable and extremely low-carbon electricity, sends a powerful message about our corporate commitment to the environment - and about our employees' desire to be part of the solution to climate change.' EV Drivers Call to Action In June, the Renault-Nissan Alliance launched a call for volunteers to allow employees in and around Paris the opportunity to be part of COP21 as volunteer drivers. The response was overwhelming, with more than 450 employees applying before the recruitment process was closed. Many of the volunteers drive an EV, and others work directly for Renault and Nissan's EV programs. Employees selected for the program had to have driver licenses for at least two years, French and English language skills (additional languages preferred), and motivation to promote Renault-Nissan's EV leadership. Each candidate had to write an essay explaining their interest in the program. 'I want to spread the word that EVs are the most pleasant, fun-to-drive, efficient and quiet way to get around,' said Francois-Xavier Lejeune, an engineer from Renault who will drive negotiators during the environmental summit. 'A major theme of COP21 is 'solutions,' and it's clear to me that EVs already represent the solution for the transportation sector to become more sustainable.' 'I strongly believe all corporations, including mine, should invest in sustainable solutions for the protection of the planet and mankind,' said Marion Lerussard, another volunteer driver who works in the aftersales department of Nissan West in France. In addition to the shuttle service, Renault-Nissan will participate in Solutions COP21 , an international exhibition on climate-change solutions, at the Grand Palais in Paris. The exhibition, which will take place from Dec. 4-10, will feature projects to reduce CO2 from cities, businesses and other organizations around the world. Renault-Nissan will have a multimedia gallery of people who switched from conventional cars to EVs. Renault-Nissan will also give public test drives of EVs along iconic Parisian streets.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK103","UN COP21: First Thoughts On Paris Agreement","December 14, 2015 Monday","Asia Pacific Power & Renewables Insight","BMI View: The efficacy of the UN COP21 deal rests on the individual countries ' implementation of climate change policy and financing availability, as the agreement forged is partly legally binding and partly voluntary. While we recognise the Paris Climate Agreement as a milestone in the global climate change discussion, which will galvanize stronger commitments to coordinated action, it has not prompted us to alter our forecasts for the power and renewables sector at this point as i mplementation is due post 2020 and we cannot assess tangible impact s at this stage . Achieving any sort of post-2020 global climate deal during the UN 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference (UN COP21 ) was going to be a challenge, given the sheer number of countries involved and the varying energy mixes and economic trajectories of the individual countries (see 'Challenges To UN Climate Change Negotiations: Five Key Charts', May 12 ). As such, the announcement of a climate change agreement on December 12 marks a historic turning point towards the global push to tackle climate change; made even more pertinent considering the breakdown in previous negotiations - notably the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen climate summit. Pressing Global Emissions {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Carbon Dioxide Emissions By Country (million tonnes CO2) and growth, 2013-2014 (LHS) & Total Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions By Country (% of total million tonnes CO2) (RHS) {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Source: BP Statistical Review Of World Energy 2015, BMI {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell However, although targets have been set - for example limiting global temperature increase 'well below' 2degC and those targets outlined in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - there is no clear indication of how these targets will be met. Furthermore, with a lack of legally binding legislation, the efficacy of the UN COP21 remains highly dependent on the individual countries' implementation of climate change policy and financing availability.This aligns with our previous analysis of the UN COP21 , when we stated that the negotiations would be 'ultimately unlikely to yield a universal agreement on emissions reductions'. This view was supported by the vague language used in the deal - with the target focused on restricting temperature increases, as opposed to a specific global emissions reduction. Instead, countries will aim to 'reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible'.Some key areas of the agreement: Limit the increase in global average temperatures to 'well below 2degC above pre-industrial levels' - and 'endeavour to limit' them to 1.5degC. In order to limit global temperature increases, governments must reach peak emissions £s soon as possible'. Post 2050, anthropogenic emissions should be at a level whereby they can be absorbed by forests and oceans. Countries must revisit their pledges (as part of the NDCs) every five years from 2023 to assess whether deeper cuts can be made. Developed nations must provide financial assi stance to developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change, for example help ing to fund the development of renewable energy. We note that there are a couple of sticking points to the deal; firstly, the lack of legally binding targets for CO2 reduction at a global level. The agreement forged from the negotiations is partly legally binding and partly voluntary; for example, countries are obligated to set an emissions target at a domestic level - as part of their NDCs - and review this target, but meeting the target is not legally binding.The fact that such targets have been agreed domestically by each country in preparation to the COP21 conference should ensure that the deal reached in Paris is ratified swiftly by national parliaments over the coming quarters. However, we warn that placing the responsibility of enforcement exclusively on governments - without a common matrix to review progress - leaves room for policy slippage and raises a risk of complacency and limited action from governments when implementing regulations that tackle rising emissions.This risk is likely to be most pertinent in Asia, where coal remains the dominant fuel-choice in the power sector, and there is already a lack of progress with regards to carbon reduction policies (see ' Carbon Reduction Policies Progressing But More To Do ', July 7). This further supports our view that the Asia region will have to become heavily involved in future climate change initiatives - primarily India and China - if success in meeting targets is to be realised post-2020 ( see ' China And India Fundamental To Climate Change Negotiations', July 2). Coal Still A Dominant Fuel In Asia {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Coal-Fired Electricity Generation By Region, % Of Total, 2015/2024 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Inner circle/Outer circle = 2015 forecast/2024 forecast. Source: EIA, BMI {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Secondly, we highlight that the responsibility of financing the shift to a cleaner global economy remains a contentious issue among countries. Emissions targets negotiations have typically centred on this argument, with developing countries pushing for greater funding from developed countries for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Developed countries currently are obligated to mobilise USD100bn in climate finance by 2020, with the Paris deal instructing that this would continue through 2025; however, this is again not legally binding.

Although we believe this negative sentiment is overdone, a global deal on climate change - which promotes the uptake of renewable energy - will help to drive growth in the sector over the coming decade. Our forecasts currently show global non-hydro capacity to expand by nearly 80% between 2015 and 2024, driven by substantial growth in the Asia market, primarily China (see 'Asia's Renewables Capacity To Double By 2024', July 30 ). There is upside to our forecasts stemming from the Paris agreement. However, the deal has not prompted us to alter our forecasts for power generation and capacity at this point as implementation is due post 2020 and we cannot assess its tangible impacts at this stage.The changing narrative about countries' efforts to address climate change produced by the Paris deal, coupled with the pledge to provide billions of financing for fighting climatic transformations and mitigating its disruptive consequences, will have an impact not only on renewable energy, but on a number of other industries. These include, among others, infrastructure construction, agriculture, mining and oil & gas; upcoming BMI coverage will provide insight on risks and business opportunities that the process starting with the COP21 Paris deal will create for these industries over the coming years. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK104","NGOs call for curbs on shipping emissions to meet Paris climate target","February 10, 2016 Wednesday","WMI Company News","NGOs Seas At Risk and Transport and Environment (T&E) have warned that achieving the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to 1.5 / 2\'b0C will be impossible unless Europe and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) ratify measures to curb shipping emissions. An EU study revealed that shipping could account for 17% of the global emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2050 if the sector is not subjected to strict emissions measures. According to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), carbon emissions from international maritime shipping could increase by 250% in the period up to 2050 if left unchecked. Currently, the sector constitutes 3% of global CO2 emissions, which is higher than those of Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, France or the UK. The IMO is said to have failed to take stock of the shipping industry's growing contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases on a global level. IMO secretary-general Koji Sekimizu had earlier in September 2015 attributed the failure to the rapidly growing world industries which mostly do not comply with the environmental standards. However, measures are being taken to address the issue which is believed to have started with the appointment of a new secretary general to head the IMO. T&E shipping officer Sotiris Raptis said: ""We welcome the new IMO secretary-general, who is coming to office at a key moment following the Paris agreement. ""We are sure Secretary-General Kitack Lim fully understands the need for the IMO to act now. ""The EU, in parallel, needs to include shipping in its 2030 reduction commitment now and in the EU ETS or in an EU climate fund from 2021."" During the climate agreement negotiated at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) in Le Bourget, Paris, in December last year, international shipping industry along with the aviation sector was excluded from discussion to introduce measures to tame global warming. Seas At Risk senior policy advisor John Maggs said: ""There is no reasonable excuse to continue exempting the sector from the global and EU climate policies. ""That shipping needs to make its fair share of cuts to keep global warming well below two degrees is not negotiable after Paris.""

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK106","Fight for justice goes on","December 19, 2015 Saturday","The Glasgow South and Eastwood Extra","After 21 years of climate justice negations, the most recent taking place in Paris in the past few weeks at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP21 , world leaders are hailing the agreements made as ambitious', set to keep the world on track to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C. Targets that must now be met with firm action, to protect people and planet from the real challenges that comes with runaway climate change, that cannot be ignored any longer. As much as climate justice is about protecting our only planet, it is also about justice for the people and communities who are already feeling the impacts of climate change. Communities across the globe are already facing the kind of sea level rises and flooding that drives people from their homes, displacing whole communities, and tampers with food production. Challenges that no country can afford to ignore, that will undoubtedly impact on us all in one way or another - as we live in an ever globalised world and economy. We got some warm words about temperature levels from the Paris agreement, but no concrete action. In order to have a decent chance of reaching that 1.5\'b0C target, we need to keep at least 80 percent of known fossil fuels in the ground, and urgently halt the exploration and extraction of new sources. Whilst our UK government signed up to the agreement, at home they continue to pursue fracking and other dirty energy policies, severely undermining any agreements made. It is clear that the fight for climate justice does not end in Paris. It is up to us, the people, to keep our governments in check and held to account around the commitments made in Paris. Without legally binding requirements to meet the promises made, it could be all to easy for our governments to pay lip service to the agreements made. Scottish Greens will continue to hold UK and Scottish Governments to account, pushing for divestment away from fossil fuels; and an outright ban on fracking and underground coal gasification; leading the way in showing what's possible in creating a sustainable, fossil free, energy future for Scotland. Scotland's response should acknowledge the direction of travel signaled in Paris. We are well placed to make the switch to clean technology to sustain our economy and our society. Energy efficient housing, better public transport and support for community and publicly owned renewables are credible alternatives and responses that Greens will continue to push for to get our climate targets on track and secure a sustainable future.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK107","Did COP21 seize last chance to halt climate change?","December 12, 2015","The Grocer","What is COP21 ? Not a snoozefest on sustainability but the ""last chance to save the world"" from cataclysmic climate change, said French president Fran\'c7ois Hollande. If that sounds hyperbolic, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian PM Narendra Modi made similar speeches about the UN initiative as the two-week conference reached its conclusion. As did the Pope and Prince Charles. How do they plan to do it? The 195 UN member countries were asked to sign a legally binding deal promising to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep global average temperatures below 2\'b0C. Currently, they are around 1\'b0C. Anything over 2\'b0C would be a tipping point for the planet, warn scientists, causing even more intense storms and rising sea levels. Universal agreement and action would ensure, unlike previous agreements like the Kyoto Agreement Protocol, structure and commitment are built. What are the stumbling blocks? Everyone agrees fossil fuels are a major contributor to greenhouse gases. But to date everyone has failed to agree how to tackle the problem. It took four years to produce a 48-page draft agreement for everyone to sign at COP21 , which still contained 900 points of contention as the event entered its second week. A major stumbling block is money. Developing countries say they can't stop using cheap and plentiful fossil fuels to aid their development unless already developed countries provide the finance for greener systems. In 2010, developed countries pledged $100bn a year by 2020 in 'climate finance'. According to the OECD, $62bn was delivered in 2014. India says that $100bn figure should increase after 2020, but divisions have emerged over who should contribute after the draft agreement said climate finance payments should be paid by any countries ""in a position to do so"". Did everyone sign up? The outcome was not due until 6pm on Friday (after The Grocer went to press). But further postponement won't derail the eco-efforts of the fmcg industry, says Martin Riant, group president & executive sponsor for global sustainability at P&G, who is at COP21 . He says P&G has a plan to deliver a 30% reduction in emissions by 2020, from a base year of 2010. ""Now we are trying to figure out how we can deliver that,"" he says. ""We have recently gone into partnership in the US to create a biomass energy plant, and another partnership with a company in Texas to create a wind farm to power all our laundry and cleaning products in the US. We will need to extend that kind of innovation in multiple places to achieve it."" He's confident P&G, as well as the wider fmcg industry, will succeed. At meetings of the Worldwide Business Council for Sustainable Development at COP21 there was a ""strong collective energy to move forward, irrespective of political agreements"". COP21 generate? The contribution livestock makes to greenhouse gases (not to mention methane and nitrous oxide emissions) was conspicuous by its absence, considering various estimates suggest the livestock sector produces about 15% of global greenhouse gases. And a November report from Chatham House claiming lower meat consumption will be ""critical"" to keep global warming below the ""danger level"" of 2\'b0C was even backed by Arnie. \"

The Tories have come under fire since the election for rolling back on support for renewables and energy efficiency. And just days before crucial climate UN talks began in the French capital, it was announced they were abandoning a \£31 billion competition for technology to capture carbon from power plants. But Mr Johnson said: ""I think it is very important to strike a balance between policies that promote economic growth and jobs and policies that keep carbon emissions coming down.

""We believe firmly in new technology in London, to continue to drive improvements, we've seen some remarkable successes, and we're going to continue with that approach."" The mayor pointed to London's bus fleet, which he said was the cleanest in Europe, the introduction of an ultra low emissions zone in the capital and reductions in greenhouse gases and air pollutants despite a growing population in the city. Mr Johnson was speaking on a visit to Paris to attend talks with other city leaders in the ""C40"" group of major world cities, from New York to Seoul, South Korea, who are leading the way on driving down emissions. He also visited a scheme, buried deep beneath Paris's elegant boulevards along the Seine, which uses water from the river for a heat exchange system which cools five million square metres of public buildings in the city. Donning a hard hat and descending metres below street level, Mr Johnson saw how the cooling network scheme saved buildings from needing their own air conditioning, describing the system as ""fantastic"". ""They're using the river very sensibly through a series of heat exchanges to cool down buildings across the city, including the Louvre and the National Assembly, and saving tens of millions of euros in electricity costs and cutting a huge amount of CO2."" He joked that it was a rare moment that Paris had upstaged London.

The three Pan-African institutions, including the African Union Commission (AUC); the African Development Bank (AfDB); the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA) brought together hundreds of African policy makers and experts attending COP 21 to enlighten them on Africa's proposed amendments to the draft Paris Agreement (especially Articles on the INDCs) now making its way through the negotiation process. The Egyptian Minister of Environment, Dr. Khaled Fahmy who currently chairs the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) told the meeting that the provision of means of implementation for the INDCs is a thick red line that Africa will not cross in Paris just because ""we want an agreement at all cost."" He said that the other red lines concerned the necessity to have an agreement with a real balance between adaptation and mitigation; while the other is on the legally binding aspect of the expected agreement. ""We are not in Paris to re-write the Convention but to ensure its judicious implementation"", he said, charging that ""all African countries having drawn up their different INDCs in accordance with the Peru outcome, the time now is for implementation; and for all to abide by it. All parties to the COP21 including African countries are expected to express their INDCs--public declarations of post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under a new international agreement to help global mitigation ambitions, as well as adaptation goals within the context of their national priorities, circumstances and capabilities. With INDC submissions to date, global warming is expected to be maintained at 2.7 degrees Celsius, which is above the global ambition of 2 degrees Celsius increase. So far, out of the fifty-four African nations, fifty-three have submitted INDCs. The day began with an opening session chaired by the Ethiopian Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The AU Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Mrs. Tumusiime Rhoda Peace in her opening statement, stressed that the Africa Day is not about lamenting the risks and challenges posed by climate change, but instead to serve as an opportunity for the continent to showcase to the rest of the world solutions underway to mitigate these challenges, specifically through the development of INDCs. ""The Paris Climate COP is the pinnacle of the global climate change negotiations that has historic milestone from the Africa COP in Durban COP17"". It proofs the level of commitment by the global community in addressing the adverse impacts of climate change and reduction of the greenhouse gases"", she said. Mr. Carlos Lopes, Executive Secretary of the UNECA, said that it is important, therefore, that Africa's Parties submission on INDCs lead to the conclusion of a new agreement under the Convention that is in full conformity with its principles and provisions, in particular those of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. ""In addition, Annex I Parties need to make ""equitable and appropriate"" mitigation contributions towards achieving the objective of the Convention taking into account their cumulative historical responsibility and use of atmospheric space and resources and that cumulative emissions in Africa remain extremely low"", Mr. Lopes concluded. The contributions forthcoming from developed country Parties relating to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity are in a balanced manner in the context of a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2020. AfDB representative, Anthony Okon Nyong, speaking on behalf of Mr. Akinwumi Adesina, AfDB President noted that ""the vision of the African Heads of State and Government to embrace green growth and low carbon development for Africa's transformation outlined today are meant to propel us into a future which promotes sustainable development for generations to come."" ""Africa has come with solutions on renewable energy; adaptation and loss and damage"", he said. There were two technical presentations on INDCs by the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change and the UNECA. A Ministerial dialogue followed on INDCs showcasing Africa's readiness in addressing climate change, including its ability to deliver on its own potential with international cooperation in addition to the contribution of INDCs to the overall development of the continent. The ministerial dialogue was chaired by H.E Ambassador Ramtane Lamamra, Foreign Minister of Algeria; and vote of thanks was given by H.E Dr. Elham Ibrahim, Commissioner for Infrastructure & Energy, AUC while Ms. Olushola of the AUC served as a Master of Ceremony. Over 500 participants attended Africa Day, which saw the participation of high level delegates from the governments of Algeria; Cameron, Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda, in addition to the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change, African Union Commission, African Ministerial Conference on Environment, Pan-African Parliament, African Development Bank, East African Community, European Investment Bank, Green Climate Fund, International Labor Organization, NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency, Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, United Nations Development Program, and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK112","There's one last chance to slow climate change; Another View","June 2, 2015","i-Independent Print Ltd","It is becoming apparent that 2015 may be a critical year for the issue of climate change, in more ways than one. The obvious way, of course, is through the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) opening in Paris in six months, where the world community will try to agree a legally binding deal to limit the carbon emissions causing the atmosphere to warm (and for which the Global Apollo Programme to lower the cost of low-carbon energy, which we report on today on page 19, might play a vital role). The Paris conference may be the final chance the world gets to keep rising temperatures below the agreed danger threshold of 2C above the pre-industrial level. The last attempt to cut such a deal, at Copenhagen in 2009, collapsed amid fierce argument about who should do what, between the developed countries, led by the Americans, and the developing nations, led by the Chinese. This time around, some of the auguries are better, not least because last November the Americans and the Chinese announced their own bilateral climate accord, each agreeing to cut their carbon dioxide emissions to a greater degree than ever before and to work together to reach agreement. This is vital because these are the two biggest carbon emitters, between them accounting for 45 per cent of the global total (China with 29 per cent, and the US with 16 per cent). If there is a major obstacle remaining, it is the third-biggest emitter, India, currently with 8 per cent of the total, and rising. For India stresses its prime national objective is economic development to pull its 1.25 billion people out of poverty, and, at the moment, that will be powered by burning cheap coal. Whether or not India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi (pictured), will agree to have his country's vital development constrained by a legally binding emissions treaty remains to be seen; it looks very doubtful. However, there is something that may comprehensively alter the mood music of Cop21 , and give 2015 another significance for climate change altogether: this may be the year when the pause in the rapid progress of rising temperatures, which began after 1998, may be over. The fact that the soaring world temperatures of the 1980s and 1990s began to flatline has puzzled climate scientists (and given comfort to climate sceptics). Computer models predicted that the mercury would steadily go up as carbon poured into the sky, and pour it has - 40 billion tonnes a year, now; and two months ago the level of atmospheric CO2 crossed 400 parts per million for the first time (when scientists began to measure it in 1958 it was 315ppm). It is likely that its effect is being buffered in some way, perhaps with increased atmospheric heat being absorbed by the deep oceans. But climate scientists' view has always been that the obvious rise in global air temperatures will, sooner or later, resume; and there are signs that this is happening now. What might seem like such a sign is India's own current terrible heatwave, one of its worst ever, which, with temperatures approaching 50C, has claimed nearly 2,000 lives in 10 days; but this may be part of natural climate variability, and may end with the monsoon. We are on surer ground with the temperature figures. It appears that 2015 may be the hottest year ever recorded for the world, by some margin. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: ""The first four months of 2015 was the warmest such period on record across the world's land and ocean surfaces, at 0.80C (1.44F) above the 20thcentury average, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.07C (0.13F)."" Several countries of the world have already experienced national record temperatures, and on 14 March Antarctica experienced its warmest recorded day, at 17.4C (63.3F). Dr Johnson famously said: ""When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully."" If 2015 is the year in which climate change resumes its dramatic upward march, it may concentrate a lot of minds in Paris, come December. It appears that 2015 may be the hottest year ever recorded \"

Caf\'e9s and restaurants are scattered around the sprawling convention centre where the COP21 talks are being held, at Le Bourget airfield north of the city. Relaxation rooms, complete with bed-like sofas and soft lighting, dot the site, a welcome repose for delegates often forced to curl up on the floor at talks that typically end with at least one 24-hour-long session of haggling. Separate meditation rooms are also at hand should delegates wish to retreat from debates about historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and other fraught topics. For committed environmentalists, the lack of vegetarian dining options has been disconcerting. But conference organisers have done their best on other green fronts: drinks are served in plastic glasses that can be exchanged for a euro after use, all the better to cut down on waste. Delegates can also avoid taking a carbon-spewing taxi back to their hotel by booking one of the complementary electric cars at the convention centre exit. An official accreditation badge also secures a COP21 travel card that allows free travel on Paris trains and buses. It is all a far cry from the last attempt to strike a global climate accord limiting carbon emissions, in Copenhagen in 2009. Many delegates in Paris have bitter memories of standing in line for hours in the frigid Danish winter, waiting for overwhelmed officials to let them into the building. This time, attendees have been able to get their accreditation in minutes and the queues to pass through security have been relatively quick, despite fears that the recent terrorist attacks in Paris would lead organisers to take precautions causing logistical mayhem. But the soothing ambience inside the convention centre belies the determination of French officials to bring some forceful diplomacy to negotiations, aimed at delivering the first new global climate accord in 18 years. COP21 ambassador, has repeatedly said she wants decisions to be made in a calm and concerted fashion. This may be a forlorn hope. The dramatic speeches and protracted wrangling that mount as the closing days near mean that UN climate talks almost never end when they are supposed to. Some have gone two days over time.

The issue is not, and never has been, whether our planet undergoes continuous climate change (it does) nor is it about whether we should control pollutants in our atmosphere (we should). It is certainly not about whether we should find practical substitutes for finite fossil fuels (we must) nor whether we should reduce energy consumption. And of course we must prepare our resilience to extreme weather. The tragedy is that these perfectly reasonable objectives, well within the capacity of human ingenuity to achieve, have been hi-jacked by opportunistic political, ideological and commercial interests. Far from helping, they have diverted attention from immediate and doable objectives and alienated huge numbers of people with their insistent alarmism and lies over decades. COP21 in Paris was an organised panic forum designed to give every party with a proboscis into the trillion dollar climate change industry a chance to advance their special cause: scientists and Met Offices bidding for the next research grant; big business selling renewable technologies and leftist ideologues intent on destroying capitalism. Let us not forget the charities justifying another round of fund-raising to boost their pension pots; the market traders looking for the next big idea after having created the crisis of collaterised debt obligations; the new power-houses like China and India egging on the developed world to commit economic suicide and, beggar nations getting a last chance to rip the development aid ring before the developed world finally runs out of money. They have all done great damage. Along for the ride go our sucker politicians, people like President Barack Obama who claims ""the science is over"" when it has hardly begun and Prime Minister David Cameron who proposes diverting UK foreign development aid currently being used for education, health and job creation in poor countries towards this garbage.

However, the theme of the nations' capacity-building to address climate change has gone almost unnoticed. Education International (EI) consultant Richard Langlois, in Paris following the delegations, said that it is going to be a major challenge for the countries to develop their own capacity outside of a climate deal.

According to EI, this is one of the major aims of the section of the Article 8 of the Draft Agreement on climate change. In order to successfully shift societies away from carbon, EI argues that the sustained support of education systems is crucial to the process. Yet no agreement has been reached on the type of activities that need to be reinforced. Despite the fact that the COP21 discussions are nearing their end, the three other components being negotiated in this section are still outstanding, including increased aid from rich countries to poor countries, transparency measures and progress as well as the type of institutional arrangements required to implement the whole process. \"

The Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has initiated a project entitled 'World-Wide Views on Climate Change and Energy' that will see over 10,000 citizens around the world on Saturday discussing and deliberating upon these issues. Richier inaugurated the India chapter of the event in the run up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP-21 ) conference in the French capital later this year. ""As per the conference, the final agreements would be legally binding and articulated with national commitments. Each country would have its national contribution plan, but we will also have to see how each country can do under its given circumstances,"" added Richier. TERI Acting Director General Leena Srivastava said this is perhaps the first-of-its-kind initiative which seeks inputs from citizens ahead of the final decision-making process. ""It (citizen deliberations) is happening across the world and due to difference in time zones, by tomorrow, we believe the final outcome will come. ""As per the Paris conference, I think India is ready for that and it will make a significant contribution to it,"" she said. The idea is to come up with models that are real and seek co-operation with, among others, local governments and research bodies in achieving the final goal.

The installation is being done in partnership with French energy provider EDF, Schneider Electric, Aeroports de Paris, Paris City Council and SNCF, France's national railway company. The charging stations, several of which will be donated by Schneider Electric, will refuel 200 EVs serving as VIP shuttles for negotiators, delegates and media attending the conference. More than 20,000 U.N. participants from 195 countries are expected to attend the 21st annual Conference of Parties (known as COP21 ), from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. "" COP21 is a call to action to reduce the impact of climate change--including global warming resulting from personal transportation,"" said Renault-Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn. ""Electric vehicles are the only existing, practical and affordable transportation solution to our planet's environmental challenges - and they are available today. Expanding the EV infrastructure is mandatory for any city or state that's serious about environmental stewardship."" The quick and standard EV charging stations will use renewable and extremely low-carbon electricity from EDF, enabling the Renault-Nissan fleet to cover more than 400,000 km in two weeks. The quick charging stations will recharge EVs from 0 to 80% capacity in about 30 minutes. EVs consume any form of electricity used in the power grid, including hydropower, solar and wind energy. As countries reduce dependence on fossil fuels and increase reliance on renewable resources, EVs become even greener. Small carbon footprint The COP21 charging stations in the Paris region will use electricity with a small carbon footprint. The French power grid distributes electricity with a very low average of CO2 emissions per kWh: less than 40 g in 2014, compared to the European average of 325 g of CO2 emissions per kWh. Renewable energy accounted for about 19% of France's electricity last year. ""EDF supports the development of electric mobility, which is a cornerstone of countries' efforts to minimize urban pollution. EDF produces extremely low-carbon electricity in France, which enables a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and thus reinforces the favorable ecological footprint of this new generation of transport,"" said EDF Chairman and CEO Jean-Bernard Levy. In addition, EDF is offsetting the remaining CO2 emissions through carbon credits generated by projects certified by the United Nations. That means the Renault-Nissan EV fleet will use electricity considered fully ""decarbonized."" Fourteen of the 27 quick chargers installed will remain after the climate change conference and will be available for the public to use. These include two at Charles de Gaulle Airport, two on the Paris peripherique highway and one at Orly Airport. France already has about 10,000 quick and standard charging spots.

While there, Premier Wynne will promote Ontario's subnational leadership in fighting climate change and expand the province's relationships with other jurisdictions. COP21 is an opportunity to continue working together across countries, states and regions to find innovative ways to combat climate change and encourage economic growth in a more sustainable low-carbon economy. During the first part of the conference, the Premier will be part of the Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Delegation members will attend meetings and events to demonstrate, on the global stage, that Canada is committed to fighting climate change. Premier Wynne will return to Ontario and resume her legislative schedule and other activities on December 1. On December 6, the Premier will return to COP21 , where she will highlight the work of subnational governments in the fight against climate change. Premier Wynne will build on the success of this summer's Climate Summit of the Americas, where Ontario hosted 300 delegates to advance subnational leadership on climate change. As part of the summit, 23 jurisdictions, including Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, California and Vermont, signed the first-ever Pan-American action statement on climate change, affirming that state, provincial and municipal governments are leaders in climate action and acknowledging the need to work together to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The Premier will return to Ontario on December 9. Ontario has demonstrated its leadership by taking strong steps to fight climate change, including: - launching a new Climate Change Strategy that sets a path for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050, - closing all of Ontario's coal-fired electricity plants -- North America's largest initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- and becoming the first place in North America to pass legislation permanently banning coal-fired electricity in the province, - announcing plans to develop a cap and trade program and the province's intention to link it with California and Quebec under the Western Climate Initiative, and - becoming the first province in Canada to set a mid-term greenhouse gas target to reduce emissions by 37 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030. Ontario's broad approach to fighting climate change is working -- based on the most current data, Ontario has exceeded its 2014 greenhouse gas reduction target. The province is also well past the half-way point to meeting its 2020 target of 15 per cent below 1990 levels. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions while supporting growth, efficiency and productivity is part of the government's plan to build Ontario up. The four-part plan includes investing in people's talents and skills, making the largest investment in public infrastructure in Ontario's history, creating a dynamic, innovative environment where business thrives, and building a secure retirement savings plan. Quick Facts - On November 23, Premier Wynne met with the Prime Minister and Canada's Premiers to discuss the nation's plans for COP21 and climate change action. - Ontario's Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Glen Murray will attend COP21 from November 30 to December 11, 2015. - COP21 is an opportunity for national leaders from around the world to work together to combat climate change by creating a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK125","-EBRD 2016 Annual Meeting: In the Wake of COP21","May 4, 2016 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","A conversation with Lord Stern. The agreement reached at last December's COP21 conference in Paris put green finance firmly on the world stage. It demonstrated the urgency of taking action now on climate change. It also revealed the great opportunities that are presented by making the transition to a low-carbon economy. Nearly six months on, the challenge is to ensure the Paris Agreement has translated into concrete and swift steps forward. What actions have been taken so far? What remains to be done to ensure pledges are carried out? On 11 May, as part of the EBRD's Annual Meeting and Business Forum in London, Lord Stern, President of the British Academy and a former EBRD Chief Economist, will join Josue Tanaka, Managing Director for OSP, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change at the EBRD, to discuss the issues that have emerged following COP21 and the signing of the Paris Agreement. Why, for example, is it so vital that multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the EBRD take a leading role in stepping up green finance and encouraging the governments of the countries where they invest to make the transition to low-carbon economies? The Paris Agreement placed a major emphasis on the transfer of finance to support climate investments in emerging and developing economies. This is particularly relevant for the EBRD. Our region's average carbon intensity continues to be high - almost 5 times higher than the EU-28 average. As a result, the Bank has been scaling-up its climate finance activity over the past year. Cumulative EBRD climate finance since 2006 has reached close to EUR20 billion and 1,100 projects, with a private sector share of 67 per cent. The EBRD is continuing to support the countries where it operates in implementing their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions under the COP21 accord - which are the steps they are planning in order to reduce their own carbon emissions. The sustained focus of the Bank's investment remains on energy efficiency improvement in cities, industries? and utilities where the fastest carbon emissions reduction can be achieved. The EBRD is also an important investor in the development of renewable sources of energy while at the same time increasing its activity in climate adaptation finance. In order to achieve its ambitious climate finance goals, the EBRD launched its Green Economy Transition approach with the goal of green finance comprising 40 per cent of total Bank investments by 2020. This is the highest target share across MDBs and reflects the EBRD's commitment to make a major contribution in addressing urgent environmental challenges. Lord Stern shares this sense of urgency when it comes to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy and believes that processes for strong acceleration are vital to making the Paris Agreement work. 'Acceleration in action is vital to the management of climate change and taking the opportunities now available to us,' he explains in his recent book, Why Are We Waiting? The Logic, Urgency and Promise of Tackling Climate Change. Lord Stern is IG Patel Professor and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE and President of the British Academy. From 1994-99 he was Chief Economist at the EBRD and from 2005-07 was adviser to the UK Government on the Economics of Climate Change and Development, reporting to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Head of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK126","COP21 Paris climate talks: a beginner\u8217 s guide","FT.com"," ","The UN has been holding annual climate change talks for 20 years but the two-week HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/intl/paris-climate-talks COP21 meeting that starts in Paris on Monday is a much more significant meeting than most. Who is attending and what are they trying to achieve? About 40,000 ministers, officials, business executives, climate campaigners and journalists are expected to descend on the Le Bourget airfield convention centre north of central Paris. Delegates from 195 countries are due to finalise an agreement to cut global emissions of the greenhouse gases scientists warn are on track to warm the planet to risky levels. Governments have sought to do this since 1992, when they met in Rio de Janeiro and agreed the first global warming accord  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its chief aim was to stabilise greenhouse gases at a level that would avoid dangerous levels of warming. But with most of those gases coming from burning fossil fuels  which power almost every country\' s economy  the talks have been deadlocked for decades as governments bicker over the extent to which each should cut their emissions and who should bear the costs. Why is the meeting called COP21 ? COP is short for  conference of the parties to that 1992 Rio framework convention, which has now been ratified by 195 countries. There have been 20 COPs since 1995  and this is the 21st, or in UN-speak, COP21 . The 1997 Kyoto protocol treaty was supposed to fill in a big hole in the Rio framework convention by setting out legally binding targets for countries to meet specific emissions targets. However, it only applied to wealthy countries that now account for a dwindling share of global emissions, and the US never ratified it, largely because it did not require China to cut its pollution. To make up for Kyoto\' s deficiencies, countries tried to come up with a more universal climate deal in Copenhagen in 2009, at COP15. But that effort ended in acrimonious failure so a new round of negotiations was launched in 2011, aimed at coming up with a new accord in Paris that will require action from all countries, rich and poor. Is COP21 That depends on the definition of success. The Kyoto protocol showed it was impossible to force countries to cut emissions, so the new deal is based on voluntary action plans. More than 180 nations have tabled pledges since March. However, the commitments are not sufficient to prevent global temperatures warming more than 2C from pre-industrial levels, a threshold agreed at previous COPs. With a 1C increase nearly reached, scientists say evidence of a changing climate is already widespread, from rising sea levels to melting ice caps. The years 2011-15 were the warmest five-year period on record, the World Meteorological Organization reported last week. UN officials say a Paris accord could still be effective because many countries want the national pledges to be reviewed every five years so they can be strengthened. But it is unclear if all nations will agree to this. If the final accord does not include such measures, it is hard to see how it can be called a success. What are the main stumbling blocks to a deal? A large coalition of developing countries in the talks says it is unfair to expect them to stop using cheap, abundant coal and other fossil fuels unless rich nations give them a lot of money and technology to help them build cleaner energy systems. Rich countries agreed in 2010 to deliver $100bn a year by 2020 in so-called climate finance, from public and private sources, and the OECD recently reported that at least $62bn was provided in 2014. But India and other countries have questioned that figure and say the Paris accord must require wealthy countries to deliver more than $100bn a year after 2020. Developed countries are balking at including a specific figure in the agreement, arguing that today\' s governments cannot be responsible for setting budgets so far ahead. If they hold out, poorer countries may say they cannot sign up to a global deal requiring five-year review periods and other measures wanted by richer nations. Is that the only sticking point? No. A host of other disagreements revolve around issues such as the long-term goal of a new climate accord. Oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia would be happy to stick with the target of limiting warming to 2C. But other countries want to  operationalise this aim by spelling out a goal to cut emissions sharply by 2050 and phase out fossil fuel pollution by the end of the century. Scientists say the latter move is what needs to be done to stop irreversible and risky changes in the climate, and some companies say clear emissions targets would offer a better signal to guide investments. But because the UN accord must be agreed by consensus, it is far from clear if a long-term emissions goal beyond 2C will make it into a final agreement. \"

The final version of the Paris Decision and Agreement was released this weekend at the end of COP21 Included in the agreement was the 'just transition' provision, which is a framework for a fair and sustainable shift to a low carbon economy, proposed by trades unions and supported by environmental NGOs and organisations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO). It makes the case for meaningful environmental transition and sustainable development; representation and employee involvement; stable employment and long-term planning; social justice and a fair distribution of costs; and government backing and a united purpose. For trade unions, the three core issues involved in the 'just transition' are the importance of consultation, investment in low carbon technologies, and equipping working people with the skills for a low carbon, resource-efficient economy. There was concern, however, by some unions of the exclusion of 'just transition' measures in the draft Paris Outcome, but it has since been included in the final agreement, albeit in the preamble. The wording of the measure is ""clear and concise"", IndustriAll says, and ""better in some ways than past formulations"". It asks the parties to take into account ""the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities"". COP21 , and pressure them to deliver on that commitment."" The main aim of the annual COP agreement is to keep global warming below 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels and to try to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels. To reach these ambitious goals and help developing countries switch from fossil fuels to greener sources of energy, appropriate financial flows will be put in place, with the developing world providing US$100bn per year by 2020. IndustriAll said its 50m affiliated workers in the manufacturing, mining, and energy sectors will be among those first and most affected by measures to control climate change. ""The Paris Agreement must be seen as a starting point, not a finish line,"" said Jyrki Raina, IndustriAll's general secretary. ""It creates an institutional framework that has all the necessary ingredients to succeed. Whether it actually does, or not, is now up to us. IndustriAll must be ready to lead the way forward.""

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK133","Geneva Association issues paper on key implications of COP21 agreement for (re)insurance industry","February 14, 2016","Insurance Newslink","The Geneva Association has issued a paper summarising the key implications of the COP21 agreement for the insurance and reinsurance industry. It is clear from the explicit inclusion of insurance in the COP21 decisions and the Paris Agreement that both developed and developing countries recognise the importance of insurance as an integral part of national climate risk management strategies and the high potential for building financial resilience by expanding insurance. The outcomes of COP21 (and the Sendai Framework for DRR) have opened the doors for innovative insurance solutions, in both developed and developing nations. The insurance industry has the potential to contribute significantly to making societies more resilient with respect to the adverse effects of climate change and, at the same time, creating new business. The public sector is required to lay the institutional foundations, whilst the insurance industry is challenged to think and act more creatively to understand the risks, actively participate in defining the role of the private sector and consider new markets, products and strategies. To this end, active engagement in relevant public-private partnerships and closer cooperation amongst (re)insurance, policymakers, governments, regulators and other stakeholders is critical to paving the way. It seems inevitable that by 2020 the (re)insurance sector will not only be providing a wider range of risk-transfer solutions, but also be supporting emission reduction efforts and transitioning to a low-carbon economy through its investment strategies as well as actively managing its carbon footprint. Furthermore, with the agreements for the net-zero emission target by 2050, the (re)insurance industry has the opportunity to engage proactively with other key stakeholders to find the best investment strategies.

The fleet of 200 electric vehicles, which transported delegates during the two-week United Nations annual climate change conference in Paris, saved nearly 182 barrels of oil or 18 tonnes of CO2 not emitted while driving. The Renault-Nissan Alliance was the official passenger-car shuttle provider for COP21 , which ran from 30 November 2015 through 11 December 2015. The Alliance EV fleet was the world's largest electric-vehicle fleet ever provided to an international conference. The EVs made more than 3,800 transfers shuttling accredited delegates to and from hotels to the Bourget conference venue north of Paris. The fleet featured the Renault ZOE subcompact car, the Nissan LEAF compact car and the 7-seater Nissan e-NV200 van. Renault and Nissan employees volunteered as drivers and electric vehicle ambassadors for the cars, which were available to COP21 delegates as a complement to public transportation. COP21 marked the first time the UN used a 100% electric fleet for its entire passenger-car shuttle at a climate summit. COP21 also resulted in the Paris declaration on electro-mobility and climate change call for action, an agreement that aims to increase EVs and their charging infrastructure. The Renault-Nissan Alliance signed the action plan, which aims to keep the transport sector in line with the COP21 promise to reduce the impact of climate change. Quick charge stations available for public use The Renault-Nissan Alliance set up network of 90 quick and standard charging stations in strategic locations to recharge the cars. The stations were powered by low-carbon electricity provided by French electric utility company EDF. The residual emissions were offset under an accredited UN carbon offsetting program. Thirteen of the 27 quick and semi quick chargers installed will remain and are available for the public to use. These include two quick chargers at Charles de Gaulle Airport, two on the principal highway surrounding Paris, and one at Orly airport. The quick charging stations are able to charge an EV from 0 to 80% capacity in about 30 minutes. The Renault-Nissan Alliance is the global leader in zero-emission vehicles, accounting for half of all EVs on the road today. Together, Renault and Nissan have sold more than 280,000 electric vehicles since the Alliance's first electric vehicle Nissan LEAF went on sale in late 2010. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK135","COP21: corporate sponsors accused of \u8216 greenwashing\u8217 ","FT.com"," ","Corporate sponsors of the HYPERLINK Paris climate summit Criticism has been focused on two of France\' s largest utilities Engie and EDF while Paris-based bank BNP Paribas has also been hit with charges of hypocrisy in sponsoring the event, which starts on Monday.  Companies are looking at the climate conference as a business opportunity, using it as a way to make themselves look \' green\' while continuing with business as usual, said Pascoe Sabido, a campaigner at Brussels based-group Corporate Europe Observatory. According to a study by Corporate Accountability International, an environmental group, Engie and EDF collectively own 44 coal-fired power plants worldwide and produce more than 190 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions a year, roughly equivalent to all that produced by Belgium. BNP Paribas has also been criticised for its role in financing a range of  dirty fossil fuel projects, involved in financing the exploration of oil sands in Canada and Tata\' s controversial Mundra coal-fired power plant in Gujarat, India. Yet all these companies will get to be associated with an event that hopes be the most substantive climate agreement since the 1997 Kyoto protocol, aiming to keep global warming to below 2C from pre-industrial times. Sensitive to charges of hypocrisy, many sponsors of the event, which also includes Air France and Renault, have been making an effort to show they are becoming more environmentally friendly. Last week BNP Paribas said it would toughen its environmental criteria for financing coal plants, and stop lending altogether to companies that specialise in coal extraction. The tougher criteria mean that it will, in effect, stop funding the coal plants in rich countries, but not in developing ones. It also said that it was committed to doubling financing for renewable energy projects by 2020. Engie, the world\' s largest electricity producer, which operates 30 coal plants globally, last month said it will not invest in any new coal projects, adding that existing contracts will be honoured. EDF, which is mostly a nuclear group but also operates 16 coal plants, has said it wants renewable electricity production to rise from 28GW to 50GW by 2030 and is investing $2bn a year in renewable energy capacity worldwide. But many environmental groups say the companies are misrepresenting their green credentials, while many even fear that their sponsorship of the event could influence the final agreement.  It is in part a way for companies to leverage opinion inside the event, said Jean-Fran\'e7ois Julliard, head of Greenpeace France.  The companies will try and use it to influence the events, he said. The French government and the UN, which is organising the Paris Cop 21 climate summit, has made a big effort to involve big business, however, and not just to meet a fifth of the \€ 170m bill for organising it. Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, said business needed to be part of the process, and praised those companies that had made commitments to reduce emissions.  [Success] is going to require action today and tomorrow and everyone needs to get on board  from governments and corporations to cities, regions and individuals, she said in September. Companies around the world have lined up to communicate their support for reaching an agreement in Paris, including chief executives from 10 of the world\' s largest oil and gas groups in October. Many companies have added that coal and other fossil fuels will remain a key part of the energy mix for years to come, and companies will still need to provide this. BNP Paribas, alongside its announcement last week, said there had to be a  gradual transition to a less carbon-intensive economy in much of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Claude Nahon, vice-president for sustainable development at EDF, said the Paris event was partly a marketing opportunity, but only to show how environmentally friendly the company is. She said EDF, with 77 per cent of its energy coming from nuclear power and 10 per cent from renewables, emits only 100g of CO2 per kWh rather than the 500g-600g average for utilities globally. This article has been changed to make clear that between them EDF and Energie own 44 coal-fired power plants worldwide not 46 as previously stated. \"

The European Union is today announcing a contribution of EUR125 million to finance emergency actions in countries affected by the extreme weather phenomenon 'El Ni\'f1o' in Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America. The support, EUR119 million of which comes from the European Development Fund reserves, and a further EUR6 million from the humanitarian budget, will contribute to the joint effort of bringing lifesaving emergency assistance and increasing resilience in the affected countries. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP21 ), European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides said: ""EU aid will help meet the urgent needs of the affected populations, but it will also support resilience efforts, making them better equipped to face natural disasters in the future. At present, El Ni\'f1o is already affecting millions of people in many vulnerable regions especially in Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, and is expected to continue to do so in the next months. "" European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, said: ""We need to react now so El Nino does not undermine the efforts in poverty alleviation in many countries in the world that we have fought so hard to achieve. Today the EU is boosting its efforts to prevent a crisis that could cause instability in the longer term."" What EU aid will do: The EU's support will combine humanitarian and development assistance, to address immediate needs of nutrition, water and sanitation, health and shelter. It will provide support to health structures, provision of food and safe drinking water, supplementary food for pregnant women and children. It will also help build resilience in the most exposed countries by enhancing disaster preparedness, early response mechanisms, and supporting long-term development solutions. What is El Ni\'f1o and which parts of the world are affected: The 'El Ni\'f1o' phenomenon is characterised by rising temperatures of surface sea water, which interact with the atmosphere and cause different extreme events, from floods to droughts. It is already affecting large regions of Africa - Central Africa, Greater Horn of Africa, and Southern Africa - with both floods and droughts. These are having consequences mainly on food security, but also on health, access to water and hygiene conditions of millions of people living in already vulnerable regions. The worst-hit country so far is Ethiopia, reporting an increase in the number of food insecure people due to drought from 2.9 million in January 2015 to 8.2 million in October 2015. Central America and the Caribbean region are also being severely affected, in particular Guatemala and Haiti. More than 6 million people are estimated to be suffering from the current drought, which is considered to be the most severe in the region in more than 100 years and expected still to worsen. The lack of water has an enormous impact on crops, livestock, reservoirs and the livelihoods of a substantial proportion of the population. With about 34 million people affected worldwide, and the most virulent impact ever expected to take place, the phenomenon demands a coordinated global response.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK141","-Survey: Future business leaders urge COP21 to reach climate deal","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Climate change is one of the key issues of our time and business must help to address it now by investing in sustainable and green technologies. This is one of the main findings from a survey of young entrepreneurs in the European Union. The ThinkYoung/3M Survey, launched in Paris today, asked current and aspiring entrepreneurs for their views on how business can best contribute to fighting climate change and on what they expect from the COP21 UN conference. '92% of young Europeans indicate that they see climate change as one of the most important issues that the world is facing. This is a strong message from future business leaders that today's negotiators in Paris need to take to heart,' said Andrea Gerosa, Founder and Chief Thinker at ThinkYoung. 'Many world leaders speaking at COP21 have stressed we need to act on climate change for the sake of future generations. It is clear that the next generation of business leaders expect them to take the necessary measures,' he added. The survey of 500 young entrepreneurs from across the 28 member states of the EU also revealed that they see a combination of technology and legislation as the best way to tackle the problem. 'It is encouraging to see that 80% of young business leaders believe that developing sustainable technologies is the most effective means of fighting climate change. I fully agree with them,' said Guenter Gressler, President for Europe at 3M, the global sustainable technology provider. In addition to emphasising the importance of technology, 67% of the respondents cited existing and future climate legislation as an effective means for fighting climate change. 'This underlines the need for clear rules to promote environmentally-friendly products and behaviour. It is a strong message for policy-makers to take responsibility in shaping a sustainable future,' said Maxime Bureau, Director, Government & Public Affairs for 3M in Europe. Three out of four survey respondents also stated that they are likely or very likely to purchase certified eco-friendly products for their company. 'This is consistent with their support for a predictable public policy with clear rules,' said Maxime Bureau. 'To have environmentally-friendly products, we need to develop common policies and standards that stimulate and reward sustainable innovation.' The survey also revealed that female entrepreneurs are more convinced than their male peers about the need to invest in green technology (56% v 42%) and in eco-friendly purchasing (32% v 23%). Regarding the outcome of COP21 , more than half of the young business leaders wish to see an international, binding agreement on climate change. 'Practically all respondents said they want world leaders to find an agreement in Paris on how to address the global challenge of climate change. For the majority, such a climate deal should be binding,' explained Andrea Gerosa. 'The message from the future is clear: Let's agree and face the challenge together,' Gerosa added. ABOUT THE SURVEY 3M and ThinkYoung have teamed up to canvas the views of young entrepreneurs on what they expect from the COP21 UN conference and how business can best fight climate change. The findings are the result of an online survey aimed at aspiring, current, and climate change focused entrepreneurs. The survey was conducted between 30 October and 23 November 2015.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK143","\line ","COP21","UN ","BMI View: The global politics of climate change are shifting, with Asia - specifically China and India - emerging as key negotiation partners due to their prominence in the global energy market. The widespread implementation of policies across Asia, which tackle emissions on the supply and demand side of the power sector, will be crucial if any meaningful reduction in global emissions post-2020 can be achieved. This report will examine the changing energy dynamics in the North America and Western Europe (NAWE) and Asia markets, which is resulting in Asia having an increasingly prominent role in global climate change negotiations - specifically the UN 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference (UN COP21 ). The NAWE region, particularly the US and EU countries, have long-been the focus of climate change negotiations; paving the way for developing countries to follow in terms of implementing targets and carbon emissions policies. However, Asia's emerging status as the global energy powerhouse, not to mention the region's heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation, has shifted the spotlight onto Asian climate policies. We will assess the various policy initiatives that are beginning to gain traction in Asian power markets and review their potential effectiveness in tackling the region's rising carbon emissions: carbon reduction policies on the supply-side of power generation ; for example, the adoption of non-thermal sources in the power mix, the introduction of emissions trading schemes and the removal of fossil fuel subsidies. Progress in implementing these initiatives has been made to a varying degree, yet further efforts will be needed. Secondly, given our expectations for Asian electricity consumption to surge over the next decade, we believe there is significant opportunity to tackle rising emissions by curbing electricity demand. As such, we will examine We believe if any meaningful reduction in global emissions post-2020 is to be achieved as part of the UNCOP21 negotiations, there will need to be widespread environmental policy implementation across Asia and a greater recognition of the region's importance in climate change negotiations. \"

""The global climate map is engaging 500 young people from 65 countries,"" Zayn Abaakil, a UNICEF child engagement coordinator, told the UN News Centre in one of the conference halls of the UN climate change conference ( COP21 ) where dozens of innovative climate projects are being showcased over the next two weeks. The idea behind the project, she said, is for young people to show the link between climate issues and the impacts they see every day that are affecting their health and access to education. The UN agency recently reported that more than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrences, while 160 million are in high drought severity zones. ""They see all the contributions from other young people,"" explained Ms. Abaakil, and ""they understand that the issue is a global one, that they are all connected around the same problem, but also learn from each other, look at the best practices that have been done from different places, and connect."" Seven UNICEF youth ambassadors have travelled from all corners of the globe to attend COP21 , display their findings, and exchange stories - this time in person. One of them is Andozile Simwinga, a driven18-year old Zambian student who said the impacts of climate change on his country are affecting his self-esteem. ""Things, they don't actually move the way they're supposed to move and young people are not happy the way they should be,"" he said energetically. Despite talking about an issue that clearly causes him distress, Mr. Simwinga couldn't hide the enthusiasm he feels being in Paris and contributing to this global event. ""[The effect of climate change] has really made me feel low - I go out of my house every day and I look at the environment. People have cut down trees, there's deforestation everywhere. I want to do environmental studies but what am I going to address? What am I going to talk about? What am I going to tell [...] my children and also the future generations? We had trees here; we had different types of animals. So it really has affected my self-esteem."" Meanwhile, 22-year-old Bellinda Raymond traveled from Malaysia to attend the Conference of Youth prior to heading to COP21 . She described herself as an active citizen, someone who engages with members of her indigenous community, especially ahead of major weather events that have the potential to destroy homes and vital surroundings. She said her grandparents weren't affected by climate change in the ways she is today. ""As an indigenous person, we depend on the forest and rivers for our daily life - and we also have our traditional system, also related to the climate. The weather is now unpredictable and we need to adapt to the environment that's changing,"" Ms. Raymond said. Asked what the worse effect of climate change has been on her community, she answered floods. ""Because last time, when the rain came, it was still okay for us, but now just two hours of rain [and] it's already flooding and has caused a lot of damage; people cannot go to work, and it's difficult to access the outside."" As youth ambassadors celebrated 'Young and Future Generations Day' at COP21 on Thursday, government delegations continued to negotiate a new climate agreement which the world's people hope will be ambitious enough to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, and prevent further degradation of the planet.

Mr Turnbull intends to head to Paris for the major global conference in December, armed with a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26-28 per cent on 2005 levels.\~ But the Labor leader suggested this will fail to make a significant impact on climate change and will serve as merely a means of raising his social media profile.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK149","A COP21 disturbance in the force","FT.com"," ","In two weeks time, 195 delegations at COP21 will gather in Paris in an attempt to tackle climate change. The goal of the 2015 UN climate change talks? A deal to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. But it\' s unclear exactly what will come out of Paris. Beyond any overarching agreement or policy, attendees would do well to remember the actual people who would be working in the changing energy landscape. With the difficulties of transitioning from a high carbon to low carbon environment, plus the potential disruption of automation and robots, going green is filled with many potential landmines for the workforce. Just last week, BoE chief economist Andy Haldane HYPERLINK http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/864.aspx sounded the alarm about the threat of robot labour to the tune of 15m UK jobs. And the most at-risk occupations from automation  involving administrative, clerical and production tasks  typically are the lowest paid. Plus, moving toward a low carbon economy will likely require trillions of dollars in investments just over the next 15 years. What will happen to employment as the energy sector and governments make moves to go green? US secretary of state John Kerry HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/79daf872-8894-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896.html#axzz3reUVyEyg told the FT that the talks would not deliver a  treaty or any legally binding agreement requiring countries to cut their carbon emissions. The EU and some other countries disagree  if it\' s not legally binding, what\' s the point? But forget all that politicking for a moment. No matter what does or does not get signed at the climate summit, renewable energy sources are already shifting the employment landscape. Take the UK, for one, where a recent BIS report found the country\' s low carbon economy now supports more than 460,000 jobs. That\' s about 1.5 per cent of all UK jobs, and the number employed has been going up an average rate of 3.8 per cent for each year: (BIS 2015: HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416240/bis-15-206-size-and-performance-of-uk-low-carbon-economy.pdf Size and Performance of the UK Low Carbon Economy . Figures in the March report are for 2013 and include supply chains.) And one should take any and all roadmaps with a grain of salt, but it\' s worth noting the EU wants it known there is  a HYPERLINK http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0112 roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050. Whatever happens at COP21 , some investment and finance is shifting from a high carbon to low carbon environment, and with that comes the question of how employment will be impacted as renewable energy jobs replace high carbon gigs. As the International Energy Agency HYPERLINK http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2015/151110_WEO2015_presentation.pdf predicts in its World Energy Outlook 2015 report , out last week, the renewables sector is set to expand even more rapidly in the years ahead: How should governments and the private sector plan for an orderly transition in the economy as they deal with creating sustainable jobs, training workers to shift sectors, closing some fossil fuel plants, and sorting out the subsequent impact those shifts will have in local communities\' economies? It\' s important to look past the Paris talks, where it\' s likely the carbon emissions chatter will overwhelm everything else, on this issue, according to Fiona Reynolds, managing director of the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. As she told FT Alphaville, part of any comprehensive strategy should include more than just touting job creation  it demands transitional planning and lots of money to make the low carbon shift and account for the workers in the sector. We need to start getting money actually to move into the low carbon economy. That will be the next focus for us, because governments alone will not be able to fund this. There will be huge amounts of private sector money needed [in order to deal with the employment transition]. The World Bank predicted in April that  over the next 15 years, the global economy will require an estimated $89 trillion in infrastructure investments across cities, energy, and land-use systems, and $4.1 trillion in incremental investment for the low-carbon transition to keep within the internationally agreed limit of a 2 degree Celsius temperature rise. And as the IEA pointed out last week in its HYPERLINK http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/weo2015/ annual outlook , many parts of the world are already undergoing an energy sector transition. From its WEO 2015 factsheet: Policies to support the transition are increasingly being adopted, the US Clean Power Plan and China\' s newly announced carbon trading scheme to take effect in 2017 being among the most recent. Supportive policies led to the installation of a record high 130 GW of renewables capacity in the power sector in 2014; collectively, renewables secured their position as the second-largest source of electricity, behind coal. Energy efficiency improvements helped restrain the growth in final energy demand in 2014 to just one-third of the level it would otherwise have been. The coverage of energy efficiency regulations in industry, buildings and transport has nearly doubled, rising from 14% of the world\' s energy consumption in 2005 to 27% in 2014. And, looking ahead at global energy trends to 2040, the IEA sees: The world\' s appetite for electricity lifts demand by more than 70% by 2040, and there is a concerted effort to reduce the environmental consequences of power generation. Renewables overtake coal as the largest source of electricity by the early-2030s and account for more than half of all growth over the period to 2040. Renewables-based generation reaches 50% in the European Union by 2040, around 30% in China and Japan, and above 25% in the United States and India. Coal\' s share of total electricity generation drops to 30% in 2040, and the output from inefficient sub-critical plants declines by 45%. So the time seems right to start assessing the impact on the workers in the transition to the so-called low carbon economy of the future. Otherwise, Reynolds suggests things could end up replicating the tech world, where  the people who are developing the new technologies are making a fortune, but the other people on the other end of that, the people driving the Ubers, for instance, are really in very low paid, precarious jobs. Some people are benefiting  the investors, the entrepreneurs  but not really the workers.We have been so focused on Paris and what it means and getting people to the table.  Everything is about the lead up to Paris, rather than the day we wake up afterwards. No matter what COP21 nails down, the energy sector and global governments will have more than the good news of more low carbon jobs to contend with  there will also be the problem of what such a major shift in employment really means for everyone.

During a dedicated transport day at the Paris climate change conference COP21 , PIANC launched its plan jointly with a number of related associations, together calling themselves the Think Climate Coalition. Supporting the drive as a member of the coalition is the International Dry Bulk Terminals group. Executive director Ian Adams told IHS Fairplay that the drive was motivated by a significant lack of awareness about the potential impacts of climate change including sea level rise, frequency of extreme conditions, and availability or appropriateness of technical solutions. The current situation, said a coalition press release, has led to a lack of action justified by a lack of information on measures that can be taken. Part of the group's 2015-2020 action plan is to provide guidance ""to help users look for the low-hanging fruit - cheap and relatively easy solutions; to consider 'no regrets' solutions - i.e. good practice solutions that can prove beneficial for other reasons, irrespective of rates of change in climate parameters; and adaptive management solutions whereby monitoring outcomes inform decisions as to next steps"", said Adams. The plan, which is called Navigating a Changing Climate, identifies action steps. Working groups to tackle specific areas of need are already under way and the need for others will be identified in the coming months, he said. Asked how the group will track how much awareness is rising, Adams said there would be a number of indicators. He explained, ""Many of these indicators will be anecdotal, but they include: the number of organisations registering as supporters; publication downloads; attendance at events and workshops/offers to host or run such events; numbers of visitors to the resources on partner associations' websites and particularly to the web-based resources that will be developed over the five years of the plan.""

Speaking at the India Pavilion during the recent United Nations Climate Conference in Paris, Arun Sharma, chairman and managing director for IRClass stressed the need to utilise the most cost-efficient and low-carbon emission sea mode in transport cargoes. In his opinion, shipping remains the most energy-efficient mode of transport, carrying almost 90% of the world trade yet only accounts 2.2% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore for him, shipping cargoes cannot be replaced completely by road and rail transport. ""There is a need to choose the most efficient mode for long haul, while relatively shorter first mile and last mile connectivity can be accomplished via other modes,"" said Sharma. Listing India as an example, where majority of the cargo movement within the country is done via roads, followed by rail. Sharma suggested the use of inland waterways and the need of coastal shipping to bring down the carbon footprint significantly in India. ""The mitigation measures available to reduce the emission levels are technical and operational,"" explained Sharma. ""While technical measures have significant potential for emission reduction requiring initial investment, the operational measures can have an immediate emission reduction, but in incremental measures,"" he said. Sharma highlighted that India can learn from the 'Marco Polo Project' in Europe where a fund was created to grant financial support to companies in using greener transport modes to ease road congestion and pollution. ""The great degree of success through the Marco Polo Project in Europe which can be replicated and adapted to Indian conditions,"" concluded Sharma. \"

Jo Johnson, the universities minister, said that the existing system of Disabled Students' Allowances ""may have removed the urgency of some higher education providers to expand provision for all disabled students"" and that, from 2016-17, English institutions should take ""primary responsibility"" for a number of areas of support. In a written statement, Mr Johnson said that while DSAs would continue to be available, they should serve to ""complement the support put in place"" by universities. The changes mean that, from September next year, universities rather than the government will be responsible for funding the provision of non-medical support staff, such as note takers. More specialist roles such as sign language interpreters will still be funded via DSAs. The cuts had been planned for 2015-16, but were postponed to give universities more time to prepare. Climate change Global network's call to action A global network of university and student sustainability associations has urged governments to acknowledge and support academic research aimed at addressing climate change. An open letter from members of Global Alliance, which represents higher and further education sustainability networks, calls for ministers to recognise the role of universities in helping to address climate change, and also to aid institutions in embedding sustainable development education in curricula. The letter asks governments to ""invest significant financial support"" and to use university campuses as a ""leverage agent"" to accelerate the transition to clean energy sources. It was due to be handed to Laurent Fabius, foreign minister of France and president of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP21 ), which is being held in Paris until 11 December.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK155","After COP-21 - where does nuclear stand?","January 8, 2016 Friday","Progressive Media - Company News","It was entirely predictable that the nuclear industry achieved precisely nothing at the recent Paris COP-21 talks and in the subsequent international agreement. The agreement reached in Paris was maybe remarkable in that 196 countries managed to agree about something, particularly after the fiasco at the previous talks in Copenhagen, but what was achieved lacks any teeth. Amongst all the predictable back-slapping that accompanied the accord is the fact that the only guarantee is continued high fossil fuel emissions. The onus is therefore upon the major economic powers, notably the United States, China and the European Union, to define a feasible path to carbon-free energy and drag the rest of the world along. Analysis of the submissions of the 196 governments that signed up to the Paris agreement, demonstrating their own individual schemes on how to reduce national carbon emissions, show that nearly all of them exclude nuclear power. The future is likely to repeat the experience of 2015 when 10 new reactors came into operation worldwide but 8 shut down. So as things stand, the industry is essentially running to stand still. The additional 1000 or 2000 reactors needed by 2050 for nuclear to take up the place allocated for it in the energy scenarios are a long way away. It is becoming increasingly clear that it is the understanding of radiation and reform of the international regime which protects the public which is the most crucial. So long as any incremental dose of radiation, however small, is regarded as potentially harmful, the nuclear industry has little chance of fulfilling its potential. The challenge is essentially to get the linear no threshold (LNT) theory of radiation exposure consigned to the dustbin of history.

President and Chief Executive Officer Danny Roderick stated, 'The road from Paris to a low-carbon, climate-friendly future is long. The clock is ticking. We need to start work now to implement the global climate deal. Everyone has finally recognized that all low-carbon technologies are needed. Governments must continue the momentum and create stable and supportive national and regional regulatory systems for them. We need to get this right with clear, consistent and workable rules.' Westinghouse, the global nuclear technology leader, has been at the forefront of the nuclear industry's drive to raise awareness about the contribution of low-carbon nuclear energy to the health of our planet. The Paris agreement signals a broader understanding of the fact that a combination of wind, solar, hydro and nuclear is needed. This change in approach will be helpful in creating a better environment for investment, according to Roderick, 'The message from COP21 is clear: it's time to redirect investment and financing from carbon-intensive fossil fuels to building a new generation of nuclear power plants for security of future energy supply.' 'We cannot risk creating a situation in which we want clean, reliable and affordable electricity, but are not able to provide it because we failed to plan, invest and build when we could. New energy infrastructure that will last for 50 years or more cannot be built overnight. We need careful, long-term planning of investments and construction,' he added. Westinghouse Electric Company, a group company of Toshiba Corporation (TKY:6502), is the world's pioneering nuclear energy company and is a leading supplier of nuclear plant products and technologies to utilities throughout the world. Westinghouse supplied the world's first commercial pressurized water reactor in 1957 in Shipping port, Pa., U.S. Today, Westinghouse technology is the basis for approximately one-half of the world's operating nuclear plants, including more than 50 percent of those in Europe.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK158","-Consider Nuclear Energy on Par in Climate Change Mitigation, IAEA at COP21","December 15, 2015 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","In weighing the energy options for mitigating climate change, nuclear energy should be considered on equal footing with other low-carbon energy sources for its broader potential for contributions to sustainable development, said IAEA Energy Economist Loreta Stankeviciute at the Paris climate conference on Thursday. 'Nuclear energy compares favourably across many sustainability indicators,' stated Stankeviciute, presenting at the COP21 side event entitled Why the Climate Needs Nuclear Energy, co-hosted by the IAEA and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). Nuclear power has a low impact on human health and the environment, as compared to other sources of electricity, especially fossil fuels. Future nuclear technologies can further reduce the volume and radioactivity of high level radioactive waste. However, nuclear energy does require a significant amount of water for cooling, but higher efficiencies in advanced technologies can reduce these needs in the future, Stankeviciute added. 'Nuclear energy also contributes to sustainable development in a societal context,' said Stankeviciute. 'It creates economic growth and new jobs. Skilled labour is necessary to design and operate nuclear power plants.' The IAEA is currently working on a detailed report on the nexus between nuclear power and sustainable development. This echoes the statement by IAEA Deputy Director General Mikhail Chudakov earlier this week to consider nuclear energy as sustainable energy because it has low life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and has the potential, with innovative technologies, to serve humanity and bolster development effectively for a very long time. 'By addressing key Sustainable Development Goals, nuclear energy has potential macro-economic benefits,' said David Shropshire, Head of the Planning and Economic Studies Section of the IAEA, at the side event. 'The IAEA is looking at developing tools, training courses and expert and review missions to help Member States analyze these macro-economic benefits.' A joint publication of the NEA and IAEA, Guidance Document for Measuring Employment Generated by the Nuclear Power Sector, will be published in early 2016. Taking place from 30 November to 11 December 2015 in Paris, France, the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides countries the opportunity to present their climate change strategies and reach a legally binding agreement on climate change. The IAEA has had an exhibit in the One UN Exhibit Area and will co-host this side event again on Why the Climate Needs Nuclear Energy on Friday, 11 December 2015, at 11:15-12:45 at the OECD Workspace, Blue Zone, Hall 3, Plot 7.

Unesid has criticised exceptions made for developing countries, especially China, at the COP-21 Sustainable Innovative Forum for climate change in Paris, which ended on December 11. Countries such as China """" responsible for around 30% of global emissions """" India and Brazil have so far refused to accept formal commitments to reduce their industrial emissions. Unesid said that, as a result, developing countries ""will enjoy an even greater competitive advantage"" over industries in Europe and other developed regions. ""The main industrial sectors compete globally, so these exceptions in certain countries constitute a breach of the rules of the free market and fair competition,"" Unesid said. The association described the case of China as ""particularly striking"", as despite the country's high per-capita emissions growth, its commitment ""remains very limited"". ""The European Commission and the governments of the member states must take care with any implementation arising on climate change in the European Union, so that the revision of the emissions trading scheme does not further erode the competitiveness of our industry,"" Unesid added. The association's comments echo those made by Eurofer, the European steel association, which called for more action to create ""equal climate targets"" for all signatories. German steel federation WV Stahl also described the outcome of the conference as ""disappointing"", and said that the EU steel industry would be ""disadvantaged"" by the global emissions plan. Unesid acknowledged that COP-21 includes steps ""in the right direction"", such as requiring developed countries to help to fund the transition to low carbon in less developed economies and increased transparency and comparison of signatories' data.

The African Development Bank announced on Thursday, December 17 that it has joined the Inclusive Green Growth Partnership, a new collaboration between the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), multilateral development banks and United Nations agencies to address policy barriers and promote social inclusion at the country level to accelerate financing for green growth projects. The Partnership was launched during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris ( COP21 ). Many African countries lack the critical financial and technical capacity to embark upon ambitious climate-friendly projects. GGGI partners with countries to help them build economies that grow strongly, are more efficient and sustainable in the use of natural resources, less carbon intensive, and more resilient to climate change. GGGI works with countries around the world, building their capacity and working collaboratively on green growth policies that can impact the lives of millions. The Partnership will therefore leverage GGGI's technical experience to build capacity to develop green capital projects, support efforts to promote readiness for climate finance, and prepare green investment projects that attract private capital. Speaking about the Partnership, AfDB Manager for Environment and Climate Change, Kurt Lonsway, stated, 'Inclusive and green growth are part of the AfDB's Ten Year Strategy and are central to the AfDB's aims to deliver such growth sustainably over the long term. Through the Inclusive Green Growth Partnership, the AfDB will be better able to collaborate among international experts in identifying opportunities and investments which deliver upon these objectives through more equitable growth models that create employment and raise incomes in regional member countries.'

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK162","Industry weighs in on COP21 climate risk talks","December 2015","Reactions","For two weeks in December, global leaders gathered at the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, the so-called COP21 , to discuss how to limit global warming. Time is against them. The UK's Met Office estimates that global temperatures between January and September of this year were already one degree Celsius above the 1850-1900 average. This is halfway towards the two degrees increase that governments have committed to combating as a benchmark limit to avoid catastrophic levels of warming. According to the World Meteorological Organization, more than 370,000 people died in extreme weather incidents between 2001 and 2010, marking a 20% rise over the previous decade. Record-beating warm weather worldwide so far in 2015 could make it the hottest year on record, according to rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P). Peter Hoeppe, head of the geo risks research at Munich Re, doubts an agreement will be reached to limit to global warming to two degrees Celsius. ""Politicians are now more aware of the acuteness of the problem than ever before, and commitments to reduce emissions have never been so significant. Yet it is unlikely that an agreement will be made in Paris to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius,"" said Hoeppe. ""It is important that the biggest polluters """" in particular China, the USA, the EU, India and Russia, which are together responsible for approximately 70% of current emissions """" assume responsibility for their share,"" he said. ""It also makes much more financial sense for states to decarbonise their economies than to fork out increasingly large sums for safety measures and damage caused by natural hazards, not to mention the human suffering involved."" Overall, in 44 natural catastrophes in 38 countries, climate change increases the expected once-in-250-years damage-to-value ratio significantly, on average by about 25%, according to S&P figures. ""The negative rating impact of the catastrophes due to climate change increases accordingly on average by about 20% compared to a scenario not including climate change,"" the rating agency said. However, important differences exist among the sovereigns covered in S&P's assessment. A report by the rating agency highlighted the climate risk threat to the ratings of sovereign states. The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Vietnam and Thailand are among those expected to be hit hardest, Standard &Poor's (S&P) estimated, focusing on flood risk and tropical cyclones. The impact of climate change is far more important for emerging and developing sovereigns than the advanced economies. ""Regarding Thailand, the impact is particularly severe: It doubles the potential flood damage compared to a status-quo scenario without climate change,"" said S&P. Nevertheless, developed countries are still expected to see much higher potential direct damage. For example, potential damage from tropical cyclones in the US, New Zealand, or Japan would be higher by 45%, 50%, and 64%, respectively. However, the impact of floods in Europe appears to be quite small, S&P's simulations suggest. Hoeppe thinks more focus needs to be put on limiting the effects of change which is already inevitable. ""As climate change cannot be stopped any more adaptation becomes more urgent. Insurance can be part of the solution,"" he said. ""For emerging and developing countries in particular, climate insurance is an efficient way to cushion the economic impact from natural catastrophes, and secure better opportunities for sustainable economic growth."" In the run up to COP21 , the Geneva Association think-tank said 68 re/insurance chief executives had pledged their support on climate resilience and adaptation industry efforts. The ""instrumental role"" of global re/insurance ""in being part of the solution to manage and reduce risks of climate risk"" was highlighted in the statement. Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO and chairman of the Geneva Association's board, spoke in Paris to promote climate resilience under the proposed ""~anticipate, absorb and reshape (A2R) Framework'. ""As we work urgently to prepare the world's people for the impacts of climate change, it is obvious that much of the resilience work ahead is right in our industry's wheelhouse,"" said McGavick. ""Our products increasingly replace failing infrastructure with sustainable solutions, including efforts to use natural ecosystems where manmade weather defenses fall short. We also create products to accelerate the financial viability of alternative energy,"" he said. McGavick also announced that the industry will join policymakers in the launch of an initiative to reduce the impact of natural disasters and climate change in emerging markets. The initiative, called the Insurance Development Forum, will be co-chaired by XL Group's executive deputy chairman Stephen Catlin. ""The forum is a joint effort of partners such as the UN Development Programme, the World Bank and member governments, who will convene adjacent to next year's IMF-World Bank Spring meetings and UN General Assembly. It is hoped this forum can help accelerate A2R efforts,"" added McGavick. \"

'When it comes to climate change that hour is almost upon us.' The Martin Luther King. Jr. quotation comes from an April 4, 1967 speech at New York City's famed Riverside Church, in which he framed the war as a choice between 'non-violent coexistence or violent co-annihilation.' King's lengthy oration came one year to the day before an assassin's bullet would kill him. He said of the then-intensifying Vietnam conflict that Americans were\~'confronted with the fierce urgency of now.' 'In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity.' Obama sang from the same hymnal on Monday, telling an assembly of world leaders that a future of environmental devastation 'is one that we have the power to change right here right now but only if we rise to this moment,' according to a White House press pool report. 'I've come here personally as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second largest emitter to say that the United States of America ... embraces its responsibility to do something about it.'

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK164","Private capital, politics, and the Paris commitment","May 24, 2016 Tuesday 12:00 PM GMT","Private Equity International","Traveling to London to speak at the PEI-PRI Responsible Investment Forum this week, I couldn't help but reflect on the stormy political weather on both sides of the Atlantic. The US and UK face uncertain civic and economic futures as a result of a highly polarised election in the US and, in the UK, the looming possibility of a ""Brexit"". In these volatile conditions, issues of global significance, particularly environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns, can be overlooked. This creates an opportunity-and a responsibility-for the private sector to lead and continue to show progress in ESG engagement. A recent report by the Institute of European Environmental Policy concluded that the UK's environment would be highly vulnerable without EU regulation. Similarly, the ability of sustainability legislation in the US to survive partisan crossfire is questionable. The framework of ESG regulation may prove to be unstable, yet international agreements have been made -at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris last November, the US committed to a 26- to 28-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, including new regulations to rein in CO2 emissions from automobiles and power plants as well as methane from fossil fuel production. The US has not, however, identified the means it will deploy to achieve a third of the promised reductions. The Paris commitments are even more fragile when it comes to fast-growing emitters in the developing world such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, where economic and political turmoil often take precedence over ESG concerns. Developing countries made promises to implement massive new wind and solar power generating capacity. Without renewable energy additions at such a scale, we have no prospect of keeping global warming from reaching catastrophically disruptive levels, but, as the 'Shaping Energy Transitions' 2016 report notes, the investment necessary to finance these initiatives is an estimated $2 trillion over 15 years. We can be certain that there is not that kind of money in government funding or the international aid and development community. Much of the capital necessary to realise the COP21 commitments worldwide will have to come from the private sector. The commitments are explicitly contingent on receiving financing, and fulfilling them is thus contingent on the desirability of the investment opportunities they present. Investors may have good intentions, but deals must still be profitable. We are going to have to get serious about eliminating barriers and implementing the investment criteria, regulatory systems, and transparency that will make these opportunities attractive, at a very large scale, to investors with access to capital. Fortunately, the private sector has, in recent years, stepped up to meet social obligations as never before. A decade ago, private equity firms had no dedicated professionals responsible for the ESG policies of their portfolio companies. TPG, a leading global alternative investment firm where I am a senior advisor, now has four. Other major firms - KKR, Carlyle, Goldman Sachs, and others - now have similar priorities and professional oversight. Until the COP21 This follows a well-established tradition of private enterprise going where government will not or cannot go, helping fulfil the need for sanitation, quality public education, reliable electricity, roads and ports, and transparent, corruption-free regulation. I used to run a fund that invested in water companies in developing countries to offer services that government did not: drip irrigation in India, clean water for beverages in Russia, water filtration and household storage in Mexico. We standardised accounting, best practices for pollution control and workplace safety, and rigorous transparency. Private equity often plays this role in developing countries, and it is a major contribution to economic innovation. It is also a crucial factor in creating opportunities for further investment, which will be key to helping meet the COP21 commitments. Private equity can invest in a struggling company and improve business management, bringing it to a condition in which it can be sold on the international market and attract investments that would not have otherwise been made. What's more, the market is changing, as are priorities for the millennial generation, in ways that give the private sector a powerful incentive to invest in sustainability. ESG concerns were once relatively marginal to the income-generating outlook of a company. Now, they are central, understood to be directly related to the bottom line. When I was EPA Administrator under the first Bush Administration, I once pressed Procter & Gamble CEO Ed Artzt about his good efforts to reduce waste by trimming non-essential packaging. He said: ""We're not doing this for you. Our customers are demanding it."" Likewise, when Walmart stopped purchasing seafood from unsustainable fisheries, then-CEO Lee Scott said very plainly that it's not because the company is trying to ""go green"", but because they want to make sure that in five years they still have seafood to sell. Private investment in businesses' ESG initiatives now has the power to change production procurement and market-facing design, with enormous influence on work practices, waste, and ethics in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India. I urge major investment institutions to convene formally and regularly, exerting leadership in setting goals and timetables for climate-friendly investments. They should not simply wait to receive proposals to help countries honour their Paris commitments, but actively pursue investment opportunities that will advance carbon reduction on a global basis. As a sector, we have the capability, and therefore a duty and a responsibility, to help build the foundation for a sustainable future around the world-a foundation that can withstand any political tempest. William K. Reilly was Administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency from 1989 to 1993. He is now a senior advisor to leading global private equity firm TPG.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK165","The food industry's vital role in realising COP21 vision","December 19, 2015 Saturday 10:24 PM GMT","just-food global news","The COP21 Joy because it is unquestionably good news for all \- including food companies \- that an international agreement on climate change has been reached. And\~an absence of comfort because what COP21 has essentially concluded is our planet is facing such great peril that only a monumental combined effort from all nations and their peoples, of which this deal is just the beginning, will be required to get us out of it. So 12 December is a starting point rather than a conclusion. There is actually little scope for congratulation. \~The assertion by Mindy Lubber, president of corporate sustainability think tank Ceres, that the ""low-carbon economy has finally arrived"" therefore seems a tad premature. On the other hand, the suggestion by Professor James Hansen, the father of climate change activism, that the Paris agreement is a ""fraud"" may seem churlish. Unilever CEO Paul Polman tweeted along the same lines as Lubber, suggesting rather more circumspectly the agreement ""signals the start of the New Climate Economy"", with ""all in place now for a US$90 trillion low carbon revolution"". The description by Food Ethics Council executive director Dan Crossley that the deal was ""potentially momentous"" may be closest to the mark, with the emphasis on ""potentially"". In the long build-up to COP21 , the prevailing view of food companies was they hoped an agreement would be reached and this would be positive for the industry. So, now that has happened, what are its implications for the industry? And why should food companies be glad their hopes have been realised? First and foremost, however much debate there may be over the merits of the deal, the very fact there is now an agreement is in itself of huge significance. The international community at last has a plan and, for major food companies as with any large corporations, the degree of certainty and unanimity of purpose the deal brings is crucial, in relation both to planning investment, particularly around low-carbon strategies, and addressing risk. The principal elements of the agreement\~\- the primary aim to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2\'b0C and drive efforts to keep it to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels;\~national commitments to peak emissions as soon as possible and submit national climate action plans; the five-year review process and, lastly but by no means least, the US$100bn a year pledged to help developing countries to reduce their emissions and cope with climate change\~\- together potentially (that word again) provide a stable framework in what may be a radically changing global environment around which companies can plan their futures. Moreover, by dint of their dominant position within and pervasive influence upon the global food system, the futures of international food companies have global significance. Climate change is now commonly viewed through the lens of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus and keeping ahead of the food security challenge is a defining objective of the global response. As with so many things, food security means different things in the developed and developing world. In developed markets, it is largely discussed in terms of price and availability and a country's food trade import-export balance. Food will become more expensive overall, and the convenience and luxury of having out-of-season or exotic products available all year round may be lost or curtailed. In developing countries, food security is about hunger and starvation.\~In human terms, the latter is palpably more important but under either definition, international food companies have a central role to play in meeting the challenge. In addition to the provision of certainty, another facet of the deal which has been widely welcomed by food companies is the support it offers in addressing risk.\~In particular, the assistance for developing countries enshrined in the deal will help support efforts by companies to address climate change risk in their agricultural supply chains. The impact of extreme weather incidents are a particular concern for food companies and while the deal clearly can do nothing to avoid these, it could offer much in terms of protection from and recovery after them, again helping to make global agricultural supply chains more robust in the face of climate change impacts.\~Protection from risk is financially advantageous for corporations and their investors but experience with the countless sustainable agriculture initiatives already launched by food companies shows that the more robust those supply chains are the better for those rural agricultural communities. In relation to food security in the developing world, it is vital work.\~ Furthermore, the potential for the deal to enable developing countries to move faster on low-carbon and renewable energy than might have previously been possible will assist international food companies in their bid to drive down their global carbon footprint.\~Regarding carbon emissions reduction in developed countries, there may be a nagging feeling in some quarters of ""be careful what you wish for"". With national climate action plans will come ambitious carbon reduction targets to which food companies will be expected to make their fair contribution and possibly tougher regulatory frameworks. Those companies leading the way in sustainability may well feel they have little to fear from this, as they are well ahead of the curve. Indeed, tougher regulation \- the proverbial levelling of the playing-field \- can benefit the leaders. However, with regard to emissions reduction the picture across the entire food sector, across the globe, is rather more varied. The pressure on the laggards will certainly increase, as will pressure on companies already relatively active on carbon emissions to adopt more stringent, science-based targets, objectively aligned with the aims of the new global deal. The global food sector's collective carbon reduction push will also be hugely dependent on how quickly SMEs, both in developed and emerging markets, can move. Through collective engagement and discussion of sustainability, leading food companies already have a relatively good record of supporting smaller companies. The importance of this outreach will increase. Where global food manufacturers and retailers may well feel the influence of this deal sooner than later is in relation to food waste. However much they may point to what they are already doing to address waste and loss, it is a fair bet it will be deemed to be insufficient. In short, the carbon cost of food waste will become increasingly intolerable and the public and governments will look to food companies for solutions.\~ In spite of previous failures, the smart money was always on an agreement being reached in Paris and commentators of all hues have generally concluded the deal was about the best that could have been hoped for. COP21 deal should rightly give the world something to cheer about and international food companies should indeed be pleased that the deal they said they wanted has materialised. But in the New Year the focus must turn unremittingly to the hard work it presages.\~ \"

This is the first time that higher education institutions have had a voice ahead of a COP conference, and Nottingham Trent University was one of only five UK universities which contributed to the Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development report. The report includes concrete examples of initiatives related to climate change action in terms of teaching, research, outreach, and greening campuses. Two Nottingham Trent University projects are showcased. Firstly, an award-winning[1] partnership with Nottingham-based social enterprise NetPositive, which sees final year undergraduate students act as consultants to local businesses as part of their core curriculum, helping them to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and achieve Investor in the Environment (iiE) accreditation. The second project is the Sustainability in Practice (SiP) certificate, which is offered to all 26,000 students at Nottingham Trent University and introduces them to the topic of sustainable development in only four sessions, with a strong focus on sustainable solutions. Nottingham Trent University's Dr Roy Smith, Course Leader for the MA International Development, and Dr Petra Molthan-Hill, Team Leader for NTU's Green Academy project Food for Thought and Principal Lecturer in Business Sustainability, recently attended the From Rio to Paris: Higher Education for Climate Change Action meeting held in Paris. The meeting was part of the United Nations' Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI) and during the launch event at UNESCO headquarters the report was presented to Pierre Henri Guignard, Secretary General of Paris 2015 COP21 . The secretary general was also presented with an open letter to COP21 ministers and governments signed by a broad range of international consortia and alliances drawn from higher education institutions around the world. Included among these consortia was the UK-based Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges (EAUC), of which Nottingham Trent University is a member. Dr Smith said: 'This trip was an opportunity for NTU to engage with high-level discussions on education for sustainable development, and Petra and I were able to meet with the Chair of the COP21 meeting. 'The open letter we presented to him outlined the importance of education for sustainable development in the context of tackling the complex challenges associated with global climate change.' Nottingham Trent University and Nottingham Trent Students' Union are planning to mark the COP 21 Paris Climate Conference, which takes place on 7-8 December 2015, with a special day full of events on Monday 1 December.

Two decades of wrangling came to an end as the most far-reaching environmental deal in history promised to cut the officially £cceptable' level global warming from 2C to 1.5C - a move with the potential to dramatically reduce the damage inflicted by climate change. A host of other measures were also agreed in an attempt to hit the extremely ambitious new gobal warming target, in what has already become known as the Paris Agreement.

Money will also be made available to help vulnerable countries deal with a whole range of problems caused by global warming, from increased storm and flood damage to mass-migration as drought and rising sea levels make huge areas uninhabitable. After the talks went into extended overtime, the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius took just minutes to declare the pact adopted delegates from almost 200 nationsgave standing ovations and whistles.

This is a historic document which promises to set the world on a new path, to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future,"" United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said yesterday as he unveiled the final draft of the agreement in Paris. Experts were so confident that the deal would be passed that they issued a flurry of responses following publication of the final draft. ""This is a historic moment, not just for us and our world today, but for our children, our grandchildren and future generations,"" said Lord Stern, the world's most authoritative climate economist. ""The Paris agreement is a turning point in the world's fight against climate change, which threatens prosperity and well-being among both rich and poor countries,"" added Lord Stern, of the London School of Economics' Grantham Institute. The agreement also includes a commitment for countries to step up their pledges to cut carbon emissions every five years and for the world to begin bringing down its collective emissions ""as soon as possible"". The new agreement also includes a crucial long-term goal for the world to effectively end carbon emissions by the second half of the century. Audience members and delegates cheer after the adoption of a historic global warming pact at the COP21 Climate Conference in Paris (AFP) The text says the world is aiming for ""net zero emissions"" at some point between 2050 and 2100, meaning that any CO2 emissions would either need to be captured at source and piped underground or offset by an increase in carbon sinks such as trees. A joyful atmosphere fills the plenary hall at # COP21 . #ParisAgreementpic.twitter.com/ukwZgFdUZr - United Nations (@UN) December 12, 2015 Experts hailed the goal to clamp down so severely on emissions as ""transformational"" saying it would ""send a clear signal to the market"" that the days of fossil fuels were ending and renewable power was taking over. This would stimulate much-needed investment in wind, solar and other low-carbon energy sources and deter financing for coal, gas and oil. However, they cautioned that while the deal ends one chapter of the global warming battle - an agreement on how to tackle it - an even more difficult era has now begun in which these highly-ambitious targets need be achieved. ""Time will reveal the true nature of the Paris Agreement. From epic turning point, to na\'efve expression of hope, it is the real-world actions that follow that will decide,"" said Professor Chris Rapley, a leading climate scientist from University College London. Thousands gather on Champ de Mars near the Eiffel tower for a human chain as COP 21 negotiations come to an end (PA) The agreement sees developed countries renew their traditional commitment to take primary responsibility for cutting emissions and for helping poorer nations adapt to global warming. But in a new move, those countries who are still classed as ""developing"" but have become relatively wealthy, are now requested to do what they can to help out poorer nations as well. The countries likely to be affected include India, China, Singapore and South Korea. Despite being widely welcomed as a historic deal campaigners were disappointed it did not go even further. They argued that parts of the agreement were voluntary rather than binding. Furthermore, the poorer countries - who had little to do with global warming but are among the most affected by it - should be getting more help, they said.

Although the new 1.5C target was widely welcomed as an aspiration, scientists questioned how feasible it would be to achieve. Last month, new research found that the world has now warmed by 1C since pre-industrial times, meaning time is rapidly running out.

We asked delegation head Giovanni La Via, an Italian member of the EPP group, what the next steps will be and how Parliament will be involved. What was the delegation's role at the climate conference? We met representatives from developing and developed countries, indigenous people, NGOs and parties involved in the process. We listened to their views on the possible agreement in order to support the other European institutions in reaching an agreement. You already attended several other climate change summits. How was COP21 different from previous climate change conferences? This COP was different for many reasons, but the most important thing is that we have achieved an ambitious agreement. During the previous COPs, we discussed many times the issues of mitigation, adaptation and finance. This time we were able to reach an ambitious agreement, but also to discuss all these points. The final deal will be useful for the next generations. How will the agreement affect Parliaments work? Now that an agreement has been reached, we are ready to start with new legislation in line with the final deal. We have to do our best to achieve the targets we have proposed for the European Union. We are ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we have to create specific legislation in this field. We have to increase our energy efficiency and to make a bigger effort on renewable energies.One of the main issues we have to discuss in the European Parliament is how to achieve the target of having 30% of total energy production come from renewables. What are the next steps? This is the start of a long process. Over the next year all COP partipants have to look at how they will implement the agreement. We will have to discuss the results of the negotiations with the member states, but also within the Parliament.

The 29-page document sets out the bones of a deal, with a demand from vulnerable nations to limit average temperature increases to no more than 1.5C included. And president of the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ), Laurent Fabius, said that the number of points to be clarified by ministers had been substantially reduced by 75pc, suggesting substantial progress had been made. ""I am absolutely convinced we will be able to reach an agreement,"" Mr Fabius said. The text sets out the points subject to further negotiation. Nothing is agreed, until everything is agreed, and the draft agreement could substantially change. There are three options for holding the increase in global average temperatures - to below 2C; to hold ""well below"" 2C and scale up efforts to limit temperature increase to below 1.5 \'b0C, or hold them below 1.5C. On the long term goal of decarbonising the global economy, the draft text presents two very different options - one suggests reducing emissions between 40pc-70pc by 2050, or by 70pc-95pc in the same period. It also calls for a reduction to zero emissions ""by the end"" or ""by the middle"" of the century. The second calls for long-term low global emissions over the course of the century, which is considered less ambitious. On efforts by all nations, it says that developed nations should make cuts, with developing nations doing the same but supported by adequate finance and technology. The second option involves all countries ""aiming"" to reduce emissions over time. There are also three options on financial support - new money from developed nations to meet the full costs of complying with the agreement; the second notes that developing countries are ""eligible for support"" and the third noting that developing countries will implement their commitments if money and support is provided. The text also calls for a review every five years, and says countries should encourage planting forestry to 'trap' carbon. NGOs are calling for commitments to reduce emissions from governments, called intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), to be reviewed from 2018.

The side event took place during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'s 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ), underway in Paris. Dr. Ali expressed his pleasure to see 51 of IDB Group's 56 member countries amongst the 180 countries that submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), adding that it was a welcome development and a turning point in the global efforts to address climate change and transform to a climate-resilient global economy. The IDB Group President, stated that financing and capacity building featured prominently in the INDCs as two major areas for preserving environment. 'While multiple sources for climate financing exist including global climate funds from public and private sectors and multilateral development banks, the resource gap is still wide', he said. 'There are many countries that need technical assistance and capacity building to be able to develop and deploy climate- smart technology as well as training on how to implement international agreement and integrate them into their national climate action plans', he added. According to Dr. Ali, the IDB Group, in 2014, launched its Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction Program to address the energy challenges of its member countries via application of renewable energy resources. He stated that the Bank will continue to work with other multilateral development banks (MDBs) in order to improve climate resilience of transport systems, and increase awareness on the need to protect transport services by building a more systematic approach to mainstreaming climate resilience in transport policies, plans and investments.

An action already taken towards this goal is Philips' membership of the RE100 program - a collaborative initiative of influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. Philips already increased its use of renewable energy from 8% to 55% in 6 years (2008-2014). The announcement comes as Eric Rondolat, Chief Executive Officer, Philips Lighting, addressed the COP21 Energy Day Summit urging leaders to set more aggressive targets to prevent climate change. 'As it stands, we've reached the climate change checkout and all the contributions from around the world have proved insufficient to prevent a potentially catastrophic rise in global temperatures. The world must set more ambitious goals to improve energy efficiency,' he said. 'Faster adoption of LED lighting, and a drive to renovate existing city infrastructure and greater use of solar-powered LED lighting would have a huge impact.' The Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs) from countries participating at COP21 are predicted to contain global warming to between 2.7-degreeC and 4-degreeC by the end of the century, studies show. This is an improvement on the business-as-usual scenario of a 6.5-degreeC rise, but falls short of the globally agreed target of 2-degreeC. However, research indicates that the world could double the annual rate of energy efficiency improvement using technologies already available. This would deliver half the emission reductions needed to meet the 2-degreeC goal. Mr Rondolat stressed the importance of the lighting industry in helping improve energy efficiency, as it accounts for 19% of global electricity consumption. Philips has gone further by developing connected LED lighting systems - to enable remote management and provide light only on demand - that can deliver energy savings of up to 80%. The company has undertaken more than 260 connected street lighting projects around the world since 2011, from picturesque towns in Italy to megacities like Los Angeles. Mr Rondolat highlighted that significant progress is being made in the global lighting sector. Even as global trends like population growth, urbanization and the rise of the middle class will lead to an increase of 35% in the number of light points by 2030, the vast improvements in LED and connected lighting could contribute to delivering higher than previously foreseen carbon emission reductions. The global transition to LED lighting will bring by 2030 an energy saving of 53% compared to business as usual scenario. He said new business models, financing options, incentives, and a move towards circular service models would stimulate shorter renovation cycles. But he added that government regulatory bodies must also be prepared to set high but attainable energy standards to encourage faster adoption. About Royal PhilipsRoyal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA) is a diversified health and well-being company, focused on improving people's lives through meaningful innovation in the areas of Healthcare, Consumer Lifestyle and Lighting.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK177","COP21: UN-backed platforms show greenhouse gas emission reductions surpass global emissions of iron and steel sector","December 7, 2015 Monday","M2 PressWIRE","December 4, 2015 A new report by Yale University finds that the combined greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments recorded in two United Nations-backed platforms by cities, regions and companies alone surpasses the global emissions of the iron and steel sector. Released on the eve of Action Day at the UN climate change conference ( COP21 ), the academic report also finds that 15 of the world's 20 largest banks, totaling close to $ 2 trillion dollars in market value, have made commitments to act and green bonds worth close to $ 50 billion are financing climate projects. ""The many thousands of governors, mayors, companies and investors who have so publicly committed to climate action are telling governments that our job in Paris is a climate change agreement that opens every possible door to help them push further and faster ahead,"" said Laurent Fabius, the French Foreign Minister and President of COP21 , at a press conference. According to a press release issued by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - the organizer of the conference - the findings are ""impressive"" but actually understate the scale of total global climate action because they are based on data from only two platforms supported by the United Nations, France and Peru, where national, regional and civic governments and business publicly enter their commitments to take action on climate change. ""It is evident that this wonderful set of recorded climate actions is only a part of much wider, broader action towards a sustainable future. I know there are many tens of thousands of other climate initiatives out there and I welcome all who can to put their efforts, pledges and commitments on the record with us,"" Mr. Fabius added. Yale analyzed over 10,000 climate commitments made by cities, regions, businesses and investors, many involving the cooperation of national governments, who formally recorded their pledges in the Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (NAZCA) and under the banner of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA). Since the opening of COP21 on Monday, leaders of dozens of LPAA cooperative initiatives announced new commitments and many new cooperative initiatives are being launched. At tomorrow's Action Day, government leaders, including French President Francois Hollande, CEOs and film makers are expected to speak to this ""exceptional global response"" to climate change and underline the need to press ahead as quickly as possible. According to UNFCCC, the growing wave of worldwide action by civic actors to reduce emissions and make societies and economies resilient to climate change was matched ahead of the Paris conference by an ""unprecedented response"" from governments. So far, 185 developed and developing countries, together representing a footprint of almost 95 per cent of global greenhouse gases, have submitted national climate action plans as their contribution to the new agreement. ""Government policies and actions alongside an ever growing number of companies, investors, cities, regions and provinces are aligning as never before. Collectively they do not yet keep us below a 2 degree Celsius temperature rise,"" said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres. ""But they keep that objective well within the affordable reach of humanity and they underwrite the truth that the clean energy transformation is already irreversible. Paris must trigger the next essential impetus towards that objective in terms of pace and scale,"" she added. Action Day will kick-off tomorrow morning with a message from the International Space Station. \"

Adesina pushes for a New Deal on Energy for Africa and Binding Agreement at COP21","September 11, 2015 Friday","ENP Newswire","Speaking to a delegation of Ministers representing more than 40 nations spanning the globe, the President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, pushed for a New Deal on Energy in Africa to solve Africa's energy crisis. The audience included the host of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, COP21 , Laurent Fabius, Minister of Foreign Affairs, France; as well as Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Minister of Environment, Peru; Khalid Fahmy, Minister of Environment and Chair of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN), Egypt; and leaders representing European governments, the G7, the G20 and other nations. Adesina also called for a binding agreement toward limited carbon dioxide emissions at the forthcoming COP21 . He outlined the importance of the Paris Climate Conference, as presenting a unique opportunity to reach a lasting agreement on limiting carbon dioxide emissions and charting the way for transformative partnerships to address the adverse effects of climate change. To this end, he stressed, Africa's voice is crucial for a successful outcome at COP21 . 'We need to support initiatives that address risks associated with climate change, and build disaster-response capacity and recovery programs for those who are most affected. This includes building their assets, providing catastrophic bonds, weather index insurance schemes, and crop/livestock insurance for farmers and rural populations,' said Adesina. Adesina called for strong political will, sharply focused partnerships, and ambitious financing programs to address climate and its impact on the millions of people whose livelihoods are under threat, especially in small, fragile, and island states, and the Sahel region. The Bank's new President also highlighted three sectors for urgent action: building integrated and resilient energy systems, including both conventional and renewable energy; smart agricultural, land use and forestry systems; and boosting urban renewal - creating more resilient cities, with efficient water systems and smart, climate-friendly infrastructure. While endorsing Africa's position on the need for more resources to address climate change adaptation and mitigation, Adesina assured world leaders of the Bank's strong support for Africa's transition to inclusive and green growth. He affirmed that the Bank will champion the implementation of the polluter pays principle and work with member countries and partners to support governance reforms, continental risk transfer and risk-sharing schemes, and building institutions that will support greater social and economic resilience in the face of climate change. He also announced that the Bank will expand its support to African countries to solve their energy and food security challenges, while ensuring inclusive and green growth. 'Together, we must end Africa's energy crisis and unlock Africa's enormous energy potentials - both conventional and renewables,' he said. 'This is why the African Development Bank strongly supports the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and will cooperate with all stakeholders to launch a New Deal on Energy for Africa that will accelerate energy supply and access across the continent.' During his visit, Adesina held bilateral talks with Laurent Fabius and Helene Le Gal, Adviser to the President of France, and senior officials of the Agence Francaise de Developpement to discuss strategic partnerships between the Bank and France. He also met with Khalid Fahmy, and other COP21 and G7 delegates to discuss the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the Bank's New Deal on Energy for Africa. Adesina secured their support for the Bank to provide leadership to drive this Africa-led initiative. The Bank will host the drafting team of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative at the Bank's Headquarters on September 16, 2015 to finalize the action plan for the Initiative. On September 17 and 18, 2015, Khalid Fahmy will attend the High Level Consultative meeting on the New Deal on Energy for Africa convened by Adesina in Abidjan.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK179","ICMIF participates in Lima-Paris Action at COP21 Conference","December 6, 2015","Insurance Newslink","At the COP21 Conference, the International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation(ICMIF) participated in the Lima-Paris Action(LPAA); Private Finance Action Session. ICMIF ceo, Shaun Tarbuck, participated in a panel session, moderated by Janos Pasztor, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Climate Change, in which representatives from the private finance sector, including investment, banking and insurance, showcased how their industries are undertaking a green shift toward a low carbon economy. Tarbuck spoke on behalf of the global insurance sector, but also took the opportunity to share how the cooperative and mutual insurance sector is playing a leading role in doubling the industry's investment in Smart-Risk investing. The mutual and cooperative insurance sector is driving an unprecedented cultural change in its investment teams in a bid to transfer the knowledge that the underwriting side of the industry has in relation to risk and modelling to the investible asset side of the business-thereby delivering a long-term culture of 'smarter' investment decisions. At the UN Climate Change Summit in September 2014, the insurance sector, represented by ICMIF and the International Insurance Society(IIS) set a target to double their $42bn investments in green finance by the end of 2015. In his speech, Tarbuck confirmed that the major actors of the sector have already exceeded the initial target by collectively investing $109bn. Tarbuck also explained how ICMIF's 5-5-5 Mutual Microinsurance Strategy aims to protect 25 million more poor people, in the world's poorest areas by 2020. That equates to 25% of the G7's business sector commitment to increase climate insurance cover for an additional 400 million poor and vulnerable people in highly exposed and low income countries within the next five years. Tarbuck showed how these two initiatives fitted within Ban Ki-moon's new Climate Resilience Initiative-Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape (A2R)-launched on Monday. He highlighted several initiatives that the coalition of industry associations ICMIF, the IIS and the Willis Group have been working on in the last 15 months. Anticipate is about understanding the risks associated with climate change and modelling their potential impact and the Resilience Modelling Forum initiative speaks to that. Absorb includes extending the market penetration of insurance with initiatives such as 5-5-5 and the African Risk Capacity. Lastly, Reshape is looking for solutions to the big issues around funding and transparency and accounting for climate change. The smart risk investing initiative is a resolution initiative as is the Financial Stability Board's(FSB) industry-led agenda to consider climate risk disclosure across the wider economy. ""Mutual insurers have continued as the fastest-growing part of the global insurance industry since the financial crisis,"" said Tarbuck. ""Since 2007, our sector has grown its premium income by an impressive 31%, considerably above the market growth of 13%. Our business model thrives by adopting a long-term, sustainable approach to business and it is therefore of little surprise to see mutual and cooperative insurance leaders now playing such a visible and vital social and economic role in the world.""

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK181","Whatever the politicians decide in Paris, industry's resolve must not falter","December 3, 2015 Thursday 8:00 AM GMT","Building Online","Clare Bowman, Broadway Malyan sustainability leader It is nearly 40 years since UN special envoy Gro Harlem Brundtland enshrined the view that development and environment cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities. Against a backdrop of environmental catastrophes from acid rain to the diminishing ozone layer, the impact of her landmark Our Common Approach paper in the proceeding decades is hard to overstate. During that period a political resolve combined with a willingness by those responsible for developing the built environment to embrace the essential tenets of sustainable development means we have seen the tide held back under the most challenging of circumstances. Further galvanised by the Kyoto Protocol a decade ago, the development sector has been at the coal face of innovation as the world has striven to drive down carbon gas emissions and reduce waste. But with 40,000 delegates converged on Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) there is a very real danger of the sustainability agenda veering into the slow lane. The construction industry still accounts for half of global energy and water consumption and almost two-thirds of its raw materials. As far as the industry has come, it has still not come anywhere near far enough. Even in the UK - which has been one of the pioneers of best practice over the past 40 years - we have seen a retreat from the sustainable agenda with the abolition of the Code for Sustainable Homes and Green Deal renewable incentives. The response to this political wavering is that the industry must take up the mantle and lead the sustainability agenda itself, not because it has to - although the future habitability of the planet kind of depends on it - but because it understands better than anyone the economic opportunities on offer from sound environmental practices. Operating in almost 40 countries globally, my practice, Broadway Malyan, is as well placed as any to understand challenges of ensuring that progress and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive positions. As political commitment has wavered, Broadway Malyan has set up an R&D Zone to develop a culture that actively challenges and explores new methods of reducing emissions and evolving waste management through adopting the RIBA Digital Plan of Works and BIM methodology for asset management on all projects. As we know the economic imperative will always trump any moral obligation. Helping to a promote a narrative that articulates the very real long-term benefits of sustainable development needs to sit at the heart of any future strategy through data sharing and inter-project collaboration. For our part, the R&D Zone is currently carrying out a study on affordable housing projects with the aim of tackling fuel poverty through design, with the outcomes set to be announced ahead of the Ecobuild conference next March. And ultimately our commitment must not just be to reducing emissions but also to understanding that climate change is already upon us. Mitigation will be our biggest growth area in the future as the health and wellbeing of those people occupying our buildings has already become a major priority for our studios operating in some of the worst-affected regions around the world. We know that we are not alone in this endeavour and that many others are committed to forging on against any prevailing winds. But we must ensure that sustainability remains front and centre for everyone involved in development - regardless of what is agreed in Paris. It's what Gro Harlem Brundtland would want. \"

More than 180 of the 195 countries involved in the Paris talks have volunteered a plan to combat climate change since March as part of an effort to forge a new global accord to stop global temperatures rising more than 2C from pre-industrial times. Their number includes the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, which was struggling HYPERLINK http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/liberia-ends-ebola/en/ this year with Ebola But Mr Oquist, who first revealed his country\' s stance to the HYPERLINK http://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/11/30/nicaragua-to-defy-un-in-climate-pledge-refusal/ Climate Home online news site, told reporters the voluntary nature of the pledges meant global temperatures were bound to rise.  We do not want to be accomplices to the death, damages and destruction that a 3C or 4C world will represent, he said. Managua\' s snub to the Paris conference, known as COP21 , is unlikely to interrupt the meeting\' s central aim of striking the first new UN climate agreement in 18 years. Nicaragua accounts for just 0.03 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But it sparked a terse response from some conference goers, including Monica Araya of Costa Rica, which shares a border with Nicaragua and is a pioneer of green policies such as a carbon tax.  This is the wrong COP to seek attention without putting solutions on the table, said Ms Araya, a former Costa Rican negotiator.  Paris cannot be kidnapped by a few countries playing ideological games. Nicaragua\' s stance was disconnected from what developing countries are doing in practice, she said, adding her country\' s climate plans included electric trains and other measures that would deliver tangible benefits to people and companies. As of Sunday, Nicaragua was one of nine countries yet to submit a climate pledge. The others were: oil-rich Venezuela, North Korea, Libya, East Timor, Nepal, Uzbekistan, St Kitts and Nevis and Panama. Panama delegate, Rosilena Lindo, said her country had been working hard on its climate strategy, which includes plans to boost its solar and wind power, and would publish it as soon as it had finished a round of consultations.

David Eynon sustainability specialist for Colliers International in the South West, hopes it will bring a new focus to environmental issues The United Nations Climate Change Conference The summit, also known as COP21 will feature a keynote speech by Prince Charles and will be attended by representatives of 196 countries, including US president Barack Obama and Xi Jinping of China. It is expected to conclude with ambitious national plans for action from 2020 onwards, and agreement is also expected to be reached on a range of actions that will see increased activity in key sectors such as energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment and forest protection. Clearly, this will have an influence on policy in all the countries that become signatories to the agreement, and it will be interesting to see if its effect on our Government's approach to sustainability. There was widespread surprise recently when the newly-elected Conservative Government published its Productivity Plan and dropped its commitment that all homes in the UK should be built to a zero-carbon standard by 2016. The non-domestic target of 2019 was not specifically mentioned in the Plan, but it later emerged that this had also been axed. Not long afterwards, it was announced that the Green Deal energy efficiency scheme - aimed at cutting carbon emissions and saving money on energy bills - was also being scrapped. In my view, it has been a case of too much, too soon - particularly given David Cameron's declaration that his is the ""greenest government ever"". A more relaxed digression of the rates would have been preferable, as it would have helped to ensure that the solar industry in the UK, which has made great leaps, is not put in jeopardy by significantly reduced Feed-In Tariffs and would also have meant that this country's carbon targets remain achievable. Feed-In Tariffs - whereby consumers who install low-carbon energy-generating technology from low-carbon sources such as solar, PV or wind turbines - were always meant to eventually no longer need a subsidy. When Amber Rudd, the new Energy Secretary, announced that the Green Deal energy efficiency scheme was being canned she declared that it would be replaced by a scheme which would be effective. The details of the new scheme are yet to be announced, but the perceived hostility from the Government to the green agenda has inevitably led to concerns that the UK's minimum energy efficiency standards will be diluted and this country could miss the carbon targets mandated under the Climate Change Act. The message we have been getting is that implementing measures to drive down resource consumption strengthens profitability and reduces exposure to legislative risk, as well as improving a company's environmental and carbon performance. Additionally, there is growing evidence that buildings which demonstrate strong sustainability principles produce additional qualitative benefits around the improved health of occupants and increased staff productivity. Housing stock in the UK is considered to be among the worst in Europe in terms of energy efficiency, and although the Green Deal received criticism there is no doubt that the scheme played a role in driving take-up. However, far more needs to be done, particularly given that the introduction of Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) will restrict the letting of assets with poor Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings from April 2018. It is also important to bear in mind issues of increasing long-term resource process and security of international energy supply. A large number of traditional generators are scheduled to come offline by 2020, and meanwhile Hinkley C will not be generating electricity by 2023 as had been originally planned. Hopefully, the outcome of the Paris 2015 summit will ensure that sustainable energy remains high on the Government's agenda, and individuals and businesses alike are encouraged take a low-carbon approach to their future energy requirements. \"

Drought and competition for increasingly scarce resources caused by manmade activities also played a role in the refugee crisis which has seen thousands of people leave the Middle East and cross Europe in recent months, the Prince of Wales said. The remarks were made in an interview with Sky News recorded before the latest wave of terror attacks in Paris, which will be broadcast on Monday. The Prince, 67, said: ""We're seeing a classic case of not dealing with the problem, because, I mean, it sounds awful to say, but some of us were saying 20 something years ago that if we didn't tackle these issues you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that people have to move. ""And, in fact, there's very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria, funnily enough was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land"". ""Obviously I try to be as optimistic as possible, but sometimes you think that - do we really have to face catastrophes and chaos before we understand that real action needs to be taken?""Prince Charles Asked by Royal Correspondent Rhiannon Mills if there was a direct link between climate change, conflict and terrorism, the heir to the throne replied: ""It's only in the last few years that the Pentagon have actually started to pay attention to this. I mean it has a huge impact on what is happening. I mean the difficulty is sometimes to get this point across - that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we're doing to our natural environment.""

During the 30-minute interview His Royal Highness said failure to urgently address issues such as a rise in global temperatures meant the world was heading towards ""catastrophes and chaos"". He drew comparisons between the current state of the environment and the global financial crisis, and said: ""The trouble is if we don't, this is the awful thing, if we don't it's going to get so much worse, then life will become very, very complicated indeed, and what we're experiencing now will be as nothing to the problems. ""I mean the difficulties in 2008 with the financial crash - that was a banking crisis. But we're now facing a real possibility of nature's bank going bust. If you see it like that, we've been putting so much pressure on the natural systems and all those aspects of nature that we take for granted. ""Obviously I try to be as optimistic as possible, but sometimes you think that - do we really have to face catastrophes and chaos before we understand that real action needs to be taken? The difficulty with all that, is that by the time you try to take the action, it's already too late.""

The accord is in line with the work the resources sector has been doing with advanced technologies to reduce emissions from use of coal and gas in power generation. Now that there seems to be steadfast commitment to implement High-Efficiency Low-Emission (HELE) coal-fired power generation technologies, Queensland's lower-emission high-energy coal reserves are well-placed, alongside our natural gas, to play an important role in the transition to a lower emissions world. We also welcome the endorsement in Paris from leading environmental NGOs that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be an important part of the longer-term solution, alongside renewables and nuclear energy. The Paris talks and accord have revealed nothing that alters our view that there will be very strong demand from India and South East Asia for our high-energy coal. In fact, governments from those regions made it very clear in Paris that coal will play a critical role in their future power supply. India is still set to be the world's largest coal importer and they have mandated supercritical technology from 2017. The historic accord will place more focus on use of HELE coal technologies such as super critical and ultra-supercritical technologies. The accord also does not alter the expected 160 percent increase in demand for gas in Asia out to 2040.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK188","COP21: Small island states hopeful of climate damage deal","FT.com"," ","Small island countries facing flooding from rising sea levels are closing in on a deal with wealthy countries that would see loss and damage support measures included in the HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/paris-climate-talks global climate accord to be finalised in Paris this week . Developed countries have been resisting such a move for more than a year, fearing it could make them liable for billions of dollars in compensation. But Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, EU climate commissioner, told the Financial Times there was now a  growing understanding that loss and damage provisions would be included in the Paris agreement, as long as they did not expose wealthy countries to new claims for compensation. A draft text of the agreement was finalised on Saturday. Mr Arias Ca\'f1ete said a meeting that Barack Obama, US president, had with five island leaders last week at the Paris talks, known as COP21 , had helped smooth the way for a compromise on what has become one of the more divisive issues in UN climate talks in recent years.  I am very glad that the US is showing flexibility because from the very beginning of this process we have supported this concept  of course with adequate language [on compensation], he said. But he added:  There is one thing that we do not accept and will not accept in this agreement and that is the notion that there should be liability and compensation for loss and damage. That is a line that we can\' t cross.  This is not a US-centric position but it is a position that is important for us. It is still unclear what type of loss and damage measures might make it into the final accord that delegates from nearly 200 nations are due to seal this Friday. The draft text of the agreement called for a  climate change displacement co-ordination facility to be set up to relocate people affected by the fierce storms and other extreme weather scientists say is more likely as global temperatures rise. The text also says plans to address  irreversible and permanent damage resulting from human-induced climate change should be completed within four years. Island country delegates said they were very pleased wealthy countries were no long rejecting outright the notion that their failure to combat global warming meant extra support was needed for small, poor countries facing a threat to their existence. But James Fletcher of St Lucia, the small Caribbean island state, said the question of how to frame loss and damage support in the Paris agreement was still a stumbling block.  We believe we already have avenues for liability and compensation under international law and international agreements, he said.  The discussion going on right now is a discussion among lawyers. How do we end up with a text that allays the fears of the US, the EU and other countries that we are creating a mechanism for liability and compensation.  And how do you address our concern that we do not give up any rights that we presently already have under international agreements. UN climate talks have been held for more than 20 years without managing to produce the deep cuts in global emissions from burning fossil fuels that scientists say are required to avert dangerous levels of global warming.

Speaking hours after the historic agreement was reached, he said itcould be a ""turning point"" for the world - and a defining moment for his administration. ""We've shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge. The climate agreement was reached by nearly 200 nations, and is a partially legally-binding commitment to keep global warming ""well below"" the threshold of 2C. President Francois Hollande said:""In Paris, there have been many revolutions over the centuries. Today it is the most beautiful and the most peaceful revolution that has just been accomplished - a revolution for climate change."" Obama said the assembled leaders in Paris ""met the moment"", and that people can be more confident ""the planet will be in better shape for the next generation."" ""The American people can be proud,"" he added. ""Because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership. Over the past seven years, we've transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change."" On Saturday night, nations agreed a ""transformational"" action plan involving the toughest climate targets ever set and hundreds of billions of dollars put asideto tackle the problem. Two decades of wrangling came to an end as the most far-reaching environmental deal in history promised to cut the officially £cceptable' level global warming from 2C to 1.5C - a move with the potential to dramatically reduce the damage inflicted by climate change. A host of other measures were also agreed in an attempt to hit the extremely ambitious new gobal warming target, in what has already become known as the Paris Agreement.

Money will also be made available to help vulnerable countries deal with a whole range of problems caused by global warming, from increased storm and flood damage to mass-migration as drought and rising sea levels make huge areas uninhabitable.

The agreement also includes a commitment for countries to step up their pledges to cut carbon emissions every five years and for the world to begin bringing down its collective emissions ""as soon as possible"". The new agreement also includes a crucial long-term goal for the world to effectively end carbon emissions by the second half of the century. Audience members and delegates cheer after the adoption of a historic global warming pact at the COP21 Climate Conference in Paris (AFP) The text says the world is aiming for ""net zero emissions"" at some point between 2050 and 2100, meaning that any CO2 emissions would either need to be captured at source and piped underground or offset by an increase in carbon sinks such as trees. A joyful atmosphere fills the plenary hall at # COP21 . #ParisAgreementpic.twitter.com/ukwZgFdUZr - United Nations (@UN) December 12, 2015 Experts hailed the goal to clamp down so severely on emissions as ""transformational"" saying it would ""send a clear signal to the market"" that the days of fossil fuels were ending and renewable power was taking over. This would stimulate much-needed investment in wind, solar and other low-carbon energy sources and deter financing for coal, gas and oil. However, they cautioned that while the deal ends one chapter of the global warming battle - an agreement on how to tackle it - an even more difficult era has now begun in which these highly-ambitious targets need be achieved. ""Time will reveal the true nature of the Paris Agreement. From epic turning point, to na\'efve expression of hope, it is the real-world actions that follow that will decide,"" said Professor Chris Rapley, a leading climate scientist from University College London. Thousands gather on Champ de Mars near the Eiffel tower for a human chain as COP 21 negotiations come to an end (PA) The agreement sees developed countries renew their traditional commitment to take primary responsibility for cutting emissions and for helping poorer nations adapt to global warming. But in a new move, those countries who are still classed as ""developing"" but have become relatively wealthy, are now requested to do what they can to help out poorer nations as well. The countries likely to be affected include India, China, Singapore and South Korea. Despite being widely welcomed as a historic deal campaigners were disappointed it did not go even further. They argued that parts of the agreement were voluntary rather than binding. Furthermore, the poorer countries - who had little to do with global warming but are among the most affected by it - should be getting more help, they said.

""This draft climate deal falls far short of the soaring rhetoric from world leaders less than two weeks ago. While it does at least put fossil fuels on the wrong side of history, it doesn't contain the solid commitments science and natural justice require to cut emissions and protect people from increasing floods, droughts and super-storms,"" he said. Although the new 1.5C target was widely welcomed as an aspiration, scientists questioned how feasible it would be to achieve. Last month, new research found that the world has now warmed by 1C since pre-industrial times, meaning time is rapidly running out. But world leaders are determined to limit global warming to 1.5C if they possibly can after research showed that the previous 2C target would spell disaster for low-lying, hot and Arctic regions - which are the most vulnerable to climate change. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK190","-Fortum - European energy companies, Carbon pricing as main tool to fight climate change","December 11, 2015 Friday","ENP Newswire","Fortum together with ten other European energy companies form the Magritte Group. Since its launch in May 2013, the Group has offered its assessment of the energy market situation in Europe and made constructive proposals to the European Commission and political leaders on how to remedy the identified problems relating to the functioning of the internal energy market and emission trading system. The Magritte Group organized a conference in Paris on 8 December in the context of the COP21 meeting and issued the statement below, calling for comprehensive implementation of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme as the main tool to combat climate change. It also calls for an ambitious international climate agreement and a carbon price signal to boost fair competition and investments in low-carbon power generation. The Magritte Group's press release on December 8, 2015: The Magritte initiative: a strong industrial commitment for a carbon market For a global deal in Paris - Supporting the momentum generated at COP 21 , today, CEOs from major European energy companies show their commitment towards a global deal on the fight against climate change. It is time for action as global warming could lead to catastrophe and inflict permanent damage on the balance of life on Earth. Keeping global warming below 2-degreeC is an absolute necessity, widely supported. Therefore the Magritte Group is calling for a far reaching and ambitious international climate agreement at COP 21 to provide the general framework for the long term as well as visibility and coherence to climate policies. The role of a carbon price signal, should also be acknowledged as a tool to ensure a level playing field worldwide. From a damaged European carbon market to a swift recovery - In the past two years, CEOs have raised their concern about the losing credibility of the European carbon market. They have played an active role in its reform and strongly welcome the agreements reached on back-loading1 and on the Market Stability Reserve2. These agreements constituted important first steps towards the deeply needed restructuring of the European carbon market. Further pursuing this mobilization, the Magritte Group stresses the need for a strengthened European CO2 market signal with the aim of providing industry with a visible scenario for its present and future long-term investments. This is a prerequisite to restore confidence in the system and activate its full benefit to climate policy. Concrete commitment of the energy industry to combating climate change - CEOs are committed to shaping a low carbon energy future and investing in low carbon and efficient technologies to reach the climate goals. Research, technological development and innovation have a key role to play in the process of a competitive low carbon path which is becoming possible through the development of concrete projects and products such as smart technologies, renewables, energy storage, demand-side response, power to gas, distribution grid modernization, alternative fuels infrastructure for transport, etc. COP21 represents the opportunity to showcase and share best practices in this regard.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK191","COP21: Carbon Divestment Is Not The Way","December 2015","Global Money Management","Institutional investors should not cut investments in fossil fuel companies as a way to fend off carbon emissions investment risk. Instead, investors should address such companies and encourage them to reduce their emissions, delegates heard at one of the conferences for the COP21 Lima-Paris Action Agenda in Paris. Institutional investors need to ""demand"" a decarbonisation strategy from the companies they invest in, said Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the Brussels-based International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). Such strategy needs to make sure that transparency, monitoring and the engagement strategies for long-term investment are included. ""If we do not see that, then by all means divest. But divestment as a first step is not where we need to be for the economy,"" she stated. ITU represents 180 million workers in 162 countries and territories, with some USD30 trillion invested in pension funds. Saker Nusseibeh, ceo of the GBP29.8 billion U.K.-based asset manager Hermes Investment Management, agrees with Burrow. ""Carbon reduction is just the first step, we should be thinking about long-term risks,"" he noted. According to Burrow, this strategy should be applied to all sector companies, and not only to the ones in the fossil fuel sector. ""We will stay with you only if you are serious about it and we can see results,"" she said, as a message to those companies. For investors to be able to make a difference, they need to engage with the boards of the companies they are invested in, ""getting them to focus their strategies to address these long-term risks,"" said Jack Ehnes, ceo of the USD191.4 billion California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS). ""Getting involved with the boards is absolutely essential for investors. Because most of our money is invested in long-term passively indexed portfolios, which really means that we will be with these companies near perpetuity,"" he added. Burrow also argued about the need for a long-term strategy. ""It is very worrying to me that the short termism is forcing good companies""""like energy [firms] that are depending on fossil fuel, which are trying desperately to move to long-term targets""""and their investors and boards are so frightened by this that they are making them put those fossil fuel assets in a bad bank or equivalent,"" she noted. ""To us, this is not the way to make the transition in companies or economies. We need stability, and to see that the transition is genuine, with transparent targets,"" she added. Putting A Price On Carbon G\'e9rard Moutet, chair of the executive committee for the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative and v.p. for climate-energy at Total, a French-based oil and gas group, argued that a price on carbon emissions is needed for the industry to move faster to a low emission environment. ""We advocate strongly to have a price on carbon emissions. We really think that when we have a realistic price on this, it will drastically change the shape of investments,"" he said. Burrow agrees with this view. ""Unless there is a carbon price, frankly, people are not going to take it seriously,"" she noted. Total already incorporates this cost in its projects, currently at a rate of EUR25 per tonne. ""We are sure that in the future CO2 emissions will have a cost, and we want to make sure that these investments will exist in this environment,"" noted Moutet. ""If you put a price on emissions, naturally coal will be less competitive than other sources, and solar will be much more competitive,"" he added. \"

This was during a session of the ""Fridays of the Commission"" organized at the African Union headquarters under the theme: ""Towards Climate Justice"" on 06th November 2015. The session brought together various participants including the African Union Commission, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), members of the diplomatic corps, religious leaders and representatives of the African civil society. Speaking during the opening session of the Fridays of the Commission, Mr. Desire Assogbavi, Head of Oxfam Liaison Office to the African Union, emphasized the fact that the climate variability is increasingly having damaging consequences on people across the continent. He also pointed out that Africa should be at the forefront of the negotiations since it is one of the world's most vulnerable continents to climate change. ""Africa must strategically be engaged in this process."" He insisted. Mr. Ayele Hegena, Director of Law and standards at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and member of the African group of negotiators (AGN) on Climate Change, declared that COP 21 is an opportunity for the continent to claim its right to sustainable development as well as to make sure that the African common positions are featured in the final text to be adopted. Mr. Ayele also presented some of the expectations of Africa during COP 21 . Those expectations include the need to have a comprehensive agreement focusing on the issues of mitigation, adaptation, financing and technology transfer. Indeed, only an inclusive approach can be successful in addressing the challenges of climate change. Moreover, he said that the need of the continent would be taken into account only if a differentiation approach based on the realities and circumstances of each continent. On the other hand, Hon. Awudu Cyprian Mbaya, Executive President of the Pan African Parliamentary Network on Climate Change (PAPNCC), called upon the African group of negotiators to ensure that the Paris's agreement is in line with the expectations of the African people. Hon. Awudu took advantage of the session to share with the participants the work the parliamentarians are doing in Africa to raise awareness on the existence climate change. In that regard, he highlighted the need to mainstream climate change in school curricula across the continent. He also pledged the total support of the PAPNCC to African governments, specialized institutions and civil society organizations who are defending the African positions. ""I hope the people of Africa will be able to smile after COP 21 . I am optimistic in the sense that I am sure the negotiators will turn our slogan ""One Africa, one voice and one position"" into a reality. An unfair agreement will be considered as a gross violation of the African people's rights."" he concluded. Mrs. Mwanahamisi Singano, Lead of the Oxfam Public campaign encouraged Africans to advocate for gender responsive agreement. As a matter of fact, women, most often responsible for feeding their families, are being hit hardest by the impact of climate change. She also said that the willingness of the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, namely China and the United States of America, to reduce their emission is a positive message to the world. In the same vein, Mr. Mithika Mwenda, Secretary General of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) urged African countries to remain united during COP 21 as well as to avoid a mitigation centric position, as was the was the previously. He added that instead of 20C, Africa should stand for 1,5 0C during the negotiations. Furthermore, he argued that justice should be at the center of the Agreement in Paris. ""Climate justice means that those who have caused the damages of the climate change should also provide means to solve the consequences on other people."" He said. Aba Melake Selam, representing the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, stated that the protection of our environment is a sacred duty for all the mankind. He underlined that the consideration of that moral obligation will pave the way for a fair agreement during COP 21 . He also said that the Church will keep supporting African stakeholders in that regard. All the participants agreed that the continent should be consistent during the negotiations COP 21 as well as they highlighted the need for an inclusive and global agreement during the Conference. The agreement to be reached at the Conference of the parties will replace the Kyoto Protocol that was adopted in Kyoto, Japan on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005.

The panel, which took place as part of the Caring for Climate Business Forum at COP21 in Paris, explored new approaches to scaling up green investments in emerging markets. IFC, the largest global development finance institution supporting the private sector in emerging markets, has been at the forefront of climate change mitigation efforts in the past decade, with a total of $ 13 billion in long-term finance in projects in renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, green buildings, and adaptation. Through its advisory work, IFC has enabled a further $ 5.4 billion in climate-related investment projects. IFC's climate-related interventions last year alone are expected to reduce 9.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent to taking more than 2 million passenger vehicles off the road. 'Fighting climate change requires the full buy-in and participation of the private sector. It also offers a triple-win: it's good for business, good for society, and good for the planet,' said Dimitris Tsitsiragos, IFC Vice President for Global Client Services, while offering opening remarks at the panel. 'We, at IFC are committed to supporting the private sector's response to climate change and as part of the World Bank Group, have committed to doubling our investment volume by year 2020.' An increasing number of companies are acting to address the challenge, either by reducing their own emissions or expanding their businesses in a way that contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Companies at the event shared valuable insights and perspectives from a diverse set of industries: International Housing Solutions of South Africa is boosting the affordable energy-efficient housing market; Azure Power of India is responding to the government's challenge to install a hundred gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2022; Hexagon of Turkey is championing a creative waste-to- energy and fertilizer model; Solar Power Company Group of Thailand is transforming the country's renewable energy capacity with utility-scale solar farms; and India's Mahindra Group is showcasing its leadership in corporate carbon pricing. 'Our experience working in emerging markets globally points us to vast opportunities for innovation, both in terms of increasing climate-smart investments in emerging markets, and also in implementing new tools to help meet the enormous climate finance gap,' said Christian Grossmann, IFC Director for Climate Change. 'We hope these exchanges throughout COP21 will translate into actionable next steps for IFC and our partners.' About IFC IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. Working with more than 2,000 businesses worldwide, we use our capital, expertise, and influence, to create opportunity where it's needed most.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK194","-Delta Invited by German Pavilion to Co-organize UN Side Event Focusing on Energy Efficiency Improvement","December 14, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","Paris - Delta Group was invited by the German Pavilion of the UN Conference on Climate Change to co-organize an official side event with the UBA, the international environmental NGO Climate Alliance, and Leeds University of the UK to highlight the importance of energy efficiency on reducing carbon emissions. The side event, one of the most relevant today at COP21 , includes parties such as governments, research institutions and enterprises to discuss the energy efficiency at a city level. Delta, as the only representative from the business sector, had its CEO Mr. Ping Cheng and its Chief Brand Officer and Executive Director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, providing keynote speeches on how Delta develops technology capable of delivering significant energy savings and how it enhances public awareness of energy savings through various initiatives. Delta's CEO Mr. Cheng said: 'Delta's corporate mission is 'To provide innovative, clean and efficient-energy solutions for a better tomorrow.' Delta provides innovative, highly efficient, and easily scalable solutions for emerging countries to support both rapid economic growth and reduced environmental impact. For developed countries, Delta provides solutions with leading energy efficiency and works with partners and customers to build smart and green lifestyles together.' Delta's Chief Brand Officer and Executive Director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, pointed out: 'By displaying the highlights of the documentary film 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above' that Delta sponsored two years ago, we can show the international community beautiful aerial photography of Taiwan and deliver the message that we must live in harmony with our planet. Delta has promoted energy conservation and has linked up with the international community for years. We interpret IPCC research reports and increase the awareness of environmental issues for the public in Taiwan. This year, Delta shares its experience in realizing 21 green buildings over the past decade with the international community at the COP21 in Paris. The aim is to call for higher awareness of the potential energy savings offered by green buildings as well as to assist the public in developing positive habits of energy consumption.' The opinion leaders in the meeting are all interested in the private sector's role against climate change. 'Delta has industry-leading energy efficiency, and its business development is aligned with the global trend of lower carbon emissions. Delta also cultivates energy conservation education in order to raise public awareness on climate issues. More importantly, Delta uses its technology to enable higher energy-saving standards capable of providing a positive contribution to climate policies, thus, realizing its corporate social responsibility,' said Ms. Shan-Shan Guo. How companies can utilize a broad range of energy-saving technologies in developed and emerging countries is a topic that was actively discussed during this side event. Delta's social participation and product technologies are closely linked to energy savings. The company continuously responds to the changing world through innovation. Delta's founder, Mr. Bruce Cheng, established the company in the 1970s when a global oil crisis made him realize the importance of energy conservation. He invested in the development of switching power supplies to dramatically improve the energy efficiency of power systems. Facing the current crisis of climate change, Delta integrates software and hardware technology to provide energy-saving solutions for both newly emerging countries and developed countries. These include, for example, the introduction of SCARA robot arms to speed up industrial automation in countries that focus on manufacturing; the establishment of 388 quick electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Norway for low-carbon transport; the provision of 10,000 sets of high-precision solar tracking systems for a US solar concentrated power plant that produces 500 million kWh of clean energy and the application of ground source heat pump and building automation technology to Delta America's net-zero energy headquarters building in California, USA. The Delta Electronics Foundation actively cooperates with academia to provide guidance for energy conservation standards including the world's third 'building carbon footprint' assessment system, industrial standards for energy-saving products such as LED lighting, and green factory certificate systems. Additionally, through interactive projection technology and art and cultural exhibition design, Delta communicates with the public on environmental issues through exhibitions such as the 'Run for Water, Water for Run' Environmental Education Exhibition last year and 'Delta 21 Green Buildings at COP21 Exhibition' this year in Paris.

""In rising to the climate challenge, we can set the world on a sustainable footing for generations to come, and lay the foundation for prosperity and security for all,"" he said one week into COP21 , which kicked off at the Paris-Le Bourget site last Monday in the north-east of the French capital. Today, the second week of negotiations begins, with the aim of reaching a new universal climate agreement to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. ""A week ago, 150 world leaders stood here and pledged their full support for a robust global climate agreement that is equal to the test we face,"" Mr. Ban recalled. ""Never before have so many Heads of State and Government gathered in one place at one time with one common purpose."" The UN chief underlined that leaders have assured him they will work to remove any roadblocks. ""They have called for strong ambition and re-affirmed their support for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and strengthening resilience to changes to come,"" he stressed, calling on leaders to translate ""this historic call for action into a durable, dynamic, credible and fair climate agreement."" Noting that outside the negotiating halls there is a ""rising global tide for a strong, universal agreement,"" he voiced what the people of the world expect from those working towards its achievement. ""First, we need an agreement that will limit temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. For many, including low-lying and least developed countries, even a 1.5 degree rise will have grave consequences,"" he insisted. ""Second, the private sector needs a clear signal that the low-emissions transformation of the global economy is inevitable, beneficial and already under way. Third, developed countries must agree to lead, and developing countries need to assume increasing responsibility in line with their capabilities. Fourth, the agreement must ensure sufficient, balanced adaptation and mitigation support for developing countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable."" Finally, he said the agreement must provide a single framework for measuring, monitoring and reporting progress in a transparent manner. ""The decisions you make here will reverberate down through the ages,"" he declared. The Secretary-General also recounted a conversation he had with a young Norwegian explorer yesterday, named Erika. While visiting the Tara research vessel currently banked on the Seine, she told him: ""We are the future. Your decisions today will be our future."" MORE TO FOLLOW \"

The Prince of Wales, in France to collect a top award for his environmental campaigning, spoke of the ""unspeakable atrocities"" carried out by Islamic State terrorists who slaughtered 130 innocent people. Speaking in the heart of Paris, he said: ""I can only begin by saying how heavy my heart is at the dreadful anguish suffered by those who lost their loved ones in the unspeakable atrocities of two weeks ago and how my deepest sympathy and solidarity are with the French people. ""Against a background of such inhuman violence and terror, it is almost impossible to talk sensibly about matters of everyday civilization. ""Yet that is what I propose to do, because in the face of such awfulness it may help to be reminded of the simple and timeless human values that lie at the heart of our society. ""Timeless values such as sustainability, cultural identity, community, health and taste - intangible things that nourish body, mind and the human spirit - are more important than pure convenience or soulless efficiency."" The prince delivered his speech partly in English and partly in French. Collecting his award, a medal, he said: ""I have spent many years, and a good deal of breath, extolling the benefits of working with nature - harnessing positive forces through healthy soil, healthy crops and healthy animals, to provide healthy food for people.""

Major roads into the capital have been closed since yesterday with about 2,800 police and soldiers guarding the conference venue near Le Bourget airport, north of Paris. Another 6,300 officers are deployed in the city, which is still reeling from the onslaught by Islamist gunmen on restaurants, a concert hall and the national football stadium on November 13. Charles, in Paris until tomorrow, addressed the opening session of COP21 . In his keynote speech, he echoed Sir Winston Churchill on the Battle of Britain, saying, ""Rarely in human history have so many people around the world placed their trust in so few. Your deliberations over the next two weeks will decide the fate not only of those alive today, but also of generations yet unborn. ""So I can only urge you to think of your grandchildren, as I think of mine, and of those billions of people without a voice; those for whom hope is the rarest of sensations; those for whom a secure life is a distant prospect. Most of all, I urge you to consider the needs of the youngest generation, because none of us has the right to assume that 'for our today they should give up their tomorrow'."" He added: ""On an increasingly crowded planet, humanity faces many threats - but none is greater than climate change. ""It magnifies every hazard and tension of our existence. It threatens our ability to feed ourselves; to remain healthy and safe from extreme weather; to manage the natural resources that support our economies, and to avert the humanitarian disaster of mass migration and increasing conflict. ""In damaging our climate we become the architects of our own destruction. While the planet can survive the scorching of the earth and the rising of the waters, the human race cannot. ""To avoid catastrophe we must restrict climate change to less than two degrees, which requires a dramatic reduction in carbon emissions. This can be done. We have the knowledge, the tools and the money - only 1.7 per cent of global annual consumption would be required to put us on the right low carbon path for 2030."" He added: ""If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago. You, ladies and gentlemen, have the power to put her on life support, and you must surely start the emergency procedures now."" Tomorrow Charles will deliver another speech on global efforts to protect forests. But many leaders will spend only a few hours at Le Bourget before leaving their national delegations to pursue more detailed discussions. In all, more than 40,000 people are expected to attend the two-week conference. @theroyaleditor 'In the face of such awfulness, it may help to be reminded of simple and timeless human values' Prince Charles \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK197","-Odebrecht Reinforces Commitment to Sustainability during COP-21","December 7, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","Companies, organizations and governments from all over the world have been meeting since November 30 to define a global agreement that includes goals to reduce carbon emissions and combat the causes of global warming. The Paris Climate Conference - COP 21 takes place until December 11 and is part of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN agency that gathers countries together to negotiate agreements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Odebrecht Group is one of the meeting participants, represented by Braskem, Odebrecht Environmental and Construtora Norberto Odebrecht. A member of the UN Global Compact, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) considered Braskem the top Brazilian company in carbon management in 2015. Odebrecht Environmental confirmed its participation in the Compact - an initiative that mobilizes companies to adopt principles in the areas of human rights, labor relations, environment and the fight against corruption. Construtora Norberto Odebrecht is a member of the Climate Forum, which launched the Open Letter to Brazil about Climate Change in August, a document that renews and expands the commitments assumed by the Forum companies as part of the 2009 Open Letter. In 2015, another five Businesses also agreed to assume the commitment in the Open Letter to Brazil: Odebrecht Oil & Gas, Braskem, Odebrecht Real Estate Developments, Odebrecht Agroindustrial, Odebrecht Environmental and the Odebrecht Renewable Energy asset. All Businesses Sergio Leao, responsible for Sustainability at Odebrecht S.A., is one of the participants of COP-21 in Paris. He emphasized the advances that all the Group Businesses have made to move forward with the climate agenda. 'We have a Sustainability Policy and guidelines that offer orientations about good practices and the responsibilities our Businesses assume when it comes to innovation and the use of cleaner technologies,' said Leao. Leao pointed out the position adopted by Brazilian companies that have been pioneers in innovation - as in Odebrecht's case. 'In 2015, with the UN launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with the mobilizations to reach agreements about climate change, the Group has taken a vanguard position, in line with other business groups that assumed the leadership in terms of sustainable commitments for the upcoming years,' he said. Just a few days before the start of COP 21 , held this week, Braskem was elected the Best Brazilian Company in Carbon Management, according to the ranking elaborated by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The position is the highlight of the 73 Brazilian companies that responded to the CDP, one of the world's most respected indicators in capital markets. The Business is also recognized by other indexes focused on good practices in sustainability. On the BM&FBovespa, it is listed as Level 1 of Corporate Governance and was selected for the 11th time to join the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) portfolio. It is also part of the theoretical portfolio of the Efficient Carbon Index (ICO2) - a group of 30 companies that accepted adopting transparent practices related to their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. For the fourth consecutive year, it was also cited by the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) index. Braskem defined 10 goals to be met by 2020, with topics like Water and Energy Efficiency. One of the results achieved was the reduction of 4.4 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions between 2008 and 2014 - equivalent to the planting of 30 million trees. Highlight on some of its products that have helped optimize resources and reduce gas emissions: Green Plastic and the Maxio resin line. 'Braskem has been committed to adopting sustainable development principles since the very start. Since then, we have remained attentive to the opportunities to increase our contribution to sustainability,' said Jorge Soto, Sustainability Development Director at Braskem. The search for new technologies, environmental solutions and process improvements that guarantee an environmentally sustainable operation are commitments that Odebrecht Environmental has assumed since its foundation. The concern with risk management associated with climate change, such as the water crisis and search for alternative energy sources are on the agenda of all the Units. Since 2012, the Business has conducted its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory. The studies have made it possible to verify opportunities for reducing gas emissions and demonstrate that the main sources of emission are associated with wastewater management: in first place, they are associated with the sewage treatment process itself (which works through anaerobic digestion to make organic bacteria produce carbon dioxide, methane and other gases). In second place, the emissions are related to the consumption of electricity necessary for operation, mainly in the segments of Water and Sewage and Utilities (Industrial Operations). Odebrecht Environmental is investing in new Sewage Treatment Plants and new technologies, like the Nereda system, which releases less gases (since it uses aerobic treatment) and reduces the electricity consumption by approximately 25%. Alternative sources are also being studied, such as the use of solar energy (through the use of Photovoltaic Panels) and biogas systems generated by the treatment plants. In the Utilities operations, members are testing solutions like a frequency inverter to reduce energy consumption, installation of equipment in the plant's refrigeration system and automation software, also designed to reduce the energy consumption. 'The importance of COP - 21 , held during a time in which the world is facing economic crises, political disputes and different agendas, is enormous,' said Monica Queiroz, responsible for Sustainability at Odebrecht Environmental. 'We have the possibility to witness a movement of global participation and effort, in which all countries can contribute toward the discussions on climate issues,' she said. Sustainable Infrastructure Since 2011, Construtora Norberto Odebrecht has also conducted GHG Inventories. The results are evaluated and disclosed on platforms like the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and Climate Forum. Since 2014, the information has been externally verified, guaranteeing the Gold Seal two times for the classification of the inventories completed by the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program. The quest to reduce emissions is part of all the Group's Engineering and Construction projects worldwide. One example is the Panamanian Road Recovery and Duplication Project, considered Panama's largest road project. By reusing 130,000 m-3 of concrete waste that would be discarded, the project saved 106,000 liters of fuel when transporting debris and new materials - saving 346 t of CO2e. (carbon dioxide equivalent) from being released into the atmosphere. At the Tom Jobim International Airport construction project in Rio de Janeiro, the Business used the BubbleDeck technology - plastic spheres that replace the concrete portion of slabs. With the alternative, the company ceased from releasing 2,000 CO2e (which would be released to produce steel and concrete, extract wood and transport materials). Another example is the use of biodiesel (B20) at the Naval Base Shipyard Project in Rio de Janeiro and for the Sao Paulo Subway Lilac Line - Lot7. At the same time, Engineering and Construction includes proposals in its projects that help adapt the infrastructures to climate change, minimizing the environmental impacts for society and its clients. 'We are working to boost the efficiency of our processes to reduce emissions at each one of the projects with which are involved. Our biggest challenge is establishing comparisons, granted that the processes change based on the type and stage of the projects,' Gabriel Azevedo, responsible for Sustainability at Construtora Norberto Odebrecht.

In December a new international climate agreement will be sought at a special UN summit in Paris. On Wednesday the environment committee adopted a report setting out Parliament's aims for the negotiations. After the Committee vote, EP rapporteur Gilles Pargneaux (S&D, FR) talked to us on the goals agreed upon. The plenary vote is foreseen for October 14. The report suggests that Parliament advocate a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2030. How do you convince China, the US and, of course, the European Union and its member states to accept this ambitious target? It is a negotiation process. My report was adopted this morning by the ENVI committee and the plenary will vote on it in on 14 October in plenary . It is the official position of the European Parliament. The Parliament will be present at the COP21 in Paris. From the moment we have our position - a position that exceeds other countries', like China, in ambition, our objective will be to convince. We will be an official delegation, we will be in contact with third countries in the COP21 , an international summit, to not only dialogue, but decide. Your report calls for additional sources of climate finance to support greater efforts for greenhouse gas reduction and adapt to climate change impacts. How should the money for these measures be raised? We need a credible finance package, hence the proposal for a roadmap to supply the Green Climate Fund with $ 100 billion per year, which will allow us to support the most vulnerable countries that do not have the means to fight against climate change. The fund will consist of state contributions. The report also proposes a certain number of innovative recipes linked, for example, to new energies to supply the fund with. The financial package will clearly be the cornerstone of the Paris agreement. If we fail to find an agreement on the Green Fund and on how to provide it, I think that unfortunately, we will either end up with either a non-agreement or a half-failure. What role will the European Parliament have in the COP21 negotiations? We believe that the European Parliament should be at the forefront to ensure success at the COP 21 , as this is the battle of the century. If nothing is done, we will have an increase of the average global temperature by above 2 degrees. We will see natural disasters and food crises multiplied. If nothing is done, experts say we are looking at almost 200 million climate refugees in the world. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK200","INSIGHT: COP 21 implications unlcear for Europe industry","October 15, 2015 Thursday","ICIS Chemical News","By Tom Brown LONDON (ICIS)--Observers of the endless ripples and occasional tsunamis of international diplomacy can be forgiven for taking international accords, particularly on issues such as poverty and the environment, with a pinch of salt. The pressure on the day of an international summit to come to an - often non-binding - agreement can often be followed by years of indifference and vague gestures, as more immediate issues such as economic growth override nebulous future commitments. The upcoming UN climate change summit, running from 30 November to 11 December in Paris this year, is aiming for more than that. Whereas the 20th annual Conference of Parties (COP) in Lima last year led to the drafting of the Lima Call for Climate Action, the UN is looking to lock down legally-binding accords on emissions reduction at COP 21 . So far, 148 countries covering 87% of global greenhouse emissions have submitted intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) towards cutting emissions. This has implications for the chemical industry on both sides of the equation. As Cefic president and Solvay chief executive, Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, noted at the trade body's general assembly in Brussels last week: "" COP 21 is an important event for the chemical industry. We are both large contributor to emissions, we are large users of energy, but we are also a very important provider of technologies and solutions when moving into a low-carbon economy."" The former seemed to concern Clamadieu more than the latter. For the last few years, the theme of Cefic's general assembly has been European industry competitiveness in one form or another, but this year the promises made by the European Commission ahead of COP 21 were presented as one of the more pressing issues for the industry. Numerous large economies have signed on at least indicatively to commit to ambitious emissions reduction targets. While questions remain whether the US is on track to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 17% compared to 2005 levels by 2020, the current target, President Obama is expected to commit to a 26% reduction by 2025. Even China, which has previously shrugged off western criticism of its pollution levels, has moderated its language on emissions as the public health impact of air quality in some parts of the country has led to growing protest from the country's expanding middle class. China is now expected to try to cut down on CO2 emissions so that they would peak around 2030. But it is the EU's commitments that are concerning Cefic. The region is to pledge to cut GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030, an ambitious target. Clamadieu, noting that European chemicals producers have cut their GHG emissions in half over the past 25 years said that the target could stand to hit industry competitiveness in terms of energy costs and how much stricter a target is being adopted at home compared to neighbouring economies. ""We are seeing a point at COP where Europe has put very ambitious goals, and when we look at what... our neighbours have put on the table, Europe is leading the way by far,"" he said at the Cefic general assembly. ""Europe is very ambitious, and we don't see the same level of ambition in most of the other large industrial countries. COP should be an opportunity to create some convergence between large economies,"" he added. While the decision to call for other economies to increase their commitments instead of requesting that the European Commission cut its own may be political, it illustrates some of the contrasting attitudes towards emissions reduction and regulation in Europe and the US. Quoted in The Wall Street Journal last week, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said that technological innovation would be insufficient to achieve emissions reductions necessary to keep global temperature increases below two degrees, and that governments should intercede. ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerman, by contrast, said that free markets and competition are the best spurs to achieving emissions reduction targets, and that he would only accept a carbon tax if it was offset by tax reductions in other areas. The sharp contrast between the views of the two oil magnates could be due in part to the way regulations are perceived in Europe compared to America, and communications between the private sector and the government. It is widely felt that there remains more of a dialogue between corporations and the government in the US, whereas the conversations within the EU tend to be flow from regulator to regulated. While protests against any new regulation or cost are a common refrain among trade groups, it is true that Europe is set to adopt some of the most ambitious emissions targets. This at a time when energy-intensive industries such as petrochemicals are already struggling with the highest cost base of any region in the world. However, the other side of Clamadieu's cost/innovation dichotomy should not be forgotten. Chemicals producers provide the innovations and compounds necessary for other industries to meet their on emissions-reduction targets. And as with any other international summit, the outcome remains far from clear. ""I am quite certain at the end of the COP, people will call it a success... but what will be within the Paris agreement is still a little bit unclear,"" Clamadieu said. ""There could be voluntary commitments from various countries... [and] when you add up the so-called NDICs you will be far from the numbers [that would secure the target].We wonder whether this will be binding our not,"" he added. Photo: Rex/Shutterstock \"

Relations between the two neighbours hit the lowest ebb after Kabul blamed Islamabad for an upsurge in Taliban violence that followed a bitter leadership row in the orthodox militia triggered by the confirmation of the death of its longtime leader Mullah Omar in July, this year. Kabul urged to bridge trust gap with Pakistan The delegation discussed bilateral relations, and peace and security in the region, according to private Pajhwok news agency. ""President Ghani has accepted the invitation to meet Nawaz Sharif,"" it quoted an unnamed official as saying. The delegation comprises Awami National Party President Asfandyar Wali, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Qaumi Wattan Party leader Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao. Former Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa governor Shaukatullah Khan and former ambassador Ayaz Wazir are also accompanying them. Though there is no official word on when and where the two leaders will meet, there are indications the meeting might take place in Paris on the on the sidelines of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21 or CMP 11. The conference will begin on November 30 and continue until December 11. Ashraf Ghani seeks Pakistani Pashtun leaders' assistance Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman said he has no knowledge of any scheduled meeting between Ghani and Nawaz. ""No such meeting was scheduled until the departure of our delegation from Islamabad,"" Qazi Khalilullah told The Express Tribune when asked about the Afghan media reports. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is currently in Malta for the Commonwealth Summit, will attend the opening ceremony of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris on Monday, according to Minister for Climate Change Zahid Hamid. The Afghan media reports came after China's ambassador in Kabul reportedly conveyed a message from the Chinese leadership to the Afghan government, advising President Ghani to attend the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in Islamabad on December 8. Ghani had attended the group's last meeting in Beijing in 2014. The conference will focus on peace and economic development in Afghanistan. The Chinese special envoy for Afghanistan Deng Xijun told The Express Tribune earlier this month that Beijing wanted Pakistan and Afghanistan to sit down and remove bilateral differences through talks. Deng met the Pakistani and Afghan leaders during his first visit to both the countries. Afghan minister to attend JEC huddle Pajhwok reported that earlier there was a proposal from British Prime Minister David Cameron that Nawaz and Ghani meet in Paris, however, the latter did not agree. ""Consequently, Pakistan has sent the Pashtun leaders to Kabul to persuade Ghani [for the meeting],"" according to the report. The delegation of Pashtun leaders met President Ghani, his predecessor Hamid Karzai and other Afghan officials, and participated in a reference in the memory of veteran Pashtun nationalist leader Afzal Khan Lala, who passed away earlier this month in his hometown of Swat. Asfandyar had met Premier Nawaz before leaving for Kabul on Thursday. Source: Express Tribune website, Karachi, in English 29 Nov 15 \"

The Paris agreement was a pleasant surprise for advocates for a market mechanism to spur private investment in carbon sequestering timber operations, Williams said at the RISI Global Timber Investment conference in New York. In 2015, leaders of 196 countries reached a preliminary agreement to voluntarily reduce their net carbon emissions, with the eventual goal of keeping global temperatures from increasing by more than between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. ""There was a lack of optimism about how market mechanisms would be treated in these talks,"" he said. ""[But] the climate pact specifically encourages [forest] preservation as a strategy for meeting climate goals."" But a robust, effective market does not mean a simple one. The nascent markets in California, Chicago and London have attracted a diverse group of public and private players. ""You're going to have the ability for a lot of different markets to show up. It's not going to be just one centralised spot,"" he said. ""You're likely going to have a situation where your path to value could come from a bilateral agreement, a private foundation, a multilateral institution such as the World Bank or sovereign funding."" A record 34.4 tonnes of sequestration credits were traded in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the vast majority voluntarily. Though Williams said this showed the strength of the market, the fact that commitments for carbon emission reductions are voluntary is a challenge. ""The real enforcement mechanism,"" said Williams, ""I characterise ... as public shaming."" 16.03.201610:41 \"

What really galls me is that we have a Prime Minister who thinks it is perfectly acceptable to attend Paris and sign a declaration that we will ""try"" to keep temperature rises to below 2C while his Government are reducing subsidies for renewable energy. Without renewable energy, we won't be able to drive properly efficient vehicles and we certainly won't be able to achieve the commitment to minimise carbon pollution as much as we could. What is most telling is that Mr Cameron and his Ministers are not bound by the outcome of the Climate Conference but are legally bound by the Climate Change Act, 2008. The 2008 Act commits the Government to reducing emissions by at least 80 per cent come 2050 from 1990 levels. They can wriggle when it comes to failure to achieve the COP21 commitments. However, the Government seem to say one thing and do another. There is no wriggle room with the Climate Change Act. We know COP21 COP21 ? Of course not. The majority of citizens can barely find time to lift their heads from the grind of life, never mind concern themselves with the subtleties of climate policy and transport emissions. What we should all care about is making our money go further and keeping our kids healthy. Being sustainable can do that. It might also keep our feet dry and enable us to escape the worst consequences of changing weather patterns. I cannot promise that, though. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK206","Shipping industry fears IMO climate change efforts may miss COP21 boat","December 10, 2015 Thursday 04:12 PM GMT","IHS Fairplay Daily News","The negative implications for the shipping industry if it is left out of the latest draft text of the UN climate change agreement have led to strong reactions from the shipping industry. As drafts of the agreement are published, fears are growing among industry players that an exclusion will undermine ongoing environmental efforts by the IMO and leave the door open for unilateral action from states and regional bodies. There is also concern that Article 3 of the latest draft, which cites mitigation measures to be taken by states, will see shipping bundled in with national initiatives. A spokesman for the shipping industry, who wished to remain anonymous, told IHS Fairplay, ""We are concerned that there could be economy-wide efforts to establish absolute targets for Annex 1 (developed) countries to come up with absolute targets to cover their entire economies. We are not sure if, without reference to the IMO in the agreement, shipping might fall into this category. But shipping is a global industry and should not be included in national-level schemes."" References to shipping's regulator (and also that of aviation) has gradually been dwindling, and in the last draft text reported on by IHS Fairplay on 3 December, the two options put forward for inclusion in the final text were to cite the IMO as chiefly responsible for CO2 emissions reductions by shipping, or to include no textual reference. The spokesman told IHS Fairplay that reference to the IMO in the final COP21 text is required to demonstrate global support for the regulator. Citing the European monitoring, reporting, and verification initiative as an example, he said, ""This scheme has been started, a global data collection system will be created, and we have got everyone on board. We feel this should be supported instead of undermined. By having a reference to the IMO [in the final text], that will be a great way to support it - it will give a clear signal that the leaders of 195 countries agree that the IMO should go ahead and find a solution, building on what has already been achieved to date."" Another draft of the final agreement is expected today (10 December). Anticipating this, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the European Community Shipowners' Associations (ECSA) have issued strong statements against the current lack of reference to the IMO. ECSA secretary general Patrick Verhoeven said, ""We firmly believe that deleting any reference to shipping and the progress needed at IMO level is a missed opportunity."" Peter Hinchliffe, ICS secretary general, said, ""[Reference] would give extra encouragement to build on the global regulations IMO has already successfully adopted and which should reduce CO2 per tonne/km 50% by 2050. ""However, the absence of text is unlikely to inhibit the aspirations of governments - which are shared by the industry - for IMO to take further action. ""Virtually all [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] parties and IMO member states have made clear that they expect the industry to deliver more, and that work on CO2 reduction must continue at IMO, as set out in the original Kyoto Protocol,"" he said.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK207","COP21: saving energy 'triple win,' Ban says, as $ 5 billion Africa plan launched at climate summit","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","December 8, 2015 The United Nations and partners launched today a $ 5 billion initiative to expand renewable energy capacity in Africa as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the UN climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris that saving energy is a triple-win in the battle against global warming. ""The production and use of energy is responsible for more than half of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. That means energy is also more than half of the solution. We need sustainable energy to reduce global greenhouse emissions and avert the risks of runaway climate change,"" Mr. Ban said, stressing that clean energy is equally important for ending extreme poverty. ""Saving energy is a triple-win solution. It can save money, reduce emissions, and provide additional energy capacity,"" he added, noting that renewable energy technologies are becoming cheaper and more competitive, with many people accessing energy for the first time thanks to solar panels, wind turbines or small hydro power plant. ""But, to replicate this experience for billions more people, we will need finance,"" he declared. ""Let us build on these bold initiatives. A global energy transformation must reduce heat-trapping emissions. It also needs to ensure that we leave no one behind. Those things can only be achieved if we tackle the issues of energy access, energy efficiency, and renewable energy together as a trinity."" COP21 held a thematic day on energy today, with the Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4All), a multi-stakeholder partnership backed by the UN and World Bank, urging Governments, businesses and financial institutions to act much faster and go much further to meet the ambitious goals of ensuring sustainable energy for all while keeping the global temperature rise within 2 degrees Celsius. SE4All is acting as a catalyst for a huge global movement for revolutionary change in the world's energy systems, helping to build working alliances across the public sector, private sector and civil society and foster innovative policies, technologies and financing mechanisms. Any rise of more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2050 will have an ever more dangerous impact on planet Earth with devastating droughts, floods and storms, and rising seas swallowing up ever more low-lying land. The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative to expand renewable capacity by 2020 and achieve universal access was just one of several launched today. The Initiative is led by the African Union's NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa's Development) the African Group of Negotiators, the African Development Bank, the UN Environment Program (UNEP), and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). At least $ 5 billion in public and highly concessional finance between 2016 and 2020 from bilateral, multilateral and other sources, including the Green Climate Fund, will be needed to leverage a further $ 15 billion in other investments, for a total investment of at least $ 20 billion pre-2020. Other initiatives launched today included efforts to improve access to electricity and energy efficiency, and promote renewable energy. Hundreds of Governments, businesses and financial institutions pledged major action on energy efficiency, recognizing it as the basis of the energy transition. More than 100 banks and a group of investors, managing close to $ 4 trillion in assets, committed to a major increase in energy efficiency lending in their portfolios. Led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the UNEP Finance Initiative, this is a major undertaking toward the four-fold increase needed to realize the full energy efficiency potential for climate change.' \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK208","ENGIE and UN-Habitat's World Urban Campaign have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to join forces for a better urban future.","February 15, 2016 Monday","FinancialWire","By joining the World Urban Campaign (WUC) as a Sponsoring Partner, ENGIE becomes an official partner of UN-Habitat and commits itself to the agency's overall mandate: to promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities.JOINING THE #UrbanThinkers COMMUNITY ENGIE becomes part of the WUC #UrbanThinkers community with more than 136 partners to date. The WUC is an advocacy and partnership platform to raise awareness about positive urban change in order to achieve green, productive, safe, healthy, inclusive, and well planned cities. The WUC is part of UN-Habitat's work programme. It is governed by a Steering Committee, composed of UN-Habitat partner organizations, and acts as an advisory body to UN-Habitat's Executive Director Dr. Joan Clos.ENGIE - A GLOBAL PRESENCE TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR RAPIDLY GROWING CITIES ENGIE is a global energy player acting in 70 countries. The Group develops its businesses around a model based on responsible growth to take on the major challenges of energy's transition to a low-carbon economy: access to sustainable energy, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, and the rational use of resources. ENGIE aims at becoming the leading architect of the energy transition, and cities have emerged as key drivers of this transformation. Representing 54% of the world's population today - a proportion that will grow to 70% by 2050 - as well as 75% of total energy consumption and 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, cities are more than ever the places where global challenges in demographics, natural resources, and climate play out. To better address the needs of its urban stakeholders, the Group is working with local ecosystems and making its diverse capabilities available to cities through customized, outcome-based solutions that integrate a wide range of services. These include decentralized renewable energy production, eco-districts, smart grids, green mobility, security, e-citizenship, and more. ENGIE is proud to join the World Urban Campaign associating all stakeholders involved in the preparation of Habitat III, which is a unique opportunity to foster innovation and promote solutions making cities safer, more sustainable, efficient and attractive.MOBILIZING FOR CLIMATE ENGIE was an official partner of COP21 , the 21st UN Conference on climate change in Paris last December. At this critical time, ENGIE set out its commitments to a global carbon pricing and its involvement on the international climate change negotiations.TOWARDS THE CITY WE NEED, HABITAT III AND BEYOND The WUC builds on the main legacy of the Habitat II Conference (Istanbul, 1996). In particular, the campaign comes as a direct response to the need for partnerships between governments and the private sector, civil society organizations, local authorities, the research community, trade unions, parliamentarians, professional organizations, youth and women groups, in order to achieve sustainable urban development. This spirit of partnership was first concretized after the conference by two global campaigns (1999) on the themes of Secure Tenure and Good Urban Governance. Those two UN-Habitat campaigns were merged in 2009 to form the World Urban Campaign, a single forward looking strategic campaign to mobilize networks of Habitat Agenda partners to implement a shared vision of sustainable urbanization. From its inception in 2009, the WUC has moved from a network of organizations united by the same purpose towards a strong platform dedicated to identified advocacy and knowledge sharing goals. In light of the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), which will be one of the first large UN Conferences after COP21 and will be held in Quito/Ecuador from 17 to 20 October 2016, the WUC has gradually asserted itself as a consensus-building platform towards a New Urban Agenda, the main outcome document of Habitat III. Through various activities, such as The City We Need, the Urban Thinkers Campuses, Urban Campaigns and a special initiative, the General Assembly of Partners (GAP), the WUC encourages its partners to contribute not only to the New Urban Agenda, but also to the implementation of the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK209","Gerard Mestrallet and the Business Dialogue Community submit their Final Report to the Presidency of COP21","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","December 7, 2015 On the occasion of COP21 Business Day in Paris Le Bourget, Laurent Fabius - French Minister of Foreign Affairs, in charge of COP21 Presidency - and Christiana Figueres - Executive Secretary of UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) - received the ""Business Dialogue Report"" from Gerard Mestrallet, chairman and CEO of ENGIE, who is in charge with Laurence Tubiana - Special Representative to the COP21 - to animate the Business Dialogue, an organization bringing together negotiators from around 30 countries and international CEOs from all sectors. This report which is summarized on 10 recommendations is proposing to adopt a universal binding international climate agreement aligned with the 2\'b0C target. To reach this goal, the Business Dialogue supports among other things a generalization of carbon pricing signals and the development of mature and breakthrough technologies (see below the 10 recommendations in total). The creation of the Business Dialogue was based on the conviction that, in the fight against climate change, the role of the Business Community is key. That creating a solid platform allowing the business sector and the public sector to share opinions on the issues at stake and solutions regarding climate change would allow both parties to have a better understanding of what the already existing solutions that need to be scaled-up are, and where the needs for innovation are. The aim of the Business Dialogue is also to share understanding between public and private leaders on the issues at stake in the negotiations challenges and on barriers to low carbon technologies solutions. Four sessions were programmed, with different partners each time : A first session organized in Paris on May 20th launched the Business Dialogue and allowed an initial discussion on the main issues and progress of climate negotiations and the role of the private sector. It was prepared with the Global Compact and the World Economic Forum. The second session, in New York on September 26th, focused on carbon pricing, sharing implementation experience and exchanging views on possible developments. The third session organized in Tokyo on October 6th focused on the role of technologies in the future agreement and the transition towards low-carbon societies. A fourth session will be held early next year in Morocco, which will organize the COP22. This initiative aims to create an open and flexible exchange ahead of the COP21 and continuing afterwards, with the aim of building a long-term institutional relationship between public and private sectors. The 10 recommendations of the Final Business Dialogue Report : Build bridges between jurisdictions,Give visibility and confidence to investors.Remove barriers preventing market-wide deployment of available emissions savings solutions,Pursue the development of supportive regulations and funding incentives for market-introduction of mature solutions and promising technologies,Encourage R&D. Adopt a Universal binding International climate agreement aligned with the 2\'b0C target as of 2020, to provide the long-term and predictable framework necessary to support scaling-up low carbon technologies and encourage low-carbon operations and investments, in particular in the countries that need it most. Translate INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) into national low carbon roadmaps and sectoral roadmaps to give business a clear sense of the expected outcome and of the pathway to design new business models. Include a provision in the Paris agreement encouraging the generalization of carbon pricing signals, the inclusion of related provisions in each country INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions), and further work on pricing mechanisms interconnections between willing countries. Determine key principles for carbon pricing design: carbon pricing mechanisms shall be precise, clear, transparent and deliver a price signal progressive and high enough to trigger low carbon operating and investment decisions. Agree to transparent monitoring, reporting and verification modalities which will eventually help: Enforce mechanisms dedicated to the deployment of mature solutions and the development of breakthrough technologies, and thus: Develop collaborative platforms between governments, companies including SMEs (Small and Medium Sized Enterprises) and third parties in order to: build capacity in the developing countries that need it most, address barriers to existing low carbon technology diffusion and encourage International cooperation for the development and deployment of breakthrough technologies at worldwide scale. Reinforce existing mechanisms, such as the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), Technology Mechanism, under the current framework, and facilitate their inter-operability. Support the healthy growth of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in the Paris agreement. The Fund can become a valuable source of finance for developing countries to achieve their mitigation and adaptation goals. Working alongside market mechanisms, and with accredited entities from both public and private sectors, the GCF can multiply the effectiveness of private sector capital in financing low-carbon solutions. It can ""de-risk"" investments in developing countries and accelerate low carbon development. Include finance from both public and private sectors in the agreement. Finance development is key to achieving the transition to a low carbon economy. Innovative financial tools need to be designed to take into consideration climate risks and climate actions when rating investments. Indeed, it is necessary to find finance models which better assess the value of the future. About ENGIE ENGIE develops its businesses (power, natural gas, energy services) around a model based on responsible growth to take on the major challenges of energy's transition to a low-carbon economy: access to sustainable energy, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, security of supply and the rational use of resources.

Amid the light-hearted fanfare generated by environmental activists in HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/paris-climate-talks the French capital Fiona Wild, a representative of the mining group BHP Billiton at the talks, flew back to Australia on Thursday after becoming the focus of an aggressive campaign against individuals in Paris accused of trying to water down the final climate agreement. Ms Wild and several others had their faces plastered on more than 1,000 large  wanted posters, which were put up around luxury hotels in Paris. The targets were accused of being  climate criminals trying to  keep fossil fuels at the centre of human development .  Wanted flyers were also handed out around the Metro stations near the conference centre in northern Paris, where delegates from almost 200 countries are attempting to reach a binding accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A spokesperson for BHP Billiton said Ms Wild flew back to Australia before the end of the summit  following a very concerning campaign by French activists . . . which incorrectly claimed BHP Billiton [and Ms Wild] were climate-change deniers . One person close to Ms Wild said she had also been warned that more personal attacks against her were to come. The BHP Billiton spokesperson called the campaign  highly personalised and unfair . The crusade reflected the generally hostile attitude to HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/in-depth/climate-change climate sceptics in Paris  These people are so out of touch with science that they believe rising sea levels don\' t matter, because in their view, the extra water is just going to spill out over the sides of a flat Earth, said John Kerry, the US secretary of state, to laughter. Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director of Avaaz, the global pressure group that organised the  wanted posters, said:  Ministers should be listening to their people, not polluters, and [should] refuse meetings with lobbyists. Others on the  wanted list included Benjamin Sporton, head of the World Coal Association; Marc Morano, who runs the climate sceptic website ClimateDepot.com; Myron Ebell, director of the US think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute; Bjorn Lomborg, Danish author of The Skeptical Environmentalist ; and James Taylor, senior fellow at the Heartland Institute, another US libertarian think-tank. Some were more relaxed than others about being branded  criminals . Mr Morano, who premiered his new climate-sceptic documentary Climate Hustle, responded to a Financial Times request for comment by sending a photograph of himself posing by his  wanted sign with an expression of mock fear.  You have to wonder how strong their scientific case really is if activists resort to accusing anyone who disagrees of being a wanted criminal, he said.  I did not let any low-brow intimidation tactics impact my trip to COP21 . Others took it more seriously. Mr Ebell said it was a concern in a  free society that in a conference attended by thousands of environmental non-government organisations, activists would want to  exclude and silence a small group of  climate realists . Mr Sporton said the World Coal Association was  fully committed to playing a central role in reaching an effective and sustainable outcome in Paris , while Mr Taylor said it was  vile and  hateful and  libellous . Mr Lomborg denied  silly claims that he was funded by any fossil-fuel interests. He said he was being attacked for his research showing that the carbon-cutting promises made so far  which will form the heart of the Paris agreement  would cut global temperatures by only 0.05 degrees Celsius by 2100 and would cost $1tn a year. The stated aim of the Paris agreement is to lower greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce the expected rise in global temperature by the end of the century from roughly 4C to less than 2C (above pre-industrial levels). Greenpeace campaigners said they had launched a sting operation posing as representatives of energy companies and offering to pay two climate academics to write papers on the benefits of coal and carbon emissions. They said the offers had been accepted. The environmental group said this  exposed how fossil-fuel companies can secretly pay academics at leading American universities to write research . The two US scientists involved said they had nothing to be ashamed of, and stood by all their research. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK222","-Imperial College London - Innovation is the path to low-carbon enlightenment, predicts global energy guru","March 8, 2016 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","In a special lecture at Imperial, Kamel Ben Naceur from the International Energy Agency said that new technology is the key to living greener lives. He believes that there are four ways to give people around the world access to the energy they need to live their lives and grow stronger national economies, without suffering the worst effects of climate change. Speaking about the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook at a Grantham Institute and Energy Futures Lab special lecture, Ben Naceur said: 'Energy innovation has already yielded solutions, but needs support and guidance to deliver its promises'. He told the audience of energy experts and academics that it is not necessary to sacrifice economic growth in order to clean up the energy supply, reduce air pollution and cut the number of early deaths from poor environmental conditions. His recommendations for governments around the world were clear: 1. Generate new energy technologies for everyday use, and make it easier and more affordable for everyone to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Take five key actions (see side box) to peak, then reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030: led by improving energy efficiency in homes and businesses, and increasing the use of renewable energy. 3. Follow the political momentum set by the signing of the Paris Agreement with short-term activities that begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and plot the course for meeting longer-term goals in the future. 4. Support international efforts to make the energy sector more resilient to the effects of climate change, and reduce global inequality in people's access to energy. Even using only existing technologies, the IEA predicts that a so-called 'Bridge scenario' (see below and side bar) could see greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2020, whilst economic growth continues unharmed. By 2030, emissions would then drop to almost 5 Gigatonnes (Gt) below the 37 Gt that has been predicted if nations stick to the levels outlined by their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) pledges submitted for the Paris Agreement. LOOKING BACK This was the sixth year that an audience at Imperial had the chance to hear about the World Energy Outlook and put questions to the IEA about its analysis. Back in 2010, the UK was under the first year of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, and Prime Minister David Cameron had pledged to make his 'the greenest government ever'. IEA Chief Economist, Dr Fatih Birol presented for the first time what governments would need to do to limit average global warming to 2-degreeC above pre-industrial levels, and tackle the growing problem of unequal access to energy causing political tensions. The World Energy Outlook 2010 also put the spotlight on impacts for the oil markets; the critical role for China in the global energy landscape; the costs and benefits of increasing renewable energy, and the lack of access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. LOOKING AHEAD Following the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in 2015, the Paris Agreement has been signed and delivered thanks to the work of government negotiators and the UN body that governs international climate (UNFCCC), whose President, Christiana Figueres will be speaking at the Grantham Annual Lecture in April. According to Ben Naceur, the onus is now on governments of the world to act on the promises they made in their pledges to reduce emissions. In the UK, carbon emissions fell by 4.3 per cent in 2015, the largest drop since the miners' strike in 1984, thanks to a further reduction in the amount of coal burnt for energy. There is also a strong sense of urgency to roll out low-carbon energy-generating and energy-efficiency technologies in developing world countries like China and India. Professor Martin Siegert, Director of the Grantham Institute, said 'The World Energy Outlook sends a clear message to governments, businesses and the energy sector in the UK. I hope that Kamel Ben Naceur's advice will encourage these sectors to support academic research into improving energy efficiency and enabling renewable energy to outpace fossil fuels.'

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK224","Gerard Mestrallet and the Business Dialogue Community submit their Final Report to the Presidency of COP21","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","FinancialWire","On the occasion of COP21 Business Day in Paris Le Bourget, Laurent Fabius - French Minister of Foreign Affairs, in charge of COP21 Presidency - and Christiana Figueres - Executive Secretary of UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) - received the ""Business Dialogue Report"" from Gerard Mestrallet, chairman and CEO of ENGIE, who is in charge with Laurence Tubiana - Special Representative to the COP21 - to animate the Business Dialogue, an organization bringing together negotiators from around 30 countries and international CEOs from all sectors. This report which is summarized on 10 recommendations is proposing to adopt a universal binding international climate agreement aligned with the 2\'b0C target. To reach this goal, the Business Dialogue supports among other things a generalization of carbon pricing signals and the development of mature and breakthrough technologies (see below the 10 recommendations in total). The creation of the Business Dialogue was based on the conviction that, in the fight against climate change, the role of the Business Community is key. That creating a solid platform allowing the business sector and the public sector to share opinions on the issues at stake and solutions regarding climate change would allow both parties to have a better understanding of what the already existing solutions that need to be scaled-up are, and where the needs for innovation are. The aim of the Business Dialogue is also to share understanding between public and private leaders on the issues at stake in the negotiations challenges and on barriers to low carbon technologies solutions. Four sessions were programmed, with different partners each time : A first session organized in Paris on May 20th launched the Business Dialogue and allowed an initial discussion on the main issues and progress of climate negotiations and the role of the private sector. It was prepared with the Global Compact and the World Economic Forum. The second session, in New York on September 26th, focused on carbon pricing, sharing implementation experience and exchanging views on possible developments. The third session organized in Tokyo on October 6th focused on the role of technologies in the future agreement and the transition towards low-carbon societies. A fourth session will be held early next year in Morocco, which will organize the COP22. This initiative aims to create an open and flexible exchange ahead of the COP21 and continuing afterwards, with the aim of building a long-term institutional relationship between public and private sectors. The 10 recommendations of the Final Business Dialogue Report : Build bridges between jurisdictions,Give visibility and confidence to investors.Remove barriers preventing market-wide deployment of available emissions savings solutions,Pursue the development of supportive regulations and funding incentives for market-introduction of mature solutions and promising technologies,Encourage R&D. Adopt a Universal binding International climate agreement aligned with the 2\'b0C target as of 2020, to provide the long-term and predictable framework necessary to support scaling-up low carbon technologies and encourage low-carbon operations and investments, in particular in the countries that need it most. Translate INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) into national low carbon roadmaps and sectoral roadmaps to give business a clear sense of the expected outcome and of the pathway to design new business models. Include a provision in the Paris agreement encouraging the generalization of carbon pricing signals, the inclusion of related provisions in each country INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions), and further work on pricing mechanisms interconnections between willing countries. Determine key principles for carbon pricing design: carbon pricing mechanisms shall be precise, clear, transparent and deliver a price signal progressive and high enough to trigger low carbon operating and investment decisions. Agree to transparent monitoring, reporting and verification modalities which will eventually help: Enforce mechanisms dedicated to the deployment of mature solutions and the development of breakthrough technologies, and thus: Develop collaborative platforms between governments, companies including SMEs (Small and Medium Sized Enterprises) and third parties in order to: build capacity in the developing countries that need it most, address barriers to existing low carbon technology diffusion and encourage International cooperation for the development and deployment of breakthrough technologies at worldwide scale. Reinforce existing mechanisms, such as the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), Technology Mechanism, under the current framework, and facilitate their inter-operability. Support the healthy growth of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in the Paris agreement. The Fund can become a valuable source of finance for developing countries to achieve their mitigation and adaptation goals. Working alongside market mechanisms, and with accredited entities from both public and private sectors, the GCF can multiply the effectiveness of private sector capital in financing low-carbon solutions. It can ""de-risk"" investments in developing countries and accelerate low carbon development. Include finance from both public and private sectors in the agreement. Finance development is key to achieving the transition to a low carbon economy. Innovative financial tools need to be designed to take into consideration climate risks and climate actions when rating investments. Indeed, it is necessary to find finance models which better assess the value of the future. About ENGIE ENGIE develops its businesses (power, natural gas, energy services) around a model based on responsible growth to take on the major challenges of energy's transition to a low-carbon economy: access to sustainable energy, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, security of supply and the rational use of resources.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK225","Scheme management: The Cut - COP21: Three sectors pension funds should worry about <SubHead> <Text> With a binding climate agreement likely to be signed at the ....","December 8, 2015","Pensions Expert","With a binding climate agreement likely to be signed at the COP21 summit in Paris this month, UK pension funds need to be aware of which companies and sectors are managing their climate risks, and which are not. Using data collected by CDP, the global environmental disclosure system, combined with other publicly available sources, we can clearly see how three important sectors - extractives, automobiles and electric utilities - are responding. Extractives CDP analysis shows that the world's largest mining companies are failing to manage carbon and water risks effectively. For example, of the 11 largest miners, almost half have yet to report meaningful emissions reduction targets. This is a 'canary in the coal mine' that suggests monitoring and management of these risks is poor. They are also exposed to a trend towards carbon pricing. Our analysis shows that the leading mining companies have more than $10bn (GBP6.7bn), or 15 per cent, of earnings at risk if a carbon price of $50 per tonne is introduced ($50 being the price already used in internal accounts by extractive companies that report a number to CDP). Automobiles Don't expect Volkswagen to be the only car company facing financial penalties as emissions legislation gets tougher around the world. Many automobile companies are struggling to keep up with existing emissions regulations, let alone more stringent requirements. In our research, we highlight Hyundai, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automotive as poor performers on fleet emissions compared with tightening regulatory targets. With a potential shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles in the years to come, some companies such as Toyota and Nissan are better positioned than others. Electric utilities Recent research shows that the European electric utility market is poorly prepared for a low-carbon future. The EU hopes to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 (from 1990 levels), requiring more than 45 per cent of European electricity generation to come from renewables and a switch from coal back to gas. However, few of the major electric utilities in Europe are managing risks such as coal exposure. For example, the three German utilities, RWE, E.ON and EnBW, all have a high exposure to coal. What can pension funds do? Climate risks may not be at the top of most trustees' risk management lists, but the window in which to act is finite and shrinking. Trustees should ensure that climate risks are factored into their investment process, and need to engage with the companies in their portfolio that are managing these risks poorly.

Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), has told MPs that 200 staff will leave through a ""voluntary exit scheme"". At 1,600 staff, DECC is already one of Whitehall's smallest departments, and the redundancies have sparked accusations that the Government will struggle to develop effective green energy policy. In July, Ms Rudd cut renewable energy subsidies, which have led to job losses in the solar industry. A letter leaked last week revealed she has also warned cabinet colleagues that the UK will be nearly 25 per cent short of its clean energy target for 2020. The jobs cull also comes ahead of this month's United Nations climate change conference in Paris, which has been billed as one of the most important summits on tackling carbon emissions in history. The United Nations climate change conference is set to take place in Paris later this month Chancellor George Osborne has asked all but a handful of protected departments to make spending cuts of up to 40 per cent so he can meet his pledge to balance the country's books by the end of this parliament. DECC is the first department to spell out the job losses that will occur as a result. The wider cuts across Whitehall will be revealed in the CSR, announced alongside the Autumn Statement on 25 November. The department was also one of the first four to agree its CSR settlement with the Chancellor. The others were Local Government and Communities, the Ministry of Justice and the Treasury itself. Mr Lovegrove told the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee: ""Clearly, in today's environment we are very conscious of the need to make a contribution to general deficit reductions, so we will be scaling back the number of people in the department. We currently have 1,600 people in the department and we have a voluntary exit scheme going on at the moment, which is designed to remove about 200 heads from the department."" But a spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents civil servants, said: ""This is a textbook example of how the Tories cut first and ask questions later. Time and again these kind of arbitrary cuts have proved unworkable, and in this case shows just how little regard the Government has for properly tackling climate change.

""One can only hope two things - that there were officials in DECC prepared to advise against this doomed sham of an energy policy, and that they are not now disproportionately represented in the 200 civil servants forced to join the jobless thousands in the solar industry."" In a speech this week, Ms Rudd will say: ""I inherited a department where policy costs on bills had spiralled ... Subsidy should be temporary, not part of a permanent business model."" A DECC source insisted there was no ""direct link"" between the redundancies and the department's ability to undertake its energy work. ""Energy security is our number one priority,"" added the source. \"

In reaching a new global agreement in Paris, the world is taking the strong and coordinated action required to address the climate crisis before it is too late. Ontario looks forward to working with its federal, provincial and territorial partners to develop a plan for Canada to implement the new global agreement, including a strong national target for reducing greenhouse gas pollution and a credible pathway to achieve it that is supported by provinces, territories and the federal government. Premier Wynne took part in COP21 to promote Ontario's leadership in fighting climate change -- such as the closure of its coal-fired power plants -- and to advocate for the role of provinces, states and cities. While there, the Premier signed an MOU on Co-operation in the Area of Climate Changewith Manitoba and Quebec that lays out the intent of the three provinces to link their cap and trade programs under the Western Climate Initiative. She also announced that Ontario is investing $ 20 million from the Ontario Green Investment Fund to build more electric vehicle charging stations in Ontario. The Premier represented Ontario at the COP21 opening ceremonies as part of the Canadian Delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Premier Wynne also promoted Ontario's leadership at several events and speaking engagements during the conference, including: - Participating in a panel discussion about fighting climate change through the Under2MOU and the Compact of States and Regions - Delivering a speech at Canada Night to showcase Ontario's climate leadership and celebrate Canada's participation in COP21 - Speaking at a panel discussion with the Premiers of Quebec and Manitoba at the Lima-Paris Action Agenda Subnational Half Day - Hosting a meeting with the Canadian Youth Delegates to discuss additional ways Ontario can continue to fight climate change The Premier also had productive meetings about climate change action with former U.S. vice president Al Gore, the Governor of Washington and the Governor of Jalisco, Mexico. In addition, Minister Murray represented Ontario at several events, including: - Participating in Buildings Day to showcase the province's successes in fighting climate change and highlight opportunities for collaboration and climate action across various sectors of the economy - Delivering a keynote address at the One Million Climate Jobs Forum, which focused on the ways in which the fight against climate change will create new jobs - Meeting with other prominent climate leaders from around the world, including representatives from South Australia, Spain and Mexico, as well as Sir David King, the UK's Special Representative for Climate Change. Fighting climate change while supporting growth, efficiency and productivity is part of the government's plan to build Ontario up. The four-part plan includes investing in people's talents and skills, making the largest investment in public infrastructure in Ontario's history, creating a dynamic, innovative environment where business thrives, and building a secure retirement savings plan.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK237","-Delta Promotes Cross-Strait Cooperation on Sustainable Cities and Green Buildings to Reduce Carbon Emissions","December 14, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","Paris - As the end of the UN Conference on Climate Change nears, experts and scholars in the energy, architecture and meteorology fields from both sides of the Taiwan Strait attend the 'Delta21 Forum' event organized by Delta Electronics on December 10 at the Grand Palais. They discussed the enormous potential of green buildings in regards to energy conservation and lower carbon emissions from the policy support, energy-efficient technology and architectural design perspective. Over the past 10 years, Delta has worked with partners to construct 21 green buildings, accumulating valuable experience and defining the philosophy of 'Building Harmony with Nature'. The concrete achievements during the COP21 conference period included proposing solutions that will help traditional high energy consumption cities transform into sustainable cities. Delta also hopes to utilize COP21 's international influence to remind organizations around the world to focus upon the potential value of conserving energy via green buildings as we all work together to create a smart green life. During the forum, Mr. Bruce Cheng, Delta's founder and honorary chairman, shared his experience on cost-effective designs for natural ventilation and lighting that can effectively conserve energy, optimize comfort and realize the concept of 'Building Harmony with Nature'. He pointed out that a UN report indicates the potential to reduce the carbon emissions of buildings reaches up to 90%. Since 2005, Delta's factories, offices and donated buildings around the world adopt green building practices, with a current total of 21 green buildings. Delta has also sponsored the 'Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition' for ten consecutive years and has promoted the implementation of winning designs from this initiative. Delta hopes that these international contestants will accumulate knowledge and skills related to green buildings and become future urban planners and architects capable of ultimately benefiting a growing number of people with higher energy conservation and healthier living and working conditions. Mr. Ding-huan Shi, president of the China Renewable Energy Society (CRES), the organizing entity of the 'Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition', and the director of the China National Engineering Research Center for Human Settlements, Mr. Ji-shou Zhong, also participated at the forum. Ding-huan Shi emphasized that in the past ten years, the Delta Cup competition has gradually become a multifaceted platform to lead the development of China's green building and energy industries, implement winning designs, nurture innovative talent and spread the low-carbon concept. Delta utilized a first-prize winning proposal to construct the 'Delta Sunshine Elementary School at Yangjia Town' and the 'Delta Sunshine Junior High School in Longmen Township' in disaster areas affected by the earthquakes in Sichuan. 'The 24 Corridors Under the Riyue Mountain', a project recognized and supported by the Qinghai Government, also combines multiple award-winning proposals into a showcase construction project to house farmers. Mr. Zhong highlighted that industries, governments and academia across the Taiwan Strait must work closely in order to facilitate more progressive ideas that enhance innovation in green building technologies. The architect who designed the first net-zero energy campus in Taiwan, the 'Namasia Ming Chuan Elementary School', Mr. Ying Chao Guo, and the architect who designed the world's largest festive lantern, Delta's Ring of Celestial Bliss, Mr. Jih Pan, also shared their design expertise. Ying Chao Guo stated that, 'we are rebuilding not just the past, but the future.' In addition to serving an educational function, the reconstructed school also follows the 'Building Harmony with Nature' philosophy while respecting the indigenous culture. The structure serves multiple complementary functions. According to Jih Pan, architecture is an external factor at any time and place, which is why architects must take special care to maintain a harmonious relationship 'between nature and humans'. He hopes that, £rchitects will remain committed to the respect for nature and humanity so that buildings can contribute towards turning the dream of sustainability into a reality.' The goal of COP21 Paris is to facilitate participants from various nations in making carbon reduction commitments. However, the conflict between energy conservation and the generation of economic profits may be the largest obstacle in realizing this goal. Smart green buildings are an effective solution to such conflict. Professionals from the industrial, governmental and academic fields, including Professor Chung Laung Liu, academic at Academia Sinica, and Mr. Jia-ping Cheng, chief of the Central Weather Bureau's Research and Development Center, proposed energy conservation solutions for new buildings as well as green building renovation initiatives throughout this forum. While introducing Delta's experience in lowering the electricity intensity of its worldwide factories by 50% from 2010-2014, the chairman of Delta Electronics, Mr. Yancey Hai, provided the example of the renovation of its 16-year-old Taipei headquarters with smart green building solutions. The building received a diamond-level EEWH certification (existing buildings) from Taiwan. This building achieved energy savings of up to 58% through the use of Delta's HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) automation, power regeneration units for elevators, LED lighting, renewable energy solutions and energy management software. Not only has this green building set the record for the most significant carbon emissions reduction among Taiwanese office buildings, it has also brought significant reductions in electricity costs. Mr. Hai stressed the business potential of smart green buildings. As a global leading provider of power and thermal management solutions, Delta is dedicated to facilitating the creation of sustainable cities to counter the impact of buildings on the environment. As the week-long 'Solutions COP21 ' exhibition ends today, this forum is the conclusion of the company's 'Delta 21 Green Buildings Exhibition', that proposes the concept of 'Building Harmony with Nature'. Delta's exhibition utilized immersive projections and interactive designs to showcase the 21 green structures Delta has constructed over the past 10 years, including Delta's own operation facilities in Taiwan, Mainland China, India, and the US, as well as the 12 green buildings donated in Taiwan and Mainland China. The exhibition organizer stated that Delta has actively exercised its responsibility as a global corporate citizen, working with all organizations to promote energy conservation and lower carbon emissions. Delta has committed to contribute in the global effort to slow down global warming within 2-degreeC through solutions that are also economically valid.

Commenting in the European Parliament last week about the Paris climate change talks, Ukip MEP Dr Julia Reid trumpeted the use of fossil fuels which she said had been the provider of ""cheap and affordable electricity for many years"". Dr Reid, who is Ukip's science spokesman, also seemed to deny the existence of climate change which is believed by around 97 per cent of scientists. ""Whenever I hear the words 'historic agreement' my sceptical streak kicks in,"" she said. ""The aim is to keep warming below two degrees at a time when there has been no warming since 1997 when we know that a thousand years ago the Earth was warmer than it is today. ""Current records are all too brief even 250 years is insufficient time for a meaningful assessment of long-term climate patterns and so-called models are only as good as the data in the programming. ""The climate change industry has become a powerful vested interest. So what will this really mean in Swindon, Exeter and Penzance?"" The 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) in early December saw delegates from around the world descend on Paris to find a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The talks ended in an agreement to limit global warming to less than 2C compared to pre-industrial levels. Dr Reid continued: ""The main problem is the demonisation of coal which has been the provider of cheap, affordable electricity for many years. COP 21 delegates state a need for cheap, affordable electricity but this agreement will have the opposite effect. ""Already, millions in the UK live in fuel poverty having to choose between heating and eating. Approximately 20 per cent of the thousands of excess winter deaths per year are directly attributable to cold homes. COP 21 is bad for them, bad for the UK and bad for Europe."" \"

But amid the excitement as the historic Paris Agreement was put forward on Saturday afternoon, most will have missed the moment when the emotion - even for hardened diplomats - finally boiled over. Presiding over COP21 , it fell to the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius to present the draft commitment that would shortly be agreed to by all those assembled. He revealed that the agreement would include a legally-binding pledge to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C, as well as the goal of aiming for the ""acceptable"" threshold of 1.5C. It was all translated into clipped English by the UN's own highly professional staff, even as Mr Fabius's own voice started to falter as he thanked those who had worked towards the deal but were ""no longer here"" to witness the historic day. The unnamed translator's words failed her, however, as Mr Fabius concluded his speech with a quote from the late Nelson Mandela. He said - and she translated: ""Let me conclude. One of you mentioned the other day a famous quote by Nelson Mandela, most suited to the occasion: 'It always seems impossible until it's done.' ""I would like to add a few more words, by the same hero: 'None of us acting alone can achieve success.' ""Success is within reach of all our hands working together.

""The production and use of energy is responsible for more than half of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. That means energy is also more than half of the solution. We need sustainable energy to reduce global greenhouse emissions and avert the risks of runaway climate change,"" Mr. Ban said, stressing that clean energy is equally important for ending extreme poverty. ""Saving energy is a triple-win solution. It can save money, reduce emissions, and provide additional energy capacity,"" he added, noting that renewable energy technologies are becoming cheaper and more competitive, with many people accessing energy for the first time thanks to solar panels, wind turbines or small hydro power plant. ""But, to replicate this experience for billions more people, we will need finance,"" he declared. ""Let us build on these bold initiatives. A global energy transformation must reduce heat-trapping emissions. It also needs to ensure that we leave no one behind. Those things can only be achieved if we tackle the issues of energy access, energy efficiency, and renewable energy together as a trinity."" COP21 held a thematic day on energy today, with the Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4All), a multi-stakeholder partnership backed by the UN and World Bank, urging Governments, businesses and financial institutions to act much faster and go much further to meet the ambitious goals of ensuring sustainable energy for all while keeping the global temperature rise within 2 degrees Celsius. SE4All is acting as a catalyst for a huge global movement for revolutionary change in the world's energy systems, helping to build working alliances across the public sector, private sector and civil society and foster innovative policies, technologies and financing mechanisms. Any rise of more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2050 will have an ever more dangerous impact on planet Earth with devastating droughts, floods and storms, and rising seas swallowing up ever more low-lying land. The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative to expand renewable capacity by 2020 and achieve universal access was just one of several launched today. The Initiative is led by the African Union's NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa's Development) the African Group of Negotiators, the African Development Bank, the UN Environment Program (UNEP), and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). At least $ 5 billion in public and highly concessional finance between 2016 and 2020 from bilateral, multilateral and other sources, including the Green Climate Fund, will be needed to leverage a further $ 15 billion in other investments, for a total investment of at least $ 20 billion pre-2020. Other initiatives launched today included efforts to improve access to electricity and energy efficiency, and promote renewable energy. Hundreds of Governments, businesses and financial institutions pledged major action on energy efficiency, recognizing it as the basis of the energy transition. More than 100 banks and a group of investors, managing close to $ 4 trillion in assets, committed to a major increase in energy efficiency lending in their portfolios. Led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the UNEP Finance Initiative, this is a major undertaking toward the four-fold increase needed to realize the full energy efficiency potential for climate change.'

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK256","-Allianz- Five numbers to remember about COP 21","December 16, 2015 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","Karsten Loffler, managing director of Allianz Climate Solutions, just returned from some very exhausting and exciting days in Paris at the UN Climate Change Conference. Here, his assessment of the outcome. Allianz-Karsten Loffler, managing director of Allianz Climate Solutions. Karsten Loffler, managing director of Allianz Climate Solutions. December 12, 2015 is a date to remember. For the 1st time ever, 195 countries were finally able to approve a truly global climate agreement. In doing so, we have moved away from the entrenched and divided world under the Kyoto protocol, which applied to industrialized nations only. With the adoption of the Paris Agreement, all countries - developed and undeveloped - have agreed to do what they can to contribute to the common purpose. This is not only a equitable way to move forward, it underscores the principle of pursuing common but differentiated responsibilities. The goal of the landmark framework agreement is to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2-degreeC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue 'efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5-degreeC.' This reference to 1.5-degreeC demonstrates the negotiating power of vulnerable countries, who are already experiencing climate change impacts. Unfortunately, the individual country climate action plans submitted, or Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs), are still likely to increase the temperature by almost 3-degreeC. The 'Fossil of the Day' While Saudi Arabia won 4 fossil of the day awards for blocking negotiations, many countries eventually joined the 'high ambition coalition,' which was initiated by the European Union along with 79 developing and industrialized countries. Unlikely candidates such as the United States and Brazil finally joined in, proving that it is possible to bring widely varying national interests to a consensus. Better than expected Critics say it will be impossible to enforce the agreement and that 1.5-degreeC will be very difficult to achieve. Even so, the Paris Agreement puts the earth on a new trajectory. It calls nations to come back to the table every five years and encourages them to be more ambitious. The outcome of COP 21 sends a strong signal to businesses and investors that there is but one way forward. Allianz is already taking bold steps to integrate climate change into its core business. We have also joined the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition (PDC), a group of investors committed to aligning their portfolios with the low-carbon economy. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is ambitious and balanced. To be honest, I didn't dare hope for such a positive outcome. Not when the draft version of the agreement contained 916 brackets and 91 options, highlighting the differences between the different participants' viewpoints. The way forward is clear. I firmly believe that the time has come to anticipate unequivocal change and act accordingly by finding solutions that protect and care for our customers as we transition to a low carbon economy.

The Assembly called for a post-Cotonou agreement to adapt the ACP-EU partnership, 40 years after it was first set up, to emerging global challenges, such as the current flows of migrants and asylum seekers. It recognised the vital importance of fostering dialogue and greater mutual understanding between EU and ACP states, in a resolution by its economic development, finance and trade committee. Migration, human rights and humanitarian refugees In the light of the ongoing, unprecedented humanitarian crisis, which led to the displacement of 60 million people in 2014, the Assembly highlighted the need for a joint EU-ACP approach to migration. The EU should continue its efforts to sustain development and democratisation in the countries of origin, said MEPs and their ACP counterparts, who stressed that the migration crises in both the EU and Africa could only really be tackled with a long-term approach addressing the root causes. The permanent resettlement mechanism should meanwhile be consolidated, they said. COP21 and universal healthcare In a debate on COP 21 , MEPs and national parliamentarians from ACP countries showed optimism about the progress and outcome of the conference in Paris. They stressed the need for a legally binding and ambitious agreement and concrete steps to implement it. Funding is key to tackling the situation as no action to fight climate change could be taken without money, they said. Ms Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organisation, opened the debate on universal health cover, stressing the need for access to healthcare for everyone. ACP MPs and MEPs pointed to equality as the guiding principle for ensuring universal health coverage, together with high-quality health services and financial-risk protection so that the cost of health care does not cause financial hardship.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK260","Nissan and Enel to launch vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trial in UK","May 13, 2016 Friday","Progressive Media - Company News","Automaker Nissan and power company Enel plans to launch a major vehicle-to-grid (V2G) trial in the UK. The trial will work by installing and connecting 100 V2G units at locations agreed by private and fleet owners of the Nissan LEAF and e-NV200 electric van. By enabling Nissan electric vehicle owners to plug their vehicles into the V2G system, they will be able to sell stored energy from their vehicle battery back to the National Grid. This move comes following the signing of the Nissan-Enel V2G partnership agreement in Paris in December 2015 during the 21st UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP21 ) and the subsequent kick-off of the installation of 40 V2G units in Denmark in January this year. Nissan Europe chairman Paul Willcoxsaid: ""The landmark trial in the UK is a significant step forward in renewable energy management, helping shape the future of industries, cities and societies. ""Smart energy management is one of the biggest challenges any nation faces for the future which is why this trial is so critical in assessing the feasibility of using variable, more flexible energy sources. ""We see Nissan electric vehicles as being the mobile energy hubs of the future, pioneering a self-sustaining energy infrastructure that will help solve the capacity issues of the future."" ""This is the first time this has ever been done in the UK and by enabling customers to sell energy back to the grid, we're providing a financial incentive to choose the sustainable option."" This initiative is part of Enel and Nissan's commitment to support the entire electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. As there will be an increasing number of EVs on the roads across Europe in the future and therefore, it is essential that V2G technology is rolled out to ensure the grid can satisfy the demands made upon it for increased energy, the companies stated. Enel innovation and sustainability head Ernesto Ciorra said: ""We are thrilled about the launch of this project in the UK. ""The installation of our innovative two-way charging technology will encourage the integration of non-programmable renewable energy flows into the grid and will help the spread of electric mobility in the country, benefitting the energy sector and the environment, while also having a positive impact on electric owners' wallets. ""The fact that Nissan has chosen Enel's charging technology to trial in the UK is the perfect demonstration of just how much potential the Group's V2G electric vehicle charging system has to revolutionise not only transport but also the way electricity distribution works."" It is estimated that if all 18,000 Nissan electric vehicles in the UK are connected to the energy network, they will generate the equivalent output of a 180MW power plant. If that is scaled up in a future where all the vehicles on UK roads are electric, vehicle-to-grid technology could generate a virtual power plant of up to 370GW. This energy capacity would be enough to power the UK, Germany and France. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK262","-Cisco, official partner of 'Solutions COP21', pledges to work for a more connected and environmentally responsible life","December 4, 2015 Friday","ENP Newswire","Issy-les-Moulineaux, France- At the start of the 21st U.N. Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Cisco France announces its association with the Comite 21 and Club France Sustainable Development, to highlight innovative technological solutions to fight climate change and its effects on cities, businesses and people. The sole technology company to join the action program Solutions COP21 , Cisco will exhibit its Eco City solutions in the Grand Palais in Paris from December 4 to 10. Cisco believes that technology can improve our daily lives and transform the way people work, live, play and learn. For this transformation to be long lasting and impactful, Cisco has placed sustainable development issues at the heart of its business. Cisco addresses energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission priorities through innovation, in order to reduce waste and improve the energy efficiency of technology products-whose energy consumption represents up to 90 percent of the carbon footprint in their life cycle. From December 4 to 10, Cisco, the only information and communications technology (ICT) company to partner with Solutions COP21 , will interact with visitors at the exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris to share its innovations in urban mobility, energy-saving buildings, remote administrative services and telepresence. Introducing So Mobility: A new approach for a smarter city Mobility is a major issue of our collective daily lives. Local mobility is essential to city movements, with residents commuting to their place of work or to study, shop or spend their leisure time. It is therefore essential to provide concrete and sustainable solutions in urban planning, traffic management and the environment as the cities of tomorrow are developed. To help tackle the questions posed by urbanization on a global scale, Cisco launched the So Mobility initiative with partners, notably in the building, energy, transport and infrastructure industry, to demonstrate that a viable, holistic, cross-industry approach can address the needs of modern citizens. To make the concept of the smart city a reality, So Mobility will focus its efforts on improving road traffic, citywide parking and work to anticipate new modes of transport. The plan is to a make a lasting impact for how people get around their city by 2020. These will be demonstrated at the Grand Palais through a connected street and traffic management demonstration. Intelligent buildings for energy savings The need to address environmental concerns as well as regulatory and societal developments requires buildings to adapt and become 'intelligent.' Buildings can now install an intelligent IP network and converged electronics system to control the services, mechanical and electronic devices, heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and lighting systems of a building. Together they enhance energy efficiency by transforming the way they are constructed, operated and occupied. Cisco will offer the public an opportunity to discover how its energy management solutions, which are part of an intelligent connected building project, visualize and measure energy consumption and waste in each element connected to the network. The net result is the ability to arrive at a set of actions that will contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gases. The Cisco Remote Expert for Government Services solution: Reducing the need for travel while facilitating access to public services The Internet already allows citizens to perform certain administrative tasks online, but many still require people to travel, and sometimes for quite long distances. In order to bring public services closer to the people, the Cisco Remote Expert for Government Services solution allows local authorities to deploy administrative services in popular places, such as a library, a cultural center, a town hall or a shopping mall. Immersive Cisco TelePresence technology and an array of intuitive digital tools allow a wide range of services to be offered. The solution integrates the best of collaborative technologies (high-definition video, high-quality sound, touchscreen and remote document reading). Cisco believes that there is an opportunity to propose next-generation solutions to improve remote services, while further reducing the carbon footprint by removing the need to run some existing administrative centers. Cisco WebEx technology: For connected, greener meetings The use of remote collaboration tools, in addition to simplifying the lives of company employees and being more efficient, reduces the environmental impact of businesses. Cisco will showcase its connected meeting Cisco WebEx tool at Solutions COP21 , which allows organizations to host online presentations, offer e-learning experiences, and even provide remote technical assistance. To prove its significant impact in reducing carbon emissions, Cisco is offering organizations an opportunity to calculate online the environmental benefits that this solution offers. The full program is available here. Further information on Cisco's policy of environmental responsibility is available online in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK265","What COP 21 means for infra investors","December 3, 2015 Thursday","Infrastructure Investor","COP 21 , the historic climate change summit, is in full swing and regardless of how sceptical you are about the kind of agreement that will be reached by world leaders in Paris, one thing is certain: the march towards a low-carbon economy is now inexorable. That's not to say the kind of agreement that will be reached won't matter. It will, especially if we are to have a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees celsius above the pre-industrial average, after which the planet will not be a very hospitable place to live in, according to an overwhelming majority of scientists. We just mean that, regardless of the strength of the agreement, the tide of public and private opinion has shifted decisively in favour of a green economy. With infrastructure investors especially well positioned to capitalise on this enormous opportunity, here are three key factors they should watch out for. 1) Get with the programme That's not just good marketing timing, by the way. As our sister publication Low Carbon Energy Investor reported last week, a recent survey by sustainable asset manager Aquila Capital shows that LPs are wanting to increase their exposure to renewable energy. The latter, as is becoming the norm, regularly accounts for the majority of new energy infrastructure built every year. That means fund managers will find themselves increasingly bumping up against clean energy infrastructure. Savvier traditional infrastructure GPs, like Meridiam and Ardian, have already recognised this and have moved to offer fund products targeting low carbon infrastructure. Those that haven't would do well to consider a similar move. In the not too distant future, not being able to offer a low carbon infrastructure product might become a real liability. 2) Stranded assets Most traditional infrastructure investors probably think they are relatively immune from the stranded assets concerns that plague fossil fuel-focused energy investors. After all, if your business model isn't mostly predicated on extracting fossil fuels you might not be able to burn soon, you don't have much to worry about. Right? Well, not really. It doesn't take a huge leap of the imagination to see how traditional infrastructure assets might be affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Take toll roads. If you own a 99-year toll road concession, you might potentially have to deal with a scenario where electric vehicles (EVs), perhaps self-driving ones, are prevalent. How will that affect traffic and toll revenue on your asset? What about capex, perhaps to upgrade your lanes so they are able to charge said EVs, as is being tested in the UK right now? Another example: maybe you own transmission infrastructure, built for an era of centralised electricity distribution and ripe to be disrupted by an abrupt drop in battery costs, which would dramatically accelerate distributed energy adoption. Or perhaps you have a nice portfolio of natural gas pipelines, but the regulator has now decided they leak too much methane and is forcing you to spend millions of dollars to fix that. We could go on, but you get the picture. 3) Green shoots Lastly, are you making the most of the technological innovations brought about by attempts to mitigate climate change? In our just published Future of Infrastructure supplement, Alinda's Alex Black offers a compelling example of how the asset manager cut the lighting energy costs of car park business InterPark by 60 percent through the introduction of LED lighting. There are also plenty of opportunities in, say, pairing solar power with street lighting. In addition to boosting revenues, 'greening' existing infrastructure assets is likely to be an increasingly important component of managers' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies, which LPs are increasingly demanding. And while it's true ESG strategies go well beyond the environment, there's certainly a reason why that 'E' comes first. \"

The dark satire features an original score by 3D - also known as Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja - and Mercury prize winners Young Fathers. It stars Fiona O'Shaughnessy , the lead in TV thriller Utopia and Natasha O'Keeffe from the BBC's Peaky Blinders and Sherlock as an executive from oil giant ExxonMobil. Related: Everything you need to know about the Paris climate summit and UN talks The film, shot in black and white, features a woman at a drug-fuelled party overlooking the bright lights of the Eiffel tower, as she identifies oil executives, spin doctors and government advisers in dark corners using a facial recognition camera. ""La F\'eate est Finie (The Party is Over)"" was devised to coincide with the COP21 conference in Paris, also known as the Conference of the Parties. It will be premiered at Le Trianon theatre in Paris ahead of performances by Thom Yorke, Patti Smith and Flea for the Pathway to Paris concert. In a statement about the film, 3D and co-director Mark Donne said: ""As with any party, the skill is in knowing when to leave. For decades fossil fuel extracting trans-nationals and western governments have continued to dance and partake long after the bright lights of climate science evidence were switched on and the deafening music of denial had its plug pulled."" The film is rooted in Donne's experiences working as a journalist and researcher in Westminster where he said he was in close contact with corporate lobbyists. Donne, who directed and produced the film with Joe Morris, told the Guardian: ""I was always struck by just how close those relationships are - how commonplace and everyday they are - and the sheer level of situational lobbying that goes on which often isn't recorded in formal meetings with ministers and special advisers and the policy capture that's able to be achieved via those gateways and those methods. Quite often these things are in spaces of hospitality, as with our film."" The release of the film follows an unauthorised advertising campaign by activists on the opening weekend of the conference in which fake adverts satirising the corporate sponsors and politicians at COP21 appeared at bus stops across Paris. A recent survey of 10 COP21 sponsors revealed that most are failing to meet EU targets on emissions reductions and do not publish relevant data on their carbon footprint. Recalling how former UK prime minister Tony Blair's closest aide Angela Hunter left in 2001 to take a communications role at BP, he said: ""There are endless examples of that and I don't think the public understand the extent of it. We're certainly not saying there shouldn't be constructive engagement with these important transnationals - those conversations have to go on - but when we're talking about the level of emergency that we're in with climate change, we need to look at the level of influence these people have."" \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK268","US borrower tipped to go big in January with green bond","December 17, 2015","Global Capital Euroweek","""There will be big news from the US,"" said Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds Initiative. ""We're expecting a significant scale issuance from a sub-national. It will startle the USA."" The ""sub-national"" is likely to be a US state or state-owned utility or transport company,GlobalCapital understands. Kidney expects another major step up in green bond issuance next year, following the COP 21 Paris Agreement over the weekend, which he says will further strengthen the importance of green funding around the globe. ""Sentiment is a driving force in any market,"" he said. ""This will make a difference in terms of investment decisions. We now have the beginning of industrial transition planning which is impacting countries' investment plans."" The main terms of the Paris agreement are to limit global warming to a rise of 1.5\'b0C and to cement the global consensus on moving to a low carbon future. Kidney explained that green infrastructure investment would be a key focus for 2016, which will increase the need for green project financing. ""There will be big growth in funding from sub-nationals and the likes of utilities and transport companies,"" he said. Green bond issuance has totalled $41.47bn equivalent so far in 2015, falling well below the CBI's initial target for the year of $100bn. This is largely due to the fact that the number of repeat green bond issuers was lower than expected, according to Kidney. But with greater issuance expected from China and India and a tangible global commitment to limit climate change, next year's volumes are expected to surpass 2015. New international issuance is also expected to come from Inter-American Development Bank and Corporaci\'c3\'b3n Andina de Fomento, as well as emerging market issuers, Kidney added. Kommuninvest has also had an inaugural green bond in the works for some time, which it originally planned to sell in the fourth quarter of 2015. The bond is now expected in early 2016. The issuer has Skr5.5bn ($646.8m) of committed funding for 12 projects that would be eligible for green bond financing. \"

The US president spoke out amid concerns that security fears in Paris coupled with an understandable deflection of French attention away from the imminent two-week summit might undermine chances for a historic agreement to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. ""I think it's absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business,"" Obama said. He added that world leaders had to show the murderous adversaries who killed at least 130 people ""that we're not afraid"". And the first chance to do that is next Monday, when the Paris climate change talks, known as COP21 , start. The Paris attacks have cast a deep shadow over COP21 - demonstrations have been banned and security has been stepped up - though none of the 130-plus heads of state and government due to attend has yet pulled out. France has made a huge play of preparing for the summit, which is supposed to achieve a new global deal to curb emissions from 2020 and prevent the planet from catastrophic overheating. But in the wake of the 13 November attacks, there have been concerns that the French political leadership, and president Fran\'e7ois Hollande in particular, might have other things on their mind. Privately, French officials insist they are determined not to let their agenda be set by terrorists. And some observers are hoping that the threat might galvanisethe talks to greater solidarity and urgency. Lord Stern, author of the landmark 2006 study finding that climate change could be dealt with more cheaply if action is taken swiftly, said: ""World leaders are more likely to come, and I don't think there will be any grandstanding [as seen at previous meetings]. It should be much more collaborative."" Leaders will only be present for the start of the talks, not for the hard negotiations. But they will set the tone, and have the power to instruct their ministers and officials to come to an agreement, which has proved elusive in the past. ""Negotiators will feel that they have to get it done,"" said Stern. ""It's remarkable how people have been coming together, sharing a recognition of this problem. Paris could be a turning point [in negotiations over global warming]. This is about our common humanity."" Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute thinktank in the US, said: ""We're struck by the resolve [to get a deal]. And one can intuitively see why. There is a degree of solidarity internationally over this issue, that is not exactly unprecedented, but since 9/11, we probably haven't seen anything quite like that. If anything, it stiffens the spine in terms of determination to really solve what is the greatest collective action problem in history."" Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth in the UK, hoped that countries would be more willing to come to a deal, but that he feared this pressure might lead to a weaker accord. ""They will want to give Hollande a deal at the end of the day. But the deal may not be as good as it might have been. Countries turning up in Paris will be reluctant for Paris to be seen as a failure, but we have a deal on the table that is not enough - we would have liked to see a stronger deal, and maybe we are less likely to get that now."" Nick Mabey, chief executive at the environmental lobby group E3G, said the terrorist attacks would ""not have a huge impact on the outcome, but they will have a huge impact on the tone"". Previous rounds of negotiations from the Copenhagen conference in 2009 - when the talks dissolved into chaos and public recrimination - have been marked by emotional outpourings, threats and public displays unusual in other forms of diplomacy. This year, such shows would be less welcome, said Nick Mabey, chief executive at the environmental lobby group E3G. ""The tone will be more serious, and less festive. Activists will have to find more creative ways to show the world the impact of climate change. There will be less grandstanding, and more focus."" He said the attacks on France would give Hollande more ""moral authority"", and that delegates would feel a greater duty to show ""the ability of people to cooperate and bring peace and work together. That is the core message, and it's really important that this message gets through."" The Paris meeting is the result of five years of hard negotiations, aimed at healing the profound differences between developed and developing countries in addressing the threat of global warming. Without a Paris agreement, global warming is set to reach as much as 5C (41F) above pre-industrial levels. Scientists estimate that warming above 2C (35.6F) will result in catastrophic and irreversible changes to the weather, including droughts, floods, heatwaves, fiercer storms and sea level rises. The difference between today's average global temperature and the last ice age is about 5C, showing what a great effect such a temperature rise could have. If pledges currently on the table for a potential Paris agreement are followed, then warming is likely to be limited to 2.7C or 3C by the end of this century - still not enough to meet scientific advice, but with mechanisms such as a five-yearly review, advocated as part of a Paris pact, the difference could be made up. \"

On the occasion of the 'What Makes a Sustainable City?' event held today during the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru, the World Bank Group and UN-Habitat commit to their shared vision of sustainable urban development, and call upon national governments, local authorities, and stakeholders to be involved in the move to a New Urban Agenda that prioritizes ending poverty, sharing prosperity, and propelling environmental sustainability. The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents a new opportunity to end poverty and ensure prosperity for all. Critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), cities are engines of growth and job creation. Good urbanization is not a passive outcome of growth. It is a driver of growth. Cities are responsible for 80 percent of global GDP. When they are well-planned, well-governed, and well-financed, cities drive national economic growth. Yet, benefits of urbanization are not guaranteed. Without appropriate legislation, good planning and implementation, and adequate financing, cities can fail their populations. The challenge is that most of the new urbanization is spontaneous and unplanned. Instead of positive outcomes, it often yields congestion, sprawl, segregation, and pollution. Cities are vulnerable to climate change and disasters because of their concentration of assets, people, and fragile ecosystems. Many of the world's largest cities are either coastal, in a delta, or on a riverbank. Urban areas are at risk of flooding from powerful storms and sea-level rise. Globally, 80 percent of the largest cities are vulnerable to severe earthquakes and 60 percent are at risk from tsunamis and storm surges. Cities are already responsible for two-thirds of the world's energy consumption and 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Cities are beginning to take action, and they have a unique opportunity in helping the world achieve the 2 degrees target. Good and sustainable urbanization, that promotes well-designed compactness and connectivity, is good for climate change mitigation and adaptation. 'The speed and scale of urbanization brings challenges, including meeting accelerated demand for affordable housing, well-connected transport systems, and basic services, as well as jobs. This is particularly the case for the nearly one billion urban poor who live in informal settlements in cities around the world,' explained Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, Senior Director of the World Bank's Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice. 'In the run-up to the COP21 Climate Summit in Paris, with developing countries experiencing unprecedented population growth in their cities, low-carbon and resilient urban development offers an opportunity for climate change action,' Ijjasz-Vasquez emphasized. Sustainable development deeply depends on sustainable urban development. The SDGs recognize the power of urbanization to accelerate prosperity and well-being. And they give cities a clear role in this transformation. 'In this unparalleled opportunity, the two institutions will join forces to work towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 11 to 'make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable',' according to Joan Clos, Executive Director of UN-Habitat. Clos, who serves as the Secretary-General of the Habitat III Conference, added that 'The United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development - Habitat III in Quito, October 2016 - will be a unique forum for asking national governments to commit to adequate rules and regulations, which govern people living close together and sharing common services; to better spatial planning and design, which optimize well-designed density, connectivity, and diversity; and to a financial plan, which sustains the functioning of the city and ensures economic prosperity.' Heading towards the Paris COP21 Climate Summit and on to Habitat III in Quito, it is time to rethink urbanization and promote national urban policies. Effective public-private partnerships are critical to unleashing the transformational role of sustainable urbanization. The World Bank Group and UN-Habitat encourage national governments, local authorities, and stakeholders to join forces in the move to a new urban agenda that focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK273","China s new normal, COP21 deal to dent coal demand - IEA","December 18, 2015 Friday","ICIS Chemical News","LONDON (ICIS)--The restructuring in China's economy and a push for renewable energies on the back of the Paris climate agreement will bring demand for coal down after 2020 following relentless growth registered in the past decade, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday. Coal will lose its appeal among the major developing economies on the back of environmental concerns as the material is a great emitter of CO2 emissions, which countries agreed to reduce in order to contain global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. The IEA's Medium-Term Coal Market Report-2015 cut its five-year estimate of global coal demand growth by more than 500m tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce). The agency said global coal markets were facing ""tremendous pressures"" mainly on the back of lower demand from China. ""The revision comes as official preliminary data indicate that a decline in Chinese coal demand occurred in 2014 and is set to accelerate in 2015. A decline in coal consumption in China for two consecutive years would be the first since 1982,"" said the Agency. The IEA said without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies the use of coal would make it difficult to achieve that target and called for the investment to develop the technology. ""Governments and industry must increase their focus on this technology if they are serious about long-term climate goals. CCS is not just a coal technology. It is not a technology just for power generation. It is an emissions reduction technology that will need to be widely deployed to achieve our low-carbon future,"" said Fatih Birol, IEA's executive director. The Agency's petrochemical analyst Fabian Kesicki also [1]said on 15 November use of coal at current levels without applying CCS technologies would make it challenging to achieve CO2 emissions reductions. ""Greater policy support for renewable energy and energy efficiency - the foundation of the COP21 [twenty-first conference of the parties on climate talks] agreement in Paris - is also expected to dent coal demand."" As the pollution in many Chinese towns surpasses the levels the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers acceptable for human health, the country's government sees the reduction in emissions as crucial on the back of public opinion's pressure. As a result, other sources of energy will be given priority in coming decades in China, said the IEA, as the country's economic system turns from a manufacturing-based model to a services one. ""New Chinese hydro, nuclear, wind and solar are also significantly curtailing coal power generation, driven not only by energy security and climate concerns but also by efforts to reduce local pollution,"" said the IEA. The second largest country in the world, India, will register an increase in coal use as the government encourages universal energy access and an expansion of the manufacturing industry, which will increase electricity growth. ""In addition to India's ambitious renewable targets (175 GW [gigawatts] of renewables by 2022, of which 100 GW are solar PV [photovoltaics]), coal will provide a significant share of the additional power requirements - as much as 60% through 2020. Indeed, preliminary data show India overtaking China as the world's largest coal importer this year,"" said the IEA. South east Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Philippines are among other countries which will use coal as a primary source of energy, but the IEA said about them: ""Unfortunately, around half of the new coal-fired generation capacity under development in the region still uses inefficient subcritical technologies.""

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK275","COP21: US adds weight to group pushing for strong climate deal","FT.com"," ","The US has unexpectedly joined a large group of countries trying to isolate China and India in the tense home stretch of UN talks in Paris on a new global climate agreement. The group, which has dubbed itself the  high ambition coalition , claims to include about half the 195 nations involved in the two-week Paris meeting known as HYPERLINK COP21 , which is due to end on Friday.  This is our moment and we need to make it count, said Todd Stern, the US climate envoy, as he joined ministers from the EU, Latin America, Africa and Pacific islands at a news conference on Wednesday evening to demand that the new accord contain measures that China, India, Saudi Arabia and other nations are trying to resist. That includes an acknowledgment that global temperatures should not rise more than 1.5C from pre-industrial times and provisions to ensure this goal is met by requiring countries to update their emissions reduction pledges every five years, starting as soon as possible. The pledges that more than 180 countries have tabled for the Paris accord would see warming rise above 2C, a threshold that governments agreed should not be breached at UN climate talks five years ago.  There are some countries here who are not in the coalition and, indeed, would seek a more minimal outcome, said Mr Stern, declining to single out countries by name. But the nations identified themselves later in the night when delegates met to consider the latest version of the draft accord produced during the day, a 29-page document riddled with competing options on a slew of contentious issues.  I understand fully the demand for mentioning 1.5C, said Prakash Javadekar, India\' s environment minister.  However, a 1.5C goal would require developed countries to massively reduce their emissions and massively scale up their financial support to developing countries. This is not happening. Some delegates pushing for a stronger agreement are privately voicing concerns that the 1.5C goal might end up being traded off in exchange for India and China supporting five-yearly pledging updates. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, had tried to ease concerns about financial aid earlier in the day with a vow that by 2020, Washington would have doubled the $430m it delivered in 2014 to help poor countries adapt to climate change. But Mr Javadekar warned that a lasting climate accord  cannot be crafted by diluting historical responsibilities or by putting the polluters and the victims at the same level . This is a reference to another contentious issue in the talks: a demand by the US and others that the new accord require developing countries to gradually take on emissions reporting obligations that only wealthy countries are subject to at present. Malaysia\' s delegate, Gurdial Singh Nijar, representing a group of countries including China and Saudi Arabia, complained that the concept of  differentiation between rich and poor countries had been  disembowelled in the latest text. Despite the occasionally terse language, last night\' s meeting was unusually orderly and polite for UN climate events which regularly descend into angry exchanges as they near a close. The calm tone of the Paris meeting, which started just two weeks after the French capital was struck by terrorist attacks that killed 130 people, has been particularly notable for a meeting aimed at forging a historic new climate accord. That has given rise to hopes that it might set a record for such events by ending on the appointed day on Friday. But with so many issues yet to be decided, it still seems more likely that delegates will be negotiating well into Friday night.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK279","-ACCIONA urges the treasury ministers of the G20 to make a commitment against climate change in the COP21","November 4, 2015 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","ACCIONA has signed a letter from the Corporate Leaders Group and nine other international business organizations asking the Treasury Ministers of the G20 to promote a legal, fiscal and financial framework to favor a low-carbon economy. To achieve this, the business leaders highlighted the importance of making progress towards setting a strong price for CO2 and the removal of 'perverse subsidies such as those for fossil fuels'. The Corporate Leaders Group has stressed to the Treasury Ministers of the G20 that the agreement reached in the COP21 needs to set long-term objectives to reduce global emissions aimed at achieving zero emissions (net) by the end of this century, setting up measures to review national commitments to reduce emissions every five years and creating clear control mechanisms to make the countries' commitments comparable and reliable. As ACCIONA President Jose Manuel Entrecanales points out, 'the companies have spoken out clearly. We have the vision, the commitment and the technologies - such as renewable energy - to mark the beginning of a new era of low-carbon prosperity. Achieving a strong treaty on the climate in Paris will allow us to work, together with the governments, to put an end to global warming'. The Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, driven by Charles, Prince of Wales, brings together 23 multinational companies - among them ACCIONA, Coca-Cola, Philips or Tesco - that are convinced of the urgent need to apply new policies with a long-term vision to combat climate change. In addition to the Corporate Leaders Group, the letter is supported by nine international business associations (We Mean Business partners BSR, Ceres, CDP, The B Team, The Climate Group, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Japan Climate Leaders Partnership, and the Brazilian Business Organizations ECP and CEBDS). In the letter, the business leaders draw attention to the major advances made by the business community in investing in technologies and business models with lower CO2 emissions, highlighting, as a paradigmatic example, that investment in clean energies worldwide reached 27 billion dollars last year. However, they point out that in order to maintain this growth and the new jobs and investments it brings, 'effective national policies aimed at a strong low-carbon economy are needed to ensure adaptation to the impacts of climate change'. The signatories also underline the importance of creating a suitable fiscal framework to bring about the transition to a low-carbon economy. To do this, clear commitments and timescales are needed to achieve a strong price for carbon and the elimination of perverse subsidies such as those for fossil fuels, plus an orientation of national finance policies to support climate change objectives. The business leaders have also asked the Treasury Ministers to guarantee public finance to combat climate change, thereby reducing the risk of investing in the industries and infrastructures of the future. This institutional support, according to the signatories, will attract private capital flows. In this sense, Corporate Leaders Group President and former President of Alstom Power Philippe Joubert points out that 'strong leadership by the Treasury Ministers is vital in order to implement effective national policies to help a low-carbon economy prosper'. Through this letter, the private sector has addressed the Treasury Ministers given their key role in driving a solid agreement in the Paris Climate Summit ( COP21 ) and their capacity to implement - in their respective countries - measures aimed at achieving the objectives on the climate by making a commitment to reduce polluting emissions. This letter joins another sent last Monday to the Environment Ministers of the EU requesting reforms to the Carbon Emissions Trading Market to encourage companies to invest in less contaminating technologies.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK280","Business as usual for China now COP21 is over?","FT.com"," ","Sir, Calvin Quek (Letters, December 11) claims that levels of PM2.5 in China are 15 per cent lower this November than last year and that this can be attributed to government action on air pollution. Clearly, levels of small particulates are subject to weather conditions, which I suspect is a more likely explanation for the short-term fluctuation that he has documented. In any event, 17 per cent of deaths in China are now attributable to air pollution, which makes it the biggest cause of mortality apart from smoking. If one considers Beijing, levels of PM2.5 peak in the early morning, an anomalous observation explained by the fact that this is when diesel-powered lorries make deliveries to the city centre. Although these lorries carry certificates that they are compliant with government regulations, most of them carry no pollution control devices of any sort, so NOx and particulates are vented straight into the night sky. Traffic police are not allowed to ban such vehicles if they are making  essential deliveries , which all claim to do. The factories that supply these untrapped vehicles claim that they are only for export to Africa. Government legislation that allows both drivers and manufacturers to be prosecuted have been on the statute books for more than a decade, but so far there has not been a single prosecution. So I am perplexed as to how Mr Quek concludes that air quality in China is improving as a result of government action. My concern is that China\' s decision to close factories during a recent smog alert was a cosmetic exercise cynically timed to coincide with the Paris summit on climate change. Now that is behind them, I suspect that China will go straight back to  business as usual . I would love to be proven wrong.

The video, created by French environmental nonprofit No\'e9, carries a message for ""nations attending the COP21 summit"", the UN-led climate change conference which took place in Paris in December. While Koko's communication skills are amazing, the message she conveys in the video isn't entirely her own - she was reportedly given a 'script' to readfor the cameras, and the video has been edited to make her speech a little more fluid. However, her 'words' are fairly profound. She begins by saying: ""I am gorilla. I am flowers, animals. I am nature."" ""Man Koko love. Earth Koko love. But man stupid."" ""Koko sorry. Koko cry. Time hurry. Fix Earth! Help Earth! Hurry."" Read more Koko, the world's smartest gorilla, has adopted a kitten The Gorilla Foundation, which looks after Koko, explained the creation of the video: ""Koko was clear about the man message: Man is harming the Earth and its many animal and plant species and needs to 'hurry' and fix the problem."" Koko's detractor's claim she is incapable of actually understanding her signs, but some studies have suggests she could know what she's saying - by showing her pointing out certain objects, or creating new compound words out of signs she already knows. At any rate, Koko's species, the western lowland gorilla, are currently classified as 'critically endangered', due to the problems of poaching and habitat destruction they encounter in the wild. Delegates to COP21 finished the conference by creating the Paris Agreement, which commits the signatories to limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees and pursuing policies that create a pathway towards lower emissions and climate-friendly development - so there may be hope for Koko yet. \"

The 648 proposed new technical cooperation projects for the next two years demonstrate the wide scope of the Agency's mandate, and the positive impact of its work on the lives of people around the world, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano told the Board in Vienna, Austria. ""Importantly for our work, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by world leaders in September, contain explicit recognition of the importance of science and technology for development,"" he said. ""The SDGs cover many areas in which the IAEA contributes a great deal,"" Mr. Amano continued. ""These include energy, food security and nutrition, human health, protection of the oceans and management of water resources, as well as climate change."" The SDGs are a set of universal development goals, targets and indicators that countries can use to frame their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years. They were adopted by the UN General Assembly in September. Mr. Amano said Member States may choose to reflect SDG targets in their development plans, which could be reflected in their IAEA country programme frameworks. The Director General also briefed the Board on the progress of plans to modernize the IAEA's nuclear applications laboratories in Seibersdorf, near Vienna. The Insect Pest Control Laboratory will be the first of two new laboratory buildings scheduled for construction under the Renovation of the Nuclear Applications Laboratories (ReNuAL) project. Modernization of the labs will improve the IAEA's ability to help countries use nuclear science and technology to achieve the SDGs, Mr. Amano said. Construction of the first laboratory is expected to begin next April. Mr. Amano told the Board that the construction of the second building, the Flexible Modular Laboratory, will begin once the required funding is available. So far, some 13.9 million euros has been provided or pledged by 20 Member States for the ReNuAL project, he confirmed, thanking them for their support. ""However, we still need an additional 6.7 million euros. I again call on all Member States in a position to do so to contribute generously."" Turning to nuclear energy, Mr. Amano noted that the IAEA will be participating in side events at the United Nations climate change conference , COP21 , that begins in Paris next week. The objective of the conference is to reach an agreement on combating global warming. ""Many countries expect nuclear power to play an important role in their energy mix in the coming decades,"" Mr. Amano said. ""It is one of the lowest emitters of carbon dioxide among energy sources, considering emissions through the entire life cycle."" On nuclear safety, Mr. Amano noted that his report on the Fukushima Daiichi accident and the final report on the implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety had been published in September. ""Work is underway to incorporate the output from these major undertakings into the Agency's regular nuclear safety activities,"" he said. In the area of nuclear verification, the IAEA is conducting preparatory activities related to the verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), agreed between Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union in July this year. This includes verification and monitoring of the steps Iran has begun taking towards the implementation of its commitments under the agreement, Mr. Amano underlined. He noted that the activities set out in the Road-map for the clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme for the period up to 15 October were completed on schedule and a wrap-up technical meeting took place on 24 November. ""Next week, I expect to provide my final assessment on all past and present outstanding issues, as set out in my report of November 2011, for action by the Board,"" Mr. Amano said. Meanwhile, an IAEA team of experts today said Russia's Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant has improved safety in recent years by, for example, using innovative techniques to reduce its impact on the environment. The team also proposed further improvements such as completing work to bring the plant's various quality arrangements into a single integrated management system. A press release issued by the Agency indicated that the Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) today concluded a 19-day mission to assess operational safety at Unit 5 of the Novovoronezh NPP in the Russian Federation, one of the plant's three operating reactors. OSART missions aim to improve operational safety by objectively assessing safety performance using the IAEA's Safety Standards and proposing recommendations for improvement where appropriate. \"

World leaders have gathered in the French capital for the start of crucial talks on climate change after half-a-million people marched in demonstrations worldwide calling for urgent action to curb rising temperatures. He said: ""Your deliberations over the next two weeks are not only for today but for generations unborn. ""I urge you to think of your grandchildren, as I do mine, and for those many millions without a voice."" Charles began his keynote speech in the French capital by expressing, in French, his profound horror at the terror attacks two weeks ago which killed 130 people and his untold sympathy for the grieving families and loved ones of those who died. ""My heart is with the courageous French people in their hour of anguish,"" he said in French. The Prince then told the summit: ""Rarely in human history have so many people around the world placed their trust in so few. Charles gave the key note speech to delegates at the "" COP 21 "" talks, before going on to receive the Prix Francois Rabelais from the Institut de France, for his commitment to organic farming and protection of the environment. He has also attended a private dinner hosted by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Peter Ricketts, with leading experts on the environment and development, including former US vice president Al Gore, World Bank president Dr Jim Yong Kim, and Lord Stern, who wrote a key report on the economics of climate change. Political leaders from 147 countries will address the conference throughout Monday and the summit will see negotiators from 195 countries try to finalise a new climate treaty over the next two weeks. Prince Charles said that before leaders gathered in Copenhagen in 2009 in an ultimately failed bid to secure a new climate treaty, he had tried to warn the best scientific evidence suggested humanity had 100 months to alter its behaviour ""before we risk the tipping point of catastrophic climate change"". Some 80 of those months had passed, he warned, urging the world ""we must act now"". ""If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago,"" he said, adding the delegates must start emergency procedures ""without further procrastination"". The conference, will, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aim to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C. Security has intensified in Paris with major roads into the capital closed and thousands of police and soldiers guarding the hermetically sealed conference venue near Le Bourget airport, north of Paris. Over 6,000 more officers have been deployed in the city, still reeling from the coordinated attacks on restaurants, a concert hall and the national football stadium in which 130 people died. On Sunday clashes broke out between some protesters and police in the city with reports around 100 people were arrested. While in Belfast hundreds gathered in Writer's Square as part of the worldwide demonstration. Among those taking part was Green Party leader Steven Agnew who said everyone had their role to play in tackling the global problem. He said: ""Our purpose is to send a message internationally that we want a deal in Paris but locally, Northern Ireland has to play its part too. This is an issue that has not gone away. ""It will impact on the people of Northern Ireland, albeit it will impact most on the world's poorest. But, we all need to take action to mitigate this global problem."" Meanwhile James Orr, Friends Of The Earth Northern Ireland director, told the crowd they stood in solidarity with environmental campaigners across the world. He said: ""This event that is happening in Paris is the most decisive event in the history of humanity. Unless we act in 2016 to reverse global warming, we are staring into the face of global genocide."" David Cameron is set to call for a robust deal that shows governments are serious about cutting carbon emissions. The Prime Minister is joining leaders including US president Barack Obama for the first day of the negotiations, with the aim to securing a global deal to stop ""dangerous"" climate change. Mr Cameron is expected to tell gathered leaders and negotiators that the issue of climate change is one that is too big for governments alone to deal with. And he will say that the conference must support the poorest countries, an issue he says the UK has led the way on by committing \£35.8billion in this Parliament, up to 2020. But the Government has come in for criticism from many quarters in recent months on the home front for curbing support for renewables and energy efficiency measures. Just days before the conference began, ministers also announced they were axing a \£31bn scheme to develop technology to capture and store technology from power stations, despite backing new gas plants. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK286","-DOE - Secretary Moniz Announces San Francisco as Site of Seventh Clean Energy Ministerial","December 10, 2015 Thursday","ENP Newswire","PARIS - U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that the United States will host the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco, California in June 2016. The announcement was made at an event in Paris during the COP21 UN Climate Negotiations. The annual meeting of energy ministers and other high-level delegates from the 23 CEM member countries and the European Commission, taking place on June 1-2, will provide an opportunity for the major economies to collaborate on solutions that advance clean energy globally and demonstrate tangible follow-up actions to COP21 . The announcement was followed by a discussion among other CEM ministers on the role of the CEM post COP21 as a key implementation forum to help countries deliver on their respective national clean energy goals and build capacity to increase ambition even further over time. That discussion included Ali Ibrahim Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Ibrahim Baylan, Sweden's Minister of Energy, Amber Rudd, United Kingdom's Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and Lars Christian Lilleholt, Denmark's Minister of Energy, Utilities and Climate. 'Holding CEM7 in San Francisco is an exciting opportunity for the United States to showcase one of America's prime technology innovation ecosystems that is providing real-world solutions to combat climate change and drive the clean energy revolution in the U.S. and around the world,' said Secretary Moniz. 'CEM is a key forum following COP-21 for energy ministers and other distinguished leaders to gather and implement the clean energy goals set forth in Paris.' The announcement that San Francisco will host CEM7 follows President Obama's video message at CEM6 in Mexico last May that the United States would host CEM in 2016. The combination of the city and state's role in advancing clean energy policies along with the concentration of clean technology companies, research and development, and the business community in the region were key deciding factors. San Francisco and the broader Bay Area, which encompasses Silicon Valley, is known as a global hub of the clean energy industry and is home to some of the most innovative technology companies that are playing a crucial role in advancing clean energy globally. California recently signed into law climate and clean energy legislation that sets aggressive targets for the share of the state's electricity from renewable sources and for energy efficiency savings in buildings. 'I can think of no better place than California to play host to the world's clean energy leaders,' said Governor Brown. The CEM was launched in 2010 with the goal of accelerating the global transition to clean energy. The United States hosted the first ministerial meeting in Washington, D.C. with subsequent meetings hosted by the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, India, Korea, and Mexico. The CEM pairs the annual meeting of energy ministers with year-round policy-targeted technical initiatives and high-visibility campaigns to deliver high-impact on-the-ground results and enable proven policies and technologies to realize broader, faster, and lower-cost diffusion and replication among CEM and non-CEM countries. In addition to Secretary Moniz, CEM7 is expected to include global energy leaders such as China's Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang, European Commissioner for Climate and Energy Miguel Arias Canete, and India's Minister of Power, Coal & New & Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal. Leaders from the business and investment community working in clean energy are also expected to participate as well as leaders from international energy organizations, foundations, research institutes, and academia.

At the same time, Parliament is continuing to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and make better use of energy, water and paper, in line with its environmental policy to first and foremost prevent or limit emissions. Commenting on the Bureau decision, Vice-President Ulrike Lunacek (Greens/EFA, AT), who is responsible for the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), said: ""With this step towards 100% carbon neutrality the European Parliament will play its part in limiting the impacts of climate change. Some weeks ahead of COP21 in Paris this is a great signal from inside the European Institutions showing that we are willing to live up to our goals. The EU will have to seriously raise its ambition if it is to play a positive role in making COP21 a success. In this way, Parliament is setting a good example in promoting best practice. But we will do more: in order to progress towards reaching our environmental targets Parliament will further improve the implementation of its environmental practices throughout the Parliament in key areas, such as water, paper and electricity consumption, waste recycling and awareness-raising."" Parliament's first carbon-offsetting scheme, in force since September 2011, only included emissions from official staff travel and official cars as well as from energy use and technical installations in Parliament's buildings. The new scheme encompasses all Parliaments' irreducible carbon emissions, including those from MEPs' flights between their countries of origin and Brussels and Strasbourg. The 100% offsetting goal is funded up to EUR 250,000. Offsetting applies only in cases where carbon emissions are unavoidable or cannot be further reduced. CO2 offsetting entails buying carbon offsets to compensate for the buyer's own CO2 emissions. Such offsets are typically achieved by providing financial support for renewable energy or efficient energy projects, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a global context. Next to the 100% offsetting goal, Parliament has also decided on eligible offsetting projects. Projects in the African, Caribbean and Pacific states should be considered first. If no projects are available in these countries, projects in countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership/Union for the Mediterranean (EuroMed/UfM) should be considered next, with projects in EU accession candidate countries or EU member states also being eligible. For offsetting projects in developing countries, the globally-recognized 'Gold Standard' of quality, originally developed by the WWF and other international NGOs as a best practice standard, should be used. All projects proposed should continue to be registered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (UNFCCC) to ensure their legitimacy. The European Parliament signed its first environmental policy pledge in 2004 and joined the voluntary EMAS scheme in 2007. One of its key EMAS aims is to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2020 compared to 2006. To date Parliament has already achieved a reduction of 27.2 %. In other EMAS key pledges Parliament has decreased its electricity consumption by 9.22% since 2012 and its gas and heating-oil consumption by 35.25%, while increasing its waste-recycling capacity to 68.9%. In a resolution adopted on the 14th of October ahead of the Paris climate change conference, Parliament called on the EU and its member states to propose a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and scale up climate finance commitments at the COP21 UN climate talks in Paris . A European Parliament delegation of 15 MEPs will attend the climate conference from 7 to 12 December. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK293","Parliament is first EU institution to become 100 % carbon neutral","November 13, 2015 Friday","FinancialWire","As of 2016, the European Parliament's irreducible carbon emissions can be fully offset, making it the first EU institution to become 100% carbon-neutral, Parliament's Bureau (President, Vice-Presidents and Quaestors), decided some weeks ahead of COP 21 in Paris. At the same time, Parliament is continuing to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and make better use of energy, water and paper, in line with its environmental policy to first and foremost prevent or limit emissions. Commenting on the Bureau decision, Vice-President Ulrike Lunacek (Greens/EFA, AT), who is responsible for the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), said: ""With this step towards 100% carbon neutrality the European Parliament will play its part in limiting the impacts of climate change. Some weeks ahead of COP21 in Paris this is a great signal from inside the European Institutions showing that we are willing to live up to our goals. The EU will have to seriously raise its ambition if it is to play a positive role in making COP21 a success. In this way, Parliament is setting a good example in promoting best practice. But we will do more: in order to progress towards reaching our environmental targets Parliament will further improve the implementation of its environmental practices throughout the Parliament in key areas, such as water, paper and electricity consumption, waste recycling and awareness-raising."" Parliament's first carbon-offsetting scheme, in force since September 2011, only included emissions from official staff travel and official cars as well as from energy use and technical installations in Parliament's buildings. The new scheme encompasses all Parliaments' irreducible carbon emissions, including those from MEPs' flights between their countries of origin and Brussels and Strasbourg. The 100% offsetting goal is funded up to EUR 250,000. Offsetting applies only in cases where carbon emissions are unavoidable or cannot be further reduced. CO2 offsetting entails buying carbon offsets to compensate for the buyer's own CO2 emissions. Such offsets are typically achieved by providing financial support for renewable energy or efficient energy projects, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a global context. Next to the 100% offsetting goal, Parliament has also decided on eligible offsetting projects. Projects in the African, Caribbean and Pacific states should be considered first. If no projects are available in these countries, projects in countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership/Union for the Mediterranean (EuroMed/UfM) should be considered next, with projects in EU accession candidate countries or EU member states also being eligible. For offsetting projects in developing countries, the globally-recognized 'Gold Standard' of quality, originally developed by the WWF and other international NGOs as a best practice standard, should be used. All projects proposed should continue to be registered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (UNFCCC) to ensure their legitimacy. The European Parliament signed its first environmental policy pledge in 2004 and joined the voluntary EMAS scheme in 2007. One of its key EMAS aims is to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2020 compared to 2006. To date Parliament has already achieved a reduction of 27.2 %. In other EMAS key pledges Parliament has decreased its electricity consumption by 9.22% since 2012 and its gas and heating-oil consumption by 35.25%, while increasing its waste-recycling capacity to 68.9%. In a resolution adopted on the 14th of October ahead of the Paris climate change conference, Parliament called on the EU and its member states to propose a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and scale up climate finance commitments at the COP21 UN climate talks in Paris . A European Parliament delegation of 15 MEPs will attend the climate conference from 7 to 12 December. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK299","COP21: Floods kill 188 in India","FT.com"," ","Heavy rains and severe flooding have hit Chennai, the capital of the southern Indian manufacturing state of Tamil Nadu, shutting the city\' s airport and forcing global companies such as Ford and Renault to halt production at local factories. The flooding comes at a moment of heightened sensitivity over catastrophic weather events as world leaders http://www.ft.com/paris-climate-talks?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true gather in Paris for talks to hash out an agreement limiting future global climate change. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who this week called on industrialised nations to do more to reverse global warming, has pointed to changing global weather patterns as a contributing factor behind the flooding. Local officials say floods have killed 188 people over recent weeks.  We are feeling climate change\' s fast growing impact now, Mr Modi said this week, in reference to the heavy rains lashing Chennai, formerly known as Madras. Chennai has a population of about 5m, making it India\' s fourth-largest city. Television images showed rescuers ferrying injured flood victims in boats, while panicked residents waded through streets engulfed in water. India\' s army and air force have been deployed to aid rescue efforts. US car group Ford said heavy rains had forced it to halt production at its assembly and engine plants in Chennai on Wednesday  for the safety of our employees . Other auto companies, including Daimler and BMW, asked employees not to report for work. Scientists say such weather disasters are made more intense and more frequent by global warming, although they are reluctant to link any one event directly to climate change. An agreement is needed to prevent countries from freeriding on the efforts of others, to facilitate co-operation on technology and to provide public goods such as climate financing for poor countries. Yet the multilateral system has failed repeatedly; success is not assured. It is normal for India\' s east coast around Chennai to suffer heavy monsoon rains at this time of year. In November, however, the region had its  highest rainfall in 100 years , according to Anurabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment & Water, a research group. The rains continued on Wednesday, forcing Chennai\' s airport to close, stranding hundreds of passengers as floods entered the building\' s main concourse and leaving aircraft marooned on its water-clogged runway.\~ Skymet, a private sector weather forecaster, said heavy rain would continue to fall over the area for the next 24 to 48 hours, worsening flooding. Chennai\' s flooding is only the latest weather related disaster in India. Scientists predict the north of the country will become significantly hotter over the next two generations, while India as a whole will become more prone to droughts, floods, crop failures and cyclones. Two years ago, some 6,000 Hindu pilgrims and residents were killed as flash floods swept down the main tributaries of the upper Ganges. Locals said that in the unusually warm weather, early monsoon storms that would normally have deposited snow in the mountains had sent rainwater cascading down the region\' s steep valleys.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK302","Want to do good at work? Here's where to find a job in the sustainability market; The historic COP21 agreement is poised to create a jump in sustainability hiri....","January 24, 2016 Sunday 9:00 PM GMT","The Guardian","The COP21 agreement was a historic milestone for climate change action, with a similarly historic price tag. According to the International Energy Agency, achieving its goals will cost an estimated $16.5tn by 2030. By comparison, when US President Barack Obama referenced ""the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history"" in his 2016 State of the Union address, he was referring to a comparatively tiny $90bn investment part of the 2009 Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But while America's prior efforts can't compare to the scale of COP21 , they do hint at its impact on the sustainability job market. From international policy and financial services to research and development, the pledge to cut local carbon emissions will affect a vast range of job sectors - and create a host of opportunities. 1. Policy Jobs at this level vary widely. In addition to senators and directors, cabinet secretaries and Obama himself, the US COP21 delegation included a host of lawyers, economists, scientists and public relations experts. But the most represented job title was foreign affairs officer, under the US Department of State's Bureau of Oceans, Environment and Science (OES). Aiming to promote US foreign policy goals in areas such as climate change, renewable energy and resource scarcity, OES officers work nationally and internationally to negotiate climate policy, form partnerships and develop programs. The job requires an academic background in public policy, economics, the environment or energy, as well as several years of work experience or a master's degree. As countries work together on COP21 's initiatives, international policy negotiation will become even more crucial. And, as the agreement's effects ripple around the world, negotiators, policy experts, economists, lawyers and others will be needed on the national level. For its part, Obama's $90bn clean energy program quickly created a host of administrative, bureaucratic and negotiating jobs. Within a year of its announcement, the Department of Energy hired 200 people just to process the grants that it disbursed. On the opposite end, states, municipalities, research labs, companies and universities scurried to hire skilled grant writers, administrators and lawyers to help them take advantage of the influx of money. 2. Renewables and construction The sustainability job surge is enhanced by the fact that many vital sectors are already on the upswing. For example, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 724,000 Americans were working in renewables in 2014 - a 16% increase over the previous year. Green construction is similarly energized: it grew by an estimated 15% between 2014 and 2015, with comparable growth predicted until 2018. According to the White House, the clean energy program directly created 60,800 new jobs and 72,400 support jobs within its first quarter. By the second quarter of 2010, the program had ""saved or created"" between 2.5-3.6m jobs. Green administrative support jobs aren't far behind. After the clean energy program passed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that professional and business services accounted for 36.2% of green jobs, including work in finance, market strategies, operations and business administration. 3. Research Several of COP21 The partnership estimates that - if taken to scale - its programs could provide $5-$10tn in business opportunities between today and 2030, directly creating between 5-10m jobs per year, and indirectly providing another 15-35m jobs. These jobs would range widely. On the research and development side, LCTPI's plan to develop new biofuels, insulation materials, low-carbon fuels and building materials would lead to work for researchers, administrators and grant writers at research labs and academic programs around the world. These R&D investments would create new innovations, investments, and startups - and, not incidentally, jobs for people with backgrounds in investor relations, finance, operations and market strategies. Another intiative, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition (BEC), also hopes to transform the green energy market by focusing on electricity generation and storage, transportation, industrial use, agriculture and energy system efficiency. Launched in November by 28 billionaires, including Bill Gates, it plans to circumvent the current research structure, which it says is too rigid. Instead, it will provide seed, angel and Series A investments, leading to a quick influx of investment into R&D followed by a quick move from lab to market. 4. Global development As part of COP21 , developed countries will provide the developing world an estimated $100bn per year to help them convert to greener energy and adapt to climate change. AECOM, a US-based global engineering design firm, is already positioning itself for this by calling for CVs from climate change experts with experience in adaptation and mitigation projects. Given AECOM's previous work with large scale infrastructure projects like the Southern Africa Trade Hub, the Delhi sewer system and the Adapt Asia-Pacific program, it's likely that these specialists will work in climate adaptation, resiliency planning and greenhouse gas mitigation projects for local governments and other public agencies. It's almost impossible to imagine the breadth of COP21 's potential economic and employment impact. But, while its scale is potentially world-transforming, its mechanism will likely be very familiar. Which means that bright days are likely on the way for people in policy and negotiation, startups and finance and R&D. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK303","COP21: New research points to falling carbon dioxide emissions","FT.com"," ","HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/paris-climate-talks Talks in Paris aimed at reaching a global climate accord entered a fraught new phase on Monday, even as research showed the carbon dioxide emissions that the agreement is supposed to cut have unexpectedly stalled. It was already known that emissions from burning fossil fuels barely grew last year. But preliminary estimates from an international group of scientists show they may have actually fallen by 0.6 per cent in 2015. That would be a dramatic turnround from the 2-3 per cent annual emissions growth recorded since 2000 and a rare occurrence in a year when the International Monetary Fund expects the global economy to grow by about 3 per cent. Global emissions normally only fall when economic crises slow the power plants and factories that pump out carbon pollution.  These figures are certainly not typical, said Professor Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9 of the UK\' s University of East Anglia, one of the authors of the analysis published on Monday in the Nature Climate Change journal. She said a stalling of emissions had not coincided with a year of more than 2-3 per cent economic growth since reliable records became available in the 1970s. The chief reason for the fall, the scientists said, is the slowdown in coal use in China. The country is the world\' s largest carbon polluter by far, responsible for 27 per cent of total world emissions in 2014. Emissions also fell in the US and the EU, the second and third largest carbon polluters, with a 15 per cent and 10 per cent share of emissions respectively. But the scientists warned that it is too early to say global emissions have definitely peaked because other big emerging economies are still planning to burn large amounts of coal. The decline in emissions from the EU in 2014, for example, matched the rise in pollution in India, the fourth-largest emitter, with just over 7 per cent of the global total.  I would be very surprised if global emissions have peaked, said Chris Field, a senior author of the latest report from the UN\' s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who was not involved with the latest research. But the data do show they can peak, he added. At the Paris conference  known as COP21  there was speculation that countries such as India, which has been accused of trying to weaken the accord due to be struck by Friday, could seize on the research to argue that a tougher agreement was not needed. But speaking to reporters, Prakash Javadekar, India\' s environment minister, described the new data as  good news .  We must start believing in human intentions, he said, adding that technological developments would help resolve the problem of global warming. India\' s position was under mounting scrutiny as ministers began flying in to Paris to finalise a draft text of the accord that the French officials running conference insist must be done by Friday. Many delegates have begun to speculate privately that opposition from India and a clutch of other developing countries may end up weakening the final accord substantially. Monday\' s new analysis chimes with data from other research bodies, such as the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which found emissions remained flat in 2014. But because carbon dioxide is such a long-lasting greenhouse gas and accumulates in the atmosphere, scientists say global emissions must quickly fall to zero if global temperatures are to stay below 2C of warming from pre-industrial times, a limit governments agreed at past UN climate talks. At present, about 36bn tonnes of carbon dioxide is being pumped out each year from fossil fuels and industry alone. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has now reached 400 parts per million, the highest level in at least 800,000 years. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000 and 2015 is on track to be the first year in which average global temperatures are approximately 1C above pre-industrial levels. The plans to combat climate change that more than 180 countries have tabled in the run-up to the Paris climate talks suggest emissions may not peak until the 2030s or later, said Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo.  India is the wild card, he said. \' We don\' t know where India will go but their [climate plan] bakes in a lot of coal consumption. Professor Robert Jackson of Stanford University said there had also been a surge in the growth of wind and solar power in 2014, and this was expected to increase further in 2015. Much of this renewables growth has come in China and India has plans to substantially increase its solar power. But the researchers warned that this cleaner power was also being accompanied by growing coal use in many countries and emissions would not fall until renewables replaced fossil fuels outright.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK305","COP21 Paris climate talks: India offers to cut coal use","FT.com"," ","India, one of the world\' s largest coal users, will cut back on its investments in the fuel if the new climate deal due to be struck next week in Paris delivers more money to help it shift to cleaner sources of energy such as solar power, a senior negotiator said on Wednesday.  We\' ve made it very clear that solar and wind is our first commitment, said Ajay Mathur, director general of India\' s Bureau of Energy Efficiency, at the Paris talks, HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/paris-climate-talks known as COP21 .  Hydro, nuclear, all of these non-carbon sources are what we will develop to the largest extent we can, he told reporters.  But it has to be affordable. He was speaking as campaigners from a fossil fuel divestment movement said the number of investors shunning coal, gas and oil has surged ahead of the Paris conference. At least 500 institutions with more than $3.4tn in assets have pledged to avoid or cut holdings in fossil fuels, said activist groups 350.org and Divest-Invest. That represents a big jump from a year ago, when 181 institutions representing about $50bn in assets were committed to such a step, they said. A spate of city councils, banks, pension funds, churches and universities have pledged to cut back or shun coal investments this year. One of the most striking commitments came last month when Allianz, the German insurance group, said it would pull more than \€ 4bn ($4.3bn) from companies with coal businesses. Earlier this year, the Norwegian parliament decided the country\' s $857bn sovereign wealth fund should withdraw from any company in which coal represents more than 30 per cent of the business. Both moves came in the wake of a divestment campaign that began on US college campuses more than two years ago in an effort to make fossil fuel holdings as unpopular as tobacco or investments in apartheid-era South Africa. Churches and wealthy individuals with an interest in climate change then joined, including the heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune.  The momentum in this divestment campaign is accelerating day by day, Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, told journalists at the Paris climate conference on Wednesday.  There is a moral imperative to save the planet and to do so we need to end the fossil fuel era now, he said. Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association said that although the campaigners\' multi-trillion dollar headline figures seemed large, a lot of the institutions and funds with these assets did not currently have coal holdings and the amount of money actually being pulled out of coal was relatively small.  While there are companies and funds saying they want to get out of coal, there are plenty of others that are remaining invested, he told the Financial Times. This was especially the case in South East Asia and in large countries such as India, where governments are planning to continue using coal for electricity. Mr Sporton said he hoped the Paris climate talks would help drive the use of  technology that allows coal to be burnt more efficiently and cleanly, a chief aim of his members. Coal companies have borne the brunt of the divestment push because coal produces more carbon emissions when burnt than other fossil fuels such as natural gas. But it remains an abundant and cheap source of energy in many developing countries and is the biggest source of electricity globally, accounting for a 41 per cent share of the world\' s electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. That global share is expected to fall to just over 30 per cent by 2030, the agency says, as fast-growing renewable energy sources supply a larger proportion of electricity. However, divestments have not been the only feature of this year\' s assault on coal. Banks have made public their refusal to fund some coal investments. In Australia, where India\' s Adani group wants to build the country\' s largest proposed coal project, Standard Chartered has said it will no longer be involved in the increasingly controversial development. Banks including Deutsche and HSBC had already steered clear. And multilateral commitments to the coal industry have been reined in. Last month member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development agreed limits on export subsidies for coal-fired power stations, following unilateral initiatives to curb export credits by countries including the UK and US. But divestment has its critics. Anne Stausboll, chief executive of Calpers, the California state pension system, has called lobbying for divestment  flawed and said it is more constructive to engage with companies where the fund invests. However California approved a divestment law in October. Calpers  will evaluate divestment as outlined in the bill , the fund said. As of June it had $57m invested in 27 thermal coal companies.

Japanese NGO Peace Boat came up with an innovative concept for a 1,900-passenger ship with 10 retractable sail masts and a hybrid propulsion system that could be adapted to future fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). The non-profit organisation, which works for world peace and the environment, claimed it would be the flagship for green technology in passenger shipping. Peace Boat is looking for a donor or investor. If funds can be found, the Eco Ship could enter service in 2020, by which time Carnival Corporation will have already built cruise ships powered by LNG. It has two 6,600-passenger giants on order from a shipyard in Finland, with the first due for completion in 2019. Norwegian coastal operator Hurtigruten also told COP21 it was hoping to develop expedition ships powered by battery technology and algae fuel. It has partnered with the Bellona Foundation, a Norwegian environmental NGO, with ambitions to provide zero-emission cruises. But are the plans just hot air? Leading UK cruise agent James Cole, managing director of Cruise118.com fears they may take longer to materialise. ""By 2020 there will undoubtedly be more eco technology and focus within cruising, but a fully eco ship is unrealistic,"" he said. Cole sees international passengers showing more interest in going green than UK customers. And is Captain Greybeard showing his cynical side in thinking that, for some companies, the use of solar panels and the introduction of developments such as fuel-saving bubble technology are as much about reducing costs as saving the planet? Hurtigruten has other bold plans too.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK310","Humanity in danger","December 3, 2015 Thursday","Leicester Mercury","Global warming could cause oxygen levels to drop drastically, resulting in the ""mass mortality"" of humans and animals, researchers have warned. A study led by Professor Sergei Petrovskii, of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Leicester, concluded an increase in the water temperature of the world's oceans of about 6C - which some scientists predict could occur as soon as 2100 - could stop oxygen production by phytoplankton, by disrupting photosynthesis. The threat from falling oxygen levels could be greater than that of melting ice caps and mass flooding, Prof Petrovskii said. He said: ""Global warming has been a focus of attention of science and politics for about two decades. ""A lot has been said about its expected disastrous consequences. Perhaps the most notorious is the global flooding that may result from melting of Antarctic ice if the warming exceeds a few degrees compared with the pre-industrial level. ""However, it now appears this is probably not the biggest danger to humanity."" About two-thirds of the planet's oxygen is produced by phytoplankton - microscopic organisms that inhabit the upper layer of almost all oceans and bodies of fresh water. ""Cessation would result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen on a global scale,"" said Prof Petrovskii. ""This would likely result in the mass mortality of animals and humans."" The team developed a new model of oxygen production in the ocean. While mainstream research often focuses on the CO2 cycle, as carbon dioxide is the agent mainly responsible for global warming, few researchers have explored the effects of global warming on oxygen production.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK312","-Statement from Peabody Energy on COP21","November 20, 2015 Friday","ENP Newswire","The United Nations will soon convene its annual Conference of the Parties, during which certain countries will commit to limits in greenhouse gas emissions. Because energy accounts for a substantial share of such human-induced emissions, the energy sector will be instrumental to success in implementing these commitments. Effective implementation will depend on sensible policy action. Fundamental to this is the acknowledgement of practical realities, one of which is the increasingly essential role played by coal in meeting the world's energy needs. Coal accounts for nearly 30% of the world's primary fuel consumption, and according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global coal demand is now approaching that of oil. Another such reality is that in the 21st century, electricity is fueling a wave of urbanization and economic growth, lifting billions to a better quality of life. However, the energy that makes longer, healthier lives possible remains surprisingly in short supply for too many. According to independent sources, today there are still 1,300,000,000 people who do not have access to electricity. The application of advanced technologies in the use of the world's coal resources presents a ready-today solution for UN negotiators and energy policymakers worldwide. Technology is the bridge to a low-emissions future for countries experiencing increasing electricity demand within their growing economies. It is also a bridge being built rapidly in scores of projects throughout India and China, in Japan and South Korea, across Southeast Asia, and on the African continent. The increased use of all forms of energy which drives economic development, and the betterment of life, can be reconciled with lower emissions through advanced energy technologies. In the case of coal, which fuels 40% of the world's electricity, the foundation of this bridge is the development of high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) technologies for electricity generation. Deployment of HELE technologies will play an increasingly significant role in meeting greenhouse gas commitments. To illustrate, moving the current average global efficiency rate of coal-fueled power to supercritical levels could deliver the equivalent environmental benefit of reducing India's CO2 emissions to zero. Policy measures are urgently needed to accelerate development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which according to the IEA must contribute 1/6 of total emissions reductions by 2050. One option is financial incentives for the design and construction of HELE projects which are CCS-ready. Another is support for academic research initiatives on the clean utilization of coal. Given their similar greenhouse gas profiles, power generation with CCS technology should be provided with policy preferences comparable to those afforded to electricity projects fueled by solar and wind. Finally, financing support for HELE projects using coal is an important instrument for policymakers to encourage advanced technologies for electricity production. Multilateral funding sources are also beneficial, and can assist countries where the cost of deploying advanced technologies is prohibitive. Additional incentives should be provided for private sector investments which result in further increases in power generation efficiency.

Malcolm Turnbull , prime minister, was set to support the Fossil-Fuel Subsidy Reform Communiqu\'e9, to be presented by John Key, New Zealand's prime minister, in Paris last night. But concerns that supporting it could threaten Australia's policy of making diesel-fuel rebates available to farmers and miners prompted Mr Turnbull to back away. The Australian Financial Review reported yesterday that each year the country pays out 38 cents per litre of diesel to farmers and miners, which costs the budget A$5.5bn (US$3.9bn). Supporters of the measure say the money is returned to users who drive vehicles that do not travel on public roads, for which tax is collected. Critics say that it is wasteful subsidy that boosts carbon emissions. The communiqu\'e9 warns that ""by keeping prices artificially low, fossil-fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, disadvantage renewable energy and depress investment in energy efficiency"". Other wealthy countries say that global warming cannot be addressed solely by the older industrialised countries that account for a dwindling share of global emissions, and that big emerging economies such as China and India must play their part. The communiqu\'e9 notes that leaders of the group of 20 countries have already committed themselves in September 2009 to phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies and urged countries to support accelerated action to phase them out. Australia's failure to sign up to the pact, which is aspirational rather than a binding legal commitment, underscores the difficulty world leaders face in supporting action to tackle climate change that threatens vested interests. Mr Turnbull is under pressure from the rightwing of his party and his rural-focused National party coalition partners not to alter an agreed stance. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK318","-University of Bath - Why struggling economies have a stake in COP21","December 7, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","With 190 states taking part in the Paris climate talks, there are clearly some for whom the outcome matters more than others. There are the small states, such as Kiribati and the Marshall Islands, for which a deal to reduce global emissions and curb climate change is a matter of survival. Then there are the big players, such as China, the US, Russia and the EU, upon which a deal will rely. But there are a number of states taking part for which economic crisis at home is their overriding concern. Within the EU bloc, in countries such as Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal the on-going economic turmoil is of enormous importance. These countries are all still suffering from the fallout of austerity measures imposed by the EU. Since the start of the eurozone crisis, the Greek economy has shrunk by 25%, the Spanish by 15%, while the Italian and Portuguese economies seem unable to recover and sustain positive growth levels. Meanwhile, domestic demand in these countries is not enough to accelerate economic growth. Similarly, investment is very thin on the ground, as their enfeebled institutions cannot guarantee that investors will get their money back. Green growth prospects An agreement on climate change could assist these countries with managing their economic problems and reinventing their economies as environmentally friendly ones. Massive investment in solar and wind energy for example could protect them from highly volatile coal, oil and gas prices. Technological advancements in these renewable energy sources now make this possible as new and improved materials have reduced the cost of investment and improved the performance of wind and solar energy. What is more, such investment would lead to new jobs and industries and enable some, especially Greece and Spain, to control their high unemployment rates. The sins of the past do not leave much room for optimism on this front, however. It seems that the institutions in these four countries, weakened by deregulation, corruption and judicial bias, lack the ability to implement a series of environmental measures needed to combat climate change effectively. Data on environmental violations in these countries support this view. Over the last year alone, Italy was fined a record EUR40m for failing to properly manage the dumping of illegal waste; Greece was charged EUR10m for lax waste management; Spain was dragged to the EU Court of Justice for the same reason; while Portugal has been accused of inadequate wastewater treatment. Not just the usual suspects But it's not just the economically weak countries who are struggling to enforce the necessary measures to combat climate change. The same might hold true for the European Commission and other EU member states, which are better placed to enforce climate change legislation than Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. Weak economic growth across the eurozone might force countries with fragile GDP rates, such as the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Finland to seek less ambitious targets too. Questions have also been asked about the commitment of the EU as a whole to tackling climate change. The European Commission's emphasis on growth under Jean-Claude Juncker's leadership and the merging of the climate change department with that of energy under a new vice-president for Energy Union indicate that climate change might not be a priority. If we combine the EU's economic problems with other equally important matters, such as the continuing refugee crisis and recent terrorist attacks, many EU member states will be preoccupied at this climate conference. The bloc's ability to promote a transition towards low-carbon economies might therefore be limited. This contradicts the EU's ambitious funding program, Horizon 2020, which has the goal of transforming the economy through responsible research and innovation. It also casts doubt on the prevalent narrative in the EU which focuses on austerity measures as the catalyst for future growth. Not only has austerity stifled growth, but it has also prevented the EU from effectively managing the many issues it currently faces and assuming its role as leader in the international political arena. A stronger focus on the goals of COP21 would not only have a wider benefit, but sustainable investment could also help kickstart Europe's economies too.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK320","-Technical Cooperation a Key Agenda Item at IAEA Board of Governors Meeting","November 30, 2015 Monday","ENP Newswire","Director General Yukiya Amano delivered his opening statement at the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors starting today in Vienna, by addressing issues of technical cooperation, nuclear applications, nuclear energy, safety and security, and nuclear verification. The 648 proposed new technical cooperation projects for 2016-2017 demonstrate the wide scope of the Agency's mandate, and the positive impact of its work on the lives of people around the world, Mr Amano told the Board. 'Importantly for our work, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by world leaders in September, contain explicit recognition of the importance of science and technology for development,' he said. 'The SDGs cover many areas in which the IAEA contributes a great deal,' Mr Amano added. 'These include energy, food security and nutrition, human health, protection of the oceans and management of water resources, as well as climate change.' The SDGs are a set of universal development goals, targets and indicators that countries can use to frame their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years. They were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September. IAEA Member States may choose to reflect SDG targets in their development plans, which could be reflected in their IAEA country programme frameworks, Mr Amano said. 'The TC programme will continue to respond to Member State needs and priorities.' Update on the lab modernization project Mr Amano also briefed the Board on the progress of plans to modernize the IAEA's nuclear applications laboratories in Seibersdorf, near Vienna. The Insect Pest Control Laboratory will be the first of two new laboratory buildings scheduled for construction under the Renovation of the Nuclear Applications Laboratories (ReNuAL) project. Modernization of the labs will improve the IAEA's ability to help countries use nuclear science and technology to achieve the SDGs, Mr Amano said. Construction of the first laboratory is expected to begin next April. Construction of the second building, the Flexible Modular Laboratory, will begin once the required funding is available, Mr Amano told the Board. So far, some 13.9 million euros has been provided or pledged by 20 Member States for the ReNuAL project, Mr Amano said, thanking them for their support. 'However, we still need an additional 6.7 million euros. I again call on all Member States in a position to do so to contribute generously.' Nuclear energy and climate change Turning to nuclear energy, Mr Amano noted that the IAEA will be participating in side events at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP-21 , that begins in Paris next week. The objective of the conference is to reach a legally binding accord on combating global warming. 'Many countries expect nuclear power to play an important role in their energy mix in the coming decades,' Mr Amano said. 'It is one of the lowest emitters of carbon dioxide among energy sources, considering emissions through the entire life cycle.' Nuclear Safety On nuclear safety, Mr Amano noted that his report on the Fukushima Daiichi accident and the final report on the implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safetyhad been published in September. 'Work is underway to incorporate the output from these major undertakings into the Agency's regular nuclear safety activities,' he said. Nuclear Verification In the area of nuclear verification, the IAEA is conducting preparatory activities related to the verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), agreed between Iran and six countries and the European Union in July this year. This includes verification and monitoring of the steps Iran has begun taking towards the implementation of its commitments under the agreement, Mr Amano said. The activities set out in the Road-map for the clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme between Iran and the IAEA for the period to October 15th were completed on schedule and a wrap-up technical meeting took place on November 24th. 'Next week, I expect to provide my final assessment on all past and present outstanding issues, as set out in my report of November 2011, for action by the Board,' Mr Amano said.

Technology may bring forth some solutions, but we must ensure that needs of 7 billion people are met on a sustainable basis. Greed and unsustainable lifestyle should have no place in a new world regime to fight Climate Change and its ill-effects. Latest Earth Overshoot Report is an eye-opener. Global Footprint Network (GFN) every year presents a report on ecological footprint which maps consumption and requirement of natural resources to sustain it. Lifestyle adopted in developed countries is unsustainable and it will require five Earths to fulfil their lifestyle demands. On the other hand, Indian lifestyle is sustainable where one earth is sufficient. This is not because of poverty, but because of Indian value systems. We believe in need-based consumption and our lifestyle is against extravagant consumption. We have an ingrained sense of responsibility where wasteful consumption is abhorred. Therefore, the Paris conference must include a debate on lifestyles. The Earth Overshoot Report has indicated that the Ecological Footprint of developed countries ranges from 8 to 4 whereas India is at 0.9. India and other developing countries have priority of eradication of poverty. They cannot be asked to compromise on that goal in the name of Climate Change. Every poor of the World has the right to emerge out of poverty, and poor and developing countries need sufficient carbon space to ensure sustainable development. As Climate Change impacts the poorer and vulnerable sections severely, we must ensure climate justice. Shri Javadekar expressed concern over the recently concluded Bonn negotiations round wherein instead of discussion on draft text, there was an effort to steamroll and thrust new ideas. It also rejected proposals of developing countries. For a successful Paris summit, next round of Bonn negotiations in October must come out with a draft text, which will include all the principles of convention like CBDR and Equity, as also all elements of Convention like Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance & Technology and Capacity Building in the core agreement. Shri Javadekar also chaired a meeting of the group of Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) at the Indian Embassy and held bilaterals with UK, USA and Germany.&rdquo; \"

Environmental activists - who had expected attract hundreds of thousands people on 29 November and 12 December - said that they accepted Wednesday's decision with regret, but were now considering ""new and imaginative"" ways of making their voices heard. Following the recent terror attacks in Paris, French authorities said a statement that all demonstrations organised in closed spaces or in places where security can easily be ensured could go ahead. ""However, in order to avoid additional risks, the government has decided not to authorise climate marches planned in public places in Paris and other French cities,"" it said. Environmental activists had hoped the marches would attract large numbers to put pressure on governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A range of groups have been involved in planning actions during the summit and the position of every one of them was not immediately clear on Wednesday. Some of those involved say though that more than 2,000 protests in around 150 countries during the talks have taken on a greater significance. They include the campaign group Avaaz, which released a promotional video for the marches it is involved in organising around the world. Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz, said: ""The police have just informed us that the tragic attacks in Paris have made the march there impossible. ""Now it's even more important for people everywhere to march on the weekend of 29 November on behalf of those who can't, and show that we are more determined than ever to meet the challenges facing humanity with hope, not fear."" Jean-Fran\'e7ois Juilliard, Greenpeace France executive director, said that it was a source of huge regret that the French authorities said that they cannot guarantee safety the safety of marchers but the decision must be respected. He added: ""Huge numbers were expected in Paris, but those people will not be silenced. We will find new, imaginative ways to ensure our voices are heard in the UN conference centre and beyond. ""In hundreds of towns and cities across the world people will still march for the climate, for Paris and for our shared humanity. We stand for a vision of human cooperation that the murderers sought to extinguish. They will not succeed."" Talks between the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and campaigners over the fate of a huge march before the forthcoming Paris climate summit ended without agreement earlier this week. Fabius expressed fears on Tuesday about the risk of another terror attack and of the sort of crowd panic seen in Paris's Place de R\'e9publique on 15 November, when hundreds of people fled a solidarity vigil after firecrackers were let off. As well as the marches, other protest actions which had been planned include a ""people's summit"", a ""climate action zone"" involving schools and community groups and a day of civil disobedience at the summit's end. It said in a statement on Wednesday that it would try to find an ""alternative form of citizen mobilisation"" to demonstrate that COP21 would not just be left to the negotiators. The organisation said that the climate summit, which was due to be held on 5 and 6 December in the eastern suburb of Montreuil and another event from 7 to 11 December in the centre of Paris should be maintained. \"

For Merkel, the Brazil Agenda is ""ambitious"" and it should encourage other countries to be ""more bold."" ""If we want to, in fact, prevent the global temperature from increasing by 2 degrees centrigrades, our commitment with the elimination of carbon emissions for 2100 is very important,"" Dilma said as she stood by Merkel in Planalto Palace. The climate change agenda was a priority for the European leader who wants to intensify her campaign among the emerging economies to prevent the failure of the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris in December. ""It is very important that each one do what is possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees centigrades, Merkel said, adding that Brazil ""has taken a big step."" ""Brazil's commitment should encourage other countries to be more bold."" Despite the commitment for the end of the century, the Brazilian government did not reveal its goals for reducing gas emissions for the COP21 . According to Dilma, the figures already disclosed by countries like China and the United States will be announced in September at the UN General Assembly in the United States with the purpose of sustained development. Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira had announced earlier that Brazil is not obliged to announce its goals now. ""There is a date established by the United Nations."" ""Impressed"" Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira has told Folha that the reduction of carbon emissions is not part of the INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) but it is important. ""It is a commitment by the countries to ensure (a limit to the temperature increase) to 2 degrees centigrades - which is a commitment already agreed at the UN convention on the subject,"" Teixeira said. ""With this, Brazil thus announces that it will not agree to change the goal for the temperature increase."" According to Teixeira, during the bilateral meeting in Planalto Palace Dilma discussed the possible Brazilian goals, ""impressing"" Merkel."" Standing beside Merkel, Dilma said that she would ""bring forward"" some commitments, but she just repeated what she had said in June, like the recovery of 12 million hectares of forest and the end of illegal deforestation. Without giving details, Dilma mentioned the neutralization of carbon gas emissions associated with legal deforestation in the Amazon region. In a joint statement, Brazil and Germany strongly support the adoption at the COP21 of an ""ambitious, lasting, broad, and legally binding"" agreement that reflects ""common although differentiated responsibilities"" by the countries - which is a crucial point for developing countries who allege having contaminated the planet to a lesser extent until the present.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK324","COP21: Paris talks agree draft accord to limit carbon emissions","FT.com"," ","A new global climate accord edged closer on Saturday as negotiators ended four years of work and produced a draft text of an agreement for ministers to finalise next week.  This is a milestone, said Laurence Tubiana, France\' s ambassador to the talks, as delegates formally accepted a draft that has been in the making since 2011.  I\' m probably not the only one who feels really emotional about this, she said. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and his counterparts from nearly 200 countries will head to HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/intl/paris-climate-talks Paris on Sunday for the last five days of negotiations on the first new global accord to limit carbon emissions in 18 years. But the 48-page draft that emerged on Saturday still contains a number of potential minefields that could end up making a final agreement very weak or even impossible to conclude.  It\' s messy, said one European delegate, adding the document nonetheless contained the clear outlines of an accord and it was striking to see delegates from almost every country say they wanted a deal next week.      We\' re talking about life itself, said Laurent Fabius, France\' s foreign minister, who is also serving as president of the conference, due to end on Friday.  To support a successful outcome at the Paris talks, known as COP21 , a host of celebrities, business leaders and politicians descended on the Le Bourget airfield north of city\' s centre on Saturday where the conference is being held. Among them were 10 US Democratic senators keen to demonstrate support for the climate plans of US President Barack Obama, despite fierce opposition from Republicanlegislators. US actor Sean Penn said he believed the Paris meeting was taking place in  the most exciting time in human history because  the days of dreams have given way to the days of doing . Chief among the most problematic issues to be settled next week are those that have bedevilled UN climate talks for more than 20 years  questions such as: How much should wealthy countries pay poorer nations to help them lower emissions and how much should all countries collectively cut their carbon pollution to avert dangerous global warming? Signs of compromise on some of the biggest stumbling blocks in the talks began to emerge late on Friday. Delegates from wealthy countries have hinted they will accept a demand for the agreement to include a requirement for them to deliver $100bna year after 2020 to help poorer countries deal with climate change  as long as developing countries agree to do their best to limit emissions and back tougher rules on the way pollution is counted and reduced. Some rich countries have also said they are willing to increase this $100bn figure in future years, but only if the so-called  donor base of climate finance is enlarged to include big emerging economies such as China. India and other countries are firmly opposed to this. But US envoy Todd Stern said people were  over-reading the issue by thinking it amounted to the US wanting countries to take on new obligations.  We are not, he said. Still, divisions remain over a host of other elements of a potential agreement, including many that helped sink the last effort to seal a new climate deal, in Copenhagen in 2009. This time, negotiators say the conditions for a deal are much better.  Copenhagen was more like a trade fair than a negotiation, said Elina Bardram, a senior EU delegate, explaining one of the reasons the meeting failed was because of the  flawed concept that world leaders could personally negotiate the highly technical details of a climate accord. In Paris, about 150 leaders came for one day at the start of the two-week meeting to help bolster what Mr Obama said should be a  turning point when  we finally determined we would save our planet . They then flew off to leave their ministers and officials to finalise the agreement. Another reason the Paris meeting differs from Copenhagen is that more than 180 of the 195 countries involved in the talks have already been setting out their respective goals and plans to deal with climate change since March. This happened much later in the run-up to Copenhagen. But collectively, the pledges made for the Paris accord do not add up to enough to stop global temperatures rising more than 2C from preindustrial times, a limit governments have already agreed at past UN climate talks. One of the issues likely to go down to the wire next week is the question of when countries should upgrade their pledges in the future. The EU and the US are pushing for this to happen as soon as possible, as are many smaller countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts. But other nations are pushing for the agreement to contain a much later date. In Paris, a group of small island states and developing nations are also pressing for the 2C target to be lowered to 1.5C in the new accord, a move Saudi Arabia and other nations are resisting. Island country leaders also want the new accord to include support for the loss and damage caused by rising sea levels and other impacts of climate change. Both issues are likely to require a lot of hard negotiation next week. Tony de Brum, foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, told reporters on Saturday:  I refuse to go home to my people without a Paris agreement that allows me to look them in the eye and say that everything is going to be OK. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK325","Carbon capture - CCS after COP21: where do we go from here?","May 1, 2016","Modern Power System","During the COP 21 meeting in Paris last December, 196 nations agreed to set new targets to address anthropogenic global warming, retaining the +2 degsC goal but setting a new stretching 1.5 degsC target. The meeting concluded that carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the required technologies in the tool box in order to meet these goals, and even carbon negative technologies may be required to reverse and stop global warming. And yet CCS development seems to have been struggling in recent years, particularly in Europe, with the UK government recently cancelling its CCS competition, for example. Against this background, what is the way forward and what are the prospects for CCS post COP21 ? We asked Oscar Graff ( HYPERLINK mailto:Oscar.Graff@akersolutions.com Oscar.Graff@akersolutions.com Improved technology When we started our CCS development programme back in 2005 the technology was regarded as not commercially available and not proven, says Graff. Today there are a handful of technology providers that can offer large scale solutions, which are tested and verified in pilot plants and ready for the market. The capture technology has been considerably improved over the years and the first large scale plants are well under way in Canada and in the USA. However, CCS developments in the EU have been slow and several projects have been cancelled. Even though the capture technology has been considerably improved, delivering increased efficiency and reduced cost, there is still a considerable gap between the cost of CO2 emissions allowances (current EU quota price is about 6 EUR/t) and the cost of CCS. In order to progress the first demonstration projects and to get on the learning curve, which will give further cost reduction, some initial financial support is required from either local or central authorities. We see an increased interest in CCS after the Paris meeting. We are being contacted by a broad range of industries that emit CO2, such as cement, steel, fertiliser, aluminium, waste-to-energy (WtE) and fossil fuel power generation. They are all interested in the cost of large scale applications and the technology performance, the integration with existing plant and possible pilot testing, says Graff. Our Mobile Test Unit (MTU) which is a complete carbon capture plant in miniature (capacity about 1000 Am3 flue gas/h), was commissioned and put in operation in 2008. The unit has been in continuous operation since then and at the same time we started our 88 month R&D programme, SOLVit, together with our partners. The MTU has been engaged in pioneering tests in Europe and the USA and has recently been testing at a cement factory (Norcem) and waste-to-energy plant (Klemetsrud, Oslo city), says Graff. (See MPS April 2016 for more on the Klemetsrud WtE project.) In 2009, Aker Solutions was selected to design and deliver the amine plant at Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM), Norway. TCM is the largest CCS test centre globally and comprises both an amine plant and a chilled ammonia plant. Flue gas is provided from two different sources. The centre was started up in 2012 and so far three technology providers have tested their amine technology there. The parliament in Norway has adopted a plan for a national CCS demonstration project to be implemented by 2020. Last year the present government initiated carbon capture feasibility studies from three alternative CO2 emitters in Norway: Norcem, cement; Oslo city, WtE; and Yara, fertiliser. The captured carbon dioxide is to be liquefied and transported by ship to an offshore reservoir for permanent storage. Three alternative reservoirs are presently being evaluated by Statoil. SOLVit R&D programme (2008-2016) In 2008 we saw the need for a development and improvement programme, says Graff. We established the SOLVit R&D programme. The target for the programme was to develop new, improved solvents that could reduce energy demand by 50%, reduce capture costs and have minimum environmental impact. The MTU was the final test station for these solvents and a second R&D test rig was established at Tiller in Trondheim in collaboration with SINTEF and the Technical University in Trondheim (NTNU). The following possible end users also participated in the programme: Statkraft; E.ON; ScottishPower; and EnBW. The programme was funded by Aker Solutions, Gassnova (the Norwegian state enterprise for initiating CCS developments) and the other partners. SOLVit, one of EU's largest carbon capture R&D programmes, was concluded in January 2016. About 50 researchers have been involved in the programme. Among the main findings is that the Advanced Carbon Capture (ACCTM) technology developed by Aker Solutions is ready and qualified for commercial scale application and that the energy efficiency has been improved by 35% compared with a standard amine solution (MEA). The recommended new solvent consists of an amine blend that is ""green"", ie, non-toxic, biodegradable and non-corrosive. This allows the use of cheaper steel materials. The research showed this solvent to be very robust and the degradation due to thermal and chemical effects to be reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the reference amine. These improvements can be illustrated by liquid samples from tests at a coal fired power plant in Heilbronn, Germany, operated by EnBW, see Figure 1. When amines degrade they lose the capture effect and the solvent becomes discoloured. The standard amine (MEA) was significantly darker after 920 operating hours. The new solvent, ACCTM S26, was tested under the same conditions and no visible change was seen after 2090 operating hours. This is a big achievement for our capture technology, says Graff. Less degradation means reduced emissions in treated flue gas and less liquid waste during operations; and the chemical consumption (amine make-up) is reduced accordingly. During the SOLVit programme, second and third generation solvent systems were also evaluated and tested at pilot scale, including two-phase liquid systems. The main conclusions from these evaluations were that new generation solutions gave marginal improvements and at high risk. The partners could not identify any good candidates for further development. Key features of the SOLVit programme are summarised below. Technology Centre Mongstad TCM, Norway, can be regarded as the most advanced amine based carbon capture plant globally. Flue gas is provided from a refinery cracker (about 13% CO2 by volume) and a gas fired CHP plant (3.5% CO2). The cracker gas is similar to the flue gas from a coal fired power station. The capacity of the capture plant is about 80,000 tons of CO2 per annum. The absorber column can have varying packing heights and two alternative desorber systems are installed. During the first two years of operation Aker Solutions carried out two campaigns with proprietary solvents from the SOLVit R&D programme and one joint campaign with the TCM owners (Gassnova, Statoil & Shell) on a standard MEA solvent. The MTU was operated in parallel with the industrial scale amine plant at TCM, see Figure 2. The scale-up from the MTU to TCM is about a factor of 50. The results from these TCM tests verified the good match between the predicted performance based on initial MTU tests and CO2SIM simulations, and actual performance in the larger amine plant under the same operating conditions. The plant availability during the first test campaign at TCM was 93% without any standby equipment. The new solvent, S26, which was tested at TCM in one of the campaigns confirmed the robustness of the solvent, as demonstrated in the course of initial laboratory, Heilbronn and MTU tests. Pioneering MTU test at Norcem In 2014 Aker Solutions started a 16 month MTU test at Norcem's cement factory in Brevik, Norway. This large scale pilot test of carbon capture from a cement factory was the first of its kind globally, and the test gained international interest. The test results from Norcem were shared with the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) and its membership of over 40 leading cement producers worldwide. Three alternative capture technologies were tested in parallel with the MTU, two membrane systems and one calcium carbonate system. Figure 3 shows the Mobile Test Unit in operation at Norcem, part of the Heidelberg group. The total CO2 emissions from the entire cement industry are estimated to account for about 5-6% of anthropogenic emissions. The CO2 concentration in the flue gas at Norcem is about 20% by volume. About 2/3 of the CO2 volume is related to the released CO2 from the cement process (limestone); and the remaining part comes from the combustion and heating system. Due to the relatively high concentration of CO2, the capture plant will be more compact, will require less energy per ton of captured CO2 and both the investment cost and operating cost will be reduced accordingly. Based on the initial tests of alternative technologies, Norcem selected the ACCTM technology from Aker Solutions for further development. The MTU test demonstrated excellent capture performance and formed the basis for further studies of a large scale capture plant at the cement factory in Brevik. In co-operation with Norcem we investigated how we could best integrate a capture plant with the existing cement factory. This plant emits about 860,000 t of carbon dioxide per annum. By utilising the available waste heat in the flue gas we would be able to capture about 400,000 t of CO2 without any need for additional heat, notes Graff. This provided the design basis for the large scale capture plant and will reduce the operating cost of the capture plant significantly. A similar design approach could be applied to other industries and thereby make the capture plant more economic. At Norcem the captured CO2 will be liquefied and stored in interim vessels, before it is loaded on to ships for further transport. Norcem is one of three candidates for the planned national CCS demo project in Norway, together with the Yara and Klemetsrud WtE projects. Time to get going To summarise, carbon capture technologies have been improved over the last ten years and several technologies have been tested at industrial scale and are ready for commercial use at an acceptable risk level. But the cost of CCS is still considerably higher than the cost of CO2 emissions quotas, so early CCS demonstration will depend on financial support. Early demonstration projects are important in order to establish references for the technology performance and cost for capture, transport and storage. These demo projects will establish an infrastructure for CO2 transport and storage, and facilitate participation by further CO2 emitters. Demonstration projects are also crucial in order to increase knowledge of CCS and to bring the costs further down. It is important to select the best candidates for carbon capture demo projects (low hanging fruit) and the best storage sites. The deployment of CCS will depend on political leadership and it is important to get going now in order to reach the planned carbon dioxide emissions reductions by 2030, says Oscar Graff. \"

Related: Focusing on purpose: new BT report sets out ambitious goals to 2020 But for me, there are two things that make this report so much more than just another ""abatement statement"". One, it's the first study of its kind to examine the impact ICT can have on society, as well as the economy and the environment. Two, is that it identifies three key stakeholder groups and recommends priority actions they could take to help safeguard a sustainable, profitable future: Policymakers should set national CO 2targets, recognising the critical role of ICT, creating investment incentives to connect the unconnected.   Businesses should recognise the growth and innovation opportunities made possible by ICT that make sustainable investments viable. Consumers should be encouraged to adopt technology solutions that promote resource efficiency. Essentially, SMARTer2030 tells us that the power of communications can help everyone live a better life. And the report is jam-packed with findings that help illustrate this. For example, it calculates that the roll-out of ICT could save up to 25bn barrels of oil, 332tn litres of water and 91m tons of paper. It also highlights a future in which 1.6 billion people have access to e-healthcare and half a billion will have access to e-learning solutions. And it says that the 2.5 billion people who do not have access to ICT-enabled services today could be connected by 2030. At the heart of the report is an examination of how ICT solutions can help make decoupling economic growth and carbon emissions an achievable goal. Historically, the link between GDP expansion, CO2 emissions and resource use has been very strong. In fact, for every 1% increase in GDP, CO2 emissions have generally risen by around 0.5% and resource intensity has risen by 0.4%. Related: 'The internet of things': what the man who coined the phrase has to say The modelling used in the SMARTERer2030 report is unpreceded in its range and depth. It paints a clear picture of how ICT can reshape the way we live, as well as reducing the impact that continued economic growth has on our environment. So, while ICT can be used to generate at least $6tn of additional economic opportunity by 2030, it can be done without adding to our resource or climate footprints, keeping CO2 emissions steady at today's (2015) levels. BT is a long-time supporter of GeSI and a sponsor of SMARTer2013. The bold, disruptive statements it makes are of special interest to us in BT. A big part of this is because at BT we know that ICT can give us a triple win - namely tremendous social, economic and environmental benefits. We've also already proved how decoupling growth and emissions can support economic success. Our ambition is to help our customers cut their carbon emissions by at least three times our own carbon impact by 2020. The good news is that we are well on the way to achieving our goal. In March 2015 we reached a reduction ratio of 1.5:1. Last year, we saw our customers spend \£33.4bn on carbon abating BT products, services and solutions. These include cloud computing, which is a much more energy efficient way for businesses to manage their data needs. Meanwhile connectivity services like videoconferencing help minimise travel. Related: Can big data improve the lives of people in the developing world? Our products and services are also having a positive impact on society across the globe. A good example is BT's Connecting Africa programme which has seen us connect 20 locations in nine African countries to the internet via satellite. We've also helped the charity SOS Children's Villages to provide better education, healthcare and training to around 73,000 people. And we extended our pilot to provide high-speed Wi-Fi to tenants living in a housing association in Glasgow at a subsidised price and developed a shared internet service. Wi-Fi and satellite communications are among the ICT solutions discussed in the SMARTer2030 report - a report that says communications technology can make a better world. This is something that we at BT agree with wholeheartedly. So I hope that message and the whole of the SMARTer2030 report is debated with enthusiasm and optimism at The United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris this December. Certainly, ICT Solutions to 21 stCentury Challenges should be essential reading for all policymakers attending the event. And let's hope it inspires them to reach the right agreements and secure a more prosperous world for all of us.

He congratulated Transition Bro Gwaun members on the success of their project which has fought off tough competition to feature in a new book which will be showcased at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The book '21 Stories of Transition: how a movement of communities is coming together to reimagine and rebuild our world' will be showcased at the conference which brings together 120 political leaders to commit to tackling climate change. Fishguard's Transition group has been running since 2008, and is the only Welsh group to have two of its projects featured in this inspiring book which highlights 39 projects from local communities in 15 countries around the world that have had a positive impact not only on their communities, but on reducing carbon and waste. During his visit to the caf\'e9, which was also used to host his advice surgery, Mr Crabb said: ""I am delighted that our local transition movement has been recognised in this way and is the only organisation in Wales to be highlighted in this book and showcased at the climate conference. ""They have created a successful operation which is not only serving a community need but is helping to reduce waste and cut carbon. All the staff and volunteers do an excellent job in creating affordable and healthy meals for sale from good food that local businesses and people would otherwise throw away."" Chris Samra, one of the founder members of Transition Bro Gwaun, said: ""Our surplus food project is more than just a way of reducing food waste.

The damaging effects of climate change are predicted to have a deadly effect on parts of the Persian Gulf in less than a century. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are all predicted to hit between 74C and 77C in some places by 2100, according to the study. Such temperatures are too hot for the human body to survive in as humans are unable to produce sweat to cool themselves down. The report was compiled by a pair of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Loyola Marymount University and was published in the journal Nature Climate Change. ""Our results expose a regional hotspot where climate change, in the absence of significant mitigation, is likely to severely impact human habitability in the future,"" they wrote. The authors used several high resolution climate model simulations to calculate the results. And although those temperatures wouldn't occur every single day, the study goes on to say that ""super heatwaves"" could arrive once in a decade and the effects would be fatal. According to the authors of the study, their results could be avoided if carbon dioxide emissions are controlled. The research comes ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Paris next month. The conference will seek to find a universal and legally-binding agreement on climate change and controlling CO2 emissions. Is climate change the biggest threat to our planet?

It contains all manner of parentheses, with scope for a variety of options to fill them when a final deal is signed off by the end of this week. Among the most critical areas left open is the question of how much support rich countries (who contributed to global warming as they developed) should provide to poor ones (who are being asked to shun ""dirty"" fuels, such as coal, on their own route to prosperity). Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, has warned that it would be ""morally wrong"" for nations such as America and Britain to duck out of providing countries like Bangladesh with compensation, as the effects of climate change hit home. He is right. But equally important at this stage is the practical case. Read more What we've learnt so far at COP21 - and what still needs resolving If poor countries are not paid enough in return for accepting a slower rate of growth, they are likely to proceed with the 2,440 coal-fired power stations they have planned, and so forth. That will cripple any climate deal, hastening the disastrous rise in temperatures the planet is heading towards. The Green Climate Fund, in which rich countries aim to place $100bn a year for poorer nations by 2020, must therefore amount to watertight proof of their commitment to this form of reparations. Gambia's Environment Minister, who represents the least-developed nations, argues that loans cannot count towards that $100bn figure. Indeed, too much of the amount raised so far comes in this form. While Germany, for example, mainly offers grants, France predominantly lends. Britain can be proud of its pledge to give \£3720m, the second-highest sum promised so far. More countries should follow such a lead - it is both moral, practical and in the long-term interest of their own citizens. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK333","COP21: Support grows for limiting warming to 1.5C amid claims 2C 'is not safe'; Even meeting existing goal would mean disaster for small island nations","December 8, 2015 Tuesday 7:09 PM GMT","Independent.co.uk","Dozens of countries are demanding that the long-standing goal of limiting global warming to 2C be discarded - and replaced with a far more ambitious target of 1.5C. The idea is rapidly gaining momentum at the UN climate change summit in Paris this week as ministers from around the world are persuaded that a 2C rise would spell disaster for many countries in low-lying or hot regions - most of them developing nations with little money to limit the damage. Read more What we've learnt so far at COP21 - and what still needs resolving The call comes a month after scientists revealed that the world has already warmed by 1C since pre-industrial times. This means that time is rapidly running out if the temperature increase is to be limited to 2C, let alone 1.5C. Research carried out in preparation for the Paris summit concluded that 1.5C of warming was vastly preferable to 2C. At the same time, a significant number of scientists believe the 1.5C target is still just about achievable with radical action, lending credibility to calls for a tougher target. ""There is no question that 1.5C would be hard to achieve but it is the right target for the world to aim for,"" Thoriq Ibrahim, Environment Minister for the Maldives, told The Independent. ""Already at 1C above preindustrial levels we are experiencing life-altering changes, such as severe erosion, deadly cyclones, and record tides: 1.5C is the scientifically understood safe level for warming,"" added Mr Ibrahim. 5 things you should know about the Paris climate change talks He is also chairman of the 44-nation Alliance of Small Island States which stretches across much of the world and includes Cuba, the Bahamas, Jamaica and Singapore. Low-lying and hot regions are not the only areas which would be threatened even if global warming were limited to less than 2C but more than 1.5C. This is because the temperature increases associated with climate change will be uneven, with the biggest rises set to be in the Arctic. ""We're pushing for 1.5C or even less. A lot of our residents depend on seals, caribou and Arctic char for their livelihoods,"" Peter Taptuna, the premier of Nunavut, a semi-autonomous Inuit province in Arctic Canada, told The Independent. ""Already we're seeing droughts that are affecting spawning grounds for Arctic char and a drastic decline in caribou numbers, and climate change is a factor. In some areas we're getting summer droughts and in the winter time a lack of snowfall. And in some parts of the north we've lost roads and we've lost schools as they sink into melting permafrost,"" he added. Dr Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, a scientist who worked on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) research, said there is just time to hit a 1.5C target. ""The window for limiting warming to 1.5C is still open, but closing fast. And 2Cis simply not safe. The impacts, such as extreme heat and long-term sea-level rise, would be substantially reduced under 1.5C,"" Dr Schleussner said.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said yesterday that the UK was ""open to a reference to a 1.5C goal in the final deal"". But many of the countries who produce or burn large quantities of fossil fuels are against reducing the target, with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela strongly opposed. Meanwhile, India's Environment Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar, said he had no problem with a 1.5C target so long as the rich, developed countries make the additional emissions cuts that would be required to meet it. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK334","COP21: Climate obstacles emerge within hours","FT.com"," ","The obstacles facing this weekend\' s historic global climate change accord were thrown into relief on Sunday night when businesses and government officials played down the impact of the deal and US Republicans underlined their opposition. The Paris agreement, which requires all countries to regularly publish plans to deal with global warming, has been hailed by international leaders as a turning point after more than 20 years of effort to make this century the last to be powered by fossil fuels. Angela Merkel, German chancellor, said the deal was  the first time that the entire world community has obligated itself to act  to act in the battle against global climate change , while Pope Francis also praised the  concerted effort and generous dedication of those involved. It was adopted by nearly 200 nations. But coal and oil industry executives shrugged off any suggestion the new agreement sealed in Paris on Saturday night would have any immediate impact on their businesses. The agreement\' s goals include driving down carbon-dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels as soon as possible in order to limit global warming to  well below 2C from pre-industrial times and perhaps as little as 1.5C, a target requiring much deeper emissions cuts than most countries are currently planning. Amber Rudd, the UK energy and climate change secretary, described the 1.5C goal as merely  aspirational while defending the UK government\' s decision last month to scrap \£31bn in funding for carbon capture systems that could hold emissions down.  I don\' t think it was a mistake, she said.  They are still expensive. Benjamin Sporton, head of the World Coal Association, said he did not see the new agreement spurring a  massive change at the moment for companies that produce coal, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels, because so many developing countries still plan to keep burning it. He said the pact was likely to force governments to focus a lot more on the carbon capture and storage systems the UK had just de-funded because they would be vital for meeting its goals. The American Petroleum Institute said it was still reviewing the Paris accord, but Amjad Bseisu, chief executive of EnQest, an oil explorer in the UK North Sea, said the oil industry had more immediate concerns beyond the Paris Agreement.  This is a very slow process. We already look at our carbon costs, but right now the industry has other challenges [with the falling oil price]. In the US, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, questioned the Paris deal, saying that the US portion relied on measures championed by President Barck Obama that were being challenged in the courts.  Before his international partners pop the champagne, they should remember that this is an unattainable deal based on a domestic energy plan that is likely illegal, that half the states have sued to halt, and that Congress has already voted to reject, Mr McConnell said. A spokesman for Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, told the Financial Times:  This agreement does not bind Congress in any way, and we will continue to focus on an energy policy that promotes America\' s abundant natural resources, But the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, told the FT the Paris Agreement was  a game-changer that should prompt fossil fuel companies to shift to low carbon business opportunities. He described his reaction to the agreement as  Wow! since its measures to help poor countries adapt to climate change would re-shape the way funds were directed to developing nations. Still, many scientists questioned the prospect of governments being able to reach either the 2C or 1.5C goal in the Paris Agreement, saying it was premised on future technologies removing huge quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere many decades from today.  If such highly speculative \' negative emission technologies\' prove to be unsuccessful then the 1.5C target is simply not achievable, said Prof Kevin Anderson of Manchester University.  Moreover, there is only a slim chance of maintaining the global temperature rise to below 2C. Additional reporting by Kiran Stacey \"

The Paris-based agency has released a special briefing outlining the energy sector implications of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). It says that if the pledges are met, then countries currently accounting for more than half of global economic activity will see their energy-related greenhouse gas emissions either plateau or be in decline by 2030. However it has warned that the measures outlined in the INDCs would not be enough to achieve the globally agreed climate goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 2\'b0C, relative to pre-industrial levels. The IEA's briefing shows that under the INDCs, global energy intensity would improve to 2030 at a rate almost three times faster than the rate seen since 2000. In the power sector, 70 per cent of additional electricity generation to 2030 would be low-carbon. Significantly, the power sector - the world's largest source of energy-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions - would see emissions plateau at close to today's levels, effectively breaking the link between rising electricity demand and rising related CO2 emissions, says the IEA. Implementation of the INDCs will require the energy sector to invest $13.5 trillion in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies from 2015 to 2030, an annual average of $840 billion. Climate goals will only be achieved if the energy sector deploys new and innovative technologies with the potential to drive transformational change and decarbonization, said the IEA. \"

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK341","Hundreds of Governments, Businesses and Financial Institutions Commit to Major Action on Energy Efficiency at COP 21, Finds Accenture and SE4All","December 11, 2015 Friday","M2 PressWIRE","December 10, 2015 PARIS -- Leading companies have pledged to enhance their energy efficiency with an estimated impact of 62,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) over the next five years, enough to power the city of Paris for nine months, according to a report by Sustainable Energy for All and Accenture (NYSE: ACN). However, many companies are facing challenges in turning commitments into effective strategies. Some 775 companies, more than 130 national, regional and local governments and over 100 financial institutions have committed to ramping up energy efficiency measures and investments under SE4All's 100/100/100 campaign, contributing to both economic growth and the fight against climate change. The details of private sector commitments are published in 'Sustainable Energy for All, We Commit.' The campaign by SE4All, a unique multi-stakeholder partnership backed by the United Nations and World Bank to catalyze action for universal access to sustainable energy, is building momentum to double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 - one of SE4All's three objectives and a target under the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 on energy. The International Energy Agency estimates that targeted energy efficiency measures have the potential to contribute up to half the savings in greenhouse gas emissions needed to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The campaign's effort to drive private-sector engagement, 'We Commit,' was led by Accenture, which has developed a framework that accepts a range of energy efficiency commitments from companies. The framework prioritizes quantifiable commitments to improvements within companies and their supply chains, but also includes non-quantifiable commitments, such as robust energy efficiency strategies. In just six months, the private-sector segment of the 100/100/100 campaign has secured commitments from around 100 large corporations and 675 small and medium-sized enterprises in 33 countries across all continents. Of these, 75 pledges that can be quantified and tallied represent a total energy saving in 2016-2020 of 62,000 gigawatt hours (GWh), resulting in large cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. In the financial sector, more than 100 banks and institutional investors, managing close to $ 4 trillion in both developed and developing countries, have committed to a major increase in energy efficiency lending in their portfolios in a drive led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United Nations Environment Programme. ""Energy accounts for 60 percent of today's greenhouse gas emissions and global demand for energy continues to rise,"" said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, group chief executive, Accenture's Resources operating group. ""Direct emissions from energy usage are expected to double or triple by 2050 compared to 2010. To help offset that expected impact, the efforts and commitments of private sector companies through this program will help achieve SE4ALL's goal of doubling the rate of energy efficiency."" ""Whether it's better equipment, cleverer systems or new business models and new financing, we need faster results,"" said Rachel Kyte, designate Chief Executive Officer of SE4All and Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Sustainable Energy for All. ""Energy efficiency is essential in growing low carbon economies and in allowing us to meet the goal of energy access for all. We can live in a cleaner world and business can compete to be resource efficient and succeed,"" added Ms Kyte, who is currently the World Bank Group's Vice President and Special Envoy for Climate Change."" The report notes that although many companies have set carbon reduction targets, they often struggle to implement strategies to achieve them, principally due to operational and structural challenges. The report suggests that doubling the rate of energy efficiency can only succeed if individual commitments are accompanied by cross-industry efforts. It calls on multi-national companies to collaborate on setting targets and on designing effective implementation programs. The commitments under the 100/100/100 campaign build on a range of initiatives that were announced at the 2014 Climate Summit in New York, including SE4All's Global Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform. This offers one of the biggest global platforms supporting energy efficiency action across the public sector, private sector and civil society, with a particular focus on reducing energy use in six key areas: appliances, lighting, buildings, industry, vehicle fuels, and district energy systems.

The campaign by SE4All, a unique multi-stakeholder partnership backed by the United Nations and World Bank to catalyze action for universal access to sustainable energy, is building momentum to double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 - one of SE4All's three objectives and a target under the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 on energy. The International Energy Agency estimates that targeted energy efficiency measures have the potential to contribute up to half the savings in greenhouse gas emissions needed to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The campaign's effort to drive private-sector engagement, 'We Commit,' was led by Accenture, which has developed a framework that accepts a range of energy efficiency commitments from companies. The framework prioritizes quantifiable commitments to improvements within companies and their supply chains, but also includes non-quantifiable commitments, such as robust energy efficiency strategies. In just six months, the private-sector segment of the 100/100/100 campaign has secured commitments from around 100 large corporations and 675 small and medium-sized enterprises in 33 countries across all continents. Of these, 75 pledges that can be quantified and tallied represent a total energy saving in 2016-2020 of 62,000 gigawatt hours (GWh), resulting in large cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. In the financial sector, more than 100 banks and institutional investors, managing close to $ 4 trillion in both developed and developing countries, have committed to a major increase in energy efficiency lending in their portfolios in a drive led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United Nations Environment Programme. ""Energy accounts for 60 percent of today's greenhouse gas emissions and global demand for energy continues to rise,"" said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, group chief executive, Accenture's Resources operating group. ""Direct emissions from energy usage are expected to double or triple by 2050 compared to 2010. To help offset that expected impact, the efforts and commitments of private sector companies through this program will help achieve SE4ALL's goal of doubling the rate of energy efficiency."" ""Whether it's better equipment, cleverer systems or new business models and new financing, we need faster results,"" said Rachel Kyte, designate Chief Executive Officer of SE4All and Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Sustainable Energy for All. ""Energy efficiency is essential in growing low carbon economies and in allowing us to meet the goal of energy access for all. We can live in a cleaner world and business can compete to be resource efficient and succeed,"" added Ms Kyte, who is currently the World Bank Group's Vice President and Special Envoy for Climate Change."" The report notes that although many companies have set carbon reduction targets, they often struggle to implement strategies to achieve them, principally due to operational and structural challenges. The report suggests that doubling the rate of energy efficiency can only succeed if individual commitments are accompanied by cross-industry efforts. It calls on multi-national companies to collaborate on setting targets and on designing effective implementation programs. The commitments under the 100/100/100 campaign build on a range of initiatives that were announced at the 2014 Climate Summit in New York, including SE4All's Global Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform. This offers one of the biggest global platforms supporting energy efficiency action across the public sector, private sector and civil society, with a particular focus on reducing energy use in six key areas: appliances, lighting, buildings, industry, vehicle fuels, and district energy systems.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK346","Food at COP21: three new initiatives spotlight food insecurity, soils, waste; Food was high on the agenda at the Paris climate talks this week-here are some of ....","December 4, 2015 Friday 2:01 PM GMT","The Guardian","It's become a catch-22 of our times: the global food system is both a villain and a victim of climate change. Agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, and yet floods, drought, and the planet's increasing climatic variability play with the fate of our food. Continuing on the current climate trajectory will mean a future of profound food insecurity, especially for developing nations. This week, these concerns have been prominent on the agenda at the COP21 climate talks in Paris. For the first time at a COP conference, agriculture had its own dedicated focus-day, held on Tuesday by the Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), a partnership established between France and Peru to showcase and strengthen on-the-ground climate action in 2015 and beyond. ""For years, agriculture, food systems, including oceans, including forests, have been knocking hard at the door-and now there's movement starting,"" said David Nabarro, former special representative of food security and nutrition for the United Nations, at the LPAA agriculture press briefing on Tuesday afternoon. That door should have been yanked open a long time ago, considering that our food systems are due to bear so much of the brunt of climate change. But there are strong signs of progress. The world needs creative solutions if we are to reduce agricultural impact and feed everyone on the planet (an estimated nine billion by 2050)-and some of the best have recently been aired at the talks. Here are three that caught my eye: each places our global food system squarely on the climate table. Charting future insecurity The first step in prioritising food systems is to confront what will happen if we don't. On Tuesday at COP21 the World Food Program and the U.K.'s Met Office Hadley Centre launched a new, interactive mapping tool that predicts, in unprecedented detail, how future climate scenarios could influence food security, especially in the world's developing nations. Based on five years of meteorological and agricultural research, the Food Insecurity and Climate Change Vulnerability Map shows how food security could change at the individual country level, either worsening or improving depending on three variables that users can tweak on the map: time scale (you can choose between the present day, 2050s, 2080s), emissions (low, medium, high), and adaptation (high, low, none). As a starting point, the map could help countries forecast their food security risk and inform their planning, says Richard Choularton, chief of climate and disaster risk reduction at the World Food Programme. ""The results of the analysis can provide some insight into vulnerability at the national level, when the specific factors behind the index are unpacked."" For example, in one country road access might emerge as the main limit on food security, in another it might be the variability of rainfall. The map also shows what can be achieved if reduced emissions are paired with increased adaptive measures-like climate-smart agriculture-to make food systems more secure. ""What's most important, especially in the context of Paris, is that mitigation or adaption alone is not enough,"" Choularton says. ""We need a very serious combination of both."" Keeping soil carbon on lockdown The planet's soils naturally hold vast quantities of carbon-two to three times more carbon than the air. Releasing it through unsuitable, soil-degrading agricultural techniques will contribute to climate change and also reduce soil health-but, if we keep more carbon locked in the soil, it has the power to both mitigate climate change and increase agricultural productivity. On Tuesday as part of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, hundreds of partners joined to launch ' 4/1000 ', an initiative designed to increase the storage of carbon in the earth: ""If we were to increase the amount of carbon in the soil by just 0.4% then we would compensate entirely for the increase of carbon in the atmosphere-just to show how huge the potential is,"" says Frank Rijsberman, CEO of the CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Centers, one of the partners contributing to the initiative. As part of 4/1000 the CGIAR itself is proposing a $225 million project that aims to increase carbon storage by promoting better farming techniques in developing world agriculture. Methods like agroforestry and reduced soil tillage could keep carbon enclosed in the soil, leading to a 20 percent boost in yields, and in theory offsetting greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent. The benefits will be three-pronged, says Rijsberman: ""We will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; adapt agriculture to climate change and thus improve food security; and improve ecosystem functioning."" Global brainstorm on food waste An estimated 1.3 billion tons of food is lost and wasted annually between farm and fork, producing 3.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year. On Tuesday at COP21 , the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the International Food Policy Research Institute announced that to counter it, they're launching a new platform that will encourage G20 member countries, the private sector, and NGOs to pool their resources toward the goal of fighting food waste. Today, that new forum-called the G20 Technical Platform on the Measurement and Reduction of Food Loss and Waste -goes live. The platform is designed to ""provide up to date information on policy, strategy and actions for food loss and waste reduction, and share best practices across countries-something which is badly needed,"" says Anthony Bennett from the Rural Infrastructure and Agro-industries Division at the FAO. G20 member countries-which include China, Brazil, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States-along with other countries, will be encouraged to use the forum to share what works for them in cutting food waste, and what doesn't. As the platform grows, it will also feature a database of low-cost, accessible technologies available to tackle this problem. The hope is that the platform will become a place where countries can unite and ultimately scale up their efforts to reduce the global impact of food waste. These are just three of the many projects worth knowing about: as part of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, several other food-focused initiatives were launched this week, touching on everything from low-carbon beef to the sustainable management of marine food systems.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK348","-EIB issues first Green Bond of 2016","January 7, 2016 Thursday","ENP Newswire","On 5 January 2016, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU Bank owned by the EU Member States, increased the 0.500% Climate Awareness Bond (CAB) November 2023 by EUR 500m, bringing the total amount outstanding to EUR 1.5bn. Credit Agricole SA is one of the main investors of the tap, in the context of its recent commitment to invest EUR 2 billion in high quality Green Bonds. EIB's CABs have been awarded a Sustainability Bond Rating of 'b+' from Oekom, one of the leading ESG rating agencies worldwide. This is the highest rating so far assigned by the agency. The transaction, which takes the total CAB issuance to EUR 11.8bn, highlights EIB's commitment to the sustainable growth of the Green Bond market by increasing the liquidity of EIB's EUR Green Bond curve. The EUR 1.5bn CAB due 11/2023 provides a benchmark of intermediate maturity between the EUR 3bn ECoop CAB due 11/2019, currently the largest Green Bond outstanding, and the EUR 1.25bn CAB due 2026 - the longest outstanding Green benchmark. In EUR, CABs are distributed in mini-benchmark / ECoop format. This means they have a EUR 500m minimum size, and EUR 250m minimum for re-openings upon actual demand. As in 2015, EIB is first to issue a Green Bond in 2016, thereby drawing attention to their relevance in the current policy and market context. Transparency and accountability are among the key features of the recent Paris agreements of COP21 . The delivery of climate goals is not only a question of volume; it implies a wide-ranging transformation of business practice, and the credibility of climate finance is crucial for the effective involvement of capital markets. Green Bonds enhance the transparency of climate finance and promote the debate on definitions, impact assessment methodologies and impact reporting principles, permitting stakeholders to increasingly engage for higher comparability and improvement in these fields. This engagement is essential for a shift from financing climate activities in incremental ways, to making climate change - both in terms of opportunities and risk - a core consideration and 'lens' through which institutions deploy capital. A synopsis or recent initiatives in these areas is provided by a report published by International Financial Institutions (IFIs, including the EIB) during COP 21 , which details five voluntary principles for mainstreaming climate change considerations within Financial Institutions, illustrated by relevant test cases (thereunder Green Bonds on p. 51): Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions. Emerging practices. HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi_mainstreaming_epp_en.pdf http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi_mainstreaming_epp_en.pdf ) A good practical example of the results already obtained is a proposal for a Harmonized Framework for Green Bond Impact Reporting jointly advanced by ADB, AFD, AfDB, EBRD, EIB, FMO, IBRD, IDB, IFC, KFW, and NIB on December 2 ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi/informationonimpactreporting.pdf http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi/informationonimpactreporting.pdf ). Joint Bookrunners for the transaction were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Agricole CIB, Commerzbank, DZ Bank, Rabobank, and UniCredit. Comments on the issue: Eila Kreivi, Director and Head of Capital Markets Department at the EIB, said: 'Today's issue underlines EIB's endeavour to further enhance the liquidity of the Green Bond market, increasing its investor appeal. Being the first Green Bond issuer to tap the market at scale in 2016 reflects the importance and urgency of acting upon decisions made at COP 21 . Moreover, this brings the CAB 2023 to EUR 1.5bn, strengthening its benchmark status.' Martin Mills, Head of Green DCM, EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: 'EIB has once more demonstrated leadership in the green bond market by kicking off the year with a EUR500m CAB increase on just day two. At the same time they have highlighted the attention given to the market by COP21 and provided renewed focus on important developments such as the recent release on impact reporting'. Tanguy Claquin, Head of Sustainable Banking, Credit Agricole CIB, said: 'This new Climate Awareness Bond highlights that the EIB will lead the way from COP21 words to climate action'. Sylvia Moussalli, Head of DCM Public Sector and Frequent Borrowers, Commerzbank, said: 'With the latest EUR 500 million increase to its 2023 Climate Awareness Bond, EIB re-opened the green bond market in 2016 and reinforced its position as one of the key issuers of the product. The early execution during the year emphasizes the importance of green bonds as a core product for EIB and Commerzbank is excited to support EIB in achieving its sustainability goals.' Patricio Bustos-Heppe, Executive Director at DZ BANK: 'The EIB has swiftly opened the SRI markets in 2016 by adding another EUR 500m to its existing November 2023 Climate Awareness Bond. The ongoing demand in this space has to be seen in conjunction with the ground-breaking agreements that have been reached during the COP 21 in December. Capital markets in general and the Climate Awareness Bonds of the EIB in particular will continue to play an important role to help financing ambitious goals in the environmental and climate policy'. Sachin Shah, Executive Director, Public Sector Origination, Rabobank, said: 'EIB remains a leading issuer in the green bond market and today's increase highlights EIB's dedication to providing liquid references in this sector for SRI investors. By bringing EIB's first EUR transaction in 2016 in Climate Awareness Bond format, the issuer has shown their commitment to the sustainable growth of the Green Bond market. EIB continues to foster transparency, accountability and compliance of environmental finance with their approach which is key for growth of the green bond market and to help combat climate change.' Antonio Keglevich, Head of Green Bond, UniCredit, said 'On the heels of the remarkable outcome of the COP21 in Paris it is again the European Investment Bank to take the lead by offering the first Green Bond in 2016. The EIB is constantly enabling investment opportunities for institutional investors who are seeking tradable and liquid debt products related to climate finance. UniCredit is proud to have repeatedly accompanied the CAB program from the very beginning in 2007.'

In 2014, the EIB dedicated over EUR 19bn, or 25% of its total lending activity, to climate action. Within this area, the EIB strongly supports Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, meaningfully contributing to the EU's 2020 and 2030 climate policy targets. EIB's overall lending in these areas in 2014 reached EUR 8.2bn. Climate Awareness Bonds CABs, EIB Green Bonds, provide investors with the opportunity to associate their investment with EIB's lending in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, while enjoying the excellent credit quality of EIB as an issuer. The funds raised via these issues are earmarked to match actual disbursements to eligible projects. These projects include, but are not exclusive to, respectively: renewable energy projects such as wind, hydropower, wave, tidal, solar and geothermal production, energy efficiency projects such as district heating, cogeneration, building insulation, energy loss reduction in transmission and distribution, and equipment replacement with significant energy efficiency improvements. The support of the Green Bond market in quantity and quality is an important objective of EIB's activity as reflected in its Corporate Operational Plan 2015-2017 ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/cop2015_en.pdf http://www.eib.org/attachments/strategies/cop2015_en.pdf , p. 15) as well as in the Climate Strategy adopted by the Bank's Board of Directors on 22/9/2015 ( \~ http://www.eib.org/attachments/consultations/eib_climate_action_climate_strategy_20150817_en.pdf http://www.eib.org/attachments/consultations/eib_climate_action_climate_strategy_20150817_en.pdf ). EIB pioneered the Green Bond segment in 2007 and is the largest issuer of Green Bonds to date, with EUR 11.8bn raised. On 27/03/2015, in concomitance with the publication of the new version of Green Bond Principles (GBP), the EIB published its 2014 Climate Awareness Bond Newsletter: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi/2014-cab-newsletter.pdf http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi/2014-cab-newsletter.pdf . The Newsletter outlines in detail EIB's Green Bond practice in relation to the four key areas of the GBP. The Newsletter also includes EIB's Green Bond project impact report, the first prepared according to the proposal for a Harmonised Framework for Green Bond Impact Reporting developed jointly by AfDB, EIB, IBRD and IFC in response to a recommendation of the 2015 Green Bond Principles and recently enriched and taken on board by 7 additional IFIs \~ HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/attachments/fi/informationonimpactreporting.pdf . EIB funding strategy The Bank's funding strategy combines a consistent and transparent approach with flexibility and innovation, both in terms of product and maturity.

The gathering, which opened in Edinburgh today, voted in favour of extending a law passed last May that permits ministers to be in same-sex civil partnerships. The outcome follows years of deliberation on the issue within the Church. The decision means the Kirk adopts a position which maintains a traditional view of marriage between a man and woman, but allows individual congregations to ''opt out'' if they wish to appoint a minister or a deacon in a same-sex marriage or a civil partnership. Any wider consideration of the theological understanding of same-sex marriage will not take place until the Theological Forum presents its report to the Kirk next year.

"COP21","UK","COP21_UK354","-California Department of Insurance -Commissioner details impacts of climate change on California insurance marketplace","April 22, 2016 Friday","ENP Newswire","As March was one of the warmest recorded months in history, and the eleventh straight month of record breaking global temperatures, Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones is using Earth Day 2016 to remind insurers and consumers of the effects climate change will have on the insurance market in California and the steps being taken mitigate that risk. 'I believe that climate change presents risks that insurance companies should consider with regard to their business operations, investment portfolio, and underwriting,' said Commissioner Jones. 'We should all be concerned about the impact climate change will have on the future availability and affordability of insurance coverage.' Jones has been a national and international leader regarding how insurers address climate risk in their business operations, reserving, and underwriting. In December at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties Jones joined global leaders addressing the threat of climate change and signed the Paris Pledge for Action. In January, Jones launched his Climate Risk Management Carbon initiative. This initiative is designed to assess the risks to insurers caused by climate change, and has two significant parts, one calls on insurance companies to divest from thermal coal and the second requires insurance companies to disclose their investments in the carbon economy. The goal is to make sure insurance companies doing business in California are adequately addressing the impacts of climate change on their risk profiles. Jones is calling on insurers to help mitigate the effects of climate change now to ensure the availability and affordability of insurance in California. The California Department of Insurance, established in 1868, is the largest consumer protection agency in California. Insurers collect $ 259 billion in premiums annually in California. In 2015 the California Department of Insurance received more than 155,000 calls from consumers and helped recover over $ 84 million in claims and premiums.

However, Chen Jining, environment minister, cautioned that HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/world/asia-pacific/china China needed a further 30-50 per cent cut in pollutants in order to achieve a  substantial improvement in its damaged air, soil and water, in a report carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Beginning in 2010, China pledged to cut emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and ammonia nitrogen as well as chemical oxygen demand (COD), a measure of organic pollutants in water. The goals were incorporated in its 12th five-year plan, which concludes this year, and were primarily tackled by installing emissions-control equipment on power plants, steel mills and other major industrial facilities. During those five years, choking air pollution has become a top source of discontent among China\' s increasingly prosperous urban middle classes. This month the northeastern city of Shenyang was blacked out by thick brown smog as the city\' s heating boilers revved up at the same time, creating the worst recorded pollution in the country in two years. On Sunday, Beijing raised its air pollution alert to  orange for the first time in 13 months as the concentration of tiny particulates known as PM2.5 hit 300 on a scale in which 50 is considered dangerous to health. Beijing has been enveloped by smog for most of November, following an unusually clear period that some attributed to a slowing economy. Mr Chen said 20m tonnes of major pollutants are still discharged every year in China, requiring further cuts. The next five-year plan, which is being drafted amid heavy lobbying from state-owned companies hit by slowing economic growth, could also include targets for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or organic chemicals that easily dissipate in the air, Xinhua said. China estimates that its carbon emissions will peak around 2030, as economic growth slows and the economy matures enough to shift away from heavy, pollution-intensive industry. The calculation of the peak has been hailed as its primary commitment to the HYPERLINK http://www.ft.com/cop21 climate change talks Slowing economic growth has led some in China to argue that its peak could come sooner, meaning coal-fired power plants included in the upcoming five-year plan do not need to be built. Others worry that policies to reduce the proportion of coal in the national energy mix lead to an unhealthy support for environmentally destructive dams and a too-quick rollout of nuclear power. \"

The a letter of agreement signed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) formalizes their collaboration on activities supporting the Government in assisting vulnerable communities in Sudan. ""UNEP is confident that this agreement with WFP will assist us to mainstream improved environmental management with humanitarian and early recovery activities through the wide-spread, professional presence of WFP in Sudan, ultimately helping recipient communities build resilience to climate change,"" UNEP Representative Bradley Smith said of the agreement, signed earlier this month. UNEP and its partners are promoting innovative natural resource management mechanisms that will contribute to improved livelihoods and climate resilience, while reducing conflict over precious natural resources such as water, forests and rangeland. ""This agreement shows our commitment to the outcomes of the United Nations climate change conference that has just concluded in Paris,"" WFP's Sudan Country Director Adnan Khan said. ""We are very pleased to have this opportunity to work with UNEP in assisting the Government of Sudan to address environmental issues and the challenges of climate change that could damage efforts to achieve Zero Hunger, especially where these involve smallholder farmers and other vulnerable groups that we assist through our programmes,"" Mr. Khan added. WFP supports vulnerable groups in Sudan in building their resilience to climate-related shocks and disasters while restoring livelihoods among internally displaced people, refugees and vulnerable communities. The necessity of climate analysis and disaster-risk reduction is rapidly becoming apparent in Sudan, as fears grow that delayed and insufficient rainfall caused by this year's El Ni\'f1o weather pattern, which brings devastating droughts or catastrophic floods to different areas of the globe, has hurt crop development in key production areas of Sudan and increased the risk of below-average yields. \"

The Reverend Val Bexon walked more than 200 miles from London to Paris, arriving on the eve of the United Nations Climate Change conference . She joined thousands of others taking part in the Pilgrimage to Paris initiative to call for world leaders to agree upon agreement to reduce carbon emissions. As the rector of the Ermin West Benefice, she covers nine churches in Cirencester, Gloucester and Stroud. Her team began their two-week pilgrimage - organised by The Church of England, and charities Christian Aid, CAFOD and Tearfund - with a service in St Martin's Church in Trafalgar Square on November 13. Sleeping on floors and with the occasional host family, the modern-day pilgrims walked an average of 15 miles a day with only one day off to catch their ferry as they converged on the French capital. They arrived in Paris on November 27, amid heightened security, but were able to enjoy a multi-faith meeting the next day and hand a petition inscribed with 1,780,528 signatures to the executive secretary of the UN conference. It was marvellous,"" said Val. ""There were leaders from every religion there. It was a very serious presentation. ""But then they brought on a young pop singer and all the faith leaders started dancing together on-stage. It was bizarre but it was a lovely way to end it. ""I hope the march will show that people are serious about wanting change. It is not something we can deal with in the future - we either deal with it now or it becomes a lot worse."" Nearly 200 countries took part in tense negotiations in the French capital over two weeks, striking the first deal to commit all nations to cut emissions. World leaders also agreed to review progress every five years and provide $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries. The agreement - which is partly legally binding and partly voluntary - will come into being in 2020. \"
"COP21","UK","COP21_UK358","COP21: Paris agreement formally adopted","FT.com"," ","Envoys in Paris have agreed an international accord to limit greenhouse gas emissions that marks a turning point in more than 20 years of efforts to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Delegates from nearly 200 nations cheered and embraced each other on the floor of the convention centre hall at Le Bourget airport, north of the city centre, as Laurent Fabius, French foreign minister, declared the new pact had been formally adopted just before 7.30pm in Paris. John Kerry, US secretary of state, said:  This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizens . . . It is a victory for all of the planet and for future generations . . . I know that all of us will be better off for the agreement we have finalised here today. Xie Zhenhua, China\' s chief climate negotiator, hailed the agreement as a  milestone in the global efforts to respond to climate change , even if it was not perfect and contained  some areas in need of improvement . The new pact, to be known as the Paris agreement, for the first time requires virtually every country in the world to set out its plans to avert climate change every five years. It includes an objective to HYPERLINK http://ig.ft.com/sites/climate-change-calculator/ limit global warming To meet these temperature targets, the draft says countries should aim to reach a  global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and  achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century . The text does not define precisely what this means but scientists said it suggested that after 2050, countries could not emit more carbon dioxide  the greenhouse gas produced by burning fossil fuels  than could be absorbed by forests and other carbon  sinks . President Fran\'e7ois Hollande became the first leader to act on the new agreement, committing France to a revision of its national climate targets before 2020. He said the country would  work with all parties who want to scale up ambition pre-2020\' \' , and that he would also form a coalition of countries on carbon pricing. Other delegates Gurdial Nijar, the Malaysian delegate who is the head of the Like Minded grouping of developing countries that includes Saudi Arabia, said he was  very happy .  It is like going to a good restaurant, he said.  You may not like all the dishes but in the end it leaves a nice taste in your mouth. Prakash Javadekar, Indian environment minister, also hailed the accord.  Today is a historic day, he said.  It is not only an agreement, but we have written a new chapter of hope in the lives of 7bn people on the planet. However, others were not so satisfied. Nur Masripatin, lead negotiator for Indonesia, said Jakarta was disappointed with the finance.  It\' s very weak, he said.  The deal is not fair . . . But we don\' t have more time, we have to agree on what we have now. Edna Molewa, South African environmental minister and chair of the G77 and China group of emerging market nations, gave the agreement a cautious welcome:  The deal is not perfect . . . but the best we can get at this historic moment Business reaction The accord was hailed as a significant step by many businesses.  We welcome the Paris outcome as a historic milestone on the road to a more sustainable global economy, said Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of the HSBC banking group. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, praised the agreement as  an unequivocal signal to the business and financial communities that would drive real economic change.  The billions of dollars pledged by developed countries will be matched with the trillions of dollars that will flow to low-carbon investment, he said, predicting the move by hundreds of businesses to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy would  become the norm for hundreds of thousands . Environmental groups While dozens of environmental groups welcomed the pact, some expressed reservations.  This climate deal falls far short of the soaring rhetoric from world leaders less than two weeks ago, said Craig Bennett, chief executive of UK campaign group Friends of the Earth, referring to the heads of state who opened the two-week Paris meeting on November 30.  An ambition to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C is all very well but we still don\' t have an adequate global plan to make this a reality. However, this is still a historic moment. This summit clearly shows that fossil fuels have had their day. Letter in response to this report: Climate accord is a global \' code red\' / From Paul Hohnen \"

Coinciding with the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this week, EcoSutton has called for air quality monitors to be installed on key roads and by schools in a bid to improve the air and reduce respiratory conditions. EcoSutton submitted a 190-signature petition to Birmingham City Council, with the help of Sutton Vesey councillor, Rob Pocock, on Tuesday (December 1) for air monitors on roads and they would like to see them in Birmingham Road, Boldmere Road and Brassington Avenue in the Royal town. Katherine Taylor, secretary with the EcoSutton group said: ""Our specific target this year has been air pollution. Our air pollution petition has requested an increase in air quality monitors on main roads and near schools, and for the results to be put in the public domain. ""We are also asking the council to publish its plans to improve our air quality given that an estimated 520 people per year are dying in Birmingham because of respiratory conditions."" Cllr Pocock said: ""The EcoSutton campaign have done a fantastic job in raising the signatures and drawing attention to the fact that air pollution is a local problem in Sutton Coldfield as well as a global issue. ""We have hotspots of poor air quality, around major road junctions like Birmingham Road at the Horse and Jockey, Beggars Bush, the town centre bus stops, and congested spots such as Reddicap and Whitehouse Common. ""I'm delighted to have had the chance to present their petition, and it was good to see this has been a cross-party initiative involving Conservative councillors as well as myself. ""We are all at risk and we need united action to deal with the problem."" \"

At COP23, Canada will continue to work with other countries to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement.In Bonn, all international partners will need to commit to further invest in solutions that build climate resilience and lower emissions. And parties will continue to advance key aspects of the Paris Agreement, related to mitigation, adaptation, transparency, and carbon markets.Working with partners at COP23, Canada will push for global efforts to phase out coal-fired electricity. This action not only reduces emissions and smog, which choke many cities, but also reduces the number of premature deaths, cases of asthma, and emergency-room visits. We will also continue to support the engagement of Indigenous Peoples in climate policy and encourage the development of a gender-action plan.Earlier this week, Canada became one of the first countries to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which will phase down powerful greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Each year, HFC sources emit the carbon-dioxide equivalent that is released by 300 coal-fired power plantsand by reducing these emissions, we make significant progress toward the Paris Agreement and help limit the future impacts of climate change.This year's conference is the first ever to be led by one of the small island developing statesa group of countries particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and other impacts of climate change. Canada strongly supports Fiji's leadership as COP23 president, and it has provided $1.4 million to help the country carry out this important role.Quotes""Canada will work with global partners at this year's United Nations climate negotiations toward the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a global challenge that demands a global response. But it's also an opportunity. Today, Canadian governments and businesses are well positioned to seize the economic opportunities of a clean-growth economy. In doing so, we will support a healthier planet for our children and grandchildren.""Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeQuick FactsThe Paris Agreement helped open up nearly $23 trillion in new opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets, between now and 2030.Canada has committed $2.65 billion by 2020 to help developing countries transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies.\l"

Among the delegates, organizations and other attendees were members from the Climate and Development Lab at Brown.The conference stretched from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17, with six of the 12 undergraduate students in the CDL going the first week and the other six going the second, said Julianna Bradley '17.5, one of the students in the CDL. Preparation for the conference took place largely in the class ENVS 1575: ""Engaged Climate Policy at the UN Climate Change Talks,"" which was taught by J. Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and co-founder and co-director of the CDL, said Emma Bouton '20, another student in the CDL. Students had a set of core readings, which included topics such as the history of the climate talks, climate vulnerability and financing, gender and loss and damage, said Stacy-Ann Robinson, postdoctoral research associate and member of the CDL. Students also worked on individual and group projects, she said.The students spent their time at COP23 working on ""embedded"" projects with organizations assigned to them before COP23. For Bradley, this meant working with Oxfam America, an organization that aims to reduce poverty. Oxfam sent delegates from their climate subsection to COP23, and Bradley attended negotiations for them, taking notes so she could report back. For Bouton, this meant working with the Global Island Partnership, for which she would attend events and work with social media. Other students worked with groups such as the United Nations Development Programme, Climate Home, the chair of the Least Developed Countries and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development.The students also worked on independent projects while at COP23. Each student focused on a specific issue, deciding which negotiations and events to attend and which people to contact. Bradley's project involved working with a group called Climate Home and looking at cities' participation in meeting U.S. climate agreements.Bradley said approaching and interacting with people involved in climate action was one of the best parts of COP23. Though there was a hierarchy with pink-badged ""delegates"" holding higher positions than yellow-badged ""observers,"" it was not rigid. ""Anyone would talk to anyone,"" she said.

(Photo by Spielvogel/ Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International) Latin American countries, regions and cities demonstrated clear ambition and leadership at the United Nations (COP23) held in Bonn, Germany over the past two weeks. Their progress appeared in the form of national commitments, participation in global coalitions, subnational action plans, and international awards. With every year, Latin America increasingly appears as a regional leader in efforts to halt and adapt to the warming planet. Several specific countries are playing leading roles and standing out for their work among other developing nations around the world. Here are just a few highlights from this year's COP:1.\~Latin America's cities and countries participated in global alliances.Mexico\~and\~Costa Rica\~joined 23 other countries in signing on to\~a new global coalition[1] committed to phasing out coal\~and supporting clean power policies and investments, while restricting financing for coal plants[2].\~Launched by Canada and the UK, the Powering Past Coal[3]\~alliance hopes to expand its membership from 25 to 50 countries by next year's COP. The coalition's members will share experiences, lessons learned and best practices on diverse strategies to phase out coal. Buenos Aires,\~Caracas,\~Mexico City,\~Quito,\~Rio de Janeiro, and\~Santiago de Chile\~were\~among 25 global cities that committed to develop and implement more ambitious climate action plans before 2020[4]. These cities -members of the C40 aim to use these plans to meet their emissions reductions goals and build more climate resilient cities. The results of these actions are expected to\~bring social, economic and environmental benefits to the nearly 150 million citizens[5]\~who live in the 25 participating cities.2.\~Latin American efforts awarded for being innovative and forward-thinking.Young scientists from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in\~Colombia won the Momentum for Change award at COP23[6], for their innovative use of information technology and communications to create new ideas. The scientists analyzed meteorological data to understand how climate variation was affecting rice agriculture in the country. Realizing that a drought was imminent, they recommended that 170 local rice producers change their sowing season, thereby helping them avoid US$3.6 million dollars in economic losses. One\~Ecuadorian\~initiative,\~Sustainable Agriculture with Inclusion and Participation of Gender[7] received the Impulse for Change award, granted by the UN to exemplary solutions for climate change in the world. The project supports families in the Metropolitan Area of Quito to give them access to 2,500 new urban gardens, creating 110 agricultural microenterprises, educating about climate change and prioritizing the presence of women as leaders (85.7 percent out of the 56,000 participants).3.\~Countries highlighted the importance of addressing gender in climate action.Following on a similar note as the previous summary,\~Costa Rica\~celebrated the\~approval of a Gender Action Plan[8], which the Foreign Ministry hailed as £ triumph for all women and girls on the planet.' As the coordinator and spokesperson on behalf of the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), Costa Rica sought to empower women and girls to achieve gender parity in representation within the Convention's negotiation process, as well as providing an adequate means of implementing mandates of the more than 60 resolutions that address the issue of gender. Indigenous women[9]\~were recognized at COP23 on Gender Day for their demands to stop illegal land titling that exacerbates the risks and disasters resulting from climate change. Sonia Guajajara of\~Brazil\~criticized Amazonian governments' extractivist economic model that prioritizes soy monocrops and mining, which become greenwashed as sustainable despite the major threat of deforestation. Ruth Flores, an Aymara leader from Puno,\~Perustated, 'We women are the ones who collect the seeds. We are the guardians of the hills and the water. And now we are the ones that face climate change.'4.\~National governments stand by -and increase- their climate commitments.Argentina\~proposed an\~increased unconditional goal of reducing emissions 18 percent by 2030[10], with a potential of reducing an additional 19 percent conditional upon international funding and technical assistance. The country plans to focus on improving energy efficiency and renewable energy generation, the conservation and restoration of forests, and transportation solutions to reach those goals. The\~Dominican Republic\~submitted its Third National Communication on Climate Change to the United Nations[11]. Officials from the National Council for Climate Change and Clean Development Mechanism and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources delivered the document to Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change, and underscored some of the actions that the Caribbean country is already taking to combat and adapt to climate change.5.\~Sub-national governments in the region took the spotlight.The Argentine province of\~Santa Fe\~presented its climate change priorities at an event for sub-national COP participants[12]. In his remarks, the Provincial Undersecretary for Renewable Energy, Maximiliano Neri, highlighted the connections between climate-inducing pollution and human health. Santa Fe's representatives also proposed bringing the rest of Argentina's provinces into the\~Under2 Coalition[13], a forum of 205 states, regions and provinces representing almost 40 percent of the world's economy who are working together on climate. Another member of the Under2 Coalition, the Mexican state of\~Yucat\'e1n,\~shared its experiences working to fight climate change at the subnational event in Bonn[14]. In particular, the state has focused on coastal recovery, encouraging biodigesters in the swine industry, reducing carbon emissions in the public sector, and restoring wetlands to improve 'blue carbon' reserves. It is no surprise that the region is taking a leadership role in global climate conversations, as Latin American countries are among some of the most vulnerable to climate impacts and most are already feeling the pains of the warming planet. Catastrophic droughts, floods and storms hit many countries hard, in 2017 costing untold dollars and, tragically, human lives.

Representing global youth constituencies at the high-level segment at the Conference of the Parties (COP23) in Bonn, Germany, Nov. 6-17, the student delivered a strong statement to the convention delegates as they negotiated and wrestled with climate change.  In the past, you\' ve never stopped promising action, Obanor said.  But there is no need to keep talking endlessly in closed rooms, if you don\' t face up to reality and act accordingly. Distinguished delegates, it is your choice if you want future generations to remember you as heroes of the century. For the past 12 years, youth and college students have participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference at the COP negotiations. Obanor interned last summer at the Business Environment Council, an environmental nongovernmental organization based in Hong Kong, where she participated in high-stakes meetings on energy efficiency and finance with United Nations and international banking officials. In Bonn, she reiterated to the delegates:  You must commit to pre-2020 action. At this very moment, people are suffering and dying from the impacts of climate change. The only option we have is to act now. The climate crisis is a new frontier for human rights. Take your responsibility seriously. In a call to end fossil fuel infrastructure expansion, Obanor said:  People around the world are demanding a just transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy. We urge the parties to make their future investments in clean sectors. Any new development, jobs and investment done in the fossil fuel industry will be wasted anyway \- when we start taking the Paris Agreement seriously. Among the events that Mitchell Lee \' 19 attended was a youth empowerment program, where he spoke to the Chinese and Mexican delegations.  My conversations were a great way to gain an international perspective on climate change. It was sobering and fascinating, Lee said. Jake Pero \' 18 described the COP23  wild ride as exhilarating but sleep depriving. By happenstance, Pero attended a climate smart solutions panel where he listened to Jared Snyder \' 81, deputy commissioner of air resources, climate change and energy for New York\' s Department of Environmental Conservation. Pero interned with the Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions (CICCS) over the summer, where he worked to build local awareness of DEC\' s Climate Smart Communities program that incentivizes cities and towns to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and build resiliency.  After the panel, I told Mr. Snyder that I was working on a climate change program with CICCS and shared that I was a Cornell undergraduate, to which he replied, \' I was once one of those too,\'  Pero said. Cornell faculty and staff attending the COP23 conference were Glen Dowell, associate professor, Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management; Robert Howarth, the David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology; Ellen Leventry, marketing and communications director, Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future; Natalie Mahowald, the Irving Porter Church Professor of Engineering in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; Erika Styger, associate director of International Programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; and Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor and David Croll Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Support was provided by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future and CICSS, while the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs, and an Engaged Cornell grant helped cover the students\' travel funding.

As stated by one of the panellist Theo de Jorge: ""there is no agriculture without land rights and water access rights.""Climate change adaptation in agriculture will be driven by growing pressure on water and land, and the food production will have to keep up with increasing demand. ""We need to produce 60% more food by 2025"" said Alan Nicol, Strategic Program Leader, Promoting Sustainable Growth, International Water Management Institute (IWMI). ""Managing agricultural water availability access and use is key to success"" he added. He presented innovations in water management and highlighted challenges in their deployment.""Climate change will increase food prices and increasing food prices worsens extreme poverty"" Jan Low, 2016 World Food Prize co-laureate and Co-leader of the Sweet potato for Profit and Health Initiative, International Potato Center (CIP) said. She made a presentation on whether non-GMO climate-smart crops can sustain small-scale farming, drawing from her experience in Africa with the Sweet potato for Profit and Health Initiative at the International Potato Center. ""To adapt to climate change we need to produce more adapted crops faster at times under tougher environments and we need to produce more with less water."" she continued.James Kinyangi, African Development Bank' s Chief Climate Change and Policy Advisor remarked that agriculture remains a major source of income in Africa. However, its untapped potential has resulted in widespread chronic poverty and food insecurity. ""In Africa 61% of the total employment is in agriculture."" Kinyangi emphasized that a supporting enabling environment in Africa includes risk management, asset protection and the inclusion of women and youth, through greater access to agricultural finance. He affirmed that the Bank is giving much attention to the development of agribusiness as a significant proportion of 70 million new jobs by 2020 will be created in the agricultural sector in Africa. He identified conditions that have to be set to enable the supporting environment for smallholder farmers in Africa.The session was part of initiative: Agriculture Advantage: The case for climate action in agriculture.\l"

Weather observation networks are inadequate in many African countries.A ministerial event at the United Nations climate change conference, COP23CREWS aims to mobilize US$100 million by 2020 and is designed to achieve a key target of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the global plan for reducing disaster losses, namely to ""substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.""""In the Paris Agreement era, it is unacceptable that populations are not forewarned of an impending weather disaster. Let us now reinforce support for CREWS, launched in Paris at COP21, to enable the most vulnerable to benefit from effective early warning systems,"" said Mr. Nicolas Hulot, the French Minister for Ecology.CREWS action in Niger, Burkina Faso and the Pacific Region in support of operational hydro-meteorological forecasts and early warning services was highlighted with a special focus on early warnings for agriculture and civil protection.""In 2012 Niger suffered the worst floods for 40 years, and this year over 100 people have died due to flooding. In the past, information and warnings was not accessible to the people living in exposed neighbourhoods. We have received funding from CREWS in order to improve early warnings so we can inform people of the risks. We are really happy about this support,"" said Laouan Magagi, Minister for Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management in Niger.In the Pacific, CREWS is strengthening hydro-meteorological and early warning services for islands including Fiji, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue and Tuvalu, Samoa, Tonga, Palau, Nauru, Marshall Islands and Tokelau.The CREWS Steering Committee last week approved a new project, ""Weather and Climate Early Warning System for Papua New Guinea."" It aims to improve control and maintenance of the existing drought and flood monitoring network and provide tailored early warnings for the agriculture sector and disaster managers, with an investment totaling US$1,650,000.The Steering Committee also approved a project for the Caribbean to review the effectiveness of the early warning systems for the recent hurricanes Irma and Maria.

And estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20 percent by 2050.Graziano da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time are also major drivers of climate change.Adopting climate-smart agricultural practicesAt least one fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, Graziano da Silva noted.Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, the FAO Director-General said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others.""We cannot expect that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists ...can tackle these challenges on their own,"" and they will need national and international support, he added.""Reducing deforestation; restoring degraded lands and forests; eliminating food loss and waste; enhancing soil carbon sequestration; low-carbon livestock - these are only a few known solutions to address hunger, poverty and sustainability at the same time,"" Graziano da Silva explained.He noted in particular, that while livestock emits more greenhouse gas than other food sources, ""low carbon livestock is possible,"" - for example, FAO estimates that readily available improved husbandry practices can reduce emissions by 20 to 30 percent.FAO's work includes supporting countries in sustainably improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries monitor their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and that technical and financial support is needed to turn these commitments into reality.At COP23\l"

Brown Jr., D-Calif., issued the following news release:In forceful remarks before the Baden-Wurttemberg State Parliament and nearly three hours of wide-ranging debate and dialogue with members of the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today forged closer ties with European leaders committed to climate action and blasted the ""denialists"" who continue to reject the scientific consensus on global warming.""We have to wake up - wake up Europe, wake up America, wake up the whole world to realize we have a common destiny and we are all human beings on this one planet,"" said Governor Brown in his address to the state parliament of Baden-Wurttemberg, co-founder of the Under2 Coalition. ""This is daunting but it's also an opportunity to pull people together.""From Stuttgart, Germany, the Governor traveled to Brussels, Belgium, where he joined dozens of members of the European Parliament's top climate and environmental committee and the leaders of the Parliament's political parties for more than three hours of debate and discussion on climate change, its impacts, and opportunities for further collaboration. During the final hour of the exchange, the Governor confronted several members that used their remarks to openly question the science of climate change.""The truth is that any kind of catalogue of the scientific community indicates that climate change is real, it's having impacts. Even the Trump administration couldn't, with a straight face, curb a report that underscores the very opposite of what you denialists have expressed here,"" said Governor Brown during the discussion with the European Parliament Conference of Presidents. ""With the denialists getting more attention, the people, instead of growing in their skepticism, are growing in their conviction that climate change and global warming are real matters - and we have to deal with them.""Tomorrow, the Governor will conclude his visit to Brussels with a moderated conversation hosted by the German Marshall Fund.

Brown Jr., The State of California has issued the following news release: Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of this year's United Nations (COP 23) by the Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama - incoming president of COP 23 - today at a ceremony where Fiji became the latest government to join the Under2 Coalition. Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee - members of the Under2 Coalition and U.S. Climate Alliance - also attended today's ceremony and announced that they too will attend the COP 23 in Bonn, Germany to represent subnational jurisdictions committed to climate action. ""California is proud to partner with Fiji, an island nation that is experiencing firsthand the impacts of climate change and this year is the leader of the UN Conference of Parties,"" said Governor Jerry Brown. ""I look forward to taking the next step later this year with Governor Kate Brown and Governor Jay Inslee when we join Prime Minister Bainimarama in Bonn to show that states and regions will fulfill the Paris commitment."" The Under2 Coalition is an international pact among cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius - the level of potentially catastrophic consequences - by either reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels or holding emissions to less than 2 annual metric tons per capita by 2050. With the addition of Fiji, the coalition now includes 176 jurisdictions on six continents collectively representing more than 36 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and over 39 percent of the global economy. ""As the incoming President of COP 23, Fiji looks forward to working with this group of states and regions in the global effort to advance climate action at every level of society. This is true now more than ever following the Trump Administration's announcement that the U.S. will be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. This decision has redoubled our commitment to forge a Grand Coalition that includes all levels of government, businesses and civil society, to take climate action forward with the urgency it deserves,"" said Prime Minister Bainimarama. ""We look forward Governor Brown's help in mobilising like-minded leaders from around the world in support of our goal to achieve concrete outcomes at COP 23."" At today's ceremony, Washington Governor Inslee and Oregon Governor Brown also announced that they will attend the as part of a delegation of U.S. governors that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a partnership formed in response to the White House's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. The alliance now includes 13 U.S. states - led by both Democrats and Republicans - committed to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. The U.S. Climate Alliance complements the goals of the Under2 Coalition, which nine climate alliance members have also joined. ""The 'America First' doctrine should put our children first. Future generations will judge us not on the facts of global climate change, but what we've done to tackle it. Strengthening the commitment to combat climate change sends a strong message to our global allies. The Paris Agreement is a blueprint from job creation and prosperity, and despite the decision by the White House to retreat, I will continue to work with leaders on the West Coast, across the country, and around the world in pursuit of greenhouse gas reduction goals and working toward the development of a greener, cleaner energy mix of the future,"" said Oregon Governor Kate Brown. ""The growing momentum for national and subnational collaboration gives me confidence about our ability to defeat climate change. This is an all-comers race against time, and I'm proud that Washington state is racing shoulder-to-shoulder with our West Coast neighbors, and our neighbors around the globe,"" said U.S. Climate Alliance co-chair Governor Inslee. California's legislative leaders, Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Le\'f3n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, share a strong commitment to climate action and also joined today's event. ""Here in California we have been leaders in developing the green economy that is proving that a healthy environment and good jobs can go hand in hand. We also recognize in California that climate change affects the quality of life and the public health in all our communities and in all countries around the world, so our climate actions must benefit all communities and all countries.

Sena welcomed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's remarks at the conference stressing greater focus on five action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership.Sena noted that the outcomes from Bonn are especially important in showing continued international commitment to climate progress in light of the decision announced by United States President Donald Trump last June to pull the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord.""Despite the disappointing decision by President Trump earlier this year to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, it is reassuring that so many world leaders - and also leaders on the state and local levels in the U.S. - are committed to continuing the pursuit of carbon reduction strategies,"" Sena said. ""I welcome the outcomes of the COP23 and I strongly urge all OSCE participating States to continue moving forward in addressing climate change, which must be seen as not only an environmental challenge but a security threat as well.""She applauded the COP23 initiative of more than 20 countries - including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Finland, and Austria - who joined the ""Powering Past Coal"" alliance, promising to phase out traditional coal power plants and cease all investment in coal domestically or abroad. Two U.S. states - Washington and Oregon - also joined the accord, Sena noted.She also said that it was encouraging to see participation at the COP23 by a coalition of more than 2,500 mayors, governors and others from across the United States who on 11 November released the ""America's Pledge"" report, outlining the scope of non-federal climate action in the U.S. following the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.""Considering the dire situation we face in terms of rising sea levels, intensified heat waves, droughts, forest fires, and stronger storms, it is clear that we need an all-hands-on-deck approach that utilizes innovation and creative thinking to move towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy,"" Sena said.At the OSCE PA Annual Session last July, parliamentarians adopted the Minsk Declaration, which ""urges all OSCE participating States to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis and its related challenges"" and calls on all OSCE countries ""to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change [and] to fulfill their obligations under the agreement.""Nilza Sena was elected Chair of the OSCE PA's Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment at the 2016 Annual Session in Tbilisi and was reelected in Minsk.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 20, 2017.Contact: Nat Parry, head of communications and press, +45 33 37 80 40, (c) +45 60 10 81 77, HYPERLINK mailto:nat@oscepa.dknat@oscepa.dkCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6082626 MSTRUCK\l"

Increasing public and private investment in the transition to clean energy and transport, in restoring forested areas, and in more sustainable cities demonstrate that significant inroads towards tackling climate change are being made at the national and local level. Countries are also reaffirming their commitment to climate action as a priority - both at home and internationally -including support for the Paris Agreement demonstrated at the\~G7[5]\~and\~G20[6]\~summits and at the\~African Ministerial Conference on the Environment\~[7](AMCEN). Steady progress, however, is not enough. Global greenhouse gas emissions need to start coming down quickly, peaking by 2020 and getting to net-zero by 2050, in order to meet the Paris goal of keeping global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and optimally1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels. That means there is a small window of opportunity left to make the low-carbon transition in ways that are economically and technically manageable given the options we have today. COP23 must continue to strengthen an international climate regime that sends the right market signals, reaffirms support for more ambitious and transformational implementation, raises awareness of the growing impacts of climate change, and mobilizes an ever greater number of players to act now before it is too late to avoid the most severe consequences of a changing climate.

The Loss and Damage Mechanism was commenced to address the implementation of approaches which would tackle loss and damage associated with ""the adverse effects of climate change"". Initiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main functions of this mechanism are the following three (UNFCCC, 2017):Enhancing knowledge and understanding of comprehensive risk management approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.Strengthening dialogue, coordination, coherence and synergies among relevant stakeholders.Enhancing action and support, including finance, technology and capacity-building, to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.Two years later on December 2015, we saw the formation of the Paris Agreement on COP 21. Article 8 of the Paris agreement focused on loss and damage. It again recognized the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with ""the adverse effects of climate change"" which included extreme weather events and slow onset events. It also expressed intention to promote the understanding, action and support among parties and emphasized on the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage (COP 21, 2015). But to be honest, these achievements have mostly become throwback meeting minutes for people in high tables. The real solutions still hasn't come from these initiatives which was initially anticipated.Neither the Paris Agreement nor the COP decisions had any specific direction regarding any financial support for loss and damage. It was merely suggested that the parties should increase support for loss and damage. In fact, paragraph 52 of the COP decision is similar to an ""exclusion clause"" which states that ""provisions defined in article 8 of the agreement do not include or are a basis for liability or compensation."" (K\'fcnzel, Sch\'e4fer, Minninger, & Baldrich, 2017) This obviously didn't get a warm welcome from the affected parties who expected more from the countries mainly responsible for rapid climate change.The major instrument discussed by the WIM so far to address the issue of loss and damage is climate risk insurance. The idea is that it will serve as a facilitative mechanism for support against the loss of assets, livelihoods and lives caused by climate change. But as the global climate change-induced disasters are on the rise, how this instrument will sustain in the long run remains a topic of contention (Thomas et al., 2017).In just July this year, unusual heavy floods have resulted in the death of more than 1,200 people and it affected the lives of 43 million people in Bangladesh, Nepal and India. Pakistan was also the victim of an ominous monsoon cyclone which killed 16 and affected millions. These extreme weather events in South Asia are predicted to rise as the global temperature continues to hike (GBSNP Varma, 2015). In fact, it has been projected that South Asia will be among the worst affected regions to be devastated by climate change (Eckstein, K\'fcnzel, & Sch\'e4fer, 2017). In a region where a quarter of the world's population lives, how the insurance mechanism will work after a major climate-change induced disaster is not clear.Following COP 19 and the Paris Agreement, this year's COP (COP 23 in Bonn) was started with the hope of a more definite and practical addressing to ""Loss and Damage"". Affected parties really wanted something meaningful to happen. But, ultimately, there were no real outcome on this at the end of the conference. Many climate vulnerable countries which includes island nations and developing countries, was hoping to get permanent and secure monetary support for their adaptation programs to mitigate the loss and damages, but the developed countries seemed to have found a way to not reach a consensus on this issue in COP 23 (Saiful Islam, 2017).Instead, the latest conference in Bonn appeared to have gain an altogether different purpose than intended, which is the promotion of the concept of a clearing house. Clearing house for risk transfer is basically a repository of information on insurance and related subjects. Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid International said a harsh truth about the Clearing house to an interview on the third pole. He commented, ""All this fanfare about the clearinghouse is actually just about a matchmaking website that can help private companies meet more clients."" He also expressed concern about the efforts and money of developed countries in this cause, which, in his opinion are ultimately helping private companies make profit from selling insurance to the poor (The Third Pole, 2017).This is indeed disappointing for the affected countries and regions like South Asia but they have to be determined and resilient as ever. It will be important to note that apart from the clearing houses, some of the best practices identified by the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (ExCom) include ideas like comprehensive risk management capacity with risk pooling and transfer, contingency finance, climate-themed bonds, catastrophe bonds and financing approaches to make development climate more resilient (K\'fcnzel et al., 2017).Affected countries and regions have to think about other innovative means of addressing Loss and Damage. Several actors have indeed come up with some innovative financial means for addressing this pressing issue. Germanwatch compiled a list of innovative solutions suggested from around the world (K\'fcnzel et al., 2017), they are:Financial Transaction Tax (FTT): This proposes a fee on transactions and trades such as bonds, stocks and currencies. Proponents say that it could generate a significant amount of money. But there remains some practical challenges when it comes to the implementation of this idea.International Airl"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA36","Taking stock at COP23","November 10, 2017 Friday","US Official News","Washington: Green Building Council has issued the following news release: This week unveils not only Greenbuild Boston, but also the start of the two-week long 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ). Nations of the world, along with local government, states, businesses and organizations, are gathering in Bonn, Germany. From the U.S., the federal government will participate despite signaling intent to withdraw, as it remains a party to the underlying convention and cannot withdraw from the Paris Agreement for several years. marks the second meeting since the conference achieved the first-ever global consensus for climate action through the Paris Agreement, which remains a groundbreaking accomplishment. With Paris, 180 countries acknowledged that humans are a cause of climate change and that collective action should be undertaken to keep the planet\' s warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Taking stock of our progress Cumulatively, all the countries\' pledges do not add up to the below-2-degree scenario, and the Paris Agreement calls for national governments to submit a new round of nationally determined contributions in 2020. Critical to informing these pledges is a large part of the formal COP23 negotiations that aim to develop a Paris Agreement rule book and to agree on details for the  Facilitative Dialogue process that will occur in 2018. The Facilitative Dialogue is the first check on how the parties are progressing against their pledges, and includes a special Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on the pathways to 1.5 degrees. The dialogue will support increased ambition and lead into the ""Global Stocktake,"" to be conducted every five years. In addition to mitigation of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, other issues to be discussed at will include technology, capacity-building support, adaptation and finance. The submitted nationally determined contribution pledged by the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is at least 26\- 28 percent below 2005 levels, to be achieved by 2025. Estimates show that we are already about halfway to that goal, with 2016 carbon emissions hitting a 25-year low. A federal research report released earlier this year also found that U.S. emission growth rates slowed as the economy became less carbon-intensive, although the slowing is not yet sufficient to meet the long-term, 2-degree goal of the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, the U.S. Climate Alliance reported last month that its member states are on the path to meet their share of the nation\' s Paris Agreement commitment; and the America\' s Pledge initiative is undertaking an analysis of the collective impact of the commitments made by U.S. states, cities and businesses. Building sector intensity declining, total area growing How does the building sector fit in? The latest data indicate that buildings are currently responsible for about one-third of global energy consumption, and about 30 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions and 20 percent of total CO2 emissions. Building energy intensity has been improving, notably from improvements in building envelope, energy efficiency and electrification offsetting more carbon-intensive energy choices. These improvements are more than offset, however, by increases in the total amount of building space driven by both per capita increases and population growth. Global energy demand in buildings could actually increase by 50 percent by 2050 without improvement. To align with the Paris Agreement goals, it is projected that we need to decrease the average energy intensity of the global building stock by 80 percent by 2050 through low- and zero-carbon strategies. Due to the work of many in the green building community, with projects demonstrating new technologies, achieving LEED Platinum and net zero energy status, we know this is technically possible; now, we need to accelerate efforts to bring these practices to scale. From major corporations with large real estate portfolios to small design firms, the private sector plays an essential role in reducing the carbon footprint of buildings. Companies throughout the building and real estate sectors are making a difference investing in efficiency and renewable energy, acting on commitments and expanding products and services to drive improvement in buildings and positively impact communities. USGBC at COP23USGBC is committed to elevating the role of green buildings and green communities as a critical part of mitigating climate change. As the leading source for green building information, education and certification, USGBC will use its presence at COP23 to highlight LEED as the global leadership standard for green buildings and to connect with attendees on policy approaches for green and net zero buildings.

The 23rd in Bonn will take place from 6 to 17 November 2017. Marco Dus, member of the Vittorio Veneto Municipal Council presented his upcoming opinion on financing climate action. Dus stressed the urgency to develop innovating financing schemes to facilitate cities and regions access to funding. The rapporteur recalled that 'it is essential to mobilise sufficient financial resources to turn the Paris commitments into practice'.About his upcoming opinion on climate finance, Dus said 'The opinion addresses the key strengths and limitations of the existing financing instruments. It formulates proposals on how to make the financing system more solid and more easily accessible to cities and regions. This opinion will represent the CoR's position on climate finance and will be defended at the upcoming COP23 in Bonn'.The event 'Enhancing the potential of climate action partnerships' has been organised by the International Climate Governance Coalition, a joint venture of the European Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Comite 21 the French Committee for Sustainable Development . Their ultimate objective goal is the development of a new multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.Brenda King , member of the EESC and President of the Sustainable Development Observatory joined Dus in Agadir. King said: 'Policy-makers are still unaware of the potential of civil society in climate action. The EESC has the priority to demonstrate the potential of non-state actors to significantly contribute to meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as well as to point to the obstacles and conditions for success of effective multi-stakeholder and multi-level governance cooperation'. These objectives are gathered in the EESC opinion ' coalition to deliver the commitments of the Paris Agreement ' adopted in July 2016.Marco Dus also presented the provisional findings of the Coalition's mapping report of multi-level and multi-stakeholders governance of climate change. The following factors proved to be particularly important: political commitment as a key to make public funds available and facilitate access to it; clear legal frameworks that reduce uncertainty and build trust between partners; adaptive and flexible management approaches; and public awareness and community involvement. Dus called the audience in Agadir to provide comments and contributions to the report which final version will be available for COP23 in Bonn.The International Climate Governance Coalition is to deliver practical solutions to boost climate action: a toolbox for climate partnerships, recommendations on climate finance, examples for scaling, replicating and extending adaptation and mitigation projects and support for the creation of new multi-stakeholder platforms dedicated to climate and sustainable development.Note: The Climate Chance Summit brings together a large majority of non-state actors worldwide upstream of the UN Climate Conferences. It provides an opportunity to discuss thematic coalitions, share best practices and concrete actions and measures put in place by these actors to combat climate change ahead of the COP climate talks.

In the face of skyrocketing costs, new forms of financial protection have become an increasingly urgent part of the climate change discussion.The InsuResilience Global Partnership is a major scaling-up of an initiative started by the G7 in 2015 under the German Presidency. It aims at meeting the pledge of providing cover and support to an extra 400 million vulnerable people by 2020.The Global Partnership now brings together G20 countries in partnership with the so called 'V20' nations, a group of 49 of the most vulnerable countries including small islands like Fiji, which holds the Presidency of COP23.""The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change,"" said the COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama.This announcement on climate risk insurance was made a day before the high-level segment of COP23, which Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General, Antnio Guterres, are expected to attend.Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to the German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support of 125 million dollar for the new Global Partnership as part of the launch. This follows the 30 million commitment to the initiative made by the British Government in July 2017.""Climate risk insurance is a response to the simple fact that extreme weather events are constantly increasing in number and intensity, and also a response to our experience that the international community and the countries affected by extreme weather events tend to really act after those incidents occurred and they tend to come too late and to intervene not significantly enough,"" Mr. Silberhorn told a press conference.""So our intention is to act more preemptively, to act in time, and to act decisively in order to reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Insurance is one tool to address this challenge,"" he added.A partnership for climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutionsThe Global Partnership supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries needs and priorities, solutions design of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions, smart support for the implementation for such schemes and monitoring and evaluation efforts.""This new and higher ambition initiative represents one shining example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions,"" said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC).The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), for example, is being supported with the help of 'InsuResilience.' The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than $55 million was paid out to 10 Caribbean countries within 14 days of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left an arc of destruction across the region.The money was used in various ways, for example, to quickly buy urgently needed medicines and to build emergency shelters for the people affected by the storms.In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments.\l"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA44","University students reflect on attending COP23 Conference","November 21, 2017 Tuesday","Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor","Twelve students from the University of Michigan's Climate Blue organization just returned to campus after attending the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference earlier this month in Bonn, Germany. This year marked the 23rd meeting of the\~Conference of Parties, held under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the UNFCCC is an international treaty that was signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 to mark the beginning of international cooperation in addressing climate change.This year, the UNFCCC's 197 parties\~came together to discuss the implementation of the Paris agreement. The agreement, which was designed during COP21 in 2015, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb the global temperature rise. However, in June 2017, President Donald Trump announced the United States would\~withdraw\~from the agreement in an effort to preserve jobs.The\~Climate Blue\~student group,\~which discusses climate policy across southeast Michigan, began as a blog created by a delegation of University community members who attended COP15 in 2009. Today it reaches graduate students, professors and business people, among others who focus on different areas of study across the country. The organization continues to send a delegation, comprised of students and faculty, to the conference each year. The conference itself primarily consists of negotiations among parties and side events, which serve as platforms for ""observer organizations"" - like the Climate Blue delegation\~\~- who don't speak in formal negotiations, according to the UNFCCC\~website. Side event participants can engage with parties and other attendees to network and share ideas.Rackham student Matt Irish, who is studying for master's degrees in Applied Climate Science and Electrical Engineering, attended this year's conference as well as COP21. He explained at COP21 there was a lot of fanfare and excitement as national leaders came together to sign the Paris agreement; however, he said after the signing there was still work to be done.""(During COP21), the leaders came the first week actually to kind of say, 'Hey, we're here signing off on it, now make it happen,'"" he said. ""There was some real stuff that needed to get done but because they had that sort of front-loaded thing, the idea was that those national leaders put their name on it and they had it done ... since we just really wanted to agree, that was mainly all that happened. There were some really important parts of the text that were extremely vague that were left to be figured out later. This year was when that actually had to happen.""This year at COP23COP23 was an exciting opportunity to substantiate some of the more abstract concepts in the Paris agreement.Pertinent to the conference, Irish explained, was whether the United States would be involved in certain parts at all, given Trump's announcement.""What I was most excited about, personally from this last week, was that it seems to me that ... in the past it was everyone waiting - is the U.S. going to play? Is the U.S. in? The question was, what's going to happen to the world if the U.S. is in or not?"" he said. ""And now, because the Paris agreement has been signed and we're kind of past it, I feel like ... the questions is more, what's going to happen to the U.S. if the U.S. isn't in?""Rackham student Samantha Basile is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. She is the director of the Climate Blue, and attended this year's conference. Basile explained the official United States delegation was really only present in name. She said the other nations had already agreed to work without them.Basile herself spent a lot of time in negotiations, and said it was interesting to see how all of the nations' voices come together to agree on certain steps that need to be taken. She said such agreements are sometimes taken for granted.""We assume that things aren't moving fast enough and we get very frustrated as students, especially because we see, we just have so much energy and we want things to move forward,"" she said. ""So it was a little frustrating to see things get kicked down the road, but at the same time, they're keeping everyone on board and keeping everyone under a consensus vote system so it's pretty amazing that they get anything done.""Environment and Sustainability graduate student Chris Karounos is pursuing his master's degree in Environmental Informatics and Conservation Ecology. He said going into the conference he underestimated the ""goodwill"" of everyone involved in negotiations.""It seemed like everyone had their hearts in the right place and it really needed to be that way because you're in a room of at least 50 different upper-level delegates that were representing an entire country, and they all had to agree on something,"" he said.Karounos said it was rewarding to be a ""fly on the wall"" in the negotiation process.""We're really serving a purpose by being there as students,"" he said. ""(Initially), I thought it was kind of a fluff thing, but the U.N. really wants it to be a transparent process.""Environment and Sustainability graduate student Tyler Fitch explained the dynamic among conference attendees operates much like a bureaucratic power structure. He said a lot of the negotiations are closed to non-party entities and he said most delegates tend to keep to themselves. However, he said there are a lot of open discussions fostered by the side events.Some student delegations work directly with countries, taking notes for them and helping them navigate their schedules. The Climate Blue delegation, Basile explained, worked specifically with the United Nations Secretariat, which allowed them to interact with the formal process.Rackham student Cesar Luis Barraza Botet, an international student from Colombia, said he approached the Colombian delegation.Barraza Botet said the groups discussed specific topics or articles in the Paris Agreement in the plenary sessions. One article, he explained, discusses technology mechanisms, which requires the development of mitigation and adaptation technologies as well as the ability to transfer them from developed countries to developing countries.\~""It was amazing to me how they had to agree on every single word that was going into these rulebook documents,"" he said.In terms of side events, Rackham student Emily Gargulinski - who is pursuing a master's degree in the Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering department - said they took place in what is called the Bonn Zone. The zone comprised country pavilions - spaces in which each country could exhibit their culture and display their climate change initiatives. The exhibitions comprised of small booths that displayed new technology and initiatives. There were also meeting rooms that held side events on topics such as nuclear power and sustainable cities.One key component of the delegation's COP experience is the Climate Blue blog. Through their blogs, members can reflect on conference highlights.""We tried to set it up as a system where everyone could be involved, but hopefully wouldn't be overwhelmed, because we knew the negotiations would be overwhelming in itself,"" Basile said. ""Everyone participated on the Twitter, on our social media, and then our requirement was either before, during or after COP, you would write one blog kind of reflecting on a certain topic. We didn't want it to just be like a diary entry, we wanted it to have a little more of a perspective behind it.""In his\~blog, Fitch discussed the We Are Still In\~movement, which comprises cities, companies and universities that support action to implement the Paris agreement despite Trump's intent to withdraw. According to Fitch, there was a series of events related to this movement at the conference.Additionally, in October, Climate Blue and\~Michigan and The Climate Crisis\~wrote a letter to University President Mark Schlissel\~asking\~him to sign the We Are Still In pledge on behalf of the University, which he did.""I think the conference was sort of a, 'What is the next step for We Are Still In?' And frankly I don't think they know yet, but the idea is that ... the We Are Still In folks are going to keep abreast of these negotiations and continue to make climate action happen in the United States,"" he said. ""(The University of) Michigan is a part of that which means it's all the more relevant for us.""Irish explained though the United States government did not have a climate pavilion of its own at the conference this year, there was a We Are Still In pavilion area that became the United States' de facto location and was bigger than past federal pavilions.""The idea is just telling the rest of the world that we have federalism in the United States - the federal government doesn't get to call the shots on everything so in a very real sense the U.S. is 'still in,'"" he said.""The good thing is it finally helped all the countries build trust together to actually want to do something and try to make this virtuous cycle, but the bad thing is there is absolutely no guarantee that we're actually going to meet our goals,"" he said.\l"

COP23 saw key details emerge of next year's Talanoa Dialogue, which will take stock of collective efforts towards the Paris Agreement's long-term mitigation goal, and inform countries as they set their next round of NDCs.The IEA is actively engaged in tracking various underlying indicators of energy transition, through Tracking Clean Energy Progress, World Energy Investment, Energy Efficiency Indicators and key statistics, and will further enhance tracking efforts to support the Talanoa Dialogue.The IEA hosted 13 events at COP23, and IEA experts spoke in dozens of other forums. A series of key takeaways emerged from these meetings.Energy remains at the heart of addressing climate changeTransforming the way we use and produce energy remains central to determining our collective success in meeting the climate challenge. Whether discussions revolved around renewable energy, technology innovation, energy efficiency, or energy access, it was clear that accelerating energy transition is a priority for countries around the world.The energy-climate challenge is global and centrally focussed on real-world implementationThe adoption of the Paris Agreement signalled a global response to the climate challenge, with countries at all levels of economic development committing to take action. Two weeks ago, the IEA launched the Clean Energy Transitions Programme, a multi-year 30 million EUR initiative scaling up engagement with major emerging economies.The IEA also took the opportunity at COP23 to meet with officials, policymakers and key stakeholders from the growing IEA family. The IEA was present in the pavilions of key Member and Association countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Germany, France, Japan, as well as the EU and Nordic pavilions.Climate objectives can and must be aligned with broader goalsThe IEA showcased an integrated approach to reaching climate, socioeconomic, and environmental objectives in the recently launched World Energy Outlook 2017 with the Sustainable Development Scenario.

Teng Fei, associate professor, Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy, Tsinghua University The main task at this year's COP is to set out the detailed rules on how the Paris Agreement will be implemented - it won't be a big year. But the devil is often in the detail - they may be small things, but they will determine whether or not the Paris Agreement achieves its long term goals. I don't think we'll be able to say whether those rules have been successful or not this year, or for several years to come. The most obvious criteria is whether or not the various parties manage to decide on those rules according to the already-agreed timetable, but I think the quality of the rules is more important than the schedule. Only when the rules are implemented will we be better able to judge whether or not the mechanisms under discussion can realise the Paris goals. As 80% of the outcomes are decided in advance, each country brings its own stance to the negotiations, and once they've taken that stance there's limited room for negotiation. Those positions are determined by domestic politics, and unless domestic politics change the positions won't change, so there's no chance of significant change at one negotiating session. The lesson of the Paris Agreement was the selection of a bottom-up approach to solving problems, and we should look for solutions and responses to climate change which are rooted in the everyday lives of the public, rather than relying on the political elite or on negotiations alone. Yang Fuqiang, senior advisor on climate and energy, National Resource Defence Council We should see a fairly modest outcome from this year's climate talks, as we can't expect everyone to have decided on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement in a single year. This is only the beginning. And some of the details are tricky - for example this year's chair, Fiji, lacks influence and if we don't see a positive approach from major powers, progress is unlikely. This year we also need to look to key European nations such as Germany, the UK and Denmark - will they join with China to put forward new initiatives and actions? If so, that may give rise to a small flurry. The attitude of the US continues to be an issue this year. Trump has said the US will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but a formal withdrawal won't be possible until 2022, and the US still has the right to intervene on a lot of matters and may present an obstacle to negotiations - for example, on funding and technology. This restriction also provides the United States with the opportunity to interfere with the many issues and to create barriers to negotiations, particularly on issues such as capital, technology, capacity building and ambitions.  Monique Barbut, under-secretary general and executive secretary, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification The Paris Agreement achieved consensus on limiting the rise in temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. For some regions in Africa, this would still lead to a 4-degree temperature rise, on average, causing epic scale disasters and unimaginable human suffering. For COP23 to be successful, adaptation must now be given the same sense of urgency and be put on the same footing as mitigation efforts. Any new mechanisms emerging should ensure that the most vulnerable countries can adapt and avoid the most catastrophic scenarios. The Agreement has four times the potential of the Kyoto Protocol\~to eliminate greenhouse gases. A lot of these new mitigation actions are based on land use and land use change. A successful COP23 needs to develop comprehensive systems that can effectively guide and promote action in this area, for at least three reasons. First, we know a lot more today about assessing soil-based measures than we did two decades ago. Under the Kyoto Protocol, for instance, carbon emissions through land use change and carbon sequestration through forests were taken into account, even if not fully understood. But limiting action under the Paris Agreement to these two areas would amount to failure. Under the desertification process, we have made a lot of progress in developing measures to assess land-based sequestration processes. Governments agreed on how to assess land cover change, land productivity and soil carbon sequestration, regardless of the ecosystem. From these experiences, COP23 can refine ways to assess initiatives under land use and land use change and promote synergies between the Conventions. Second, there is often a discrepancy between what governments intend to achieve and what is actually realised. We need to ensure that every commitment - including in the new areas of land use and land use change identified under the Paris Agreement - are turned into real commitments on the ground. Third, incentives to promote early action are vital. They would be highly effective in the context of land-related measures. On the one hand, it would shield productive land from further degradation in order to curb future emissions. On the other hand, the rehabilitation of degraded land would put carbon back into the soil. Jennifer Morgan, executive director, Greenpeace International As a whole, a successful COP23, including the events that occur around it, will need to show an acceleration of momentum towards the Paris Agreement goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This will require the emergence of strong, shared leadership at all levels from governments, cities, states, corporations and communities around the world towards higher ambition, to meet the worsening climate threat in the small window of opportunity we still have. Specifically, in the US, mayors, governors and others can counterbalance President Trump's announced withdrawal from Paris. In Europe, all eyes will be on Germany as a new government must commit to phasing out coal and the combustion engine to maintain its credibility internationally. In the COP negotiations themselves, the list of unfinished business of the Paris Climate Agreement is long and detailed and it is crucial for significant progress to be made on the Paris Agreement's implementation guidel"
"COP23","USA","COP23_USA48","COP23: Africa makes itself heard","November 7, 2017 Tuesday 5:34 PM EST","Deutsche Welle World","Nov 07, 2017( Deutsche Welle World: HYPERLINK http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex) As COP23 kicks off in Bonn this week, African participants are working hard to ensure their voices are being heard, amid fears that the so-called 'Trump effect"" could make matters worse for developing states.With COP23 well under way in Bonn this week, African states and organizations are making the most of their presence at the high - profile conference by voicing their concerns and ideas - and are using their influence to pressure developed nations to commit to more ambitious reduction targets for the sake of poorer, more vulnerable regions.Africa is the continent which will likely be affected the most by climate change, with almost two-thirds of its population making its living off the land.Yunis Arikan, the Head of Advocacy and Development from ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability (formerly known as the International Council for Local Environmental Issues), believes that African states have become increasingly vocal and proactive at COP conferences since the very first meeting in Berlin in 1995.""Among our over 300 leaders, we have a significant delegation from Africa bringing their solutions and priorities,"" Arikan told DW, ""I think in that sense a COP in Germany is fulfilling its mission to give voice to Africa and we are proud that they are coming not only to listen, but to speak and offer their solutions and expectations so that they are part of the process, not just outside the fence. Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in terms of drought, but it also represents many opportunities when it comes to things like solar power generation.""Part of this increased involvement comes down to a change in attitudes towards climate change, as well as a larger young generation who are concerned for their futures.""For many years sustainability and urbanization was a taboo. It was not considered a big priority for Africa. But there is a huge influx of people going to cities in Africa, as there is a young generation emerging,"" said Arikan, ""There are a lot of ambitious leaders in Africa who would like to be connected to the world and who want to be a part of the global movement.""Holding industrialized nations to account US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement earlier this year has unsurprisingly dominated much of the discourse at COP23 - especially after Syria announced its plans to join the agreement, effectively isolating the US as the only country opposed to the pact. But for many countries in Africa, the US's withdrawal represents a dangerous disregard for poorer states who are more likely to be at the receiving end of the worst effects of climate change - a scenario made even more troubling by the fact that the majority of C02 emissions are generated by wealthier, industrialized nations like the US.The Panafrican Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) represents a coalition of civil society organizations from diverse backgrounds across Africa. Secretary General of PACJA, Mithika Mwenda, told DW that part of the organization's mission at COP23 is to push industrialized countries to set more ambitious goals to reduce their carbon emissions so that African states don't have to contend with the adverse effects of climate change. ""Our frustration, as a coalition of African countries, is that there is no strong signal of something being done,"" said Mwenda, ""It's like a jamboree where people come, make proclamations, and after two weeks they go back to their normal lives. We are insisting that it is no longer business as usual. We need to acknowledge the expectations of poorer states and ensure that we are taking action.""Fighting back against the 'Trump effect' Mwenda also openly questions the presence of an official US delegation, out of fear it may prove to be a bad influence on other states that are already reluctant to take serious action on climate change - something he terms as the ""Trump effect.""""[The US] withdraws from the Paris Agreement, yet they still want to show that they can negotiate the implementation framework,"" said Mwenda, ""That's why we are calling in delegates here to sign our petition to kick Trump and his government out of these negotiations. We have to make it very clear that we are not kicking [out] the people of America. We are in solidarity with [those who oppose Trump's actions]. Our target is the Trump government.""Holding high-polluters to account - including the possibility of financial reparations for small-polluters, including African countries - is likely to be another flashpoint issue at this year's COP, especially with island nation Fiji at the helm. ""It is quite symbolic that a small island state is hosting COP23,""Mwenda told DW, ""[Developed nations] hold a lot of power in terms of determining what is on the agendaThe problem is the apathy of industrialized countries. We want to challenge them on that."" \l"

The leaders will then proceed to Bonn where they will attend the United Nations .The following is the Pope's address to those present at the meeting:Address of the Holy FatherYour Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,I share your concern for the peoples of the region, especially those exposed to the extreme environmental and climate events that are becoming more frequent and intense. Of concern too is the grave impact of rising sea levels and the disturbing and continuous deterioration of the barrier reef, a marine ecosystem of immense importance. In this regard, I remember the disquieting question posed almost thirty years ago by the Bishops of the Philippines: ""Who turned the wonderworld of the seas into underwater cemeteries bereft of colour and life?"" (cf. Laudato Si', 41). A number of causes have led to this environmental decay and, sadly, many of them are due to short-sighted human activity connected with certain ways of exploiting natural and human resources, the impact of which ultimately reaches the ocean bed itself (cf. ibid.).When we speak of rising sea levels, which ""mainly affect impoverished coastal populations who have nowhere else to go"" (ibid., 48), our thoughts turn to the problem of global warming widely discussed in various international forums and meetings. In these very days COP-23, the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention Framework of the United Nations, is meeting in Bonn, under the presidency of one of the countries you represent, the Fiji Islands. It is my hope that the efforts of COP-23, and those yet to come, will always keep in mind the greater picture of that ""earth without borders, with its highly rarified atmosphere"", as it was described by one of the astronauts currently orbiting in the International Space Station, with whom I recently had a fascinating conversation.You have come here from countries far distant from Rome, yet that vision of an ""earth without borders"" dissolves all geographic distances. It reminds us of the need for a global outlook, international cooperation and solidarity, and a shared strategy, which can prevent us from remaining indifferent in the face of grave problems such as the deterioration of the environment and of the health of the oceans, which is itself linked to the human and social deterioration experienced by humanity today.Not only geographic and territorial distances, but also distances in time are dissolved by the realization that everything in the world is intimately connected (cf. ibid., 16). Almost thirty years have passed since the Filipino Bishops' appeal, and yet it cannot be said that the situation of the oceans and marine ecosystem has really improved. We still face any number of problems regarding, for example, the management of fishing resources, activities in shallow and deep waters, the situation of coastal communities and of fishing families, and the pollution caused by the accumulation of plastics and micro-plastics. ""What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up? This question not only concerns the environment in isolation... When we ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave behind, we think in the first place of its general direction, its meaning and its values"" (ibid., 160).I thank you for your welcome visit and I invoke upon you and your countries God's abundant blessings.Thank you.\l"

The OECD too has made it clear what is at stake. ""We will only be able to preserve our prosperity in future if we make extensive investments climate-friendly,"" said the Chancellor. ""That is why we are convinced that climate policy is also economic policy for the future. We must preserve the natural resource base on which life depends if we are to continue successfully with business.""Renewable energy for growth""If we do it right, the transformation offers great opportunities for growth. Renewable energy, energy efficiency technologies that use fewer resources and save costs, climate-sound innovation in building technology and in the traffic and transport sector all this and more will become increasingly important on markets worldwide."" In Germany, renewables are the strongest pillar in the country's energy supply mix.Doubling climate finance by 2020""That is why Germany and the other industrialised countries stand by their pledge to provide 100 billion US dollars every year from public and private sources as of 2020 to support developing countries,"" said the Chancellor. ""And that is why we in Germany plan to double climate funding by 2020."" Private-sector investment is also need here though. ""We must all pull together to put in place an enabling environment that will allow us to mobilise private capital for climate finance.""Looking ahead to Paris in DecemberThe development banks and the World Bank play an important part in this, Angela Merkel continued. ""We should all strengthen this part. I can only welcome the fact that President Emmanuel Macron, the UN Secretary-General and the President of the World Bank will be hosting a summit that is to focus on climate finance in Paris on 12 December.""Financial support for developing countriesIn 2016 Germany provided a sum of 1.4 billion euros to support developing countries. To this sum must be added another 100 million euros this year for the Adaptation Fund. A global partnership for climate risk insurance in developing countries has now been founded with the World Bank, as a joint initiative of the G20 and the countries affected by climate change.\l"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA58","WBCSD | Insider Perspective: COP23 in Bonn","November 20, 2017 Monday 9:10 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Nov 20, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.comhttp://3blmedia.comCOP23 was presided over by Fiji and helped shine a light on important aspects of climate resilience and adaptation that have not been as visible at previous COPs. The mood of the event was noticeably different than Paris or Marrakech, with a clear focus on how countries should be moving from ambition towards action and implementation - and with heightened awareness of the\~gap between current ambitions and the 2 degree target[2]. Participants were serious, and even somber. Over the course of COP23, WBCSD and our members embodied the Fijian concept of 'Talenoa' - bringing all actors together to discuss solutions to challenges in a meaningful and productive way. For business, the key takeaway from this round of negotiations is that companies are now formally invited to provide input into the climate negotiations through reports, dialogue and analyses. WBCSD member companies look forward to actively engaging in this process through regional, solutions-focused multi-stakeholder meetings over the course of 2018 and through to COP24. This year, WBCSD was present across COP side events through the Marrakech Partnership under the Global Climate Action Agenda. Representatives from climate and energy, circular economy, climate smart agriculture, forests, water and cement were there to represent the voice of business. Through WBCSD, over 70 companies and over 200 participants were able to attend the world-renowned climate meeting. Over the course of the two-week event, WBCSD ran or hosted nearly twenty sessions - and, according to President and CEO Peter Bakker, brought together the 'highest concentration of CEOs in the same room at COP.' Throughout the negotiations and across the side events, our member companies and other business leaders within the We Mean Business Coalition called for strong climate action,\~urging country negotiators to consider[3]:How to ensure a structured policy dialogue between governments and other stakeholders through the Marrakech Partnership How to formally introduce and incorporate input from non-state actors in the Talanoa (Facilitative) Dialogue Building partnerships for resilience across global supply chains and in vulnerable communities experiencing climate impacts Supporting carbon markets and enabling cross-border collaboration on mitigation effortsEnacting strong climate policies that\~reward\~sustainability leaders will be key for ensuring the low-carbon transition. 'I love polar bears,' one participant said, 'but I'm really here for my shareholders unchecked climate change could erode trillions from the global economy.' Across the multitude of events happening alongside the official negotiation process, key themes emerged, including: The importance of non-state actors and the Talanoa Dialogue Because of geopolitical uncertainty and the slow pace of government negotiation, momentum is building across cities, states, organizations and businesses for leading on the implementation of the Paris agreement. It was clear during the event that corporate commitments to climate action are the new norm. Since 2015, over 600 companies have made over 1,000 commitments under the We Mean Business Coalition - with companies involved in WBCSD's Low Carbon Technology Partnerships Initiative (LCTPi), targeting 65% of the emissions reductions needed for remining under 2 degrees - and already\~making progress[4]. 'By 2020, it will be normal for all of the world's well-run companies to have a science based target,' said Nigel Topping, CEO of We Mean Business, at the start of COP23's Global Climate Action Industry Day. Which means, in order to ensure that progress towards Paris is accurately reflected, it will be critical for business to be involved in the Talanoa Dialogue - the consultative process for taking stock of how far we've come and where we need to go in terms of ramping up climate ambition. 'Many governments aren't even aware of the suite of solutions available to help them achieve their Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs),' said Rasmus Valanko, Director of WBCSD's Climate and Energy project. 'It's up to business to show them what's possible, because countries won't commit unless they believe they can succeed.' At the\~Low Emissions Solutions Conference[5], co-hosted by WBCSD, ICLEI and UNSDSN, Minister Seruiratu of Fiji addressed the room full of high-level business and city leaders, 'As we are building up to the Talanoa Dialogue, I see that [this] is where the real world is- this is where the actions take place. This is where you see responsible leadership - this is where you see shakers and movers.'

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA59","Bonn, a Boon for Business? Top Ways Your Company Can Make the Most of COP23","November 2, 2017 Thursday 3:12 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Nov 02, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.comhttp://3blmedia.com in Bonn will be the year for business. In today's uncertain geopolitical landscape, businesses have a unique opportunity to step up on climate action, but they need to be informed and they need to be engaged. Next week, thousands of delegates from government, international organizations, trade unions, business and civil society will gather in Bonn, Germany for the latest round of negotiations under the\~United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[2]\~(UNFCCC). This 23rd Conference of the Parties, COP23 as it's known, will give\~Paris Agreement[3]\~signatories the opportunity to assess their\~progress in implementing climate commitments. It will also enable them to create rules to ensure they're adhering to the Agreement, while preparing the groundwork for all countries to increase ambitions under their\~national climate action plans[4]. The meeting couldn't come at a better time, as 2017 has been another critical year for the health of the planet. COP23 coincides with the closing of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, likely to be the costliest on record, with a preliminary total of over\~US$290 billion in damages[5]\~for hurricanes Harvey and Irma alone. Hurricane Irma was the strongest recorded hurricane ever to form in the Atlantic Ocean; and hurricane Ophelia is the easternmost major hurricane in the basin on record. With the European Union also reeling from tragic wildfires in Spain and Portugal, and experiencing a\~doubling in the total number of forest fires in 2017[6]\~while deadly wildfires rage across California, delegates should be motivated to infuse the negotiations with the urgency and ambition they deserve. On one side, we have intense weather events - on the other, governments seem to be losing focus. Global politics - especially around climate action - continue to be unclear, and the need for distributed leadership among a diverse array of stakeholders across the UNFCCC process is more poignant than ever. In this context, Bonn could be business's climate moment. As such, here are the top five issues for companies to engage with and watch out for: The Marrakech Partnership, go beyond show-and-tell The\~Marrakech Partnership[7]\~for global climate action provides a platform for showcasing successful approaches to reducing greenhouse gases and enhancing climate resilience. The showcasing element is important, but the Partnership is missing a space for a structured conversation between governments and other stakeholders to address the challenges that undermine climate action. Many companies want to go further and faster towards decarbonization, but don't know how to get there. The first question COP23 negotiators need to answer is, 'How can governments provide companies with a policy enabling environment that catalyzes their ambition?' Improving the Marrakech Partnership is key to this. Business should be heard at COP23 - they should be vocal to negotiators about the policy environment they want and the solutions they can bring to the market to accelerate the transformation to a low-carbon world. The facilitative dialogue, make sure you're being heard The\~Facilitative Dialogue[8]\~is a process intended to take stock of collective progress towards the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement by speaking to a wide range of stakeholders. It's also designed to help kick off consideration of the 2020 update to countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Over the course of 2017, the Fijian and Moroccan governments have been leading extensive consultations\~how\~to get input from other stakeholders: how often will people have the opportunity to give input, can they physically sit in the rooms with negotiators, how will their input be integrated? A draft design of what the facilitative dialogue will look like is going to be presented during COP23. For business, the key questions around this process are, 'Will this Dialogue lead to stronger collective ambition and not just a review of progress? Will the Dialogue result in more comprehensive national climate action plans? And will companies be invited to engage as partners in the design of the Dialogue and of the domestic policies that follow?' Business should be involved and contribute to scale ambition of the NDCs to meet the agreed goals. Climate resilience, prepare for what's inevitable Climate change is a significant and material risk to business. Research in the journal\~Nature[9]\~suggests the impact of climate change on the market value of global financial assets to be $2.5 trillion and could be as high as $24.2 trillion under worst case scenarios. In a\~recent survey[10], 72% of suppliers stated that climate risks could significantly impact their business operations, revenue or expenditure, yet only half of these are currently managing this risk. Governments and the private sector need to find constructive ways to partner in building resilience inside individual companies, across complex global supply chains, and within frontl"

While McKibben agrees the economic theories presented by EWC and LUT are sensible and realistic, he is less than optimistic that world governments have the political will to follow through on the steps necessary to prevent a climate emergency. 'That depends entirely on whether we can build movements large enough to break the power of the fossil fuel industry that holds us where we are,' McKibben said. 'To go further, what we need are many people in the streets demanding action and pushing governments to move much, much faster than they're currently contemplating.' He goes on to tell\~Deutsche Welle, 'We've used up most of what scientists have described as the carbon budget. We are producing carbon at record levels, year after year.

Political leaders from 197 nations will gather in Bonn, Germany, next month for the next phase of the United Nations (COP23); and the Christian leaders are urging them to  keep the promises they made in the Paris Agreement, to restore the natural balance. The letter was signed by five archbishops: Thabo Makgoba of Southern Africa, Winston Halapua of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, Albert Chama of Central Africa, Philip Freier of Australia; and Francisco De Assis Da Silva of Brazil; and two bishops: Dr Jwan Zhumbes of Bukuru in Nigeria, and Dr Robert Innes from the Church of England\' s Diocese in Europe. The letter has been co-ordinated by Renew Our World \- a Christian partnership bringing together the World Evangelical Alliance, Tearfund, Micah Challenge, EU-Cord, Eficor, Paz y Esperanza, and the Jos Green Centre in Australia, Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria, Peru, the UK, US, and Zambia. Renew Our World say that next month\' s Cop23 meeting is  the crucial next step for our world to take urgent action on climate solutions, before it\' s too late. We already won the commitment of almost every country in the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. But now it is time to hold our governments accountable to those commitments, and make sure we turn the Paris Agreement into reality. We must make sure our leaders keep their promises.  This year is critically important, especially since President Trump indicated he wants to withdraw the US from the agreement. Now is the crucial time for our world to band together, focus, and rise to meet our commitments to protect people and planet.

It says:  as Christians across the globe we are calling for action on climate change. The changing climate is causing great damage to people and planet right now, and we are particularly concerned about hunger and poverty hitting the most vulnerable communities, who did least to cause it. They are calling on world leaders to Set targets for the world to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to limit global warming to the safe level of 1.5 degrees. Invest in 100% clean energy, particularly using local grids so it reaches those in poverty beyond the reach of national electricity grids.

At a time when the United States federal government wishes to leave the Paris agreement, the presence of many USA mayors and governors pledging to continue their fight against climate change illustrated that even when States do not deliver, subnational governments are there to pick up the fight.AER signed up to the Bonn-Fiji commitment of local and regional leaders to deliver the Paris agreement and to keep the global temperature rise well below two degrees celsius.AER President Magnus Berntsson was invited to speak at various events during the COP to voice the determination, concerns and hopes of European regions. He specifically talked about access to finance for sustainable projects, a key issue for many cities and regions and a long-term fight for AER and the R20.After several breakthrough : the 100 climate solutions projects campaign in the Summer 2016 which showed investors that regions have great projects to be financed ; the development of regional training to maximise access to public money via the SOURCE software ; AER and R20 are going one step further during this COP23 by announcing their progress towards setting up the first Subnational Climate Funds.In presence of the UNFCCC and UNIDO executive secretary and as R20 President, Magnus Berntsson announced the launch of the first subnational climate fund for Africa with a goal of 350 million $ worth of blended finance for African cities and regions' projects.As AER President, Magnus Berntsson announced that the organisation would take the leadership on the creation of a similar fund for European cities and regions, the Subnational climate fund for Europe.With the governor of Washington @JayInslee part of the governors fighting against climate change #COP23 pic.twitter.com/0BfLaMX659AER (@europeanregions) November 13, 2017To that end, several side meetings took place between AER, the European Commission vice president for energy union, M.

""Every five minutes, the pump will activate and the tree will come to life, water will trickle, the birds will sing and the leaves will flutter.""This sculpture highlights the dependence of all living things on a functioning healthy ecosystem. The tree provides food and a home to animals and birds. It also offers shelter from wind and shade from sun, allowing crops to thrive and feed families.""The water running through the tree highlights the increasing importance of this critical resource due to climate change,"" said IFAD'sEnvironment and Climate DivisionDirector, Margarita Astralaga. ""When the water is running the tree comes to life, when the water stops the tree comes to a stop, or dies.""She added, ""Right now climate change issues such as water scarcity and erratic weather patterns are adversely affecting smallholder farmers in the developing world. But IFAD-led solutions are empowering them to combat and overcome these issues. """"The sculpture highlights IFADs restoration efforts which focuses on planting trees on degraded lands to stop soil erosion,"" added Birtwistle.In the Sahel region of Africa IFAD has rehabilitated almost 300,000 hectares. Once barren land now has approximately 50 trees per hectare. In total IFAD's agroforestry and related activities have contributed to the removal of over 58,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.IFAD's investments, including theAdaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), help farmers in several ways, from installing weather forecast systems, to introducing new drought resistant crop varieties, as well as setting up farmer field schools where knowledge and new climate smart agriculture techniques can be demonstrated and disseminated.Contact: Brian ThomsonMobile: +39 HYPERLINK mailto:3666121101b.thomson@ifad.org3666121101b.thomson@ifad.orgAbout IFADBiomimic Tree VideoView original content: HYPERLINK http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biomimic-tree----pushing-agriculture-up-the-agenda-cop23-300550780.htmlhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biomimic-tree----pushing-agriculture-up-the-agenda- HYPERLINK http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biomimic-tree----pushing-agriculture-up-the-agenda-cop23-300550780.htmlcop23 -300550780.htmlSOURCE International Fund for Agricultural Development\l"

Since COP21, when the Paris Agreement formally recognized local governments' role in addressing climate change, we've seen growing global interest in how local solutions can reduce emissions and adapt communities to new weather extremes.""This weekend at COP23, more than 1,000 municipal delegates from 60 countries attended the Summit of Local and Regional Leaders hosted by ICLEI Global. FCM's Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program (MCIP) was featured as an exemplary initiative supporting the group's Bonn-Fiji Commitment. Delivered in partnership with the Government of Canada, MCIP raises municipalities' capacity to integrate climate priorities in local infrastructure planning.""All week in Bonn, we've shown how municipalities are modelling some of Canada's most innovative green solutions - from building retrofits to district heating, from better transit to low-GHG waste systems. Some of the richest potential to meet Canada's GHG emission targets lies in scaling up this local innovation. That's our message to the federal government as it continues to negotiate details of its long-term Green Infrastructure Fund with provinces and territories.""FCM's delegation participated in a promising conversation with municipal experts from Barcelona and Paris, along with leading international climate science organizations, about the need for climate science to be co-developed and shared directly with local governments.

[boo-lah vee-nah-kah, meaning 'warm hello'].COP 23, and I want to thank the Fijian Presidency for its excellent leadership...... and the people of Germany for their great hospitality.As our Prime Minister highlighted in New York in September, the Paris Agreement is a brilliant example of effective global cooperation. Every country in the world has now signed the Agreement, and I am proud that the UK is part of this.It has never been more important to accelerate our momentum. Recent extreme weather events have devastated the lives of many across the world. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to all those affected and emphasise that we are taking our commitments under the Paris Agreement very seriously and we are taking action.Firstly, for the UK we launched a Clean Growth Strategy for the UK just last month a critical set of measures to meet our domestic carbon budgets and help our global CO2 reduction process.I was also proud that the UK recently announced plans to phase out unabated coal fired electricity generation by 2025... our intent to end the sale of conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040... and to establish our Green Finance TaskforceEarlier today the UK, Canada, and over twenty five other parties committed to forming the Powering Past Coal Alliance - a new alliance committed to phasing out unabated coal from power generation. We have also kept our promises in supporting poorer nations to accelerate the transition to a more resilient and low carbon future and play our role in meeting our collective goal of mobilising $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020.Last year, we showed international leadership by successfully balancing our climate finance across mitigation and adaptation... and so far we have mobilised 2.2 billion public and 500 million private finance for climate change purposes in developing countries. This has helped over 34 million people deal with the impacts of climate change.... and I am very proud of the over three hundred million pounds of UK funding announcements at this COP on protecting forests, encouraging private sector investment in sustainable infrastructure, and helping countries finance their existing emissions reduction plans.Plus we have recently committed to double our 2017 funding to IPCC and make multi-year pledges to be sure that this important institution can continue to play a crucial role in providing independent, rigorous and balances scientific information on climate change.The UK also continues to be a global leader in protecting oceans and marine life:We are on track to protect 4 million square kilometres of ocean across Overseas Territories by 2020.We see pre-2020 action as extremely important - on Tuesday we ratified the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol on phasing down HFCs.......and I am pleased to say that our Foreign Secretary signed the Doha Amendment yesterday.We are not resting on our laurels. In the New Year we are looking forward to hosting the Commonwealth summit in London which will help to provide a springboard for future collective action...We see it as crucial that over the next few years we achieve:... Agreement on the rules that underpin the Paris Agreement...... an increase in ambition as technology and innovation makes the transition a win win for the planet and our economy.... but of course the action that really matters is in the real world where businesses and organisations are taking the signals from these negotiations to transform our futureThere is much we can and must achieve together.Thank you to all parties here for working together to make COP23 a huge success.Document informationPublished: 17 November 2017From: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Claire Perry MPPart of: Climate change international actionHelp us improve GOV.UKDon't include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.\l"

The 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change (COP23), which is being held in Bonn between 6 and 17 November, began its second and final week in Bonn under the presidency of Fiji. This is a strong symbol given that this small country in the Pacific is already being hit hard by the effects of climate change, in particular the devastation caused by cyclones, as recalled Richard Langlois, economist and representative of Education International (EI) at the COP23. The findings detailed in the discussions at the COP23 are clear and unequivocal: the current trajectory of carbon emissions, should it remain unchanged, would render it impossible to reach the objective of the Paris Agreement which, according to a majority of experts, is a minimum threshold that should not be exceeded at the risk of exposing humanity to grave danger. This situation requires urgent mobilisation of all relevant stakeholders, and government first among them, which must rapidly fulfil their role as leaders. According to the trade union movement, which was strongly represented in Bonn, it is imperative for governments to strengthen international climate governance. This means raising their ""ambitions"" by 2020, observing their financial commitments and committing to a fair transition for workers and populations. EI: The planet's future depends on generations of educated citizens informed about the climate emergency According to EI, better governance must also include an ambitious programme on climate-related education and training. The education sector has a crucial role to play in the transition towards a low carbon emission global economy. With new business models making a significant impact on workers, EI also emphasised that education and training must prepare young people for civic and professional life. Similarly, technological research and development will be of paramount importance in combating climate change. Consequently, EI calls on the world's governments to strengthen initial training and lifelong professional training programmes for teachers who must have the necessary skills with which to deliver education on sustainable development and climate change. The future of the planet will rest in the hands of generations informed and educated with regard to the climate emergency. \l"

From scientists to policymakers and individuals we all need to be involved. Increasingly ambitious global action is key, as analyses by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released prior to COP23 confirm that greenhouse gas emissions are still on the rise while efforts to reduce emissions are insufficient to hold temperature increases to a bearable level in a year in which the world has endured significant extreme weather events. Physical risks from climate change are increasingly clear.The Paris Agreement provided the collective framework to limit temperature increases to well below 2\'baC above preindustrial levels, but international rules that will govern the Paris Agreement are yet to be finalised. National climate laws and policies that are fostered, inter alia, by the Paris Agreement ensure action on the ground. Appropriation of new and existing climate policies is key to ensure their implementation. Citizen concern seems to be mounting, thus favouring increasingly ambitious climate regulation, although further action is needed. The current legal and social contexts highlight both transition risks and market opportunities for stakeholders as a function of their climate action.Recent developments in climate science, legislation, litigation and citizen engagement provide the context in which international climate negotiations took place in Bonn this year.

Earlier this year, Mexico and Canada joined the Under2 Coalition, the global pact of cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences.Governor Brown started the day with keynote remarks at the largest United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) gathering of businesses, civil society, states and regions organized to detail climate action and commitments from non-state actors.Governor Brown then joined a panel discussion, including former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and moderated by former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres, focused on efforts to curb carbon pollution by U.S. states.Governor Brown then gave remarks ahead of a panel discussion hosted by Sustainable Energy for All, the Global Covenant of Mayors and the Partnership on Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport on how cities can deploy new technology and innovative policies to decarbonize and reduce emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.The Governor also previewed the Global Climate Action Summit, which California will host in San Francisco in September 2018. This event will showcase the surge of climate action around the world - and make the case that even more must be done. The Summit will also help strengthen the push for greater emissions reduction targets at COP 24 in December 2018.On his final day at COP23 tomorrow, Governor Brown will deliver the keynote address at a cap-and-trade forum organized by the People's Republic of China, speak at the UN Environment Programme's Sustainable Innovation Forum and the Zero-Emission Vehicle Alliance's ZEV Infrastructure Symposium, participate in a panel discussion hosted by the World Wildlife Foundation and join environment officials from the German Federal Government and Under2 Coalition co-founder Baden-Wurttemberg to welcome new Under2 Coalition members at a signing ceremony.Yesterday, in Bonn, Governor Brown rallied city, state and regional leaders at the ICLEI climate summit, the largest gathering on global subnational climate action at COP23; joined fellow Pacific Coast Collaborative governors on a panel to discuss West Coast climate action; gave keynote remarks at a clean energy forum hosted by the International Renewable Energy Agency; discussed further collaboration on climate action with the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia and with Germany's Secretary for Economic Affairs and Energy; and joined Senator Ricardo Lara to accept the UN Environment Programme's Climate and Clean Air Coalition award on behalf of California.Last week, in Bonn, Governor Brown joined fellow America's Pledge co-founder Michael Bloomberg to reaffirm the commitment of America's states, cities and businesses to the Paris Agreement and welcomed Virginia to the Under2 Coalition. In Oslo, Governor Brown met with Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and convened a first-of-its-kind meeting with representatives of the world's leading independent national academies of science to review climate impacts and discuss how scientists and policymakers can more effectively translate research findings into meaningful action. In Brussels, Governor Brown delivered opening remarks at a high-level conference on clean energy organized by the European Parliament and European Commission, met with the president of the European Parliament and the European Union's top representatives at COP23, joined members of the European Parliament's top climate and environmental committee and the leaders of the Parliament's political parties for an extensive discussion on opportunities for further collaboration on climate action, and highlighted California's local and global efforts to fight climate change at an event organized by the German Marshall Fund. In Stuttgart, the Governor met with Under2 Coalition co-founder Baden- Wurttemberg's Minister-President and delivered remarks before the state parliament. Governor Brown also delivered keynote remarks at a symposium on climate change hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican.More information on the Governor's itinerary can be found here: HYPERLINK https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=20046https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=20046Photo captions:1.)

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA83","A reflection on COP23: Incremental progress but no industrialized country's top priority (commentary)","November 22, 2017 Wednesday 7:02 PM EST","Mongabay News","Nov 22, 2017( Mongabay News: HYPERLINK http://news.mongabay.comhttp://news.mongabay.comCOP23Most COPs, like COP23, produce progress around the edges of climate mitigation and promises to talk again next year. Always next year. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.I remember well the vibrancy that December evening in 2015 when word spread on the last day of the 21st UN climate summit that there would be an agreement  the Paris Agreement. After two decades of staring at a known and worsening global crisis of epic proportions, leaders of 196 nations, pushed mercilessly by UN, French, and US negotiators, finally decided to not allow the earth to burn up[1] by 2100. The Eiffel Tower glowed with triumphant messages against a starry Paris sky. For the first time, nations voluntarily agreed to reduce their carbon emissions and slow the rate of deforestation. That moment in Paris felt historic, hopeful, perhaps the most significant agreement among world leaders for the greater good of this earth since World War II. Just two years later, as I stayed late on the last night of the 23rd UN climate summit in Bonn, Germany, I felt no such vibrancy and certainly no such history-making optimism. There was little. COP23 wasn't designed for major breakthroughs. Everyone conceded that. But why not?COP23, while held in Bonn, Germany, was hosted for the first time by a Pacific island nation, Fiji. Developing and vulnerable nations wanted the logo to be true. The response they received? Maybe next year. Photo by Justin Catanoso. Bad and getting worseOnce again, 2017 promises to be another of the hottest years in the historical record. After three years of stable global greenhouse gas emissions, 2017 will see a spike in emissions[2] to record highs. How many hurricanes the ferocity of Harvey, Irma, and Maria must be experienced in the US alone to stoke a greater sense of urgency? How many climate refugees need to be pushed from sub-Saharan Africa and Syria because of unrelenting drought? How much more Arctic ice needs to melt? How much sea-level rise can be tolerated in low-lying island nations  and Miami Beach, for goodness sake  before COP participants stop delaying greater ambitions prior to 2020, when a stronger Paris Agreement is to take effect? Despite Trump's climate denial[3], the U.S. military labels the destabilizing impact of global climate change as the most serious national security threat facing the nation. Not immigration. Not terrorism. Not economic calamity. Climate change. So where's the incitement, now, to reduce carbon emissions beyond the modest Paris pledges, an absolute necessity if we are to contain temperature rise to 1.5 degree C by 2100, the Paris goal? Where are the billions in promised funding to help the victims of climate impacts adapt and recover their losses and damages? Nowhere yet in sight. COP23 was not without incremental accomplishments. There were many, most boldly a coalition of US cities, states, and businesses[4] pledging to do for climate mitigation what the Trump administration won't. Would a Hillary Clinton administration have done more? Hard to say. Trump's low-level State Department staffers pressed the common US goal of greater transparency and accountability in reporting climate action. Mostly, they provided cover for other developed nations to block progress on defining pathways to billions in financing adaptation and loss-and-damage funds. Under Obama, the wealthiest nation on earth committed just $3 billion to global climate-related funds and paid only $1 billion before Trump's election. Last month, the U.S. House approved $36.5 billion in recovery funds to Florida and Texas alone, far less than half of what's needed. So it's not likely that Clinton negotiators would have been more forthcoming on finance in Bonn.The world gathers again next December for COP24 in Katowice, Poland. Hard deadl"

November, 2017)-Today at the COP23 global climate change talks in Bonn, Germany, U.S. West Coast governors from California, Oregon, and Washington joined in a panel discussion focused on their regional objective of phasing out fossil fuels and moving toward a vibrant, growing clean energy economy. The discussion highlighted the ways Pacific Coast states, in partnership with British Columbia, are leading the charge on climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown of California, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington spoke at today's event.These four governments are members of a regional partnership called the Pacific Coast Collaborative (PCC), which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonize the economy and build thriving sustainable communities through the adoption of clean energy policies, sharing of expertise and resources, and collective action. This collaborative represents the biggest, most advanced attempt to create a low-carbon future of any transboundary region in the world.With the Trump administration's retreat from the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan, the governors used the panel, titled ""Leadership for 2050: Subnational Action with a Long-Term Vision,"" to discuss how they are moving forward in building a robust clean energy economy with or without federal leadership.

Schneider Electric's sustainability efforts are closely aligned with the ambitions of COP23. Specifically, Schneider Electric's aims to address the following issues when it comes to climate change.What is good for the climate is good for the economy: the global demand for infrastructure investments in transport, energy, water, and urban development is estimated at around 6,000 billion US dollars per year over the next 15 years, while 270 billion US dollars per year would be sufficient to develop low carbon infrastructures. Schneider Electric has introduced Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to help companies, as well as its own business, capitalize on the new energy landscape opportunities; Access to energy as a fundamental human right: the fight against climate change will not be effective without taking into account the needs of 2.3 billion people who have poor access to energy. Schneider Electric actively promotes access to energy. Energy Access Ventures - a fund backed by Schneider Electric that invests in growing, entrepreneurial businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa addressing the lack of electrification in the region with new technology and innovative business models - has secured commitments of 54.4 million Euros to provide electricity to 1 million people by 2020; Providing new solutions for more efficient, more livable and more sustainable cities: for Schneider Electric, a sustainable city is an urban center where infrastructure and energy go hand in hand. Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure enables it, its partners and its customers to lead a new world of energy that is more electric, more digitized, more decarbonized and more decentralized. Schneider Electric also uses its EcoStruxure Power, Building and Grid solutions to help its own buildings and data centers to be more resource efficient and profitable; Carbon pricing: the introduction of robust, clear and predictable carbon pricing mechanisms, that consider specificities across regions, along with the adoption of ambitious, long term policy frameworks that favor low carbon solutions and incentivize innovation are essential to reduce CO2 emissions. Schneider Electric has already adopted an internal price of carbon as part of its various programs to reduce its CO2 footprint, which include setting bold energy efficiency targets; introducing renewable energy projects; optimizing logistical operations, such as transportation routes and container fill rates; and eco-design of its products with CO2 considerations front of mind; Raising awareness of sustainability is crucial for making the world greener: doing more with less is possible now, but to successfully face climate change, we need to involve and change behaviours across society. Schneider Electric is committed to raising awareness amongst its employees, customers, partners and shareholders globally, developing tools such as a Footprint Calculator that allows users to measure their demand on natural resources and assess their personal Earth Overshoot Day (the calculated illustrative calendar date on which humanity's resource consumption for the year exceeds Earth's capacity to regenerate those resources that year); Importance of gender equality for energy transition: Fiji Presidency of COP23 will focus on the disproportionate vulnerability of women and the approaches that can make them more resilient.

Over the past few months, the European Beyond Coal Campaign launched, the largest-ever climate march in Germany kicked off the beginning of the climate negotiations, and we delivered more than 1.1 million signatures from Americans declaring that they are #StillIn the Paris Agreement.Perhaps the most visible setbacks for coal have been the U.S. passing the halfway mark of retiring its coal plants back in October, and just yesterday, 27 governments joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to call for an end to coal worldwide.In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement:""Even in the face of the climate-denying Trump administration, it is the unstoppable power of the people across the United States and the world that has continued to drive progress beyond coal -- from retiring half of the U.S. coal fleet to pushing governments to form the new Powering Past Coal Alliance. Coal and other fossil fuels have no place in our future, and the world will continue to move toward a clean and just energy economy. The Sierra Club is committed to doing our part to drive that progress and ensure this transition to clean energy leaves no one behind until the goal is met.""The Sierra Club applauds the government of Fiji for their leadership during these negotiations, and we challenge all governments to continue to step up to meet the ever-growing challenge of tackling the climate crisis.

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA92","Environmental Protesters Disrupt COP23, Demanding U.S. Action and Resisting Development","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.","Nov. 14--For more than a week, leaders from the around the world have been meeting at the COP23 talks in Bonn, Germany to discuss the progress that has been made on the Paris Climate Agreement. The U.S., which pulled out of the agreement earlier this year, was not invited. For a non-participant, however, Americans have been making a splash. Governors and mayors who support the goals of the climate agreement traveled to Germany to attend the COP23 conference, as did protesters, including some of the organizers of last year's Standing Rock protest camp. On Monday, the various protest actions demonstrated that division continues among the ranks of the environmentalists, showing that while they resist the Trump administration's pro-coal policies, they are far from unified in presenting alternative solutions.Activists were particularly incensed by a White House-sponsored panel that highlighted ways in which fossil fuels and nuclear energy could play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change. To many of the environmentalists, the theme was a thinly-veiled promotion of coal. More than 100 protesters disrupted the event with signs, singing, and chants, first preventing the panel from speaking before walking out of the talk en mass.""This event illustrates that our U.S. government is now run by fossil fuel billionaires who do not represent the values of the American people,"" said Garrett Blad, executive coordinator of SustainUS, a youth-led advocacy group for sustainable development.""We need to kick out corporate polluters and fossil fuel CEOs from our international institutions and from every single level of government back in the U.S. to ensure young people and those most impacted by climate change not only have seats at the table but are driving the agenda,"" he continued.The speakers invited by the White House failed to see why the topic was so controversial.""This panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system,"" said White House energy aide George David Banks after the panel. He and the other speakers described how present technology is not sufficient to power the country without the use of fossil fuels.The panel was the only event planned by the White House at COP23. For many of the environmentalists, the inclusion of any positive mentions of fossil fuels was an attempt to support the coal industry. And any attempt to speak favorably of fossil fuels was anathema.Over the weekend, California Governor Jerry Brown, who had come to speak on state efforts to meet the Paris goals, was interrupted by protesters who shouted ""keep it in the ground,"" a reference to oil development in California. Brown, who has a record of promoting pro-carbon reduction policies, including a state-level cap and trade bill, grew increasingly frustrated with the hecklers, eventually snapping ""Let's put you in the ground so we can get on with the show here.""On the whole, the protest element was heavily represented at COP23 in Bonn on Monday. As the UN climate talks were underway, the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) International was also meeting in the city. The WECAN conference highlighted female indigenous voices in the environmental movement. During the event, women from around the world spoke on the movement towards climate solutions and the need to include women's voices in this process.Among the speakers were Kathy Egland, a member of the NAACP board of directors, Isabella Zizi, a member of the native environmental group the Indigenous Environmental Network, and Nina Gualinga a Kichwa leader from the Pueblo of Sarayaku in Ecuador. They stressed the connection between colonization and environmental segregation, saying that native peoples had to resist any and all development of their lands and calling present American energy policy ""environmental racism.""""We have a plan for zero development on our land. Indigenous people are protecting forests, biodiversity globally. We're not here to negotiate we're here to protect life! Woman across the globe, now is our time to resist!"" said Gualinga.While calls for bolder action came from a wide range of sources, the details of how to accomplish these emissions reductions remained sketchy. The protests showed that, for many environmentalists, half measures such as carbon mitigation or responsible energy development are unacceptable. The steps that countries will take to actually reduce carbon emissions are the subject of the formal discussions also occurring in Bonn. For the largely American group of protesters however, the details may be moot. Without a significant change in American policy, the Paris agreement will not effect the U.S.Follow Erin on Twitter.___ (c)2017 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

It has also been a fundamental part of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, announced in June 2017, which are focused on improving clarity and comparability of climate disclosures, across four corporate areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management; and; Metrics and Targets.""We believe the TCFD's robust framework provides an essential foundation for investors and others to better assess and effectively price climate-related risks and opportunities, so disclosure of this kind must become a routine part of annual corporate reporting practice,"" said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the IIGCC.""The recommendations make a great leap forward in standardizing climate-related financial disclosure and enabling investors to compare impacts across companies and sectors,"" added Mark Campanale, founder and executive director of Carbon Tracker.To showcase how investors, the finance sector and companies are working with each other and governments to ensure greater disclosure of climate-related financial information, a side event: Actions on Disclosure of Climate Risks and Opportunities, will be held on at COP23 on 15 November. The event will include two panel discussions with experts from the finance and business sectors. The event is being organised by AIGCC, Carbon Tracker, CDP, Ceres, IGCC, IIGCC, PRI, and UNEP FI.""The TCFD recommendations represent an important milestone in the recognition of climate change--which our signatories have identified as their biggest concern--as a systemic financial risk. This is why, beginning in 2018, the PRI will start to align its reporting framework to the recommendations,"" said managing director, Fiona Reynolds.""The TCFD recommendations are already helping Australasian investors understand how the effects of climate change and the market response will impact portfolios and to identify investment solutions to build resilience and generate low carbon returns"", said Emma Herd, Chief Executive Officer of the Investor Group on Climate Change.A hallmark of the TCFD's disclosure framework is the recommendation that organisations provide climate-related financial disclosures in their main annual financial filings, and that companiesdetermine materiality for climate-related issues consistent with how they determine the materiality of other information included in their filings.""As a result of increasing levels of investor support for climate disclosure more than 6,200 companies have disclosed their climate performance through CDP this year. The TCFD recommendations will help further strengthen and scale disclosure and ensure we close the loop on climate risk in capital markets."" noted Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP.""Investors in Asia are beginning to realise the material risks of ESG issues, particularly climate change, to their portfolios, so the recommendations provide essential guidance on what they should be asking from the companies in which they invest,"" said Rebecca Mikula-Wright, Director of the AIGCC.""The TCFD framework - through its emphasis on forward-looking assessments and scenario analysis - has the potential to get corporate and financial organisations to more fully understand - and disclose - the climate-related risks and opportunities they face. At UNEP FI, we will support our members in adopting the recommendations and help accelerate TCFD disclosure practice in the financial industry."" explained Eric Usher, Head UNEP FI.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 13, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6072809 MSTRUCK\l"

At COP 21, all of the nations in attendance came together to sign the famous\~Paris Climate Agreement[3]\~to combat climate change. Though the recent major news has been the United States withdrawal of the agreement in 2020,\~the United Nation's chief climate negotiator[4]\~Christina Figueres believes the withdrawal has 'shored up the world's resolve on climate action, and for that we can all be grateful.' The private sector must take a larger stand to work with the world's organizations, both public and private, to commit to addressing the issues of climate change. This is where forums like COP shine. The conference brings together representatives from countries and private industry to find real solutions. Leaders from Ingersoll Rand have participated for 10 years. We engage with delegates to ensure country-level delegates have access to the latest information on next-generation technologies and solutions can help them achieve their GHG reduction targets. In 2014 we made a public\~Climate Commitment[5]\~to increase our energy efficiency and minimize our GHG emissions, and we take that commitment just as seriously now as we did then. We've already\~made great progress on our commitments[6], avoiding approximately 6.7 million metric tons of CO2e, equivalent to the emissions from nearly 700,000 homes' electricity use for one year. Our efforts reflect the wider initiatives of the private sector to make a greater push towards sustainability, and our successes demonstrate the difference individual organizations can make. Ingersoll Rand was the first industrial company to acknowledge climate risk in our 10-K filing, and we've confirmed plans to re-engineer products for a resource constrained world. We've also introduced our\~EcoWise portfolio[7]: our industry-leading product portfolio that meets customer requirements for energy efficiency while reducing climate and environmental impacts at a significantly improved performance level than alternatives - both our competitors' products and our legacy products. However, no matter the size of the company, organizations can take many climate-friendly actions. For example, buildings are responsible for approximately 40 percent of GHG emissions in mature parts of the world, and as much as 80 percent in some developing markets, with heating and cooling accounting for 40 percent of a building's GHG emissions. That means that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) alone is responsible for somewhere between 16-32 percent of all global GHG emissions. So, imagine if we cut that number in half - that's what we did in our Climate Commitment - a 50 percent reduction in our HVAC product portfolio. Now, imagine if other companies, in other industries like automotive or food production, did the same thing -- half a dozen leading companies could change the world by changing the conversation for their industry. As COP 23 gets underway, it is important for the private sector to share insights, learnings and solutions for addressing global environmental issues as well as reflect on how to increase sustainability efforts. The more we magnify this conversation, the sooner we can gain acceptance of climate-friendly actions that will not only have a lasting, positive impact on business, but also change the world.\~Tweet me: KEYWORDS: Energy, Energy Efficiency, Ingersoll Rand [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/Ingersoll-Randhttp://3blmedia.com/Profiles/Ingersoll-Rand [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6383.phphttp://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6383.php [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.phphttp://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/the-cop23-climate-change-summit-in-bonn-and-why-it-mattershttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/the- HYPERLINK cop23 -climate-change-summit-in-bonn-and-why-it-matters [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://ir.ingersollrand.com/investors/press-releases-and-events/press-releases/news-details/2014/Ingersoll-Rand-to-Cut-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-in-Half-by-2020-Invests-500-Million-in-Energy-Efficiency-to-Address-Climate-Change/default.aspxhttp://ir.ingersollrand.com/investors/press-releases-and-events/press-releases/news-details/2014/Ingersoll-Rand-to-Cut-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-in-Half-by-2020-Invests-500-Million-in-Energy-Efficiency-to-Address-Climate-Change/default.aspx [ 6]: \~ http://www.ingersollrand.com/sustainabilitysupplement/messages_from_leadership/http://www.ingersollrand.com/sustainabilitysupplement/messages_from_leadership/ [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK https://company.ingersollrand.com/strengths/sustainability/our-climate-commitment/ecowise.htmlhttps://company.ingersollrand.com/strengths/sustainability/our-climate-commitment/ecowise.html \l"

Given that cities already account for[5] 75% of the world's energy use and 76% of carbon dioxide emissions, there's a growing focus on how urban planning and design can reduce emissions and help humanity to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Representatives of the world's global powers have gathered in Bonn to attend the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change - more pithily known as COP 23. Working together to affect large-scale change has been the key message of the conference. There has been a groundswell of urban innovation on show[6], largely driven by the mayors and governors of cities and regions, as well as industry leaders and universities interested in promoting opportunities for greener growth. These bodies have formed alliances and networks to develop ideas and strategies around smart mobility, renewable energy, living infrastructure and sustainable urban design. This has been the good news story of COP 23. The conference has given nation states a unique opportunity to work more closely with cities, to plan for climate change. So, in my role as an urban and regional planner (in practice and academia) I spent some time in Bonn finding out about the exciting ways that cities are leading the fight against climate change. 1. Low-carbon precincts One aim is for current and future cities to be powered by 100% renewable electricity. This can be achieved with a combination of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar or hydro, with battery storage and microgrids integrating with national grids as needed. Location, location, location. Marcin Wichary/Flickr[7], CC BY[8] Cities will have integrated transport systems with electric-powered light rail and personal vehicles, while promoting active travel such as walking and cycling. Designing for integrated green precincts will bring greater benefits for local communities than one green building at a time. For example, community recycling and solar programs are more feasible on a larger precinct scale. Of course, there are challenges to overcome. Finding appropriate locations for renewable energy farms that are also acceptable to the local people requires careful consideration of design guidel"

Jerry Brown was named Tuesday as a special envoy to states at the next United Nations Climate Change Conference, further elevating his international profile as a leader on the issue as President Donald Trump backs away from a key international agreement.The announcement of Browns role at the November conference in Bonn, Germany, by Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama comes on the heels of the governors meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks to discuss climate change.I will lean on Gov. Brown to continue to bring the great leadership he has demonstrated time and time again, and to mobilize a strong contingent of like-minded leaders from around the world, to show the world that we mean business, Bainimarama said during a news conference at the historic governors mansion in Sacramento.The four-term governor has made reducing greenhouse gas emissions and boosting green technology a key tenet of his administration. Hes launched non-binding climate change pacts, including the newly formed U.S. Climate Alliance of states committed to upholding the carbon reductions goals in the Paris climate agreement, from which Trump plans to withdraw. Bainimarama on Tuesday joined Fiji in the Under2 Coalition, a pact among cities, states and countries that Brown helped launch in 2015 aimed at keeping the rise of global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius.Bainimarama praised U.S. states commitment to upholding the Paris agreements. He noted Trumps choice to withdraw could bring fireworks to the U.N. conference, known as COP 23.I think the withdrawal of the White House is going to make COP 23 very exciting, he said.Brown wont be the only governor potentially playing an outsize role at the conference. Fellow West Coast Govs. Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington, who also traveled to Sacramento on Tuesday, both plan to attend with other governors in the states Climate Alliance.Were going to play a very important role, Jerry Brown said.The state agreement is a non-binding commitment to uphold the Paris goals, which include reducing the countrys emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels. Many of the 13 states involved already have their own targets in place, and the goal of the coalition is to collaborate and share ideas on using green technology and other means to meet the goal.When the president decided to run up the white flag of surrender to the challenge of climate change, we jumped right into the barricades, Inslee said.\l"

Here's an excerpt: Two US delegations After Trump's decision in June that he wanted to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, all eyes were on the US official delegation to see how they would navigate the negotiations. During the first week of the talks, a civil society group known as the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance called for the US delegation to be barred from attending the negotiations, due to its decision to leave the Paris deal. Meanwhile, a seemingly pointed message was sent on day two of the COP, when Syria announced it would sign the Paris Agreement. This now leaves the US as the only country in the world stating it doesn't intend to honour the landmark deal. However, the delegation itself kept a relatively low profile - bar a now infamous 'cleaner fossil fuels' side event which anti-Trump protesters disrupted for seven minutes, singing: 'We proudly stand up until you keep it in the ground'). The US delegation co-chaired a working group with China on Nationally Determined Contributions (country pledges, often known by the acronym NDCs) with reportedly high success. It's worth noting, though, that many of the US negotiators are the same officials who have been representing the US at COPs for years. They seemingly continued their negotiations with little change in attitude, albeit possibly taking harder stances on issues such as 'loss and damage' and finance. There was a further chaotic appearance in the media centre by Trump adviser George David Banks, who vowed that his priority at COP23 was to fight 'differentiation' (sometimes called 'bifurcation'), namely, the division of countries into industrialised £nnex one' countries and the rest in the UN climate arena. However, beyond this, the behaviour of the US delegation did not differ significantly from previous years. Importantly, though, the official US delegation were not the only group from the US drawing attention at the COP. An alternative 'We Are Still In' delegation set up a large pavilion at their US Climate Action Centre just outside the main venue for the talks. This group included major sub-national actors, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California governor Jerry Brown, keen to prove there are many US voices against Trump's anti-climate policies.

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA100","WCA's Engagement at COP23 in Bonn, Germany","November 6, 2017 Monday 3:14 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Coal Association issued the following news release:The World coal Association (WCA) has been involved in international climate discussions since their inception more than two decades ago. As the WCA prepares to attend another important meeting - the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23) - we look at priorities for the event in Bonn and how the conference plans to engage with the 24 countries that have included low emissions coal technologies in their climate pledges.More than 20,000 people are expected at this year's COP, which starts today. Some people ask why the WCA attends climate talks. WCA believes that for many countries that use coal, especially in emerging Asia, the only realistic pathway is to make sure that they use the most modern coal technologies available today, with enhanced ambition on CCS.Many countries have identified high efficiency low emissions (HELE) technologies as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement.Developing and emerging economies have to meet their energy needs, tackle energy poverty, and reduce emissions. They cannot do all three things without utilising all low emission technologies.China is a remarkable example of the role that affordable coal can play in improving access to energy and supporting economic development. Over the last three decades, according to the World Bank, China has achieved universal access to electricity - 600 million people have been lifted out of poverty and connected to the electricity grid. The link between access to affordable power from coal, economic growth and prosperity is clear. China is also working towards having the world's cleanest coal power system by 2020 by utilising advanced cleaner coal technologies. Another example is India which has made significant deployments of solar power but continues to rely on coal for baseload electricity.The 24 countries that have included HELE in their agreements don't want to sacrifice economic development or their climate obligations. They want to achieve both. Energy security and climate objectives are competing, but integrated priorities.WCA will also be supporting greater action on CCS as well as policy parity with other low emission technologies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made it clear that it is almost impossible, and far more expensive, to reach the below 2 degrees target without significantly scaling up CCS technologies worldwide.WCA would like to see practical solutions to reduce global emissions. Solutions that recognise countries' individual circumstances. Developing economies should be heard at these talks. They are at a point where economic growth is imperative, alongside climate objectives. They need a solution that enables them to achieve both. A solution the WCA believes lies in technology.So at the Bonn talks, WCA will continue to call for policy parity for all low-emissions technologies and also ask for technology neutrality in the Paris Agreement's 'rulebook'. Countries must also be supported in implementing all aspects of their Paris Agreement commitments, including those relating to low emissions coal technologies. This is the only practical approach to reaching our common climate goals.If you'd like to speak with WCA, please email HYPERLINK mailto:media@worldcoal.orgmedia@worldcoal.org[Category: Energy]This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 6, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6064272 MSTRUCK\l"
"COP23","USA","COP23_USA101","AVALANCHES OF GLOBAL WARMING ALARMISM","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Heartland Institute:By Tom Harris, Timothy BallUnited NationsClimate Change ConferenceThroughout the United Nations wrapping up in Bonn, Germany this week, the world has been inundated with the usual avalanche of manmade global warming alarmism. The UN expects us to believe that extreme weather, shrinking sea ice, and sea level rise will soon become much worse if we do not quickly phase out our use of fossil fuels that provide over 80% of the world's energy.There is essentially nothing to support these alarms, of course. We simply do not have adequate observational data required to know or understand what has happened over the past century and a half. Meaningful forecasts of future climate conditions are therefore impossible.Nevertheless, this year's session has been especially intense, since the meeting is being chaired by the island nation of Fiji, a government that has taken climate change fears to extremes.COP23 (the 23rd meeting of the Conference of the Parties on climate change) conference president, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, has called for ""an absolute dedication to meet the 1.5-degree target."" This is the arbitrary and most stringent goal suggested by the Paris Agreement. In support of Bainimarama's position, the COP23/Fiji Website repeatedly cites frightening forecasts made by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).One prediction stated: ""The IPCC recently reported that temperatures will significantly increase in the Sahel and Southern African regions, rainfall will significantly decrease, and tropical storms will become more frequent and intense, with a projected 20 per cent increase in cyclone activity.""To make such dire forecasts, the IPCC relies on computerized models built on data and formulas to represent atmospheric conditions, and reflect the hypothesis that carbon dioxide is the principal factor driving planetary warming and climate change.However, we still do not have a comprehensive, workable ""theory of climate,"" and thus do not have valid formulas to properly represent how the atmosphere functions. We also lack data to properly understand what weather was like over most of the planet even in the recent past. Without a good understanding of past weather conditions, we have no way to know the history, or the future, of average weather conditions what we call the climate.An important data set used by the computer models cited by the IPCC is the ""HadCRUT4"" global average temperature history for the past 167 years. This was produced by the Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, both based in the United Kingdom.Until the 1960s, HadCRUT4 temperature data were collected using mercury thermometers located at weather stations situated mostly in the United States, Japan, the UK, and eastern Australia. Most of the rest of the planet had very few temperature sensing stations, and none of the Earth's oceans (which cover 70% of the planet) had more than occasional stations separated from the next ones by thousands of kilometers of no data. Temperatures over these vast empty areas were simply ""guesstimated.""Making matters even worse, data collected at weather stations in this sparse grid had, at best, an accuracy of +/-0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees F), and oftentimes no better than +/-1.0 degree C. Averaging such poor data in an attempt to determine past or future global conditions cannot yield anything meaningful and certainly nothing accurate or valid enough to use in making critical energy policy decisions.Modern weather station surface temperature data are now collected using precision thermocouples. But, starting in the 1970s, less and less ground surface temperature data was used for plots such as HadCRUT4. Initially, this was done because governments believed satellite monitoring could take over from most of the ground surface data collection.However, the satellites did not show the warming that climate activists and computer models had forecast. So, bureaucrats closed many of the colder rural surface temperature sensing stations, while many stations in the vast frigid area of Siberia were closed for economic and other reasons. The net result was that cold temperature data disappeared from more recent records thereby creating artificial warming trends, the very warming that alarmists predicted, desired and needed for political purposes.Today, we have virtually no data for approximately 85% of the Earth's surface. Indeed, there are fewer weather stations in operation now than there were in 1960.That means HadCRUT4 and other surface temperature computations after about 1980 are meaningless. Combining this with the sensitivity (accuracy) problems in the early data, and the fact that we have almost no long-term data above Earth's surface, the conclusion is unavoidable:It is not possible to know how or whether Earth's climate has varied over the past century and a half. The data are therefore useless for input to the computer models that form the basis of the IPCC's conclusions.Many people think the planet is adequately covered by satellite observations data that is almost global 24/7 coverage and far more accurate than anything determined at weather stations. But the satellites are unable to collect data from the north and south poles, regions that are touted as critical to understanding global warming.Moreover, space-based temperature data collection did not start until 1979, and 30 years of weather data is required to generate a single data point on a climate graph. The satellite record is far too short to allow us to come to any useful conclusions about climate change.In fact, there is insufficient data of any kind temperature, land and sea ice, glaciers, sea level, extreme weather, ocean pH, et cetera to be able to determine how today's climate differs from the past, much less predict the future. The IPCC's climate forecasts have no connection with the real world.Sherlock Holmes warned that ""It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this famous quote for fiction, of course. But it applies perfectly to today's global warming debate, especially where the IPCC's scary conclusions and forecasts are involved. Of course, this will not stop Bainimarama and other conference leaders from citing IPCC ""science"" in support of their warnings of future climate catastrophe.We should use these facts to spotlight and embarrass them every time.\l"
"COP23","USA","COP23_USA102","A GLOBAL ALLIANCE TO PHASE OUT COAL FORMS AT COP23","November 16, 2017 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC):Han Chen In the same week Trump Administration officials tried to convince negotiators at the global COP23 climate conference that more coal use was needed, a global alliance of over two dozen countries, provinces, states and cities has formed to declare a phase-out of coal. Talk about a mic drop.This global Powering Past Coal Alliance was launched just three days after a much-ridiculed event hosted by the Trump Administration touting fossil fuels which many observers noted was a mockery of real efforts to deal with climate change. As former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg noted, the Administration's actions were like showing up to a cancer summit to promote tobacco. (Not surprisingly, US and international participants at the Trump Administration's pro-coal session staged a song and walkout in protest of the event on Monday.)And only three days after that event and walkout, the United Kingdom and Canada were joined by dozens of new partners in the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The countries, provinces, states and cities who joined include Alberta, Angola, Austria, Belgium, British Columbia, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, Fiji, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niue, Ontario, Oregon, Portugal, Quebec, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Vancouver, and WashingtonThe Alliance noted the negative health effects of air pollution from burning coal, such as respiratory diseases and premature deaths, which have massive costs in both human and economic terms. The Alliance also noted that 800,000 people die each year around the world from the pollution generated by burning coal as important reasons to work towards a global coal phase-out.The signatories committed to phasing out coal power that produces carbon emissions and supporting clean power policies and investments, while restricting financing for coal plants. To achieve these goals, the participants will share real-world examples and best practices on how to phase-out of coal, scale up climate financing, and develop clean energy plans and targets. There are many lessons which can be shared. For instance, the UK has transitioned from getting 40 percent of its electricity from coal in 2012 to getting only 2 percent of its electricity from coal in July 2017. That's a massive decrease in the span of only five years. In fact, in April 2017 the UK had its first full day without coal use in 135 years.So what's next? The Alliance hopes to expand from 25 to 50 partners by the COP24 climate conference next year. The US states of Oregon and Washington have already joined the alliance. With several other states in the U.S. already coal-free, having leaders of other U.S. states join this alliance could be a vital opportunity for us to demonstrate that Americans are ""still in"" the Paris Agreement, despite President Trump's attempt to dismantle US climate policies.\l"

A great many people in Fiji will benefit from this project, which will cost a total of approximately USD 400 million, and I am grateful to the EIB for its support and its foresight. Financing of projects to build resiliency in developing countries is critical, and I sincerely hope that this project can serve as a model for other developing countries that wish to access blended financing on behalf of their own people,"" said Frank Bainimarama Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23.More than 275,000 people living around the capital city of Suva will benefit from the new EIB-financed water investment that will both help to improve current service levels and reduce leakages and enable quicker resumption of water supply following cyclones.The scheme includes construction of a new water-treatment plant and upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities, as well as improving and expanding water networks. Once complete, the scheme is expected to support a number of sustainable development goals including health, economic development and sustainable urban growth.The new water investment is also financed by the Government of Fiji, Asian Development Bank and Green Climate Fund.

This critical need has led many at COP23 to ask how can we accelerate renewable energy development.While several ideas have been put forth this week, one in particular resonates strongly: Involve more women.Women working in the energy sector hold disproportionately fewer leadership positions globally: Women hold 24 percent of senior management roles globally and only 14 percent of senior management positions at the top 200 worldwide power and utility companies. We at the Clinton Climate Initiatives Islands Energy Program, which is helping island nations transition to renewable energy, have found women to be key drivers of clean energy efforts. To ensure that the clean energy sector develops the most innovate solutions to climate change possible, we need a greater diversity of perspectives&#8202;&#8202;including the perspectives of women&#8202;&#8202;at the highest levels of leadership. Our team has seen many women managing key processes of clean energy projects in the island nations we work, yet are not recognized with the formal leadership roles they need in order to deliver greatest impact.Women represent an untapped talent that could&#8202;&#8202;if harnessed&#8202;&#8202;accelerate clean energy development. The absence of women at the top isnt only an injustice. Its a climate change risk.In February 2016, the Clinton Climate Initiative founded the first network of its kind to empower rising women leaders working in island energy sectors&#8202;&#8202;the Women in Renewable Energy Network (WIRE Network). The WIRE Network provides a common platform for women working in islands to support and mentor each other. It also offers technical and leadership skills development opportunities for women looking to propel their careers faster and further.In its first year, the WIRE Network grew to over 350 members, and several of the WIRE Networks mentoring program participants received promotions that they directly attributed to their growth through participating in the network. Motivated by their mentors, Jamaican Transmission and Distribution Engineer Tanya Hylton earned her Project Management Professional certification, a license needed to advance her career, and Hannah Olmberg-Soesman recently became Chief Executive Officer of a solar company and led an all-woman solar energy installation in rural Suriname.The WIRE Network is not alone in recognizing gender inclusion as an imperative, and at COP23 41 organizations have united together under the common belief that empowering women is key to transitioning to clean energy. This coalition is launching the Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) People-Centered Accelerator, bringing together a group of like-minded partners who are committed to seeing the full and equal participation of women, from CEOs to rural farmers, in promoting clean energy efforts globally.SEforALL works directly with the United Nations to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, and they see women as key to achieving this objective. Its also critical to advancing UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 on Access to Energy, which aims to engage all people&#8202;&#8202;both men and women&#8202;&#8202;to achieve access to sustainable and reliable energy for all.As we celebrate COP23s Gender Day, we&#8202;&#8202;all 41 organizations&#8202;&#8202;recognize that we can only achieve our climate change interventions with the full participation of women. We commit to empowering women, and thereby safeguarding our planet.\l"

In terms of climate action, California and more than a dozen other [U.S.] states are taking real action. I'm looking forward to forging agreements with various provinces in Canada and particularly in zero-emission vehicles -- electric cars, hydrogen cars,"" said Governor Brown at the opening of today's meeting. ""I'm hoping Canada, California and the rest of America can really commit to developing the technologies that will allow us to have zero-emission vehicles be a big part of our future.""""It's a real pleasure to meet with Governor Brown, an opportunity to talk about all the great connections between California and Canada,"" said Prime Minister Trudeau.

However, plans by the Trump administration to promote coal as a solution to climate change has angered many who will be attending the climate meeting. The White House confirmed on Thursday it was sending a delegation of ""negotiators"" to the UN climate meeting, scheduled to last for two weeks. In June, Trump announced the U.S. was pulling out of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord but under the rules, the U.S. cannot leave the agreement until 2020.It has also been learned, according to the BBC,[1] that the White House is also supporting an event to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power, headed up by speakers from coal giant Peabody Energy and others. The plan is to show how coal and other fossil fuels can help in curbing the impacts of rising temperatures. In a statement, a White House spokesman said the presentation and discussion will build on the administration's attempts to promote fossil fuels at the G20 meeting[2] that was held in July this year. ""It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean,"" the spokesman said. The absurdity of the claimsThe Trump program, entitled 'The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,' will also feature NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter besides Peabody Coal. 'As the world seeks to reduce emissions while promoting economic prosperity, fossil fuels will continue to play a central role in the energy mix,' a preview of the Nov. 13 presentation says, reports the New York Times.[3] Barry K. Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, will also be a speaker, and he says he plans to ""deliver a dose of reality"" to a forum dominated by activists demanding an end to coal, oil, and gas. Worthington argues there are 'no credible projections' showing fossil fuels will meet less than 40 percent of global energy demand by 2050. Worthington says his message to the delegates will be a 'horrible experience' but it is important for many to hear. 'The reality of it is the world is going to continue to use fossil fuels,'' he said, £nd if I can throw myself on the hand grenade to help people realize that, I'm willing to do it.' 'This discussion is a follow-up to the Administration's success at the G20, where the United States expressed its support for helping countries meet their climate objectives through the use of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and other clean energy sources and technologies,' White House spokesman Raj Shah, said in a statement. 'It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean. Through innovation, the United States continues to be a global leader in cutting carbon emissions.' Anger and dismay over U.S. promotion of fossil fuelsIn addition to a number of lawmakers voicing their distaste for the White House stunt, critics worldwide are calling it a ""poke in the eye of the international community."" Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, says fossil fuels are hurting, not helping the world's poorest countries. 'Any country or company continuing to champion further exploration for and mining of coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be willfully carrying out a crime against humanity, and they would be held accountable,' he said.

Fiji is presiding over COP23 in Bonn with the support of the German government. More information on COP23 can be found here.Previous meetings have produced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, which serves as the basis for standards on climate action and lowering carbon emissions.Appointed by Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, the 11-member COP23 delegation will share Episcopal Church resolutions on climate change and information about the church and its ministries centered on ecojustice. Led by Diocese California Bishop Marc Andrus, the delegation will offer a spiritual presence through daily interfaith prayer and worship, and by encouraging active churchwide participation by Episcopalians through virtual participation and social media.""Our goals are to build on the work done at previous conferences by urging member states to implement the Paris Agreement and pay particular attention to developing nations and the poor,"" said the Rev. Canon Charles Robertson, canon to the presiding bishop for ministry beyond the Episcopal Church, in a press release.Robertson said the delegation also hopes to ""network within the accredited and public zones of the conference to spread the word about what the Episcopal Church is doing on climate issues.""In addition, the delegation hopes its efforts will ""raise awareness across the Episcopal Church of the importance of engaging on climate change as Christians,"" according to Robertson, and ""digitally engage Episcopalians in that work.""This event marks the third Episcopal delegation to attend a COP meeting. A delegation attended COP21 in Paris in 2015, advocating for an agreement aligning with General Convention resolutions related to climate change. In 2016, a delegation traveled to Marrakesh, Morocco, for COP22, which focused on implementing the Paris Agreement and birthed the ""We're Still In [the Paris Agreement]"" movement.The Paris Agreement, which went into effect Nov. 4, 2016, calls on the countries of the world to limit carbon emissions, which will require a decrease in dependence on fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources; and for developed countries, those responsible for the majority of emissions both historically and today, to commit to $100 billion in development aid annually by 2020 to developing countries.The agreement, which is a legally binding agreement, established specific actions and targets for reducing greenhouse gases emissions, mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, and financing mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries. Signatory countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius and to make strong efforts to keep the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The Bonn meeting takes place against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's oft-repeated promise to fulfill his campaign vow to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and curb the country's commitment to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. According to the agreement's rule, the United States cannot actually withdraw until 2020.He claimed in his initial June 1 announcement that the pact was bad for the U.S. economy but said he might be open to renegotiating its terms to be more ""pro-American.""

His approach to climate issues has created deep skepticism on the global stage.Democrats \£f including senators and governors \£f traveled to Bonn this week to make the case that states and the private sector are committed to the Paris deal despite the Trump administration's approach to the issue.But Banks argued that the administration would remain active in international efforts to overhaul the energy sector, even with its focus on fossil fuels and nuclear power.""The United States will truly support an £ll of the above' approach and maintain a leadership role in innovation on all energy fronts,"" he said.""All this is to say we believe that there is a rational way forward that does not force countries to choose between mitigation and development and energy security. This is the U.S.'s vision for a balanced approach,"" he said.The United States's panel discussion \£f the Trump administration's only official event of the 11-day climate conference \£f was a tense one, with questions from the audience ranging from fossil fuel financing to a Trump tweet alleging climate change is a Chinese hoax.Banks sat alongside fossil fuel and nuclear industry officials \£f as well as a former Obama administration State Department diplomat \£f for the U.S.'s presentation. At one point, a large group of protesters interrupted the event for about five minutes, singing a rendition of Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA,"" rewritten with anti-coal lyrics.Amos Hochstein, an Obama administration energy diplomat who currently works for a natural gas firm, at one point admonished protesters to listen to the U.S.'s position.""If you really care about clean air, if you really care about climate change, then we have to stop siloing ourselves into communities where we're only talking to ourselves,"" he said.""We are only going to be able to move forward if we actually have this kind of conversation together,"" he said.\l"

""The Bonn climate talks put substance over style. Negotiators made steady progress on important details of the Paris Agreement and laid the groundwork for greater acceleration next year. The stage is set to finalize the rules that underpin the Paris Agreement in 2018 and for countries to commit by COP24 to enhance their national climate plans by 2020.""Bonn saw good progress, but negotiators have a lot of homework to do. Countries will need to intensify talks next year to navigate critical and sensitive topics such as transparency, accounting and raising ambition over time.""An appeal for developed countries to ramp up their climate efforts before 2020 became an unexpectedly prominent topic at the talks. Delegates reached common ground by agreeing to form special stocktaking sessions to review progress towards curbing emissions and delivering on climate finance in the immediate term.""The Fiji Presidency unveiled a roadmap for the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue, a year-long process to assess progress and identify opportunities for countries to make bolder commitments. As the birth place for nationally determined contributions (NDCs), Poland can demonstrate leadership alongside Fiji by facilitating a smooth path on the next round of national climate commitments.""As climate change intensifies, so too will its devastating impacts on the world's most vulnerable people. In Bonn, negotiators linked the Adaptation Fund to the Paris Agreement. This financial institution provides critical support to help developing countries manage climate impacts. Both the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund saw new pledges that will enable them to continue their work supporting urgent to support urgent adaptation needs in vulnerable countries. Negotiators also established an expert dialogue to identify ways in which to support countries facing loss and damage.""""Outside the negotiating rooms, a broad range of voices continue to show strong support for climate action. We heard from companies like HP, Mars, and Wal-Mart, which are among over 320 major companies that have committed to or have already set science-based emissions targets. The Global Covenant of Mayors brings together 7,500 cities and local government with the potential to reduce the equivalent of 1.7 billion tons of emissions.""Having already abandoned its leadership role on climate, the Trump administration appears to be living in an alternate universe with its focus on fossil fuels. Now that the United States is the only nation that is not on board with the Paris Agreement, the Trump Administration should carefully consider whether being completely isolated on the climate issue really benefits the American people.""While the U.S. official presence was subdued in the negotiations, the country's subnational climate action was on full display. The America's Pledge report shows that a coalition of U.S. states, cities and businesses - equivalent to more than half of the U.S. economy and population - are committed to carry climate action forward.""We are living in unusual and alarming times. The latest studies show that global emissions are again on the rise and the world is off track of where it needs to be. In the coming months, we need a greater sense of urgency to make the deep shifts needed in our economies to address the climate challenge. 2018 needs to be the year that all countries and leaders across sectors step up.""This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 18, 2017.Contact: Rhys Gerholdt, senior communications manager, 202/729-7639, HYPERLINK Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6081501 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA125","BONN: CLIMATE ENGINEERING IS RISKY, BUT SHOULD BE EXPLORED, EXPERTS SAY AT UN CONFERENCE","November 16, 2017 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations:Climate engineering, or climate intervention, is risky but needs to be explored as a supplement not as a 'Plan B' to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, said experts at the United Nations Climate Change ConferenceCOP23), in Bonn, Germany.Climate engineering, also referred to as geoengineering, is the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the climate system with measures including carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere or solar radiation management.We can do a lot, we have to do a lot, we have to try much harder at cutting our emissions, but there will remain certain emissions, especially in the land use sector, which are not going away. So we actually need to start talking about this removal of greenhouse gases inevitably, said Matthias Honegger, research scientist with the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, at a press conference.Different approaches are being discussed. Some already exist, like planting trees. Other ideas include dispersing certain minerals in the oceans to enhance the growth of algae, which then as they sink to the ocean floor, would create a net flux of carbon from the atmosphere into the oceans.Business as usual is a little worrying, said Dr. Hugh Hunt, from the Department of Engineering at Cambridge University. The concept of not doing anything is full of danger. Now the concept of cooling the planet is full of danger as well.We need to have full-on public engagement, full-on societal involvement. The reason is that the risks of climate change are huge, the risks of doing nothing are huge; but the risks of geoengineering are huge as well. We've got to explore those risks, because who knows, we may end up entering a very risky world without understanding it, he added. Geoengineering risks are not well understood and need to be explored.Stratospheric aerosol injectionDue to the great uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects of climate engineering including the risk of disrupting natural systems experts think that there is a need to discuss climate engineering governance, especially as it relates to stratospheric aerosol injection.Stratospheric aerosol injection consists of injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere with aircraft or balloons to create a global dimming effect.This technology is absolutely terrifying. We may actually need it, but then, who do we want to decide. That's where this society-wide discussion has to take place, said Janos Pasztor, Executive Director of the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative (C2G2), and former UN senior climate advisor. It would require a level of international cooperation that we have not yet seen.Who will decide whether we should make use of stratospheric aerosol injection and when that decision should take place? [...] Who will make that decision on behalf of the world? And then how far do we turn the thermostat of the global air conditioning system [...] to cool the planet? he said.There are issues: the more temperature you want to reduce the higher the chance there will be negative impact and the higher the chance that some of these impacts will not be the same across different geographical zones. You might end up in a situation where some people benefit from the reduced temperature but some people would have negative impacts. What do you do with those people? How do you compensate them? How do you take care of them? he added.Mr. Pasztor concluded that the highest priority should remain the gas emission reduction. But we have to consider these other options, as supplements, not as a 'Plan B,' he warned.\l"

Since then a lot has changed (both positive and negative). As leaders meet in Bonn, Germany for the next round of international climate negotiations there will be several key issues on the table. This meeting will set the tone for how leaders will come together in the era of President Trump and show that they are prepared to carry forward climate action. Here are four key themes to watch at COP 23 (the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC): While President Trump has announced his intention to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, we\' ve witnessed a resounding revolt in the U.S. to that decision (as our new issue brief documents) by Governors, Mayors, business leaders, and citizens. States are committing to expand renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cleaner transportation. Mayors are committing to go to power their cities with 100% renewable energy and are finding ways to use energy more efficiently. Business leaders are committing to power their companies with 100% renewable energy and to ensure that their supply-chains are helping solve climate change, not make it worse. At the climate conference, we will see a much larger contingent of U.S. sub-national leaders than typically comes to these meetings. They are showing up in force with one clear message: Trump may be trying to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, but we are still in and committed to helping deliver on America\' s climate targets. 2. Countries are acting at home Key countries are showing that they aren\' t just waiting for the future to implement new actions to reduce their emissions and meet their Paris targets. While not all countries are yet on track to meet their targets, we have seen noticeable progress in some of the world\' s biggest emitting countries. Here are some examples (from our new issue briefs on key countries): China has made significant progress towards its Paris targets. Coal consumption has remained relatively flat since its peak in 2013, and China\' s wind and solar energy deployment continue to grow at the fastest pace in the world. India is on track to achieve and exceed its Paris climate commitments. In just one year, from 2016 to 2017, India increased its renewable energy capacity by 11.3 gigawatts (GW) making critical progress towards its target to install 100 GW of solar, 60 GW wind, and 15 GW of biogas by 2022. Mexico has been making progress on climate change policies both domestically and internationally, but the country must increase its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy resources if it is to meet its target. Japan needs to raise the ambition of its emissions reduction target and stop its rapid expansion of new coal power plants. Canada unveiled the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change Canada\' s first truly comprehensive climate action plan. However, enhanced climate policies are still needed to fulfill Canada\' s international obligations. European Union is making progress towards its target through its 2030 climate and energy framework. While member states\' carbon targets for 2030 are a step in the right direction, more action is needed to ensure the EU\' s target is realized and even overachieved. Brazil has put forward some actions to help meet this target, but recent political developments in the country have led to a spike in deforestation rates and threats to protected areas, which may hamper national progress in mitigation. And these actions are starting to show up in global emissions data. Prior to 2014, global emissions of carbon dioxide had been growing at a significant pace adding roughly 0.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) per year between 2005 and 2014 (with some occasional annual variation). But between 2014 and 2016, these emissions have remained essentially flat. 3. Paris Agreement  rulebook matters a great deal The Paris Agreement established the essential foundations for how the world is going to advance international climate action for decades to come. Critical to its continued success will be ensuring that the  rulebook for the Paris Agreement helps to ensure that countries meet their targets and creates incentives for countries to beat their targets. Countries agreed to finalize the details of the Paris rulebook next year, so this year\' s meeting needs to ensure strong progress towards building a system of strong rules to help ensure that the promise of the Paris Agreement is translated into reality in the years ahead. This includes making significant progress in Bonn towards defining rules around: An  enhanced transparency and accountability system so that countries report progress towards their targets every two years; Spurring countries to announce stronger emissions reduction targets in the coming years; and The detailed information that countries will provide as they announce future targets so that we can be sure that we fully understand the environmental implications of their new targets. 4. More needs to be done: the Paris targets are the floor, not the ceiling of ambition While significant progress is being made by many key countries to meet their target, stronger action will be needed in the coming years if we are going to be on a safer climate trajectory. A recent report from U.N. Environment states it clearly:  there is an urgent need for accelerated short-term action and enhanced longer-term national ambition, if the goals of the Paris Agreement are to remain achievable  . Recognizing this dynamic, the Paris Agreement created a dynamic process for countries to adopt more aggressive commitments starting in 2020. We were confident after Paris that countries would find that they could commit to strengthened targets in the coming years. Countries will need to be prepared to announce even stronger targets in the years to come. There are emerging positive signs that some key countries will be in a position to deliver even greater ambition than they promised in 2015. \l"

In the hours remaining, WWF urges parties to resolve the issues still pending.A year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, negotiations over the past two weeks have seen countries come to agreement on critical issues of pre-2020 action and support, and the role of gender, local communities and Indigenous Peoples in climate action. However, much remains to be done to ensure we seize the small window of opportunity we have to achieve the objectives of this landmark climate accord. Governments must strengthen urgent action, finalize the Paris Agreement rulebook and decide collectively to review and strengthen ambition of post-2020 climate commitments urgently.""From the onset, the paradoxes at this COP have been many. Negotiators have gathered in Bonn under a Fiji Presidency and, as states deliberate on future action, cities, regions, businesses and communities have stepped up their efforts toward achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. We also saw that despite the momentum seen in the corridors in Bonn, domestically countries are still falling behind"" said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, head of WWF's global climate and energy programme. ""In a year marked by extreme weather disasters and potentially the first increase in carbon emissions in four years, the paradox between what we are doing and need to be delivering is clear: countries must act with greater climate ambition, and soon, to put us on a path to a 1.5degreeC future.""By raising the profile of pre-2020 action in the UNFCCC process, and agreeing on the design of a process to review and increase ambition through the Talanoa Dialogue, COP23 has provided important building blocks to move the spirit of the Paris Agreement forward. But success is far from guaranteed. The Polish presidency must complement, and aim to bolster, Fiji's efforts to accelerate progress towards finalizing the Rulebook that will guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement and ensure scaled up, predictable finance for developing countries, including for loss and damage.""Two years ago, countries around the world were entrusted with an important mandate in Paris. Today, they are making progress but with the impacts of climate change accelerating, the pace and scale of the response is still insufficient. It is time to show bolder vision, innovation, and urgent action - domestically and on the international front - and build on the clear momentum we are seeing in our societies and economies already. We look to Poland to continue Fiji's legacy to translate the ambition and vision of the Paris Agreement into reality,"" added Pulgar-Vidal.Countries are not the only ones taking action. Through the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, efforts underway by states and non-State actors - including cities, regions, business, investors, and civil society - to galvanize climate action were in the spotlight at COP23 in Bonn. The WWF 'PandaHub' Pavilion hosted a full programme of dialogues and events to showcase the value of collaboration and innovation to create a sustainable, resilient future for all.In addition, the U.S. Climate Action Center brought together over 100 prominent leaders from U.S. state and local governments, private sector and academia showing the U.S.' commitment to remaining a global frontrunner in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. WWF is one of many organizations supporting the new generation of climate leaders who comprise the ""We Are Still In"" movement, the largest U.S. coalition ever assembled in support of climate action. ""Never before has a coalition of American business, state and local leaders come together under a common banner to drive climate action,"" said Lou Leonard, WWF's senior vice president of climate change and energy. ""By working together, they can ensure that the United States meets its commitment under the Paris Agreement while creating new jobs and creating a safer future for communities in America and around the world.""The 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the UNFCCC will take place from 3-14 December 2018, in Katowice, Poland.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 17, 2017.

The announcement was made at a ceremony recognizing Fiji as the latest government to join the Under2 Coalition and Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama as the incoming COP23 president.  The \' America First' doctrine should put our children first. Future generations will judge us not on the facts of global climate change, but what we've done to tackle it, Governor Kate Brown said.  Strengthening the commitment to combat climate change sends a strong message to our global allies. The Paris Agreement is a blueprint from job creation and prosperity, and despite the decision by the White House to retreat, I will continue to work with leaders on the West Coast, across the country, and around the world in pursuit of greenhouse gas reduction goals and working toward the development of a greener, cleaner energy mix of the future."" The Under2 Coalition is an international pact among cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius \- the level of potentially catastrophic consequences \- by either reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels, or holding emissions to less than 2 annual metric tons per capita by 2050. With the addition of Fiji, the coalition now includes 176 jurisdictions on six continents collectively representing more than 36 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to more than 16 percent of the global population and more than 39 percent of the global economy.  As the incoming President of COP23, Fiji looks forward to working with this group of states and regions in the global effort to advance climate action at every level of society, said Prime Minister Bainimarama. ""This is true now more than ever following the Trump Administration's announcement that the U.S. will be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. This decision has redoubled our commitment to forge a Grand Coalition that includes all levels of government, businesses and civil society, to take climate action forward with the urgency it deserves. We look forward Governor Brown's help in mobilising like-minded leaders from around the world in support of our goal to achieve concrete outcomes at COP23. At today's ceremony, Governor Kate Brown, California Governor Jerry Brown, and Washington Governor Inslee were the first U.S. state leaders to announce that they will participate in COP23 as part of a delegation of U.S. governors that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a partnership formed in response to the White House's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. The alliance now includes 13 U.S. states \- led by both Democrats and Republicans \- committed to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan.

At a pavilion at the talks, a group of more than 40 organizations and 2,584 individuals using the slogan We Are Still In will demonstrate the United States' resolve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite President Trump's announcement that he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the group said. A Republican elected leader, Native American tribes, five counties, and 213 churches and congregations today signed on to the We Are Still In declaration. ""It's critical for the world to know that the U.S. will continue to lead on climate change -- and that we can fulfill our Paris commitments even without help from Washington,"" said Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor and U.N. special envoy for cities and climate change, in a statement. ""By pitching a big tent in Bonn, we are providing space for American mayors, governors and business leaders to collaborate with their counterparts around the world,"" he added. The pavilion is the first to be sponsored exclusively by nonfederal agents and will provide space for exhibitions starting Nov. 9. Its sponsors include Bloomberg Philanthropies and NextGen America. A large number of state governors, mayors and council members along with private leaders plan to travel to Bonn for the 23rd Conference of the Parties, including U.S. Climate Alliance members Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D). The We Are Still In campaign has garnered bipartisan support with signatories in all 50 states since it launched following Trump's Paris withdrawal announcement. Its membership is composed of nine states, 252 cities and counties, 1,780 businesses and investors, 339 colleges and universities, and 213 communities of faith -- all totaling $6.2 trillion of the U.S. economy.\l"

Recent climate disasters in Puerto Rico expose this immoral behavior. After suffering two hurricanes (Irma and Maria), the US administration blocked any form of assistance to rebuild the island, only allowing its corporations. For Jes\'fas V\'e1zquez Negr\'f3n from Puerto Rico, who was attending the people's mobilizations parallel to the 23rd edition of the Conference of Parties (COP23) in Bonn, climate change is real. ""We are here to remind the world that the change must be systemic. That is why the proposal of systemic change proposed by La Via Campesina, a global grassroots movement and alliance, is crucial.' The peasant struggle is not just about climate resilience - which is an act of resistance in itself. It is also a global fight against the expansion of agribusiness, which relies on free trade agreements. There is an urgent need to critically question the mass production of meat[1] and reduce the import of feed from the global south to Europe. To make sure they keep growing despite global climate change, transnational corporations have developed their own ways - false solutions such as blue carbon, REDD [1] mechanism and climate smart agriculture. Another issue that is generally undermined in climate change debates is migration. There are today more than ever before a growing number of climate-migrants. According to Massa Kon\'e9 of the Global Convergence of Land and Water Struggles - West Africa, the climate and the migrantion crisis are the two sides of the same coin. ' It is those who try to contain migrations who have also provoked it! It is their false solutions that are taking over our land, disturb our rainfall, that create wars! This is why migration increases everyday', says Kon\'e9. The good news is that the debates have a strong youth movement that is leading the struggle in various places of the globe, as they are the future of humanity. 'We are the present for a better future and we will not give up, but continue to defend the interests of the peasants, the whole society, for a social transformation. We, peasants across the world, firmly reject the industrial model of agriculture which is at the very root of climate change', says young French peasant Fanny Metrat of Confederation Paysanne. 'We are the ones who can cool the planet and feed the world', she added. There have been many COPs before and many more will follow, but their impact on public policies is minor. Sustainable development, green economy, REDD are the buzzwords of capitalism being hammered these days in Bonn. But social movements expect governments and multinationals around the negotiating table to deliver real solutions. To change the system, grassroots and peasant movements have to keep growing and establish more alliances. Our governments do not realize the urgency of the situation but the peasantry suffers from it on a daily basis. Food sovereignty and peasant agroecology - which should be understood in the context of national sovereignty - are the true solutions to build their resilience and resistance.

""California welcomes Armenia to this growing coalition and together, we will continue to drive the change that will get us to the climate goals we have to reach.""With the addition of Armenia, the Under2 Coalition now includes 188 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.2 billion people and $28.9 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and 39 percent of the global economy. The coalition, formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action in the lead up to COP 21, pledges to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.""Armenia is pleased to endorse and express support to sovereign nations and regional governments of the world united by the Under2 Coalition. We commend the efforts by our partner - the State of California and the Governor Brown, in building this remarkable coalition of governments and peoples concerned about our planet's future,"" said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for International Economic Integration and Reforms Gabrielyan.Armenia signed on to the Under2 Coalition today during a meeting between Governor Brown and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for International Economic Integration and Reforms Gabrielyan, becoming the 18th nation to join.California's Climate LeadershipGovernor Brown, who was named Special Advisor for States and Regions by the president of this year's United Nations (), continues to build strong coalitions of partners committed to curbing carbon pollution in both the United States through the U.S. Climate Alliance and around the globe with the Under2 Coalition. The Governor has also launched America's Pledge on climate change with Michael Bloomberg to help compile and quantify the actions of states, cities and businesses in the U.S. to drive down emissions. In September 2018, the State of California will convene the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, where representatives from subnational governments, businesses and civil society will gather with the direct goal of supporting the Paris Agreement. Next month, the Governor will take part in a number of events in Europe focused on fighting global warming, including a climate symposium organized by the Vatican and COP 23 in Bonn, Germany.Last month, Governor Brown signed an agreement with the leaders of Quebec and Ontario to officially integrate their cap-and-trade programs. This followed a week of events and meetings tied to Climate Week NYC, the Yale Climate Conference and the UN General Assembly, during which the Governor met with the UN Secretary-General, opened Climate Week NYC 2017 and discussed subnational climate action from governments and the business community at events with other global leaders.Earlier this year, Governor Brown signed landmark legislation that extends and improves the state's world-leading cap-and-trade program and establishes a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. In recent years, Governor Brown has signed legislation establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; setting the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; directing cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems; and requiring the state to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings.More information about the Under2 Coalition can be found at HYPERLINK http://www.under2MOU.orgwww.under2MOU.org.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6035159 MSTRUCK\l"

Gov. Jerry Brown is taking up the mantle of chief U.S. advocate for action on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions as the leader of the world's sixth-largest economy.Shortly after Trump made his decision, the governor announced that he will travel to China on June 2 to ""strengthen California's long-standing, climate, clean energy and economic ties with the nation."" While in the country, he plans to visit Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces, which are members of the Under2 Coalition, a group of 170 cities, states and countries that have pledged to slash emissions 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050 in a bid to limit the rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees C or less.California and the German state of Baden-W\'fcrttemberg co-founded the Under2 Coalition in 2015 ahead of COP21 in Paris. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions, representing about 89 million people, or 28% of the U.S. population, have joined the Under2 Coalition, according to Brown's office.Brown will then fly to Europe to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, or COP 23.""Donald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course,"" Brown said in a June 1 statement. ""He's wrong on the facts. America's economy is boosted by following the Paris Agreement. He's wrong on the science. Totally wrong. California will resist this misguided and insane course of action. Trump is AWOL but California is on the field, ready for battle.""The governor's comments came as California lawmakers advanced a flurry of clean energy and environmental measures billed as ""Trump insurance,"" including legislation that would set a goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2045. It would also accelerate the state's current 50% renewables portfolio standard by four years, to 2026, and set a new 60% requirement for 2030.""Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement confirms that Washington is retreating from being a global leader,"" Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\'f3n, the bill's author, said in a June 1 statement, echoing comments made at recent press conferences in Sacramento and Anaheim.

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA148","CLIMATE CHANGE MINISTER CLAIRE PERRY LAUNCHES POWERING PAST COAL ALLIANCE AT COP23","November 16, 2017 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government:Global alliance, launched by UK and Canada, to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to the use of unabated coal power.An alliance of nations and states committed to moving the world from burning coal to cleaner power sources was launched today (16 November 2017) by more than 20 partners at COP23, the United Nations climate change talks.The UK was one of the first countries to commit to ending unabated coal power generation by 2025. In July 2012, our generation profile still included 40% coal. In July this year, this fell to 2% and in April, the UK had its first full day when no coal was used for 135 years.The Powering Past Coal Alliance plans to grow to 50 or more members by this time next year. Its ambition is to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to unabated coal power. The members of the alliance commit to taking action such as setting coal phase out targets, committing to no further investments in coal-fired electricity in their jurisdictions or abroad.Unabated coal is the generation of electricity from a coal plant without any treatment to reduce substantially the emissions of carbon dioxide. It emits twice as much CO2 as gas per unit of electricity.The announcement comes as the UK government prepares to launch its flagship Industrial Strategy to get the economy firing while building on its strengths like clean growth and embracing the opportunities of technological change.Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry, said:Reducing global coal consumption should be a vital and urgent priority for all countries and states. Unabated coal is the dirtiest, most polluting way of generating electricity.The Powering Past Coal Alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed. The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2025 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit.Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said:Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health, and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities, with close to a million people dying every year from coal pollution. I'm thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy and this is only the beginning.The new coalition will work with businesses, civil society and governments to offer technical and practical help to accelerate the transition away from coal. However, it recognises that not all countries can completely phase out the use of unabated coal at the same rate.To stay below the 2C target agreed as part of the Paris accord 2 years ago, OECD countries across the world need to phase out coal by 2030 and global use will need to reduce by two-thirds by 2040. Today's launch of the alliance comes after British Prime Minister Theresa May reiterated the UK's commitment to phase out unabated coal by 2025 in a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September.In its first meeting, the alliance agreed that transitioning away from coal-fired electricity is one of the most important steps the international community can take to meet the aims of the historic Paris agreement at which the UK played a leading role 2 years ago.The UK has already begun its transition away from coal, in part as a result of renewable energy sources becoming cost effective. Offshore wind, for example, is now half the cost it was 2 years ago. Since 1990, the UK has reduced its emissions by 42%, while growing our economy by 67%. This is in no small part due to the 85% reduction in coal use we've seen in that time.However, domestic action alone is not enough. It is important that we restrict financing for coal projects abroad. The UK government announced in 2014 that it would end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances. UK Export Finance has not supported a coal project since 2002.Powering Past Coal Alliance declaration (PDF, 209KB, 2 pages)Share this pageShare on Facebook Share on TwitterDocument informationFrom: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Claire Perry MPPart of: Climate change international action Canada\l"

Carbon capture and storage or use can play a key role in the transition to low-carbon economic growth and development in many parts of the world.""Echoing these comments, Energy Future Initiative Distinguished Associate, Dr Julio Friedmann, said current policies in most jurisdictions were biased and short-sighted.""All the benefits commonly cited for renewables and nuclear, such as native industrial support, cost reduction, and emissions reduction, apply to CCS/CCUS as well. Attention must be paid, and speed is needed.""The Global Status of CCS: 2017, includes a commentary from Australia's Ambassador for the Environment, Patrick Suckling, who says we must pull all levers to implement the Paris Agreement.""Without CCUS, the IPCC says the cost of meeting global targets will double and the IEA says the energy transition would cost US$3.5 trillion more.Achieving the Paris Agreement's goals will require a renewed focus on international CCS/CCUS collaboration. A renewed push would provide governments with the confidence to develop technology neutral energy and climate change policies that provide incentives to all emissions reduction technologies, including CCUS. This will help to ensure our energy and industrial sectors are affordable and reliable as we transition to a lower emissions future.""Also writing in the Report, the Father of the phrase ""global warming"", Colombia University Professor, Wallace Smith Broecker, said the dependence on fossil fuels will come to an end and the world will be powered by renewables.""But as this energy utopia lies many decades in the future, by the time we arrive there, we will be saddled with an atmosphere laden with excess CO2. Garbage brought disease to our streets. We learned to dispose of it. Sewage poisoned our waters. We learned to treat it. CO2 threatens to change our climate. Hence, we must learn how to capture and bury it.""Key highlights from the Global Status of CCS: 2017 are: To reach Paris climate targets: more than 2000 CCS facilities will be needed by 2040 14 per cent of cumulative emissions reductions must be derived from CCS; There are now 17 large-scale CCS facilities operating globally, with four more coming onstream in 2018; Current CO2 capture is 37 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) - equivalent to removing eight million cars from the road each year; CCS is the only clean technology capable of decarbonising industry - steel, chemicals, cement, fertilisers, pulp and paper, coal and gas-fired powered generation; To date, more than 220 million tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 has been safely and permanently injected deep underground; In Asia and the Pacific (APAC), 11 CCS facilities are in varying stages of development including eight in China; In Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), four large scale facilities are operating successfully (two in Norway and two in the Middle East), with two more in early development in the United Kingdom); Twelve of the 17-large scale facilities in operation are located in the United States and Canada and two of those came onstream in the past twelve months (Petra Nova and Illinois Industrial);  CCS is now proving its versatility across five industrial sectors in the United States - natural gas processing, power, fertiliser, hydrogen and biofuels; On a like-for-like basis, CCS is cheaper than intermittent renewables and costs continue to fall.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 13, 2017.Contact: Antonios Papaspiropoulos, +61 401 944 478, HYPERLINK mailto:antonios.papaspiropoulos@globalccsinstitute.comantonios.papaspiropoulos@globalccsinstitute.com; Annya Schneider, +32 (0) 25503972, HYPERLINK mailto:annya.schneider@globalccsinstitute.comannya.schneider@globalccsinstitute.comCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6072384 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA152","UN Climate Conference - ICS Has Vision for Zero Carbon Shipping Future","November 6, 2017 Monday 1:37 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Shipping issued the following news release:The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is representing the world's national shipowners' associations and over 80 percent of the world merchant fleet at the United Nations (COP 23) in Bonn this week.ICS will emphasise how the shipping industry is supporting the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop an ambitious CO2 reduction strategy.ICS Director of Policy, Simon Bennett explained:""ICS has a vision of zero CO2 emissions from shipping in the second half of the century. We are confident this will be achievable with alternative fuels and new propulsion technologies.""ICS says its vision might be delivered with batteries or fuel cells using renewable energy, other new technologies such as hydrogen or even something not yet anticipated.In the meantime, the shipping industry has proposed that IMO Member States should adopt a suitably ambitious goal for reducing total emissions from the entire international shipping sector by an agreed percentage by 2050.ICS is pleased that a large number of IMO Member States have already come forward with detailed proposals. Several EU and Pacific island nations have jointly proposed that the sector should reduce total CO2 by as much as 70 percent by 2050.Mr Bennett commented:""Japan has set out in detail to IMO how a 50 percent total cut by 2060 might be achieved. In view of projections for future trade growth, an objective in this range, while still incredibly ambitious, therefore seems more realistic.""He added:""It will be for governments to agree the actual reduction number when they adopt an initial IMO strategy next April. And this is also going to have to address the legitimate concerns of major economies such as China and India about the implications for future trade and their sustainable development.""Whatever is decided, ICS says that the entire world fleet is probably unlikely to enjoy global access to new alternative fuels for at least another 20 or 30 years. Moreover, population growth and further improvements to global living standards will probably determine that demand for shipping must continue to increase, as it is already by far the most carbon efficient form of commercial transport.ICS says that, using a combination of technical and operational measures, the international shipping sector already appears to have reduced and held its total annual CO2 emissions at about 8 percent below its 2008 peak. This is despite an increase of about 30 percent in maritime trade, estimated in tonnes of cargo transported one nautical mile (tonne-miles) over the period up to the end of 2015.ICS cautions that these latest estimates by third parties will have to be verified by the next official IMO Greenhouse Study in 2019 using the new IMO CO2 Data Collection System.""They are nevertheless encouraging especially given the dramatic reduction in fuel prices since 2014. Moreover, a significant increase in marine fuel costs is expected in 2020 due to the mandatory global switch by the entire world fleet to low sulphur fuels. This should greatly incentivise, to the extent this is possible, the further reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by ships."" said Mr Bennett.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 6, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6063996 MSTRUCK\l"

The goal of the meeting is to work out some of the details related to the Paris Agreement, the so-called Paris Rulebook, which has to be finished at COP 24 in 2018.The Paris Agreement didn't create any legal obligations for states to act on climate change but required them to make voluntary promises of action toward shared goals every five years. To ensure parties keep their promises and to inform the regular revisions of these pledges, the agreement established a process for reviewing collective progress, also every five years, called the global stocktake.What this process will look like is yet to be determined. Manjana Milkoreit, an assistant professor of political science at Purdue, is leading research that seeks to support the design process. ""The first global stocktake is set to happen in 2023, but it's unclear what that will look like,"" she said. ""How often will they meet? Who's going to be there? What will they talk about? What kind of information will they have in front of them? All of these questions need to be worked out.""Milkoreit is joined at the conference by graduate student Kate Haapala. They plan to sit in on negotiation sessions and interview participants to identify takeaways for the design of the global stocktake.""In particular, I'm going to ask what can be learned from existing mechanisms in other international institutions and past experiences within the climate change regime,"" Milkoreit said. ""Between 2013 and 2015, there was a periodic review of the global temperature goal, and that process might serve as a useful blueprint for the global stocktake.""Milkoreit also is working with a larger interdisciplinary team to design a science-policy engagement process using a serious game that will help climate negotiators learn about complex scientific concepts, such as climate tipping points. A tipping point is an abrupt shift in Earth systems, sometimes into an irreversible new state with major implications for life on Earth, such as the melting of major ice sheets or the degradation of coral reefs.Purdue professor Jason Reed and graduate student Roberta Weiner also are attending COP 23. They plan to interview conference participants and observe negotiations with specific questions in mind: What do climate negotiators already know about climate tipping points, and what do they want or need to know? They'll use their observations to design the game back at Purdue.Milkoreit's team is focusing on a fairly specific set of questions, but conference attendees from other nations will likely come with one of their own: What will the role of the United States be in climate negotiations going forward?President Trump announced the country's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June, but as of now, that's purely symbolic; it isn't possible to formally pull out of the agreement until 2020. The American delegation is present at COP 23, but how involved they will be and what aims they will pursue remain open questions.

'We are pleased to participate in forums about the need for long-term climate change actions where our customers and the environment both benefit,' said Paul Camuti, senior vice president, innovation and chief technology officer, Ingersoll Rand. 'We believe sustainable business practices improve our operating footprint globally and deliver business results. We create a broad range of innovative solutions that provide options for our customers to determine when and how they can achieve their own climate goals.' COP 23 convenes countries and various private sector organizations to share best practices in achieving national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Ingersoll Rand will participate this year, as in previous years, to ensure country-level delegates have access to the latest information on\~next-generation technologies and solutions can help them achieve their GHG reduction targets. Ingersoll Rand made a Climate Commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its products and operations by 2030. The Ingersoll Rand Climate Commitment pledges to:Cut the refrigerant GHG footprint of its products by 50 percent by 2020 and incorporate lower GWP alternatives across its portfolio by 2030; Invest $500 million in product-related research and development over the next five years to fund the long-term reduction of GHG emissions; and Reduce company operations-related GHG emissions by 35 percent by 2020.As part of the company's effort to reduce emissions, Ingersoll Rand evaluated its own operations at facilities and committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within locations around the world. Examples of the company's efforts include lighting upgrades, reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, waste reduction and water conservation. To date, the company's Climate Commitment has supported the avoidance of approximately 6.7 million metric tons of CO2 globally, which is the equivalent of avoiding annual CO2 emissions from energy used in more than 700,000 homes for one year. By 2030, the company expects to reduce its carbon footprint by 50 million metric tons.

Tafue Lusama, general secretary of the Tuvalu Christian Church, speaking at a side event organised by the World Council of Churches, Bread for the World, ActionAid, and Climate Action Now-South Asia at the 23rd Conference of Parties (COP 23) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). COP 23 is currently underway in Bonn, Germany from 6-17 November.According to the 5th Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 2-degree Celsius rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels carries with it an increased risk of sea level rise and extreme weather events such as powerful storms, floods, droughts, and heat waves, particularly affecting small islands, the tropics and the polar regions.The landmark Paris Agreement obliges countries to keep global temperature rise to under 2 degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic climate change. However, nationally determined contributions remain vastly insufficient to reach this target and the latest estimates indicate that the planet is well on track for at least a 3-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures, causing permanent and irreversible loss and damage.The Paris Agreement supported the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage which was established by the UNFCCC at COP 19 in Warsaw in 2013 to provide a platform for broadening our understanding of climate change impacts and exploring approaches to addressing loss and damage.""The government of Tuvalu was already raising the issue of loss and damage as early as 1991,"" said Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager at ActionAid and one of the panelists at the side-event. ""Because we have failed over the last decades to sufficiently mitigate and adapt to climate change, there is now an urgent need to address climate-induced displacement as well as to provide funds to compensate for the loss and damage.""While financial compensation is important for helping affected people and communities get back on their feet, it is not enough to truly remedy their suffering. ""How can you value the loss of lives, lands, languages, and cultures in monetary terms?,"" asked Rev. Henrik Grape, who coordinates the WCC Working Group on Climate Change. Grape offered a moral and ethical perspective to the side-event topic.""Clearly these have non-material, even spiritual dimensions. As churches and faith communities, we need to foster deeper discussions on non-economic loss and damage caused by climate change and how it can really be redressed. In such discussions we need to ensure in the first place that the voices of the most vulnerable are heard. And we need to stand in solidarity with them.""How can we practice solidarity? ""Join us in our fight to keep global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" said Lusama. ""We do not want to become forced migrants, to lose our roots, to have no point of reference on the face of the planet. Therefore we need to act now.""This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 10, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6071060 MSTRUCK\l"

The latest projections for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 2017 show an upward trend, reversing the near-flat growth seen the last three years. The forecast by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), published Monday in a series of reports in three different journals, says 2017 will see a record 41 billion tons of CO2 emissions globally, an increase of 2 percent compared to 2016. The years from 2014 to 2016, by contrast, had seen little-to-no growth in CO2 emissions, making the 2017 projections particularly worrisome. Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9 of the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, who was lead researcher for one of the reports, said in a statement[1] Monday: 'Global carbon dioxide emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period. This is very disappointing. With global carbon dioxide emissions from all human activities estimated at 41 billion tons for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius.' In another statement[2], Robert Jackson of Stanford University, who co-chairs GCP, also warned of a rising trend in 2018: 'Several factors point to a continued rise in 2018. That's a real concern. The global economy is picking up slowly. As GDP rises, we produce more goods, which, by design, produces more emissions.' The increase being seen in 2017 is led by China, whose CO2 emissions are set to grow 3.5 percent through the year. This, Jackson said, was despite green energy sources becoming increasingly popular in China but still being insufficient to meet the burgeoning energy demand  a gap that has been filled by 'new oil, coal and natural gas infrastructure.'

The NDC Partnership supports emerging economies and developing countries in translating the provisions of the Paris Agreement into national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).Federal Development Minister Gerd Mller stated: ""Those least able to defend themselves are the ones suffering most because of the impacts of climate change. That is why we support in particular developing countries in combatting the impacts of climate change - for instance, with tailor-made climate solutions for every country. The NDC Partnership provides the ideal framework to this end. It is the eleventh hour, and the only way to save the global climate is by joining forces.""The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development will provide an additional 31 million euros for short-term support in the framework of the NDC Partnership which will be implemented by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the deutsche Gesellschaft fr internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Partnerships Secretariat. In addition, the Federal Development Ministry will provide start-up funding for the Regional Pacific NDC Hub together with the UK and Australia, among others.Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks commented: ""Implementing national climate action programmes is a challenge for all countries. This makes it all the more important that we support one another and share what we are doing and how we can raise the level of ambition. The problem of climate change can only be resolved through multilateral action. This characterises the NDC Partnerships spirit.""In the context of the NDC Partnership, the Federal Environment and Development Ministries are working closely together. Developed countries and multilateral institutions are supporting emerging economies and developing countries in achieving their NDCs and aligning them with their national development goals. To this end, they are promoting access to funding and technical support. NDC members are also involved in an exchange of knowledge and experience on climate action and adaptation measures.Since the Partnership was founded one year ago, its membership has almost doubled from 41 to 77 members, with 48 developing countries, 16 developed countries and 13 international organisations. The German Government has geared its entire climate finance amounting to 3.4 billion euros from budget funds in 2016 alone towards the NDCs of partner countries helping them to achieve their mitigation and adaptation goals.\l"

Mohammed's remarks, as prepared for delivery, at the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Pre-COP [Conference of Parties] Partnership Day in Suva, Fiji, today:I am so happy to be with you here in Fiji. Your commitment and partnership are what will make the Paris Agreement succeed in transforming our world.The Paris Agreement represents a turning point in international cooperation to combat climate change. It is a hallmark of the Agreement that so many leaders from cities, States, regions, territories, the private sector, the investment community and civil society came in with pledges and initiatives to take climate action.The enthusiastic support for the Paris Agreement as a key pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development continues. In the run-up to and during Climate Week in New York in September, on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, many more companies and local authorities committed to action.RE100, an initiative in which companies commit to 100 per cent renewable energy, welcomed new partners including Estee Lauder, Kellogg's and DBS Bank. EV100, launched this year, is bringing together companies committed to accelerating the transition to electric vehicles and making electric transport the new normal by 2030.The Under2 Coalition, whose members are committed to reducing emissions by up to 95 per cent by 2050, welcomed new signatories, including major cities and the Marshall Islands, which became the seventeenth nation to endorse the Coalition. The Under2 Coalition now includes 187 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion of GDP equivalent to more than 16 per cent of the global population and 39 per cent of the global economy.We could spend all day trying to capture the breadth and scale of this momentum. We are moving taking important steps, but of course it is not enough. Paris is a global agreement of nations but it needs the global support of all sectors of society from all across the planet to minimize risks and provide security and opportunity for all.In the words of Frank Bainimarama, Fiji's Prime Minister and the incoming President of the next United Nations climate change conference, we need a grand coalition. While support for the Paris Agreement from subnational governments is gathering momentum in developed and developing countries alike, support from business and investors is still predominantly from Europe and the United States.This must change. So, I welcome the establishment of the Climate Action Pacific Partnership as an important new piece in the grand coalition jigsaw puzzle and a new catalyst for the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. The bringing together of business, investors, funders and Governments from within and outside the region to accelerate implementation of national climate action plans is a significant new development.The other challenge is to bring all sectors of society and the economy into alignment with the Paris Agreement's pathways, timetables and goals including finance, so that funding flows into the low-carbon, sustainable economy that must be the future. We must also engage and enrol the higher-emitting sectors of the economy.As some of you may recall, during the high-level segment of the General Assembly last month, the Secretary-General outl"

Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) led their colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals.The resolution also points to the massive job growth potential from clean energy, with more than 2.5 million people in the United States already working in industries such as wind, solar and energy efficiency in all 50 States. As recently as this week, Virginia and New Jersey have taken steps or signaled their intention to join the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the successful market-based system that sets a cap on carbon emissions from the electric sector.""We will not allow President Trump's intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement to turn America from leader to laggard on climate action,"" said Senator Markey. ""In the face of the Trump administration's climate denial, state and local leaders, the business community, and the American people are taking action to address global warming and spur clean energy deployment. At COP23, our delegation delivered the message that COP really stands for 'Can't Obstruct Progress' and that we are still in and we will win.""""Denying climate change doesn't stop the climate from changing,"" said Senator Whitehouse. ""And President Trump reneging on the Paris agreement can't erase America's commitment to meeting our climate goals. Rhode Island is still in. And so are states and cities across the country, leading corporations, and millions of Americans. We won't turn back.""""President Trump can try to stop climate progress, but his denialism is no match for the incredible efforts of states, cities, businesses, and more all over the U.S. who are stepping up in his place,"" said Senator Merkley. ""By working together toward a bold vision of 100% clean and renewable energy, grassroots America can and will keep the U.S. on track to meet or even exceed our Paris commitment.""A copy of the Senate resolution can be found HERE HYPERLINK https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Paris%20Climate%20Accord%20resolution%2011.17.17.pdfhttps://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Paris%20Climate%20Accord%20resolution%2011.17.17.pdf.Other Senators co-sponsoring the resolution include Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.).Read this original document at: HYPERLINK https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/as-cop23-closes-us-senators-reaffirm-support-for-paris-climate-agreementhttps://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/as- HYPERLINK cop23 -closes-us-senators-reaffirm-support-for-paris-climate-agreement\l"

Women commonly face higher risks in responding to natural hazards and greater burden from the impacts of climate change. Although they have intimate local knowledge and are managers of common natural resources, they are often left out of the picture when decisions on climate action are made.The aim of the Gender Action Plan is to ensure that women can influence climate change decisions, and that women and men are represented equally in all aspects of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as a way to increase its effectiveness.As the agreement on the Gender Action Plan was finalized, President of COP23 and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, welcomed the result and said to the UN: This recognizes the role of women in climate action. It is about integration of gender into all the work around climate policy both nationally and internationally, added Nazhat Shameen Khan, the Chief Negotiator for the COP 23 Presidency, also according to the UN.The Gender Action Plan sets out, in five priority areas, the activities that will help achieve this objective. These range from increasing knowledge and capacities of women and men through workshops and information exchanges, so that they can systematically integrate gender considerations in all areas of their work, to pursuing the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in national delegations, including women from grassroots organizations, local and indigenous peoples and women from Small Island Developing StatesOther priority areas refer to the need to increase integration of the gender considerationssuch as addressing womens specific vulnerability to natural disasters as well as understanding womens role in agriculture and food production, and supporting women entrepreneurs in the energy sectorinto the areas of work of all Parties to the Convention; and to increase climate-related financial resources that integrate gender priorities and reflect the needs of women and girls. Lastly, the Gender Action Plan seeks to improve tracking of the implementation of the gender-related decisions.UN Women provided technical support to the Parties throughout the process of developing the Gender Action Plan. The organizations Deputy Executive Director, Yannick Glemarec, welcomed the decision, saying: The Gender Action Plan is the culmination of two decades of efforts to integrate gender perspectives in climate negotiations. It will help practitioners and stakeholders leverage co-benefits between gender equality and climate action to achieve sustainable development.The first report to evaluate the progress on the implementation of the Gender Action Plan will be presented in November 2019.\l"

LeasePlan will also facilitate the implementation of charging infrastructure at customers' offices and employees' homes. Wherever possible, LeasePlan will work with partners to ensure the charging infrastructure is supplied with 100% renewable energy. Carbon offsetting will also be available for the non-electric cars that do not form part of the pilot. The full pilot will be available in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK from December, with a further rollout planned for Italy, Spain and Sweden in the first quarter of 2018.CEO Tex Gunning: ""We see an increasing demand for electric vehicle fleets from corporate companies that want to lower their overall emissions and help tackle climate change. As part of our 2030 Sustainability Strategy, LeasePlan is fully committed to helping these customers make the switch. We're therefore delighted to be launching our electric vehicle pilot program for large corporate organizations here at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn. Making the switch to an electric fleet is one of the simplest ways for companies to rapidly lower their emissions and help tackle climate change - and we are committed to facilitating those companies that want to make the transition.""Sustainability strategyToday's announcement marks another milestone in LeasePlan's sustainability strategy, which aims to achieve net zero emissions from the total LeasePlan fleet by 2030.

Anything that can help empower and mobilise citizens. The lively debates in panel discussions, workshops and lectures made the event look like a carnival of creative new ideas and tested knowledge.The Innovation Lab brought together human rights defenders to share their tools, tactics and strategies. Oxfam addressed the long term problems that the 300 nuclear tests in the Pacific had caused. And the Public Interest Registry taught participants how to inspire donors to give and supporters to take action.A lot of attention went to activist stars like Kumi Naidoo (Greenpeace, CIVICUS, ...), Helen Clark (former prime minister of New Zealand) and Jose Ramos-Horta (former president of Timor-Leste). The youthful and charming winners of the 'Nelson Mandela - Graca Machel Innovation Awards' won many hearts when the annual prize was handed out.Special focus on the PacificFor the first time this global event was hosted in the Pacific. The conference focussed on the plight of small islands affected by rising sea levels and more frequent and extreme weather.""The peoples of the Pacific, like those in other small island states, have to tackle the devastating impacts of climate change alongside other development challenges,"" says Danny Sriskandarajah, secretary general of CIVICUS.CIVICUS, an alliance for citizen participation, organized the conference in cooperation with PIANGO, the Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation.Fiji has taken a leading role in the Pacific to address climate change. The republic has already presided over the United Nations (COP 23) in Bonn and co-hosted the UN Oceans Conference in New York earlier this year. It collaborates closely with other Pacific states and territories.Brianna Fruean, a 19 year old student from Samoa, is one of the Pacific Climate Warriors, a cooperation between 12 island nations. ""My grandfather liked to take me to the markets to look at the rich variety of fish. But the corals are devastated due to climate change. If you go to the fish markets now it's not so plentiful anymore. That's how my passion for climate change began.""""It is critical that every person on this planet recognizes the importance of what is going on in the Pacific,"" says Danny Sriskandarajah. ""Everybody must act. Whether it is change in their consumption behavior or putting pressure on their local and national authorities.""Many inspirational voicesSpeaking at the closing event, Joanna Kerr - the Canadian head of Greenpeace - said that the problem of climate change will require enormous civil society mobilisation to address. ""The problem is so huge it can be hard to stay optimistic. But the hope and resilience of the Pacific gives us hope."" She applauded the ordinary Pacific peoples' appreciation for climate change.Another inspirational voice of hope was that of Victor Ugo, a Nigerian doctor.

CAFOD campaigns for action on climate change because it is affecting the poor communities it works with overseas, pushing people back into poverty in many areas.CAFOD says positive progress was made on defining a 'rulebook' for how the agreement will work, although there is still a lot of decisions to be made at the next round of talks, scheduled to take place in Poland in November 2018. There was dismay at this year's talks at attempts to promote the use of coal by the United States, which President Donald Trump has said will withdraw from the Paris agreement - leaving it the only country in the world outside the accord. Other countries rallied to fill the leadership vacuum left by America, with several countries joining an alliance led by the UK and Canada agreeing to phase out the use of coal for power generation by 2030.However, CAFOD says despite the positive steps taken in many areas, money remains the real sticking point for achieving the goals of the Paris agreement.Sally Tyldesley, Climate Analyst at CAFOD, said: """"Ultimately, to build the trust needed now to deliver the Paris agreement, developing countries need to feel assured that richer nations that have caused the problem are going to stump up the cash they've promised to help poorer countries cope with climate change. There's been a sense this year of developed countries hiding behind negotiations on other issues, such as agricultural policy, to avoid reaching the point where money has to be talked about, but developing countries want to see that richer nations are doing more than just expressing sympathy and empathy and instead are putting their money where their mouth is on climate action.""The Catholic Church and 18 Catholic development agencies from around the world joined forces at the climate talks to launch a new paper, Climate Action for the Common Good, to encourage governments to respond to the climate challenge in a way that reflects the spirit of Pope Francis's landmark encyclical Laudato Si', which was credited as having a significant impact on the world successfully agreeing a global climate deal in Paris[1]. The Church aimed to remind governments that massive transformational change is needed to tackle climate change, in the cultural, economic, social and spiritual perspectives of today's lifestyles and for future generations.Fr. Bruno Marie Duffe, Secretary for the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, said of the paper's launch: ""We should not underestimate the importance of the moment we are in now. We are in the middle of the river, and we cannot go back. We have to be together, and we have to be strong, even if one state decides to go back. We have had the Paris agreement and now we have to move from the ethical intentions to making the political happen, and to do that we will need a new model of development that is rooted in dialogue and mutual solidarity, and that recognises the talents that each party has to contribute.""This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 17, 2017.Contact: Lucinda Devine-Kennedy, +44 (0) 7785 950 585, HYPERLINK ldevine@cafod.org.ukCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6080056 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA176","COP-23 Climate Negotiations: Politics Over Just Commitments - Analysis","December 2, 2017 Saturday","Eurasia Review","By Garima MaheshwariWhat was expected and proclaimed to be a rather technical working conference to hash out the rules for 2018 is turning out to be a political minefield with the potential to undermine the very basis of 'climate justice' that has formed the core of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 1992. On the very first day of COP-23, at the plenary session itself, the presidency held by Fiji has backtracked on the pre-2020 promises to the majority of developing countries, grouped under coalitions like 'like minded developing countries', 'BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China)' and G-77+China. Fiji twisted the hard-fought inclusion of 'pre-2020 commitments' on the COP-23 agenda and declared that they would not be discussed in the main negotiations.Under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period, the pre-2020 commitments obligate the developed countries to meet their mitigation targets and also provide 'mean of implementation' - like finance, technology and capacity-building - to developing countries. Post-2020, as envisioned in Paris, even developing countries would be nearly equal partners in mitigation. The understanding that the pre-2020 commitments would be fulfilled had allowed for consensus on discussing ambitious mitigation commitments by developing countries.The commitments arising out of historical responsibility of the developed countries forms the core of climate justice, hard-won by developing countries since 1992 under UNFCCC. India, China and others have always been clear that the Paris Agreement falls within the UNFCCC, and yet the attempt now is to subvert the principles of UNFCCC itself. One wonders why Fiji is playing this politics. The island nation wants the temperature limit controlled up to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels; and for that, ambitious mitigation action is necessary. Although this can be justified, would it not make more sense to compel the developed countries to stick to their mitigation targets and other commitments (since that would also incentivise developing countries to ramp up climate action)?This would have been the most rational course to take for Fiji and it would have kept all parties on board, instead of alienating a whole section of developing countries and the African group of least developed countries that acutely needs the finance. It would have cohered with Fiji's understandable ambitions to leave a mark or a legacy on the COP. The only explanation for Fiji's hostile turnaround is that it has joined forces with the developed countries' bargaining positions.This politics renders the term climate justice vacuous and vulnerable to political appropriation. The term is often used loosely in the COPs, and the implications of each definition would be very different. It has become even more vacuous and narrowly quantified ever since the Paris Agreement provided breathing space to countries. While everyone was complacent at Paris (despite its weak climate pledges), now the whole thing seems to be backfiring and threatening the very nature of climate regime built over the last 25 years.This space is being utilised by advanced historical emitters and developing countries alike. For the advanced historical emitters, attempting to avoid pre-2020 commitments and focusing mainly on mitigation actions after 2020, would solve the purpose of letting the advanced polluting economies go scot-free on their earlier commitments as well as avoid the tricky issues of finance and technology transfers by privileging mitigation over adaptation.Developing countries appear cornered for now. From the way the current political positions are panning out, even speculations about China assuming leadership at Bonn seem exaggerated. Countries' political positions are determined more by their alliances and less by sincere climate action back home. In fact, in the latter case, India is about to meet its 2030 commitments, but the vexatious politics at UNFCCC is far from being in India's favour. China may have allied with the US at Paris, but right now the usual multilateral voice of G-77 and 'like minded developing countries' would likely predominate. Nevertheless, these countries will find themselves on the backfoot in the mitigation debate.They may refuse to cooperate altogether on the post-2020 Paris agenda if the pre-2020 commitments and mobilisation of finance is not done. By also stressing that adaptation is a priority for developing countries, the adaptation versus mitigation debate threatens to lock down critical aspects of negotiations. This would be a loss for the island states. The G-77+China and the island states have a lot to share - including critical issues like mobilising finance for the Warsaw Mechanism on Loss and Damage (which has been perennially stuck because of developed countries' resistance). Therefore, alienating the developing countries under the delusion that ambitious mitigation action is possible by allying with the developed countries will only obstruct climate action further. Disasters due to climate change are a reality and current pledges and measures can only be temporary palliatives, but even so, to bargain over the bare minimum of commitments shows that climate inaction is here to stay.

Countries have now submitted their views on the rules, and work is now continuing to ensure a decision on the rules can be taken next year.Alongside negotiations on the rules, decisions have also been reached on several important issues. The Fijian Presidency put forward a proposal for the 'Talanoa Dialogue', which will be the first opportunity since Paris for countries to evaluate how global climate action corresponds to the 1.5 degree Celsius goal and how ambitions can be raised.Sweden also announced that it is concluding its ratification of the Doha Amendment that establishes the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.""Sweden is now leading the EU in concluding its ratification of the Doha Amendment. We are pleased that the EU has also announced that it will conclude ratification before the end of the year,"" says Minister for International Development Cooperation Isabella Lovin.The Doha Amendment means 20 per cent joint emission reductions compared to 1990 levels by 2020, when the first commitment period of the Paris Agreement begins.""We are also providing an additional SEK 185 million each to the Adaptation Fund and Least Developed Countries Fund, which is an important signal to many developing countries that we are prepared to resolve the issue of financing climate action,"" says Ms Lovin.At the conference, the UK and Canada launched the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance', a global coalition to phase out traditional coal power.

GarberActing Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific AffairsBonn, GermanyNovember 16, 2017________________________________President of COP 23, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates. The United States is pleased to be engaging with other Parties here at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.President Trump has made clear the U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement. Although he indicated that the United States intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people.Irrespective of our views on the Paris Agreement, the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy and innovation, and we understand the need for transforming energy systems.President Trump made this clear when the United States joined other G-20 countries in the G-20 Leaders' Declaration in stating that we remain collectively committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through, among other things, increased innovation on sustainable energy and energy efficiency, and working towards low greenhouse gas emissions energy systems.Our guiding principles are universal access to affordable and reliable energy, and open, competitive markets that promote efficiency and energy security, not only for the United States but around the globe.The United States will continue supporting a balanced approach to climate mitigation, economic development, and energy security that takes into consideration the realities of the global energy mix.Over the past 10 years, the United States has shown that it can reduce emissions while growing the economy and promoting energy security. Since 2005, the United States' net greenhouse gas emissions have decreased 11.5 percent while the U.S. economy has grown 15 percent, adjusted for inflation.A large portion of these reductions have come as a result of the adoption by the private sector of innovative energy technologies --fostered by early stage innovation by the public sector.Collaborative U.S. public and private efforts over the past ten years have resulted in dramatic decreases in the cost of low-emissions technologies and fuels, including natural gas, solar, wind, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Natural gas prices have dropped to about a third of what they were in 2007 and the cost of utility-scale solar PV has dropped by more than 64 percent.We want to work with other countries to continue advancing the development and deployment of a broad array of technologies that will ultimately enable us to achieve our climate and energy security goals.Already, the United States is working bilaterally with countries such as China and India to advance power sector transformation and smart grid technologies, energy efficiency, and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage.We are also engaged in many multilateral initiatives.Through the Clean Energy Ministerial, we are engaging our national laboratories to provide in-depth technical expertise to pursue new global opportunities to leverage the potential of advanced energy technologies including carbon capture, utilization, and storage, and nuclear energy.Through our work with Power Africa, we have catalyzed some $60 billion in energy investments that will provide modern energy services for roughly 300 million citizens across Africa by 2030.And through the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, we are working with island states to identify cost-effective options for using advanced energy technologies to diversify and strengthen their power systems and increase energy access.Of course, we know that each country will need to determine the appropriate energy mix based on its particular circumstances, taking into account the need for energy security, promotion of economic growth and environmental protection.In that context, we want to support the cleanest, most efficient power generation, regardless of source.Beyond energy, the United States will continue to help our partner countries reduce emissions from forests and other lands, to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and to respond to natural disasters.Our Sustainable Landscapes programs are helping partners to protect well over 2 million square kilometers of forests and other landscapes, reducing more than 300 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, while enhancing sustainable development, generating local livelihood opportunities, and protecting biodiversity and water resources.U.S. government technical agencies also continue to help partners improve their capacities to monitor and report on terrestrial carbon through the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon has helped countries conduct forest inventories, develop maps of forests and other ecosystems, and worked to include forests and other landscapes in national greenhouse gas mitigation strategies and targets.In sum, the United States intends to remain engaged with our many partners and allies around the world on these issues, here in the U.N. Framework Convention and everywhere else.Thank you.\l"

The request seeks all reports and memoranda that the administration relied upon when it made its decision, as well as related emails, telephone logs and notes from meetings involving President Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and other administration officials. As the international community prepares for this November\' s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, the Center hopes to determine how Trump\' s Paris decision was influenced by a poor understanding of climate science and lobbying by the fossil fuel industry. The Center also looks to uncover whether any new scientific or economic analysis was used in justifying the withdrawal.  We need to know if Trump put any real thought at all into this profoundly dangerous decision, said Clare Lakewood, a staff attorney at the Center.

'Federalism was, until recently, the darling of conservatives,' says David Freeman Engstrom, a law professor at Stanford University. 'But in the current moment, federalism's valence has flipped. Sub-federal governments including states, counties, and cities are driving progressive policy agendas and moving onto the global stage in a wide range of areas. And California is leading the charge.'Challenging TrumpUnder the current administration, the incentives are high right now for California and other states and municipalities to advance priorities that are stuck in gridlock or moving backward at the federal level. 'As a former foreign policy-maker, the question I have been asking myself is: To what extent are we going to see progressive states challenge the Trump administration, particularly in the realm of foreign policy?' says Jeremy M. Weinstein, a professor of political science, who also served as deputy to the US ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration. 'And how will the federal government respond if there are multiple voices speaking for the United States in the international arena?' Take climate policy, for example. In 2017, Gov. Jerry Brown met with China's President Xi Jinping to negotiate a joint partnership to reduce carbon emissions. Ahead of the United Nations (COP23), Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, president of the conference, named Brown special adviser for states and regions. When President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, hundreds of sub-federal governments including dozens of towns and cities in California pledged to abide by the agreement. But these are only recent cases. In 2013, well before the Trump administration, California began to connect its cap-and-trade system regulating how companies emit greenhouse gases to provinces in Canada. The result is a sub-federal system for regulating carbon that spans international borders.'One-voice doctrine'There's a problem with all this sub-federal activism, according to the researchers: It might run afoul of the US Constitution. 'One problem is that the Constitution says that states aren't supposed to enter into agreements with other states, whether domestic or foreign, except with congressional consent,' says Engstrom, noting that could include California's cap-and-trade linkages, and Congress can disallow them if it chooses. The conventional view of foreign affairs is based on the 'one-voice doctrine,' a premise that the federal government must speak as a cohesive unit on foreign affairs, which is out of sync with reality, Weinstein says. While working in government, Weinstein helped shepherd a range of international initiatives including the Open Government Partnership, an effort to engage national and sub-national governments in promoting transparency. Initiatives like this show how the one-voice doctrine doesn't match up with what is taking place. 'We are starting to see some fissures and cracks in the doctrine.' 'Anyone who has worked in the foreign policy space will tell you that the global stage is an increasingly crowded place, with nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and every level of government vying for influence and exercising their voice,' he says. The 'one-voice' idea is also legally vulnerable. 'We are starting to see some fissures and cracks in the doctrine,' Engstrom says. He and Weinstein cite recent legal cases that have opened up room for states to maneuver. For instance, in 2003 the US Supreme Court invalidated a California law that required insurance companies to provide information about policies related to Holocaust victims and survivors. What makes the case significant, the researchers note, is that the Supreme Court, in finding the state law preempted, said that its resolution of federal-state conflict in future cases would turn at least in part on the strength and the importance of the state concern.Climate change could turn military bases into foreign policy problems[1]'The idea is that, where the state is using its more traditional police powers to protect its people, the one-voice doctrine might need to be relaxed a bit,' Engstrom says. California is not alone in its attempt to build a legal case and infrastructure for an expanded role in foreign policy. Massachusetts challenged the federal government in 2007 in a case targeting the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to regulate carbon emissions.

The United States is pleased to be engaging with other Parties here at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. President Trump has made clear the U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement. Although he indicated that the United States intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people. Irrespective of our views on the Paris Agreement, the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy and innovation, and we understand the need for transforming energy systems. President Trump made this clear when the United States joined other G-20 countries in the G-20 Leaders\' Declaration in stating that we remain collectively committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through, among other things, increased innovation on sustainable energy and energy efficiency, and working towards low greenhouse gas emissions energy systems. Our guiding principles are universal access to affordable and reliable energy, and open, competitive markets that promote efficiency and energy security, not only for the United States but around the globe. Over the past 10 years, the United States has shown that it can reduce emissions while growing the economy and promoting energy security. Since 2005, the United States\' net greenhouse gas emissions have decreased 11.5 percent while the U.S. economy has grown 15 percent, adjusted for inflation. A large portion of these reductions have come as a result of the adoption by the private sector of innovative energy technologies \- fostered by early stage innovation by the public sector. Collaborative U.S. public and private efforts over the past ten years have resulted in dramatic decreases in the cost of low-emissions technologies and fuels, including natural gas, solar, wind, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Natural gas prices have dropped to about a third of what they were in 2007 and the cost of utility-scale solar PV has dropped by more than 64 percent. We want to work with other countries to continue advancing the development and deployment of a broad array of technologies that will ultimately enable us to achieve our climate and energy security goals. Already, the United States is working bilaterally with countries such as China and India to advance power sector transformation and smart grid technologies, energy efficiency, and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage. We are also engaged in many multilateral initiatives. Through our work with Power Africa, we have catalyzed some $60 billion in energy investments that will provide modern energy services for roughly 300 million citizens across Africa by 2030. And through the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, we are working with island states to identify cost-effective options for using advanced energy technologies to diversify and strengthen their power systems and increase energy access. Of course, we know that each country will need to determine the appropriate energy mix based on its particular circumstances, taking into account the need for energy security, promotion of economic growth and environmental protection. In that context, we want to support the cleanest, most efficient power generation, regardless of source. Beyond energy, the United States will continue to help our partner countries reduce emissions from forests and other lands, to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and to respond to natural disasters. Our Sustainable Landscapes programs are helping partners to protect well over 2 million square kilometers of forests and other landscapes, reducing more than 300 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, while enhancing sustainable development, generating local livelihood opportunities, and protecting biodiversity and water resources. U.S. government technical agencies also continue to help partners improve their capacities to monitor and report on terrestrial carbon through the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon has helped countries conduct forest inventories, develop maps of forests and other ecosystems, and worked to include forests and other landscapes in national greenhouse gas mitigation strategies and targets. In sum, the United States intends to remain engaged with our many partners and allies around the world on these issues, here in the U.N. Framework Convention and everywhere else. Thank you. \l"

Applicants: Georges Martino-Gauchi (FR). Inventors: Georges Martino-Gauchi (FR). According to the abstract posted by the World Intellectual Property Organization: ""Process for manufacturing hydrogen from shale gas (or shale oil) in which: a) The shale gas (or oil) produced is converted into hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming or by partial oxidation by oxygen from the air in a plant set up nearby, b) The carbon dioxide generated with the hydrogen is separated from the gas mixture and recycled into the shale gas reservoir, it is used to carry out hydraulic fracturing. It may pass into a buffer reservoir. c) The carbon dioxide is finally sequestered in the borehole created for the exploitation of the gas. d) The hydrogen is used either directly in an electric power plant set up on the site and (or) injected into a hydrogen distribution network constructed for this purpose. The cost price of the hydrogen thus produced and distributed is of the order of magnitude of the price of imported natural gas having an identical energy content, this including the investments with a return time of less than four years. The invention thus makes it possible to reduce the releases of greenhouse gases to a level lower than those anticipated by COP21 (United Nations ).""

The Global ABC, of which RICS is a founding member, was established at COP21 in 2015 to develop a more coordinated sectoral approach to tackling climate change.""Within the Global ABC, RICS is part of a dedicated working group on measurement, data and accountability. Following an extensive global survey of our stakeholders, the report pulls together how collecting, managing and sharing data across the sector can support larger climate goals. Better data means more market transparency, more informed decision-making, reduced investment risk and the ability to track and measure the all-important targets set out in the Paris Agreement.""- Ursula Hartenberger: RICS Global Head of SustainabilityEnergy use in buildings and construction represents more than one-third of global energy consumption and contributes to nearly one-quarter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide.

It also highlights the gaps that current data capture and management patterns can have for how countries and organisations meet their energy-saving and climate targets.""As part of our commitment to advancing the global climate agenda, RICS is promoting International Property Measurement Standards to inform energy performance measures as a key metric for benchmarking the physical size of a building. Given the emphasis on driving investment into more energy efficiency measures in the built environment, the report aims to help governments, investors, developers, corporate occupiers and property professionals understand how better data management can protect their investments and assets through supporting the global climate agenda.""- Ursula Hartenberger: RICS Global Head of SustainabilityBetter whole life-cycle data capture, management and reporting enables government decision-makers, for example, to: Assess and develop more effective sustainability policies and incentive schemes, Kick-start innovation, and Enable sector participants to build holistic strategies targeted at reducing carbon emissions during planning, construction and real estate use.Fragmentation and silo-thinkingWhile the report lists an encouraging number of good practice examples and public and private initiatives, the overriding message of the survey is that the fragmentation and silo-thinking that the sector is known for, also translates into the way it handles its data.The report will be presented to key stakeholders at COP23, to promote collective action and a common approach across the sector in an effort to meet global climate targets.Read and download the report ( HYPERLINK http://www.rics.org/us/knowledge/research/insights/rics-takes-data-and-measurement-centre-stage-at- http://www.rics.org/us/knowledge/research/insights/rics-takes-data-and-measurement-centre-stage-at-cop23/cop23 /)Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6069408 MSTRUCK\l"

PHOTO BY MAISIE MANSFIELD-GREENWALD/ DAILY FREE PRESS STAFFDivestBU urged the Boston University Board of Trustees to adopt BU Bold - a version of the Climate Action Plan advocating that BU shift entirely to renewable energy by 2040 - at a rally Wednesday afternoon.The rally coincided with National Campus Day of Action - a movement to encourage students across the country to call for environmental action from their administrations in light of the ongoing COP23: United Nations Climate Change Conference.The CAP was created by the Climate Action Task Force in September. The Board of Trustees will likely vote on whether to induct the CAP next month.""We're ... doing the best that we can along the way to make sure that the Board of Trustees votes on the BU Bold plan, which is the most aggressive form of the Climate Action Plan,"" Stephanie Eggers, DivestBU's media liaison, said before the rally.The adoption of BU Bold would require the university to adopt 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, Eggers, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, said.The goal is to eliminate emissions from ""anything from electricity to heating and cooling and transportation on campus,"" Eggers said, ""and then also trying to internalize emissions that come from outside BU's campus, like professors coming to work every day.""In the week before the rally, DivestBU asked students to fill out paper baseball caps, representing the CAP, with a message about why they believe the Board of Trustees should pass the CAP or BU Bold, Eggers said.Rally-goers walked from Marsh Plaza to the building that houses President Robert Brown's office to deliver one of the caps for him to fill out, as well as a letter written and signed by DivestBU. Brown wasn't in the office, so members handed the caps and letter to his chief of staff.""It's just kind of our call to action for him,"" Eggers said.Four community leaders spoke at the rally - Quinton Zondervan, a Cambridge city councilor-elect; Marta Marello, project manager of BU's Climate Action Plan; Jake Taber, campus coordinator with Environment America and Bolaji Olagbegi, a DivestBU member and sophomore in the CAS.Marchers chanted in between speakers and along the walk, demanding climate action from BU.""What do we want?

However, this was not the case. There is still a window of opportunity, but there is only a few years left to prevent a rise above 1.5oC. We hope that the Talanoa Dialogue launched at COP23 will play an essential role in bringing countries back to next year's climate summit COP24 with clear plans for increasing ambition.Wolfgang Jamann, Secretary General and CEO of CARE International, said:""At COP23, political agreements did not sufficiently address the harsh climate reality that millions of poor and vulnerable people already face. CARE welcomes the agreements in areas such as gender and agriculture, as well as the attention to climate impacts. However, as global emissions continue to increase, we need countries to significantly step up their efforts in 2018 to shift away from this dangerous trajectory and to keep within the 1.5oC limit.""Vitumbiko Chinoko, CARE's Partnerships and Advocacy Coordinator for Southern Africa, said:""After years of seeing Parties at the UN Climate Change talks struggle to agree, CARE welcomes the positive outcome in agriculture. We are particularly pleased that Parties will focus on food security and social dynamics and move the agriculture agenda to implementation. Countries in Southern Africa are already acting, and the COP decision is a critical opportunity to help scale up approaches that tackle climate change and increase the resilience of food producers and women.""Fanny Petitbon, Advocacy Manager of CARE France, said:""The adoption of the first ever Gender Action Plan under the UNFCCC is a big step in the right direction.

Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today joined leaders from Japan, South Korea, Russia, China and more than a dozen other countries at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia where he pushed businesses and governments to join forces not just on trade and investment but also on the decarbonization of the economy.""The world has never had more power or more danger - or more opportunity if we can work together. And this forum is inviting that coming together of countries in the Pacific region, focusing on trade. But trade, to be sustainable, must be innovative and creative,"" said Governor Brown in remarks at the opening of the Forum. ""Trade will not be sustainable if it attempts to violate forever the rules of nature.""In addition to speaking at the opening of the Forum, Governor Brown gave remarks today at the sixth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Conference on Cooperation in Higher Education and later participated on a Forum panel focused on opportunities for cooperation between Russia, China, Japan and the United States.On Thursday, the Governor will lead a discussion on climate change at the Far Eastern Federal University.On the way to Vladivostok, Russia, Governor Brown stopped in Nome, Alaska where he met with researchers and native Alaskans to learn more about the impacts of climate change to arctic ecosystems.The Governor's complete remarks, delivered at the opening of the Forum, are below:Good morning. I first want to express my appreciation for the invitation to represent California at this forum. It's what we call ""bottom-up"" diplomacy.I come from a mere state or what people like to call a sub-national unit. Nevertheless, we have an impact in the world. Our gross domestic product is about $2.5 trillion. We're a land of innovation: Google, Facebook, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Hollywood. We're a land of disruption, where we never set in and accept a status quo, but we disrupt and create and build a future that works for everyone.California, of course, has a very special relationship with Russia. Russia was in California before America was in California. I refer to Fort Ross and the settlement there that still represents a symbolic place of collaboration and dialogue - the Fort Ross dialogue, something that I attend each year.So, I really have to express again my appreciation for being here, to be a part of this discussion bringing the peoples of the Pacific closer together. The Pacific Ocean, the name of which stands for peace, peaceful cooperation. And through trade, through business, through investment, through cultural exchange, we can create opportunities. And as we create opportunities of collaboration, we minimize those real threats that we all face. The threats of climate change, of terrorism, of nuclear proliferation and danger.The world has never had more power or more danger - or more opportunity if we can work together. And this forum is inviting that coming together of countries in the Pacific region, focusing on trade. But trade, to be sustainable, must be innovative and creative. The world of carbon is very much with us and is the basis of our civilization, even our meeting here. But the future is going to decarbonize. We need a world of elegance and innovation and renewable technology and zero-emission transportation and more efficient ways of building and living together.Trade will not be sustainable if it attempts to violate forever the rules of nature. We are all subject to physics and atmospheric chemistry. And 97 percent of the world's scientists tell us climate change is occurring, that it will have catastrophic impacts. Yes, there will be some positives but the increase in heat will cause migrations of millions, tens of millions of people and widespread suffering if we cannot make the Paris Agreement real.That's why California has joined with 175 other states, provinces and regions to form the Under2 Coalition. This is a coalition of states representing over a billion people that are committed to keeping greenhouse gas emissions under 2 degrees centigrade from the industrial period. But this is not just a coalition of restriction, it's a coalition of innovation. And the future will go to those who look not to the past, but look to the future. And not getting absorbed in the controversies of the moment; the difficulties of today or even next week. But rather standing back, looking out 25 years, 50 years - what is the world that we will all create together? Russia and the United States with China and Vietnam and Japan and India and Korea and other countries.This forum in the Pacific has great significance symbolically, humanly and economically. I am glad to be a small part of it. And I would just say that what rises converges. If we can raise our thinking and lift our eyes to a future that is inclusive, that is innovative and that takes into account the science that we all know, then we will converge and we can look to a very bright future, not only in the Pacific but everywhere in the world. Thank you.California's Climate LeadershipIn July, Governor Brown signed landmark legislation that extends and improves the state's world-leading cap-and-trade program and establishes a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. In recent years, Governor Brown has signed legislation establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; setting the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; directing cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems; and requiring the state to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings.Later this month, Governor Brown will travel to New York City for events connected to Climate Week NYC and the 72nd Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In November, the Governor is expected to take part in a number of international gatherings in Europe focused on fighting global warming, including a climate symposium organized by the Vatican and this year's United Nations (COP 23) in Bonn, Germany.In June, Governor Brown was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of COP 23 by Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama - incoming president of . This followed meetings with China's President Xi Jinping during the Governor's week-long trip to China and with Germany's top environmental official, Minister Barbara Hendricks, in San Francisco.Governor Brown continues to build strong coalitions of partners committed to curbing carbon pollution in both the United States through the U.S. Climate Alliance and around the globe with the Under2 Coalition.

With the UN climate talks, presided over by the government of Fiji, set to take place from 6 to 17 November in Bonn, Germany, an estimated 25,000 participants from nearly 200 countries have a chance to ensure that the disproportionate consequences of climate change on women and girls around the world are tackled.Wolfgang Jamann, CEO CARE International, said:Sven Harmeling, Head of the COP23 delegation CARE International, said:""The Parties at COP23 know what is needed to end suffering while tackling the gender gap that widens from climate change impacts. They must adopt a gender-equitable loss and damage work plan that identifies sources to generate finance in the order of USD50bn per year for recovery following loss of homes, farms and land and the means to sustain their families. Governments must also decide to promote alternative farming techniques adapted to changing climate conditions which benefits the poor, as climate change increasingly undermines the food and nutrition security of small-holder women farmers and their communities.""Fanny Petitbon, Advocacy Manager CARE France, said:COP23 also marks a crucial meeting on the pathway to finalising further rules required for the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement, and increasing actions to cut emissions, aimed for 2018. Progressive developing and developed countries must stand together and resist any backtracking from the Paris Agreement by unwilling countries.""The actions promised by the most powerful nations to cut harmful emissions from fossil fuels still fall short of the agreed upon goal to limit global warming to 1.5&#61616;C degrees above pre-industrial levels.

Jay Inslee was sitting with nearly 100 other guests in the dining room of California Gov. Jerry Brown\' s home at a lunch event to celebrate Fiji becoming the newest signatory to the Under2 MOU, an international coalition of national and subnational governments committed to ambitious climate action. The lunch had particular significance in the wake of recent events. President Donald Trump had just announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. In response, Brown and Inslee, as well as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, had launched the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance with more than a dozen states committing to achieving their share of the U.S. greenhouse gas reduction target. So while what happened at that lunch was unprecedented, it wasn\' t necessarily surprising. Fiji\' s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama is also the president of COP23, the 23rd annual convening of nations to talk about next steps in global climate action. Right after signing the Under2 MOU, Bainimarama invited Inslee, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, and Jerry Brown to attend COP23 in Bonn, Germany, and deliver a message to the world that the U.S. was still in for the fight against climate change. All three West Coast governors agreed. They would help a wide collection of U.S. voices stand in as the collective, representative voice of U.S. action on climate. With every nation in the world  save the U.S.  formally committed to the Paris agreement, COP23 drew an estimated 25,000 participants representing nations, subnational governments, businesses, schools, universities, NGOs and faith communities.

The goal is to lower CO2 emissions at Fraport's fully-consolidated Group companies by nearly half to about 125,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2030. The corresponding emissions in 2017 amounted to 209,668 metric tons of CO2. Fraport's new target is based on the national reduction rates agreed to at the United Nations in Paris in 2015.Fraport AG's executive board chairman, Dr. Stefan Schulte, said: ""Growth and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, but belong together. In the spirit of corporate responsibility, we have firmly embedded climate protection in our Group companies to make a positive contribution to this worldwide effort. To achieve our CO2 goals, we will continue to improve the energy efficiency ratings of our buildings, facilities and processes.""In the report, Group CO2 emissions were included with the non-financial performance indicators - along with figures on the sickness rate and the ratio for women in management positions (in Germany). Other indicators include global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity at Frankfurt Airport, as well as Group-wide employee satisfaction.

They will also talk about the ways in which mosquitos spread disease, and how recent years have brought about major epidemics spread by the winged pests surreptitiously traveling from one country to another. Like that one Israeli mosquito that, experts now say, may be responsible for bringing West Nile fever to New York. The culprit, said professor Jurgen May of the Bernahrd Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, probably hopped a flight from Tel Aviv to the Big Apple sometime in 1999. 'One can say with a fair degree of certainty that the virus arrived with an infected mosquito aboard a plane from Tel Aviv,' May said[2], adding that scientists have reached this conclusion by analyzing the virus and discovering strong relations to a virus discovered a year earlier in a goose living on an Israeli farm. 'There was a mild winter,' May explained. 'That enabled the infectious mosquitos to survive until the spring. There was a warm and dry early summer, which was good for the mosquitos. They stung migratory birds, which then carried the virus further afield. The late summer was wet and lots of new breeding grounds emerged.' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[3], more than 44,000 cases of the virus have been reported in the 18 years since. That, May added, happened in part because local American mosquitos helped spread the virus rapidly. 'These were mosquitos that sting both humans and birds. And that enabled the virus to spread very far in a short timeframe.'

""Urban planning has dramatically decreased from around 80 per cent [of urban land being planned] before 1900 to less than 50 per cent in 2015."" He went on to emphasize the importance of planning as one of the key tools to make climate positive cities.A recognised role for citiesCities' contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 per cent and 49 per cent globally - a significant portion of total emissions.Despite the significant challenges that they present, it is increasingly evident that well-planned cities can reduce congestion, pollution and provide energy efficiency, leading to reduced emissions.The Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda all acknowledge the role that cities have to play in combating climate change.Under the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action, Human Settlements Day at COP23 aims to promote the invaluable role of non-state actors in global action towards curbing and mitigating climate change while also emphasizing the nexus between these two key issues.Urban and regional planners have a key role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. Despite this, up to now, planners have not had a comfortable place within existing multi-stakeholder climate initiatives.Planners for Climate Action aims to combat this by bringing global, regional and national associations of planning professionals and planning educators together to ensure their expertise is incorporated into discussions and action.Among other activities, Planners for Climate Action will:Advocate for strengthened and accelerated urban/regional planningHelp to monitor implementation of relevant targetsMap and share knowledgeJointly develop normative guidance and knowledge productsProvide substantive input to ongoing relevant initiativesFind out more on UN-Habitat at COP23 Climate Change Conference here ( HYPERLINK https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-at-cop23/https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-at- HYPERLINK cop23 /)Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6074766 MSTRUCK\l"

This makes policies and resources to protect and prepare communities for current and future impacts of climate change all the more paramount.""Below is a statement from Kathy Egland, chair of the Environmental and Climate Justice Committee for the NAACP National Board of Directors.""Some communities are hit harder than others when disaster strikes. Historical disenfranchisement often leads to people of color being underprotected during extreme weather emergencies. To help these communities we need a three-pronged approach that aims to minimize damages in areas seeing recurring disasters, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, and limit industry efforts to pawn off their harmful product on low-income communities. That's why the NAACP is working to build an energy system that creates quality jobs to grow the economy, and ensures equal access to the benefits offered by renewables.""Below is a statement from Saleemul Huq, director of the ICCCAD at Independent University in Bangladesh.""The devastation of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, are not limited to the U.S. Despite being well adapted to annual river flooding during monsoon season, one-third of Bangladesh found itself underwater earlier this year due to unyielding rain. This historic rainfall left the nation reeling leaving more than 1,000 dead, hundreds of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed, and a large portion of their crops devastated. Human induced climate change requires nations around the world to redefine a 'new normal' as weather events become more intense and destructive.""Additionally, UCS discussed the results of their first-of-its-kind study recently published in Climatic Change, which finds that top fossil fuel producers such as ExxonMobil and Chevron are responsible for as much as half of the global surface temperature increase and roughly 30 percent of global sea level rise. The study examined attribution during two time periodsbefore and after 1980, when investor-owned fossil fuel companies were aware of the threat posed by their products.Below is a statement for Peter Frumhoff, chief climate scientist and director of science and policy at UCS.""Up until this point, governments and taxpayers have shouldered the responsibility on growing climate change costsfor both damages and measures to adapt. The science now enables us to quantify how much specific companies' products have caused the Earth to warm and seas to rise, begging the question of who should pay for their mounting costs moving forward.""Fossil fuel companies could've taken any number of steps, such as investing in clean energy or carbon capture and storage, yet many chose to instead spend millions of dollars to deceive the public on climate science or block sensible limits on carbon emissions for decades. The victims of these companies' irresponsible decisions should not have to continue to foot the bill. This new scientific data can and should help inform juries and judges, as well as governments, who may seek to have fossil fuel producers pay their fair share.""The Union of Concerned Scientists puts rigorous, independent science to work to solve our planet's most pressing problems. Joining with people across the country, we combine technical analysis and effective advocacy to create innovative, practical solutions for a healthy, safe, and sustainable future.\l"

For the first time ever, the majority of nation's agreed on single goal  to limit global to well below 2 degrees Celsius. That's the threshold scientists say we shouldn't pass if we want to avert dangerous climate disruptions. Decades of research led to that conclusion, so there's no reason to doubt it, unless you are willingly sticking your head in the sand. Say what you want about the global climate deal, it's significant just for the fact that there was agreement among so many countries with so many varied interests, and the U.S. helped lead the way to making the agreement happen. A couple of years later and that heady Paris buzz has turned into a bit of a climate hangover, with the realization that the truly hard work of actually cutting emissions is still ahead. In late November I attended the latest edition of the annual powwow, and it was encouraging to see that, even in the absence of U.S. leadership, the rest of the world is determined to save us from ourselves. If this process works, the U.S. will owe the rest of the world a huge debt of gratitude, because this is truly a case of pulling the bacon out of the fire. I wrote several stories about the COP23 conference, including a story about what, exactly, the negotiators were trying to achieve in Bonn: COP23: Writing the Paris accord rule book.[1] Germany is supposed to be one of the new global leaders on climate policy, but is that really the case? Here's what I found out: How Germany Can Lead on Climate, Despite Setbacks. [2] Then the was the fossil fuel sideshow put on by the White House: America's Mortifying Performance at the Bonn Climate Talks.[3] The issue of climate financing (who pays for the damage that's already been caused; who helps pay to help poorer, developing countries cope with impacts that rich countries for the most part caused?) was on the table, and it's a question of how to make sure the money is getting to where it's needed. It looks like one of the most promising avenues for climate action is in the courts, as lawsuits will force energy companies and governments to accept liability for failing to avoid actions that hard harmful consequences. The message from environmental attorneys is that, if climate policies fail, 'We'll see you in court.' And in the end, the U.S. negotiators actually didn't try to disrupt the negotiations at all, and didn't try to impede global progress toward the Paris Agreement. In some areas, they actually helped make progress, according to European experts[4].

An estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over ten years almost equivalent to 100 percent of the country's GDP for one year is needed to build the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change.Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient , which was prepared in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), was launched at COP23 today by Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum .The Vulnerability Assessment provides significant new analysis of Fiji's vulnerability to climate change, with projections outlining potential impacts for Fiji over the coming decades, covering the impact of climate change on Fiji's economy, livelihoods and poverty levels, health and food security together with key industries including agriculture and tourism, as well as potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas and low lying islands. Key projections from the Assessment include:An increase in the number of Fijians being pushed into poverty and hardship would increase from 25,700 people per year to an estimated 32,400 per year by 2050.A significant increase in the cost of climate change-related disasters, with projections of asset losses from floods and cyclones costing up to 30 percent higher than current averages .Sea-level rise and increased intensity of coastal storms, with most models projecting an increase in global sea levels of 17-38cm relative to current levels by 2065, potentially creating a major threat for the country; with 30 percent of Fiji's population currently living in risk-prone areas.Much can be done to help Fiji minimize risks and adapt to climate change. The Assessment identifies 125 measures across five priority areas that could make Fiji and Fijians more resilient. The five areas include: building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; improving infrastructure services; climate smart agriculture and fisheries; conserving ecosystems and building socioeconomic resilience. According to the Assessment, an estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over 10 years is required to finance these interventions, in addition to maintenance and operation costs and social protection systems.Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said the Assessment is critical for climate and risk-informed development to strengthen the resilience of the Fijian economy.Michel Kerf , the World Bank's Country Director for the Pacific Islands, said that the World Bank had set out to support Fiji with a comprehensive Assessment that would paint a realistic picture of the challenges ahead and provide a roadmap of recommended priorities for climate resilience.""This Assessment presents, in stark terms, clear evidence of the costs of climate change,"" said Kerf.

If it succeeds, Brazil will be subsidizing oil reserves whose development could alone eat up at least 7 percent of humanity's remaining carbon budget.The bill was proposed in August but is only being voted now, at an ominous timing - during COP23 and days after the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) published data indicating that 2017 will be one of the three hottest years on record.In a moment when all countries in Bonn pledge that reducing carbon emissions is key to a safe climate future and the current NDCs are not enough to deliver it, the known pre-salt oil reserves are a climate time bomb. They are thought to contain 176 billion recoverable barrels, which if burned could release 74,8 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. This is equivalent to 7 per cent of all carbon dioxide humanity can still emit if it wants to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming below 2 degreeC, and to 18 per cent of what we can still dump in the air to meet the more ambitious goal of stabilizing warming at 1.5 degreeC - the only safe temperature limit for island nations like Fiji, host of COP23.COP23, in Bonn, is for countries to step up and raise ambition in their NDCs from 2020 onwards. Brazil must scale up renewable energy and keep the pre-salt reserves underground, for the benefit of its people and as its fair share to keep the temperature rise at 1.5oC"", says Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, leader of WWF's Climate and Energy Practice.A few days before the beginning of COP23, new data published by the Brazilian Climate Observatory showed that Brazil's greenhouse-gas emissions rose 8.9 percent in 2016 from the previous year, even though during a deep recession. Brazil, the world's seventh biggest climate polluter, thus became the only major economy in the world to increase pollution without growing income. According to Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, it shows the contradiction between the country's international discourse and national action.""This bill is not only a climate freak, but also an economic liability for a country still mired in recession. By giving big oil a subsidy in the tune of hundreds of billions, President Michel Temer is either dooming the planet or tying his country to stranded fossil assets"", says Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. ""Since the President was irresponsible enough as to send this bill to Congress, the task of stopping the madness now is in the hands of House speaker Rodrigo Maia.""Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, adds that the incentives to accelerate the development of pre-salt have consequences not only to Brazil but the whole planet. ""This is a terrible sign, more important than speeches are the practical actions that can drive us to fight climate change. With this bill, Brazil will make the global responsibility to reduce emissions even more difficult than it already is"".""The Brazilian government should be honoring the commitments it assumed under the Paris Agreement and completely restructuring its energy matrix, redirecting resources to renewable energies. But instead, they are giving subsidies that strengthen the fossil fuel industry. This bill not only damages public safety, but also will exponentially increase the country's greenhouse gas emissions.

And for many island nations, the impact of climate change also represents the gravest of threats to their survival and viability , including, for some, through the loss of territory due to sea-level rise and the potential danger of being wiped off the face of the earth.Chaired by FAO Director-General Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, the meeting of leaders from nine small island developing states (SIDS) and representatives of regional development bodies, plus New Zealand and Australia, focused on Improving food security and nutrition, building resilient livelihoods and promoting partnerships for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands. The nine participating countries included Kiribati, Vanuatu, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Samoa, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea and French Polynesia, whose inhabitants face a potentially severe food crisis triggered mostly by climate change.Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva. Credit: FAOIn his opening remarks on Saturday, Graziano da Silva shared the Pacific leaders' concerns about the negative impact of climate change on food security and nutrition and its role in exacerbating the burden of malnutrition as well as the alarming overweight and obesity levels. You are suffering from things that you didn't cause, from things you are not responsible for the impact of climate change, the FAO Director-General said. This is what FAO offers support so that you can face climate change; scale up growing local products as we see you import more and more food. Obesity is a big problem. It is an epidemic that we need to address. Together with partners such as WHO, we promote the uptake of healthy, fresh food fruits, vegetable and fish instead of processed food. We promote local products bread fruit, for which we have a pilot programme in the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Nauru, and which we want to scale up and multiply, he addedIn a joint statement, following the meeting Saturday, the Pacific leaders called upon all countries to exceed previous commitments and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \'b0C as above pre-industrial levels, to reduce the adverse impacts on food security and nutrition, coastal habitats and the livelihoods of those depending on oceans. The 1.5 degrees limit will allow for a greater change at maintaining resilient livelihoods and promote partnerships for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands, the HYPERLINK statement read.Also participating in the meeting were officials from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Director-General of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency and Chief executive officer of the Pan Pacific Power Association.The joint statement was also a call to action to the UN climate change Conference of Parties (COP 23The meeting, which concludes November 17, will be presided over by the government of Fiji, a small island developing state in the Pacific.The leaders also raised concerns about the negative impacts of malnutrition evidenced by the growing incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which accounts for 75 percent of adult deaths in the Pacific, and called for more proactive and integrated actions to promote policies to tackle food insecurity challenges, especially on issues related to obesity, stunting, wasting and NCDs. They acknowledged the importance of the FAO and partners' HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7135e.pdfGlobal Action Programme on Food Security and Nutrition in SIDS, which recommends action at global, regional, national and local level to accelerate food security and nutrition, calling for its endorsement and immediate implementation.With Pacific island states highly dependent on their oceans for their livelihoods and food security, leaders reiterated their anxiety about ecosystem degradation, and called upon the international community to assist in maximizing the sustainable utilization of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for the benefit of small island developing states.According to FAO, the Pacific islands are among the most environmentally vulnerable nations in the world. Drought, extreme high tides, violent winds, and storm surges pose major risks to small island nations, and their efforts to achieve sustainable development.With Oceans Day events taking place at COP23 on Saturday, Graziano da Silva highlighted the importance of the FAO HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/port-state-measures/en/Port State Measures AgreementUrging all Pacific Island states to adhere to the agreement, he said: You are countries with more water and natural resources to preserve than any other countries.

This mission marks the Governors 35th trade and marketing mission.The Governor and his delegation will participate in more than 50 meetings over the course of the mission. The Governor will meet with senior business executives in each country and attend the United Nations , as well as promote Virginias desirable business location advantages and tourism assets. In addition, Governor McAuliffe and team will also promote increased opportunities for Virginia agricultural products including: seafood, wine, craft beverages, leaf tobacco, produce, lumber, and specialty food and beverage products.Promoting Virginia in the global marketplace allows us to recruit more foreign direct investment and expand trade routes for Virginia good and services, which are key to our efforts to build a new Virginia economy, said Governor McAuliffe. More than 550 international companies from more than 55 countries have operations in Virginia and these trade and marketing missions are vital to growing international business investment in the commonwealth. During this mission, I look forward to closing more deals and bringing more international companies home to Virginia.Virginia and the United Kingdom have a strong and robust partnership. The United Kingdom is one of Virginias largest export destinations, ranked fourth for overall exports of Virginia goods and services and in agriculture and forestry exports. Additionally, the United Kingdom ranks first in international employment, employing 3,039 Virginians from 2012 to 2016.Denmark is the 26th largest international investor into the Commonwealth of Virginia, and ranks 27th when it comes to employing citizens in the commonwealth.Germany is the fifth largest market for total Virginia exports and is an important market for Virginia agriculture and forestry products.

An estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over ten years - almost equivalent to 100 percent of the country's GDP for one year - is needed to build the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change.Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, which was prepared in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), was launched at COP23 today by Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum.The Vulnerability Assessment provides significant new analysis of Fiji's vulnerability to climate change, with projections outlining potential impacts for Fiji over the coming decades, covering the impact of climate change on Fiji's economy, livelihoods and poverty levels, health and food security together with key industries including agriculture and tourism, as well as potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas and low lying islands. Key projections from the Assessment include:An increase in the number of Fijians being pushed into poverty and hardship would increase from 25,700 people per year to an estimated 32,400 per year by 2050.A significant increase in the cost of climate change-related disasters, with projections of asset losses from floods and cyclones costing up to 30 percent higher than current averages.Sea-level rise and increased intensity of coastal storms, with most models projecting an increase in global sea levels of 17-38cm relative to current levels by 2065, potentially creating a major threat for the country; with 30 percent of Fiji's population currently living in risk-prone areas.Much can be done to help Fiji minimize risks and adapt to climate change. The Assessment identifies 125 measures across five priority areas that could make Fiji and Fijians more resilient. The five areas include: building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; improving infrastructure services; climate smart agriculture and fisheries; conserving ecosystems and building socioeconomic resilience. According to the Assessment, an estimated FJ$9.3 billion (US$4.5 billion) over 10 years is required to finance these interventions, in addition to maintenance and operation costs and social protection systems.Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said the Assessment is critical for climate and risk-informed development to strengthen the resilience of the Fijian economy.Michel Kerf, the World Bank's Country Director for the Pacific Islands, said that the World Bank had set out to support Fiji with a comprehensive Assessment that would paint a realistic picture of the challenges ahead and provide a roadmap of recommended priorities for climate resilience.""This Assessment presents, in stark terms, clear evidence of the costs of climate change,"" said Kerf. ""Yet crucially it also provides an evidence-based resource from which we can best support Fiji, and other island countries, in their drive towards more climate resilient development.""The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was launched at COP23 alongside a 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR) experience, Our Home, Our People ( HYPERLINK http://www.ourhomeourpeople.comwww.ourhomeourpeople.comCOP23 delegates, decision-makers and the global community to Fiji to see the impacts of climate change for themselves.Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient was produced by the Fijian Government in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 10, 2017Contact: Dan Gavidi, (+679) 9905966, HYPERLINK taniela.gavidi@govnet.gov.fjCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6071261 MSTRUCK\l"

Instead, the GOP is\~working actively[3]\~to increase production and consumption of fossil fuels and to slow the transition to renewable energy. How can conservatives be moved on climate change? I recently heard a podcast that helped me order my thoughts on this perennial debate. It was\~Political Research Digest[4], a weekly 15-minute research round-up hosted by Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossman for the\~Niskanen Center[5]. (Grossman is the author of\~Asymmetric Politics[6], a crucial text for understanding American political parties. The podcast is nerdy and good.) In the\~third episode[7], Grossman takes a look at some recent literature on climate change opinion and how, if at all, it can be shifted among conservatives. It begins well, with an excellent lay of the land. But the discussion of how to move forward goes off course, in a very familiar way. It stops short of contemplating the uncomfortable but increasingly likely possibility that persuading conservatives on this subject has become impossible, and what that might mean for those concerned about the looming dangers of climate change. Let's start with a look a few basic facts about public opinion on climate. Conservatives probably can't be persuaded on climate change.

Once operationalized, the airport will save power and water corresponding to the annual consumptions of 19,000 households and 5,500 households, respectively. These savings are expected to hit TL 33.2 million annually.The 23rd United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties took place November 6-17 in Bonn, Germany. Convened every year since 1995 to evaluate the progress on the fight against climate change, the conference saw participation of representatives and guests from the UN member states.Mehmet Kalyoncu, Board Member at Kalyon Holding and Executive Board Member of IGA, shared his views on the meeting: ""Istanbul New Airport is the world's largest airport under one roof and built from scratch. At IGA, we placed faith in our airport's capability of contribution to Turkey's sustainability culture, right from the inception. The airport is globally unprecedented in many aspects. We are in the know of the responsibility we have shouldered. We started off with environmental and social impact assessments of the highest world standards. In an era marked by a rapidly changing technology, the fact that we build the entire infrastructure from scratch, unlike ongoing airport renovation projects in Europe, enables us to bring to life a much more innovative and sustainable airport. With these features, Istanbul New Airport will outperform existing airports in respect of saving and efficiency. We foresee to save power and water amounting to TL 33.2 million annually.""Informing that the terminal building will be 20 percent energy-efficient and will save up to 40 percent of water according to well-established standards set by The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), Kalyoncu added: ""All businesses to operate in the New Airport, designed in accordance with LEED Silver certification requirements, will have the green building certificate. Buildings such as the Air Traffic Control tower, the mosque and the State Guest House were also designed in accordance with LEED certification standards."" Mehmet Kalyoncu also remarked that the structures to be utilized by third parties, including office buildings, hangars and cargo facilities, were contracted on the condition to meet the Green Building Certification requirements.Noting that Istanbul New Airport is built to operate as a sustainable and environment-friendly as well as a barrier-free airport, Kalyoncu continued his remarks: ""At INA, we have been satisfying the Green Airport requirements all along, starting from the construction phase. Built and set for operation in compliance with IFC standards, INA will also feature third party companies following the highest global environmental and social standards.""Mehmet Kalyoncu elaborated on the sustainability-oriented technologies utilized in the design and construction phases: ""With the BIM (Building Information Modeling) system, we improve efficiency in design and construction. Basically, we reduce waste in terms of cost, time, and quality, and monitor subcontractors to eliminate unforeseen overspending.""""The studies we carried out here as well as the resulting accumulation of knowledge have become a case study for the global aviation industry. We are frequently invited to international conferences, for our studies set an example. We intend to share with everybody the knowledge, know-how and experience we acquired here so as to contribute to the sustainable development of the aviation sector,"" said Kalyoncu, emphasizing that detailed and technical investigation into environmental and sustainability aspects of Istanbul New Airport set a high-profile role model for world aviation.Mehmet Kalyoncu also pointed out that they launched the IGA Social Investment Program on January 1st, 2016, in a bid to contribute to the socio-economic development of the local communities in neighborhoods close to the project site and manage in the best way possible the current and potential effects of the project; adding that they were nominated for three global awards in their social management projects to date.Istanbul New Airport to minimize impacts of climate change!Ulku Ozeren, IGA Director of Environment and Sustainability, who delivered a presentation titled ""Istanbul New Airport Climate Change Action Plan"" as part of the UN COP23 forum ""Adaptation to Climate Change and Sustainable Practices in Aviation"", described environment and sustainability as their first priorities.

Click here to view video of the event on demand.Below is a statement from Rachel Cleetus, lead economist and climate policy manager at UCS.""Along with other parts of the world, this year, the U.S. experienced some of the worst climate and extreme weather-related events to date. A record-breaking wildfire season in the West caused over 50 deaths, and has resulted in nearly 8.9 million acres burned and over $2.7 billion in federal firefighting costs. Hotter, drier conditions--often a fingerprint of climate change--are contributing to a longer and more severe western wildfire seasons. Similarly, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were ravaged by intense hurricanes fed by warmer waters, resulting in record-breaking floods, loss of power, damage to homes and infrastructure, and contributing to potentially hundreds of deaths. The final numbers for this year's disasters are not yet in, but experts estimate the damage costs will likely top $300 billion.""Scientific projections show the risks of climate-related disasters like wildfires, droughts and floods will become increasingly severe as the planet warms, and with that we can expect economic costs to also grow exponentially. This makes policies and resources to protect and prepare communities for current and future impacts of climate change all the more paramount.""Below is a statement from Kathy Egland, chair of the Environmental and Climate Justice Committee for the NAACP National Board of Directors.""Some communities are hit harder than others when disaster strikes. Historical disenfranchisement often leads to people of color being underprotected during extreme weather emergencies. To help these communities we need a three-pronged approach that aims to minimize damages in areas seeing recurring disasters, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, and limit industry efforts to pawn off their harmful product on low-income communities. That's why the NAACP is working to build an energy system that creates quality jobs to grow the economy, and ensures equal access to the benefits offered by renewables.""Below is a statement from Saleemul Huq, director of the ICCCAD at Independent University in Bangladesh.""The devastation of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, are not limited to the U.S. Despite being well adapted to annual river flooding during monsoon season, one-third of Bangladesh found itself underwater earlier this year due to unyielding rain. This historic rainfall left the nation reeling leaving more than 1,000 dead, hundreds of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed, and a large portion of their crops devastated. Human induced climate change requires nations around the world to redefine a 'new normal' as weather events become more intense and destructive.""Additionally, UCS discussed the results of their first-of-its-kind study recently published in Climatic Change, which finds that top fossil fuel producers such as ExxonMobil and Chevron are responsible for as much as half of the global surface temperature increase and roughly 30 percent of global sea level rise. The study examined attribution during two time periods--before and after 1980, when investor-owned fossil fuel companies were aware of the threat posed by their products.Below is a statement for Peter Frumhoff, chief climate scientist and director of science and policy at UCS.""Up until this point, governments and taxpayers have shouldered the responsibility on growing climate change costs--for both damages and measures to adapt. The science now enables us to quantify how much specific companies' products have caused the Earth to warm and seas to rise, begging the question of who should pay for their mounting costs moving forward.""Fossil fuel companies could've taken any number of steps, such as investing in clean energy or carbon capture and storage, yet many chose to instead spend millions of dollars to deceive the public on climate science or block sensible limits on carbon emissions for decades. The victims of these companies' irresponsible decisions should not have to continue to foot the bill. This new scientific data can and should help inform juries and judges, as well as governments, who may seek to have fossil fuel producers pay their fair share.""This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 14, 2017.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6073648 MSTRUCK\l"

Leith Anderson, president of the United States-based National Association of Evangelicals, noting that most of the world's population has some religious affiliation. ''Environmental catastrophes'' like recent storms, flooding and droughts, he said, ''create opportunities to persuade.'' The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox, president of the Evangelical Environmental Network, said he had given hundreds of talks on the issue. ''Many evangelicals believe in climate change or understand the science in climate change, but they still see it as a future event,'' he said. ''It's not something they have to worry about, and that is what we have to change.'' Mr. Hescox added: ''The way to move conservatives around the world is to talk about how it impacts or affects their children, their own lives.'' The three-day conference on public health and the planet, which ended Saturday, was hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The conference reviewed studies and data that have emerged since Francis issued a forceful 2015 encyclical that highlighted the social and ethical issues caused by climate change, including mass migration and famine. The participants shared ''the most recent solid science on how climate change and air pollution undermines health, increases chronic diseases and the early results on how it impacts the brain,'' said Joachim von Braun, the president of the Pontifical Academy.

Gov. Jerry Brown argued at a Vatican City climate symposium on Nov. 4, exactly one year after the accord entered into force just days before Trump was elected. ""I would say over time, given the commitments in this room today, and what we are seeing around the world, the Trump factor is very small, very small indeed in comparison.""Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown poses for a photo in Rome on Nov. 3, 2017, ahead of climate talks at COP23.Source: AP Photo/ Alessandra TarantinoWhile Brown said Americans ""are very much in support of serious climate action,"" he waved off applause from leading scientists, religious leaders and politicians assembled at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ""If Trump was our only problem, we'd have it solved ... The problem is us. It's our whole way of life. It's our comfort. It's the greed. It's the indulgence it is a challenge of transformation, and a transformation in the profoundest way possible.""The governor's comments came on the first leg of a two-week trip through Europe in which the leader of the world's sixth-largest economy is acting as the de facto U.S. point man in a series of international climate talks at the Vatican, the European Union in Brussels, a German state government, a meeting of scientific academies in Norway and at this year's 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP23, in Bonn, Germany. In June, Brown was appointed as COP23 special envoy for states and regions.Brown, a Roman Catholic, called for leaders of all faiths to participate at secular climate talks, citing a need for ""a clear prophetic voice"" on the imperative of climate change instead of a language that is ""too opaque, too bureaucratic,"" including in the Paris accord itself. ""There's no way in hell that's going to motivate people,"" he said. A ""religious"" and ""prophetic spirit"" must accompany political, scientific and technological solutions, he added.Preaching cap and trade to a skeptical popeIn his 184-page encyclical in 2015, Pope Francis called on the world to transition to renewable energy from fossil fuels to address social and ethical inequities linked to climate change. In it, he criticized market mechanisms, such as California's cap and trade program, referring to carbon trading a possible ""new form of speculation"" that would not help reduce global emissions. However, Brown and Kevin de Le\'f3n, California's state Senate president pro-tempore, who has co-authored several landmark energy and climate laws, defended cap and trade as a key part of the state's bid to slash greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% by mid-century.Kevin de Le\'f3n speaking to supporters as he launched his run for U.S. Senate on Oct. 18, 2017.Source: AP Photo / Jae C. Hong""I understand the deep skepticism of market mechanisms articulated by Pope Francis,"" de Le\'f3n, a 2018 U.S. Senate candidate running against Senator Dianne Feinstein, said. ""We are not relying on market mechanisms alone It complements a host of direct measures we have taken in recent years.""Among those measures, California requires utilities to reach 50% nonhydroelectric renewable electricity by 2030, he said, adding that he will continue to press the case for 100% carbon-free power for 2045 despite the recent failure of his legislative proposal to set that target. Moreover, through cap-and-trade auctions, ""we are taking billions of dollars from polluters to put solar panels on rooftops in poor neighborhoods"" and to ""take dirty diesel engines off the road and replace them with electric vehicles"" in the areas most severely impacted by local air pollution.Under a 2012 law authored by de Le\'f3n, at least a quarter of auction revenues flow to the state's poorest, most polluted areas. ""As I like to say: We are teaching electric vehicles to speak Spanish,"" the state senator said. California's combination of market-based policies and mandates is ""a model to governments around the world"" on equitable renewable energy and environmental policies, he added. ""America may not have the leadership at this time. But I submit to each and every one of you: California does.""\l"

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA278","AT CLIMATE SUMMIT, TWO GLOBAL ENERGY ALLIANCES EMERGE","November 19, 2017 Sunday","IPS - Inter Press Service","As the summit of governments known as reached its conclusion in Bonn, Germany this week, two clear alliances have emerged in the global energy landscape.One of them, the International Solar Alliance, was launched in Paris and is all set to become a legal entity. The other, an alliance to phase out coal, was announced on Dec. 16 in one of the biggest developments at COP23.Jointly launched by Britain and Canada - both developed countries - the alliance already has 20 members, including Italy, France, Mexico, Norway, El Salvador and several U.S. states.The International Solar Alliance, on the other hand, is led by India - an emerging economy. Forty-four countries have already joined this alliance, of which 16 have also ratified it. As a result, the alliance will come into force on Dec. 6.New Emissions Data, New AlliancesThe launch of the Global Alliance to Power Past Coal comes at a time when global carbon emissions are rising. Earlier in the week, the University of East Anglia and Global Carbon Project global emissions report showed a significant rise in global carbon emissions in 2017. The rise was observed after three years during which emissions figures were static. The biggest increase in carbon emissions occurred in China and India.According to the report, Global CO2 emissions from all human activities are set to reach 41 billion tons (41 Gt CO2) by the end of 2017. Meanwhile emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach 37 Gt CO2 - a record high. China's emissions are projected to grow by 3.5 percent while India's emissions are projected to grow by 2 percent.Launching the new alliance to phase out coal, Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said, ""Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities with close to a million dying every year from coal pollution. I am thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy - and this is only the beginning.""The members of the new alliance, which aims to grow to 50 by the next COP in 2018, would not only phase out coal in their own countries by 2030 but also stop investing in coal-fired electricity both within and outside of their countries.In sharp contrast, the members of the other alliance - the ISA - are reluctant to make any commitment to end coal energy before 2030. India, the leader of the alliance and a major coal producer, argues that coal is needed to end poverty and provide its poor citizens access to electricity. The country plans to produce 1.5 billion tons of coal by 2020 - double the amount it produces now.""From the Indian perspective, let me make it very clear: there are development imperatives which as a country we need to fulfill. If you look at the total emissions, our contribution is miniscule. The point is, while this factor is spoken of, what is not spoken [about] is India's extreme effort at trying to get energy much better,"" said India's Environment Secretary in a definite statement to the press.""Today we are talking of producing 175 gigawatt of energy from renewable sources by 2022. Of that 120 GW will be from solar and the rest from biomass and others. Coal will continue to be used for some time, but we are continuously looking at alternative sources of energy.""Anand Kumar, secretary at India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said that IAS's core goal is to bring 121 countries on a single platform to explore ways to utilize and promote solar energy. Besides production, the alliance would also focus on making solar energy cheaper and more accessible by garnering investment, bringing down the cost of solar cells, solar modules and solar storage.The other prominent members of the alliance - China, Australia and New Zealand - still heavily invest in coal, even as they're trying to produce more energy from renewable sources. At the COP, soon after the emissions report was presented by the University of East Anglia, Brazil, India, South Africa and China - known as the BASIC countries - released a joint statement reiterating their right to grow and asking the world to look at their emissions from the perspective of equity.No coal vs no unabated coalHowever, even as the new Global Alliance to Power Past Coal was announced, some of the statements raised doubts over whether the alliance only wanted to end unabated coal or coal in general.Unabated coal refers to plants that are not fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which captures the harmful emissions that cause global warming.According to Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry in the UK and one of the alliance's leaders, unabated coal was ""the dirtiest"" and her country would try to end using it. ""The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2015 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit.""Perry did not elaborate if the UK or the new alliance would still support use of abated or partially abated coal.India, which otherwise refuses to end its use of coal, is also in favor of using partially abated or so-called ""clean coal."" Says C K Mishra, ""We are also looking at making use of better quality coals.""Sitting on the Fence: Germany's non-partisan status - has not announced its intention to join either of these alliances. This has been severely criticized by anti-coal activists who have accused Germany of having a double standard by organizing the climate conference while not taking a strong step on either ending coal or shifting to renewable energy.On Nov. 15, as Angela Merkel reached the COP to address the parties, the activists laid out a red banner that read ""keep it in the ground"" for the chancellor to walk on.""We want no coal. We want no dirty power,"" said one of the activists who was not allowed inside the conference.\l"

The two discussed cooperation in advancing carbon capture, utilization and storage, according to a Canadian government statement. The meeting comes ahead of the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties, or COP23, summit planned for November in Bonn, Germany.Canada's government has legislated the end to coal-plant emissions by 2030, while the U.K. plans to phase out traditional coal-fired generation by 2025. Canada has already granted exemptions to its plan to isolated provinces without access to natural gas sources that would back up renewables. While other countries participating in COP23 have agreed to cut emissions, host country Germany and China are both expanding their coal-fired generating fleets.""Canada and the United Kingdom will champion a global alliance on the transition from unabated coal-fired electricity at next month's United Nations climate change meetings in Bonn, Germany,"" the ministers said in a joint statement. ""Phasing unabated coal power out of the energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technologies will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve the health of our communities, and benefit generations to come. We are doing our part, but we recognize the need to accelerate the international transition from burning coal to using cleaner power sources.""Canada already has two industrial-scale carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, projects in operation, Royal Dutch Shell plc's Quest CCS project and SaskPower's Boundary Dam project. Those facilities were both built with provincial government aid prior to the election of McKenna's government.\l"

Markey (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR), expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. The resolution highlights that fact that, despite President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw from the historic climate accord, the United States has experienced emissions reductions during a period of economic growth, and that state and local governments are committing to clean energy deployment that will help ensure the United States can meet its climate goals.""There is no doubt that global climate change poses a growing threat to our planet, our country, our Great Lakes and Wisconsin,"" said Senator Baldwin.

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA282","Virtue signaling won't save the planet, but state compacts might","November 21, 2017 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington: R Street Institute Organization has issued the following news release: Senior U.S. climate officials arrived Monday in Bonn, Germany, a week into the latest meeting of the United Nations-sponsored climate change project known as the Conference of Parties-23 (COP-23). To no one\' s surprise, the  rest of the world (which is to say, Europe and the American political left, mostly) remains unhappy about the United States\' decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord in June. Nonetheless, they are committed to find a way to persuade the country (which is to say, the red states) to see the error of its ways. Over the weekend, four Democratic governors from states with active environmental movements Jay Inslee of Washington, Jerry Brown of California, Kate Brown of Oregon and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia verbally thrashed the Trump administration, although Brown was taken aback when even he was booed and heckled by  climate justice protestors. But to no avail. On Monday, as several of Trump\' s most senior climate negotiators took part in a panel talk on  clean fossil fuels, attendees started singing a clever protest song to the tune of Lee Greenwood\' s  God Bless the U.S.A. But the Trump administration still plans to exit the Paris Agreement. What gives? Suffice it to say, taking moral umbrage at the United States doesn\' t have the same coercive power over American policy as the Pentagon\' s nuclear umbrella over Europe or the U.S. Navy and its 11 aircraft carriers keeping the world\' s trade routes has had on global policy. Hence, the distinction between  hard power and  soft power made many years ago by Harvard\' s Joseph Nye. The top-down approach to climate change the United Nations prefers was never going to work. Major climate meetings have been taking place for 23 years hence the name COP23 but have never succeeded in creating a workable international scheme. On two separate occasions, the United States has signed up and then removed itself from a global climate agreement, first in 2001 under George W. Bush and now in 2017 under Trump. Thankfully, a more decentralized approach to carbon policy is quietly gaining steam, as states and cities band together to pursue their own goals. Speaking during a panel discussion in Bonn, McAuliffe celebrated the recent election wins in Virginia, which ushered in a new swath of Democrats who will enjoy something like parity with Republicans in the Legislature\' s lower house, not to mention a new Democratic governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. This means Virginia will likely become a member of the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which has had some success cutting emissions from the power sector. Carbon markets are less economically efficient than a carbon price, but since its creation in 2005, RGGI state carbon emissions have fallen 40 percent, thanks in large part to the development of natural gas reserves from hydraulic fracturing. While RGGI is not an ideal vehicle to place a market price on carbon, this type of compulsory, cost-sharing system is the longest-lasting successful carbon market still in existence. Along with Virginia, the election of a Democrat to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey also means that state may rejoin RGGI, after leaving the group in 2011. In other words, the growth of regional carbon markets is still a going concern. It even could force real U.S. emissions reductions in the coming years, even as the sound and fury of U.N. meetings along the Rhine continue to signify nothing. \l"

President Trump will be in the Philippines on 12-13 November.""While Trump seems to deny climate change and apparently defends fossil fuel interests, Filipinos have learned the hard way that climate change is real and happening now. Greenpeace stands with typhoon survivors and all those impacted by climate change, and especially with the brave activists fighting for climate justice through the courts,"" said Sano.Typhoon Haiyan (or Yolanda in the Philippines), packed 300km/h winds and a 7.5m storm surge that locals say claimed many more lives than the official toll of 6,329, and displaced millions of people who are still rebuilding their lives. The Haiyan commemoration honours those lost and celebrates the second lease on life that survivors feel they've been given, as well as the fighting spirit that the local Waray-Waray people are famous for.In 2015, Filipino typhoon survivors, other communities suffering the impacts of climate change, and civil society organisations, including Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Philippines), filed a petition with the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in the Philippines to investigate the responsibility of big fossil fuel companies for climate-related human rights harms (2). The Commission has called on 47 carbon producers, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Total, BHP Billiton, Suncor, and ConocoPhillips, to show up at the first meeting with the petitioners on 11 December, as part of its investigation.As part of the Haiyan commemoration, over 500 students and local community members sent a strong visual message to Bonn, calling for climate justice in a world where those least responsible for climate change suffer the worst consequences. Commemoration activities also include art exhibits and storytelling events, culminating in a memorial walk and candlelight vigil on 8 November to mark the anniversary.Yeb and his brother, AG Sano, a visual artist, activist, and Haiyan survivor, are among the CHR signatories. AG is currently in Bonn to call for climate justice on behalf of the other petitioners. On 6 November, AG Sano delivered a message during the COP23 opening plenary: ""You might remember when an emotional Philippine negotiator spoke about Typhoon Haiyan at COP19 in Warsaw (3), and his despair for his own brother in the eye of the storm.

"COP23","USA","COP23_USA285","McAuliffe will help us breathe easier; Stephen Goodwin column: McAuliffe will help Virginians breathe easier","November 22, 2017 Wednesday","Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia)","The news from the recent 23rd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP23, is disturbing. The meeting, which took place in Bonn, Germany, is the first set of international climate talks since Donald Trump announced his plans in June to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. At the meeting the Trump administration used its only public forum to promote dirty energy sources like fossil fuels and nuclear power.The Trump administration ignores its own science about the health and climate dangers of fossil fuels. It is well known combustion of fossil fuels emits volumes of pollutants, which can cause a variety of illnesses. As the father of a childhood cancer survivor, I am particularly concerned about these negative effects on the health of my children and other Virginians' children. While I am extremely disappointed in the government's position on the Paris climate agreement and its inaction, it is encouraging that U.S. business leaders, activists, and state legislators have used the COP 23 climate talks to show other countries that many Americans are still committed to fighting climate change. Twenty states, more than 50 cities, and 1,400 businesses have signed America's Pledge - an initiative to mobilize states, cities, and companies to comply with the U.S. commitment in the Paris agreement to cut carbon-dioxide emissions. Virginia looks poised to join in this effort by linking to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a collaborative of nine Northeastern states working together to reduce carbon emissions. Governor McAuliffe earlier this year issued Executive Directive 11 - also known as the Clean Energy Virginia initiative - which directed the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to draft proposed regulations to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Last Thursday, the Air Pollution Control Board voted to move this effort forward for public comment as a proposed standard. This common-sense standard will not only reduce carbon pollution in the commonwealth, it will incentivize the development of renewable energy, creating jobs and improving the quality of our air and water. Virginians should be vocal in their support of ED 11, and also urge Governor McAuliffe, along with their representatives in the General Assembly and in Washington, to protect climate action and fight back against Trump's reckless stance on global fossil fuel consumption. Energy monopolies like Dominion Energy are fighting for a massive buildout of Trump-supported fracked gas infrastructure in Virginia, including the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipel"
"COP23","USA","COP23_USA286","CLIMATE: Whitehouse eyes Trump's '2009 persona' in carbon fee push","October 2, 2017 Monday","E&E News PM","In 2009, President Trump and members of his family signed a full-page ad in The New York Times urging then-President Obama to push a global climate change pact negotiated in Copenhagen, Denmark. In a recent interview, climate hawk Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said Trump's flexible stance on climate change combined with his increasing frustration with Republican leadership in Congress could pave the way for a carbon fee. ""There's the prospect of his 2009 persona combining with his impatience with being led down blind alleys,"" Whitehouse said, ""and here is a really big deal that can do something huge and also reduce taxes significantly."" Since Trump launched his bid to hold presidential office, he has openly questioned mainstream climate science and called it a hoax. He also pulled out of the Paris Agreement and is pursuing policies friendly to coal, natural gas and oil interests. The 2009 ad harks back to a time when the real estate mogul was a Democrat. Whitehouse said the public tends to forget Trump's leftist era because Democrats have failed to publicize it and his inconsistent views on global warming. ""Because we're idiots on our side and don't know how to take advantage of openings like this,"" he said. ""I've probably given eight speeches about it on the floor; we even have a big blown-up version of [the ad] to show."" The ad appeared a day before leaders from 192 countries gathered at the United Nations in Denmark to ""determine the fate of our planet,"" the ad reads. ""As business leaders we are optimistic that President Obama is attending Copenhagen with emissions targets,"" it states. ""Please don't postpone the earth. It we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet,"" the ad continues. Trump along with Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump signed on to the advertisement. In the wake of recent hurricanes and wildfires, the Trump administration has been avoiding the subject of climate change. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last month sidestepped answering about whether Trump believes the mainstream scientific finding that humans are driving greenhouse gas emissions higher (Climatewire, Sept. 12). ""The president has addressed this already. I don't think that it's changed over the last several weeks,"" she said. Still, the president has been known to change his mind and shift his policy stances. Whitehouse said he wouldn't rule this out when it comes to a carbon fee. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina recently said he would work with Whitehouse on a carbon fee, though the administration said it was ""off the table"" for the upcoming GOP tax overhaul (E&E Daily, Sept. 28).\l"

The parties made concrete progress on turning the historic 2015 agreement into action on the ground across the world, ahead of next year's UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland.The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework for climate action and the necessary transition to a low-carbon future in order to limit global warming to well below 2degreeC. Under the Paris Agreement the EU has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% till 2030 (1990 level).As stated by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his 2017 State of the Union address, the EU wants to remain the global leader in the fight against climate change. To re-affirm this commitment to ambitious climate action, President Juncker will lead the Commission delegation at the 'One Planet Summit' to be hosted by the French President Emanuel Macron, the United Nations and the World Bank in Paris on 12 December.Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: ""The spirit of Paris is very much alive. We achieved progress in Bonn on the issues that were important to the EU, such as the Paris Work Program. But we must continue to build on this momentum in the coming months, because there is still a lot of work ahead of us before we meet in Katowice next year. The main objective must be to keep the world firmly on the path towards what was agreed two years ago in Paris.""The EU again had a central role in brokering agreements during the two-week climate negotiations. As a sign of climate leadership the EU announced on Thursday that it intends to deposit the ratification instruments of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol by the end of this year. The Doha Amendment concerns the second period of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires parties to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 targets in 2016 by having decreased emissions by 23%. The decision to swiftly ratify the Doha Amendment demonstrates our commitment to the international climate action and shows that the EU makes good on its promises.Concrete steps forward were also taken on the work program for implementing the Paris Agreement. Clarity on the design of the so called 'Talanoa Dialogue' (Facilitative Dialogue) has been achieved looking at how global climate action can be accelerated in the years to come. The Facilitative Dialogue next year will be the opportunity for political stock-taking for the parties on progress made on the implementation of the Paris Agreement.COP23 also brought outcomes on a number of other key issues:Facilitative (Talanoa)DialogueThe design of the Talanoa Dialogue has been agreed here in Bonn to set a firm base for ambitiously accelerating global efforts to tackle climate change. The Dialogue will provide a space to showcase progress and share best practice in tackling climate change, with contributions from every corner of society.Pre-2020 ambitionThe discussions on pre-2020 ambition concluded with an agreement on a decision text which foresees two stocktaking exercises on pre-2020 implementation and ambition to take place at COP24 and COP25. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 target by having decreased emissions by 23% in 2016. Furthermore, the EU and its Member States remain the biggest donors of climate finance to developing countries with a contribution of Euros20.2 billion in 2016.Loss and damageThe parties agreed on a substantive decision text. They worked out a compromise proposal that takes into account asks from the vulnerable and small islands while keeping a balance with what had been already agreed. An expert dialogue will be organised in May 2018 to enhance the support for Loss and Damage.Gender Action PlanThe COP23The Parties agreed on the functioning of the local communities and indigenous peoples' platform, which was established at COP21 in Paris. Again the EU played an important role in securing the outcome.Next stepsAhead of the next UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, the EU will play an active role in a number of key high-level climate events, starting with the 'One Planet Summit' in Paris next month.Next year, the EU will also host the second Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) together with Canada and China, in Brussels, and takes part in the 2018 Petersberg Climate Dialogue, as well as preparatory UN climate meetings in Bonn and Katowice ahead of COP24.The release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5 celsius ahead of Katowice will be an important source of information for discussions under the Talanoa Dialogue.This document was posted showing the date: Nov. 18, 2017Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6082426 MSTRUCK\l"

But when Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of the island nation, stepped up to the podium at the governor's mansion in Sacramento on June 13, the house was packed with state lawmakers and regulators, governors, reporters, and, of course, the host himself, Gov. Jerry Brown.Bainimarama, the incoming president of this year's 23rd Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP23, came to California to enlist Brown as special envoy for states and regions at the meeting, which convenes in Bonn, Germany, in November. As leader of the world's sixth-largest economy, Brown will join COP23 talks on the next steps to avoid a potential climate catastrophe by slashing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent global average temperatures from rising 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.Gov. Jerry Brown speaks to the media June 13 in Sacramento.Source: Garrett Hering, S&P Global Market IntelligenceAfter President Donald Trump earlier in June bowed out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Brown teamed up with the governors of New York and Washington to launch the U.S. Climate Alliance. The group of now 13 states remains committed to reducing emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, as the Obama administration agreed to do when it helped hash out the Paris pact. Brown has also signed several clean energy development agreements with the People's Republic of China and two Chinese provinces.""It there's one thing we have learned over the past two weeks, it's that for every action there is a reaction,"" Bainimarama said. ""People of all walks of life all across America have spoken very loudly, telling the world that America will continue to tackle climate change, continue the clean energy revolution, continue to create jobs and grow its economy so that it can thrive in the 21st century.""As COP president, Fiji's prime minister committed to working with California and other sub-national jurisdictions on actions to limit climate change and mitigate its impacts. ""There is a home for you in the international climate process,"" he said.In addition to appointing Brown as COP23 special adviser, Bainimarama committed Fiji to becoming the latest member of the Under2 Coalition. The group now includes 176 cities, states and countries that have pledged to slash emissions 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. California and the German state of Baden-W\'fcrttemberg co-founded the group, which includes 18 U.S. jurisdictions. Like the Paris agreement and the U.S. Climate Alliance, the Under2 Coalition has nonbinding targets.'The beauty of state action'Asked during a press conference whether states would have a formal seat at the table at COP23, Brown said, ""We're gonna be there. We have a very important role. How the particular formalities actually work out in practice, that's something to be determined. But the nations of the world are convening in Bonn to follow up on their individual commitments at the Paris conference. The states in the Under2 Coalition group, we're gonna be there, too, and we are going to do our part.""""Donald Trump cannot stop the states from making this progress. That's an important fact to understand,"" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee added. ""Think of it this way: Tweets can't stop the heat, and they also can't stop our progress on this issue. Our ability to move forward with our renewable portfolio standards, our cap on carbon, our research and development ... there's so much we can do and the federal government doesn't have the ability to stop. That's the beauty of state action.""Even if their ability to influence federal policy, in turn, is limited, states still committed to the Paris accord aspire to project power beyond their own borders, Inslee and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown acknowledged at the press conference.""This is a circumstance when the federal government is failing to lead. The states can move forward and we can pilot progressive policies that can be replicated by other states,"" Brown said.Inslee pointed to the regional grid proposal led by the California ISO as a platform for Western states to share their renewable energy resources. ""We can work on integration of our electrical grids so that we can move solar and wind energy from where it is to where it isn't much more efficiently."" The proposal first requires the approval of California lawmakers, who are considering a two-year regional grid bill in the Assembly.\l"

Climate financing was highlighted in the Paris Climate Agreement as one of the key measures needed to help countries, particularly in the developing world, adapt and adjust to climate change.Transparency is now an ingrained requirement under the Paris Agreement, with discussions about a new Transparency Framework taking place at COP23. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its funding mechanisms should learn from the best practices. It should also learn from the failures of more established multilateral funds to increase the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement and ensure that climate finance benefits those that truly need it.The progress made by multilateral climate funds on anti-corruption measures is a testament to their willingness to listen to civil society and the needs of affected communities, said Patricia Moreira, managing director of Transparency International. However, good policies require proper implementation, so the task now is for climate funds to make sure that the people they are supposed to help can engage with the decision making processes around how this money is spent.With more and more funds flowing into climate change adaptation and mitigation projects it is more important than ever that the UNFCCC, multilateral funds like the Green Climate Fund, and the other funds assessed take responsibility for their own transparency, integrity, and accountability.Transparency International has long advocated for strong anti-corruption measures within these funds: it is now time to demonstrate the implementation and efficiency of these policies.

Secretary Grumbles will discuss Maryland\' s work to fight climate change and gather insights into how other jurisdictions around the world are addressing challenges involving climate change, the environment, energy, and economic matters.  Maryland is a leader in fighting climate change, and this is a great opportunity to share our approaches and learn from others, Secretary Grumbles said.  The conference is also a chance to tell the world that Maryland is open for business on environmental, energy, and climate change solutions. The 2017 U.N.

The conference\' s stated aims include the fueling of momentum among cities, states, regions, and territories in support of climate action plans. Secretary Grumbles, who is chairman of the independent, bipartisan Maryland Commission on Climate Change, is to participate in over a dozen presentations and meetings with government leaders, businesses and environmental, and scientific and academic organizations starting Saturday and ending next week. He is expected to discuss the actions Maryland is taking to make the state a national leader in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resiliency and preparedness throughout the state and region. When the federal administration withdrew from the Paris Climate Change Agreement earlier this year, the Hogan administration immediately stated its opposition and reaffirmed Maryland\' s commitment to stringent clean air standards. In 2015, in partnership with members of the Maryland General Assembly, Governor Larry Hogan signed legislation to strengthen and expand the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. The governor signed into law the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2016, which requires reductions of greenhouse gases in Maryland by 40 percent by 2030 \- one of the most aggressive requirements in the country \- while continuing to have a net positive effect on both the economy and job creation in Maryland. Governor Hogan also proposed and passed the Clean Cars Act of 2017 to boost the state\' s efforts to encourage the use of electric vehicles. Maryland is a member of the multi-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In August, Governor Hogan announced that Maryland and the eight other states in RGGI had agreed to reduce the program\' s carbon pollution cap by 30 percent from 2020 to 2030, finding consensus for a stronger and sustainable program that will also grow Maryland\' s economy through innovation and collaboration. Maryland is also encouraging other states to join the bipartisan initiative and for regions around the world to learn about RGGI\' s impressive track record and new tools for clean energy progress. Secretary Grumbles is expected to be one of 10 American state officials to attend meetings and briefings at the conference.

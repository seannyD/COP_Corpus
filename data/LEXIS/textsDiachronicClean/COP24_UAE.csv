Every UN member state signed on. But that will not be enough to head off climate catastrophe. It's time to call in the engineers.The diplomatic success at COP24 was remarkable, given relentless lobbying and foot-dragging by the fossil-fuel industry. The diplomats have read the science and know the truth: without a rapid move to a zero-carbon global energy system by mid-century, humanity will be in grave peril. In recent years, millions of people have suffered the hardships of extreme heatwaves, droughts, flood surges, powerful hurricanes, and devastating forest fires, because the Earth's temperature is already 1.1 Celsius (roughly 2 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.If warming exceeds 1.5C or 2C later this century - temperatures never experienced in the entire 10,000-year history of human civilization - the world will become vastly more dangerous.The Paris accord commits national governments to keep temperatures ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and [to pursue] efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels."" We now have a rulebook for measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, sharing know-how, and measuring financial transfers from rich to poor countries. Yet we still lack the plans for shifting the world energy system to renewable energy by mid-century.The diplomats, of course, are not technical experts. The next stage needs the world's engineering experts on power generation and transmission, electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, artificial intelligence for energy systems management, urban design for energy efficiency and public transport, and related specialists. Diplomats, rather than engineers, have been at the forefront at UN climate summits for the past 24 years. The time for engineers to take center stage has arrived.The Paris accord assumes that each government consults with its own country's engineers to devise a national energy strategy, with each of the 193 UN member states essentially producing a separate plan. That approach reflects a deep misunderstanding of how the global energy transition must work. We need solutions that are agreed and coordinated at the international scale, not country by country.Global engineering systems require global coordination. Consider civil aviation, a triumph of globally coordinated engineering. In 2017, there were 41.8 million flights without a single fatal passenger jet accident. The civil aviation system works so well because all countries use aircraft manufactured by a few global companies and share standard operating procedures for navigation, air traffic control, airport and airplane security, maintenance, insurance, and other operations. Other global systems are similarly coordinated.The transition to renewable energy can be greatly accelerated if the world's governments finally bring the engineers to the fore. I was recently on a panel with three economists and a senior business-sector engineer. After the economists spoke about carbon prices, internalizing externalities, feed-in tariffs, carbon offsets, and the like, the engineer spoke succinctly and wisely. ""I don't really understand what you economists were just speaking about, but I do have a suggestion,"" he said. ""Tell us engineers the desired 'specs' and the timel"

The ""warming trend is obvious and continuing,"" WMO chief Petteri Taalas told reporters in Geneva.The report shows that the global average temperature for the first 10 months of the year was nearly 1.0-degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900).""It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it,"" Taalas warned.With levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, at a record high, ""we may see temperature increase of 3-5C by the end of the century,"" Taalas said.""If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher.""Delegations from nearly 200 countries are due in Poland next week for the latest COP24 climate summit, aimed at renewing and building on the Paris deal and limiting global warming.World leaders have been trying to breathe new life into the 195-nation agreement amid backsliding from several nations -- most notably the United States -- over commitments made when it was signed in December 2015.It is to take effect in 2020 and calls for limiting global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.But experts warn that global warming is on track to surpass three degrees by 2100 and urge governments to do more than first planned to rein it in.""Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life,"" WMO deputy chief Elena Manaenkova stressed in a statement.""It makes a difference to economic productivity, food security, and to the resilience of our infrastructure and cities,"" she said.""It makes a difference to the speed of glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities.""

Let's protect it","November 24, 2018 Saturday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Inaction will haunt the entire planet for generations to comeFarouk Araie The profound contents of the report on climate change released in the US and its global consequences delivers a chilling message to human kind to modify its reckless behaviour, or face climatic catastrophe. An American proverb encapsulates it the best: ""We did not inherit this planet from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.""Inaction will haunt the entire planet for generations to come. It is evident that many will chose to ignore the report, which is supported by right-wing politicians, the coal industry, unenlightened industrialists and self-appointed experts, many of whom speak not from the high ground of sound technical knowledge and wisdom, but from the pit of scientific illiteracy. Sir John Houghton, former head of the United Kingdom's Meteorological Office, once remarked on climate change: ""Like terrorism, this weapon knows no boundaries. It can strike anywhere, in any form, a heat wave in one place, a drought, a flood or storm surge in another.""The world's ecological health is now linked to an artificial life support system. Irrefutable scientific evidence graphically reveals that forests are disappearing and agricultural lands are eroding. In November 2006 in Nairobi, the United Nations discussed that a warmer earth over the next 25 years will put at risk 65 to 95 million Africans, most of them in and around the Sahara. The UN's prediction prompted the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to declare Africa as 'the most vulnerable continent to global warming'.Fish stocks are rapidly diminishing. Land, water and air are being poisoned. Many species of living things are disappearing. The planet is getting warmer, resulting in increasing super storms and dramatic changes in rainfall. We are graphically witnessing the impact of global warming all around us. The past 100 years have seen an unprecedented retreat of glaciers all over the world. In the Alps, around half of total glacier mass was lost between 1850 and 1990. In the US, the 150 glaciers that gave a name to Glacier National Park has been reduced to 48, while the ice caps of Patagonia are melting at an alarming rate creating a deluge of freezing water up to thousand cubic kilometres. In the Himalayas, rapidly retreating glaciers have created 40 huge lakes in Nepal and Bhutan. Hundreds more glacier fed lakes continue to expand an threaten towns, villages and cities in the Tibet, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India.When tress breathe in carbon dioxide from the air, trees absorb and sequester carbon, and they slowly exhale oxygen that all animals breathe. When tress are killed or chopped down for wood or burned for land, the carbon in the trees is released back into the atmosphere.Having too much carbon in the atmosphere has been proven by most scientists and researchers to cause global warming. Unfortunately, humanity is rapidly losing most of the world's forests. Thus, fewer forests indicate fewer trees are sequestering carbon and more carbon is being released into the atmosphere.Global climate change is increasing at an exponential rate, and we are blissfully unaware that we are hurtling towards climatic Armageddon.The writer is based in Johannesburg, South Africa\l"

A string of scientific reports and studies indicate greenhouse gas emissions should be drastically slashed or the consequences could be disastrous.COP24, the two-week 24th conference of the parties of the United Nations Climate Change Convention that has taken off in Katowice, Poland, is the most critical event on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement.It's unfortunate that representatives of some of the most powerful countries and biggest polluters are absent. The United States has gone to the extent of quitting the UN climate process.Yet, on the positive side, most other countries are not giving up on their responsibility and doing their best to alleviate the situation. In fact, to maximise the chances of success in Poland, technical talks began on Sunday, a day early, with delegates from nearly 200 nations debating how to meet the Paris target of limiting global warming to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius.To contain warming at 1.5?C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach ""net zero"" by mid-century.Even with just one degree Celsius of warming so far, Earth has been bombarded with raging wildfires, widespread crop failures and super-storms exacerbated by rising sea levels. If that does not prompt leaders to unite and act, what else will?It is true that expectations for Katowice are low. To have any hope of reaching the 1.5?C goal by the end of the century, emissions from fossil fuel use need to be halved by 2030.

The challenge it presents to all of us is huge.To avoid severe economic and social shocks and protect essential ecosystems, we urgently need to limit the increase in global temperature to within 1.5 Celsius of the pre-industrial level. Achieving the required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will require boldness, creativity and some hard choices. But Costa Rica's experience shows that, in the long run, what is gained far outweighs the sacrifices for all.Climate change is not the first daunting challenge our country - among the world's most biodiverse countries per square metre - has had to overcome to preserve its natural beauty. Deforestation for cattle grazing nearly halved the land covered by forest over the four decades prior to 1986. Government investment in protecting these natural assets was essential, which meant eliminating subsidies for the cattle industry and perverse incentives for agrarian reform.With subsidies and negative incentives gone, Costa Rica's cattle population dropped by a third, taking pressure off grazing lands. In the five decades since, forests have recovered and now cover more than half the country. And while forest cover doubled, Costa Rica's per capita income tripled. From this foundation, the economy has grown sustainably and the country has become a world leader in eco-tourism.Now, as this latest IPCC report makes clear, rising temperature is the new threat to both biodiversity and our economy. We all must combat it.Costa Rica, for its part, has set what President Carlos Alvarado has called the ""titanic and beautiful task"" of decarbonising the economy. One of the goals of the national decarbonisation plan, which will be launched in December, is to ensure that the market properly accounts for the costs of climate change.This policy has the effect of rendering fossil fuels economically uncompetitive - and creating incentives to use Costa Rica's nearly 100 per cent renewable power in the transportation sector to cut our dependence on oil. A moratorium on oil and gas exploitation, respected by five different governments, reinforces these incentives. Making the energy sector work properly - an objective that unites both environmentalists and economists - means recognising that a short-term economic boost cannot justify the long-term costs of fossil fuels.As a minister and a climate activist, we both agree that government has an important role to play in achieving decarbonisation. But the work of non-state actors such as local businesses and communities will also be essential. For this reason, government policy has focused on boosting community-based low-impact tourism initiatives that value local knowledge. The Costa Rican experience shows that environmental stewardship is a job done best by alliances between local people and national leaders, united by the common cause of conservation.At its heart, Costa Rica's approach to climate change is about people, not industry and markets. Our commitment to tackling climate change is based on an understanding of the enormous health risks and costs that arise from inaction. Costa Rica devotes significant resources to tackling problems like dengue fever and malaria because our people remain our most important asset. And staying below the 1.5C limit will mean 3.3 million fewer cases of dengue fever annually in Latin America and the Caribbean, fewer people at risk of malaria, and less food instability and poor nutrition caused by higher temperatures and unstable weather patterns.Costa Rica is proud to be leading the world by putting this approach into practice. As a result, we are one of the few countries ready to exceed our commitments under the Paris climate agreement. Not all of the changes will be easy, and getting them right will require perseverance and a commitment to adaptability. Other countries that agreed as part of the Paris agreement to boost the ambition of their national climate plans by 2020 can learn from our experience in aiming for decarbonisation, investing in natural assets, and recognising the importance of the climate for a healthy population.One of the most obvious lessons is the interdependence of these policies. Climate change is a collective problem, no single policy is enough, and no country can solve it alone. But this interdependence cannot be an excuse for paralysis. Limiting warming to 1.5 Celsius is a goal around which we can all unite in diverse ways.Next month's Climate Vulnerable Forum will bring together leaders from the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change for the first entirely virtual summit of heads of state. Together with the next key intergovernmental meeting, COP24 in Poland this December, political leaders have an opportunity to prove they understand the science underpinning the IPCC report, and are ready to take ambitious steps to achieve the 1.5 target. Unless all of us do so, the consequences will spare none of us.-Project SyndicateMonica Araya is Vice-President of Costa Rica's Electric Mobility Association.

Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed,"" World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said.The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin shows that global concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide have been increasing steadily over the past years. In addition, the report notes a resurgence of a potent greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting substance called CFC-11, which is regulated under an international agreement to protect the ozone layer.The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin reports specifically on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are what remains in the atmosphere, following a complex process of emissions and absorptions.\~Since 1990, there has been a 41% increase in the warming effect by the various greenhouse gases on the climate, known as ""radioactive forcing."" CO2 specifically accounts for about 82% of the increase in radioactive forcing over the past decade, according to figures quoted in the WMO report.\~""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, when the temperature was 2 to 3\'b0C warmer and sea level was 10 to 20 meters higher than now,"" said Mr. Taalas.The WMO report comes on top of the evidence presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special\~report on global warming\~issued last month, which sounded the alarm on the need to reach zero net emissions of CO2 by mid-century, in order to keep temperature increases to below 1.5\'b0C.\~The report showed how keeping temperature increases below 2\'b0C could reduce the risks for the well-being of the planet and its people.""CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere,"" warned WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova. ""Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,"" she insisted.The new report adds yet another building block of scientific evidence to inform decision-making at the upcoming UN climate change conference \- the\~COP 24\~\- planned from 2 to 14 December in Poland. The key objective of this meeting is to adopt an implementation plan for the 2015\~Paris Agreement.Against the backdrop of the sobering report, Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has\~sent a letter to all States, telling them they have legal obligations under international human rights law to prevent climate change and try to mitigate its effects.""Human rights are under threat from a force which challenges the foundations of all life, as we know it, on this planet we share,"" she said, pointing out that the decisions taken CO P24 will govern climate action under the Paris agreement ""for the indefinite future,"" and said that ""the rights of the millions of people [are] threatened by climate change.""\~The global averages presented in the WMO Bulletin, the report says are based on a rigorous tracking of the changing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of industrialization, use of fossil fuels, unsustainable agricultural practices, increases in land use and deforestation.\~The UN has called for urgent actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the national and sub-national levels.\l"

The final meetings of the conference on 16th December, in Katowice, Poland, lasted late into the night. The two-week event, that ran into overtime, ended with the adoption of a set of strong guidelines to ensure the implementation of the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, aimed at containing global temperature rise this century to below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment and head of the UAE delegation at the conference, said, ""The final meetings confirmed the UAE's statement during the conference that time is no longer with us, and the need for decisive climate action has never been more crucial. We managed to forge a global commitment to implement the terms of the Paris Agreement, and pursue the goals of sustainable development to reduce the effects of global warming and climate change and protect the lives of millions of people who are exposed to the negative consequences of this change annually."" The most prominent points and criteria agreed upon at COP24 included a detailed transparency framework meant to promote trust among nations that they are doing their part in addressing climate change. It sets out how countries will provide information about their national action plans, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as mitigation and adaptation measures. The guidelines also spell out how to uniformly count greenhouse gas emissions. If poorer countries feel they cannot meet the standards set, they can explain why the reasons for their non-compliance and present a plan to build up their capacity in that regard. Another notable achievement was that the nations agreed on how to collectively assess the effectiveness of climate action in 2023, and how to monitor and report progress on the development and transfer of technology. Other points include the development of a new vision and mechanisms for global funding for climate action and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In his speech at the conference, Al Zeyoudi recounted the UAE's experience in successfully dealing with the challenges of climate change, working towards achieving sustainability in all sectors and committing, through specific national contributions, to implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement globally. He also invited all delegates to attend the upcoming edition of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Abu Dhabi in January 2019. The annual global platform will bring together thousands of world leaders, businesspersons and experts at conferences, exhibitions and high-level events that seek to identify innovative solutions to global sustainability issues. The UAE delegation held a number of joint meetings on the sidelines of the conference. This included a meeting with Henryk Kowalczyk, Polish Minister of Environment, where they discussed ways of achieving innovative and sustainable solutions. The Minister Al Zeyoudi also met with Masagos Zulkifli, Minister of Environment and Water Resources of Singapore, and discussed ways to enhance cooperation between the two countries in the fields of waste management and sustainability, and on innovations related to climate action. He also held discussions with Jennifer Morris, President of the nonprofit Conservation International, on cooperation in the conservation of marine life. Talks were also held with Erik Grigoryan, Armenian Minister of Natural Protection, on ways to leverage the UAE's experience in protecting biodiversity and achieving sustainability of natural resources.

"COP24","UAE","COP24_UAE6","Let's make tech work for clean air","December 21, 2018 Friday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","The oil-producing Gulf countries should export solar energy from the vast Arabian Desert to both Europe and Asia. Jeffrey Sachs (Earth Matters) This month's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland succeeded in producing a rulebook to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Every UN member state signed on. But that will not be enough to head off climate catastrophe. It's time to call in the engineers. The diplomatic success at COP24 was remarkable, given relentless lobbying and foot-dragging by the fossil-fuel industry. The diplomats have read the science and know the truth: without a rapid move to a zero-carbon global energy system by mid-century, humanity will be in grave peril. In recent years, millions of people have suffered the hardships of extreme heatwaves, droughts, flood surges, powerful hurricanes, and devastating forest fires, because the Earth's temperature is already 1.1 Celsius (roughly 2 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average. If warming exceeds 1.5C or 2C later this century - temperatures never experienced in the entire 10,000-year history of human civilization - the world will become vastly more dangerous. The Paris accord commits national governments to keep temperatures ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and [to pursue] efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels."" We now have a rulebook for measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, sharing know-how, and measuring financial transfers from rich to poor countries. Yet we still lack the plans for shifting the world energy system to renewable energy by mid-century. The diplomats, of course, are not technical experts. The next stage needs the world's engineering experts on power generation and transmission, electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, artificial intelligence for energy systems management, urban design for energy efficiency and public transport, and related specialists. Diplomats, rather than engineers, have been at the forefront at UN climate summits for the past 24 years. The time for engineers to take center stage has arrived. The Paris accord assumes that each government consults with its own country's engineers to devise a national energy strategy, with each of the 193 UN member states essentially producing a separate plan. That approach reflects a deep misunderstanding of how the global energy transition must work. We need solutions that are agreed and coordinated at the international scale, not country by country. Global engineering systems require global coordination. Consider civil aviation, a triumph of globally coordinated engineering. In 2017, there were 41.8 million flights without a single fatal passenger jet accident. The civil aviation system works so well because all countries use aircraft manufactured by a few global companies and share standard operating procedures for navigation, air traffic control, airport and airplane security, maintenance, insurance, and other operations. Other global systems are similarly coordinated. The transition to renewable energy can be greatly accelerated if the world's governments finally bring the engineers to the fore. I was recently on a panel with three economists and a senior business-sector engineer. After the economists spoke about carbon prices, internalizing externalities, feed-in tariffs, carbon offsets, and the like, the engineer spoke succinctly and wisely. ""I don't really understand what you economists were just speaking about, but I do have a suggestion,"" he said. ""Tell us engineers the desired 'specs' and the timeline, and we'll get the job done."" This is not bravado. Here are the specs. To limit warming to 1.5C, the world's energy system must be decarbonized by mid-century. This will require the vast mobilization of zero-carbon energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power, implying a power system that can handle intermittent energy sources that depend on when the sun shines, how hard the wind blows, and how fast the rivers flow. This zero-carbon electricity will power electric vehicles that replace our internal-combustion engine cars. It will also be used to produce zero-carbon fuels such as hydrogen for ocean shipping and synthetic hydrocarbons for airplanes. We will heat our homes and office buildings with zero-carbon electricity rather than with coal, oil, or natural gas. And energy-intensive industries such as steel and aluminum will also replace fossil fuels with zero-carbon electricity and hydrogen. In a sensible global decarbonization plan, many of today's fossil-fuel exporting countries and companies will become tomorrow's exporters of zero-carbon energy. The oil-producing Gulf countries should export solar energy from the vast Arabian Desert to both Europe and Asia. Coal-producing Australia should export solar power from the enormous outback to Southeast Asia via submarine cable. The next big act belongs to the engineers. Energy transformation for climate safety is our twenty-first-century moonshot. When heads of state convene at the UN next September, the world's leading engineers should greet them with a cutting-edge framework for global action. - Jeffrey D.

Dr. Al Zeyoudi conveyed the UAE's message to the international community in his address at the 24th Conference of the Parties, COP24 , to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, in Katowice, Poland, on 12th December, 2018. Delegates from more than 190 countries and territories were part of the audience at the event that aims to formulate the required legislation to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The minister met with Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, on the sidelines of the conference and discussed the challenges posed by climate change and the ways for the international community to cooperate in mitigating its effects. The UN Secretary-General praised the UAE's prominent role in combatting global warming and its efforts globally in supporting initiatives to reduce the consequences of climate change. In his speech, Dr. Al Zeyoudi pointed to the importance of experimenting with models that have proved successful in reducing the effects of climate change, across several sectors. In addition, he called for the adoption of renewable and clean energy projects and called for the dissemination of solutions through effective international initiatives. The UAE has adopted a series of ambitious visions and strategies, including the UAE Vision 2021, to promote sustainability. The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 seeks to bring the share of clean energy in the total energy mix to 50 percent, while the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE streamlines the concept of climate change mitigation and adaptation across the government and private sector. The minister said, ""The UAE has supported these strategies and plans with robust and long-standing initiatives on the ground such as the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park and Noor Abu Dhabi, the world's largest solar power plant that is being built in the UAE capital at a cost of AED3.2 billion. We are currently in the process of assessing the adaptability of our environmental and economic systems to climate change impacts in a bid to boost their efficiency. In addition, we are about to issue the first law on climate change."" ""The UAE has also \- through its government and semi-government entities \- helped deploy renewable energy solutions across the world. The work of the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund, which allocates millions of dollars to execute renewable energy projects that help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the Caribbean island countries, testifies to the country's efforts,"" he added. Dr. Al Zeyoudi noted that in early 2018, the ministry launched the Climate Project on a global scale with the objective of positively influencing 10 million people around the world and helping them become resilient to climate change impacts. The minister pointed out that the impacts of climate change, highlighted in previous cycles, were growing in intensity and frequency, and adversely affecting the lives of millions of people. He said, ""The warning signs are becoming more evident and dramatic \- the devastating forest fires, droughts, floods, and hurricanes are now the norm rather than the exception across the globe. Such climatic catastrophes reaffirm to the international community that we were not blowing the matter out of proportion when we warned against the considerable risks that climate change poses to human lives and property. They also make it very clear for world nations that they have no choice but to intensify their efforts to cut down carbon emissions and expedite climate adaptation measures, both at home and abroad."" Dr. Al Zeyoudi concluded his speech by inviting the delegates to attend the upcoming edition of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Abu Dhabi, in January 2019. The annual global platform will bring together thousands of world leaders, businesspeople and experts to engage in high-profile conferences, exhibitions and activities aimed at identifying innovative solutions to global sustainability issues, with climate change at the forefront.

In a report released ahead of the COP 24 climate summit in Poland, the World Meteorological Organization pointed out that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, and that ""2018 is on course to be the 4th warmest year on record."" The ""warming trend is obvious and continuing,"" WMO chief Petteri Taalas told reporters in Geneva. The report shows that the global average temperature for the first 10 months of the year was nearly 1.0-degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). ""It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it,"" Taalas warned. With levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, at a record high, ""we may see temperature increase of 3-5C by the end of the century,"" Taalas said. ""If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher."" Delegations from nearly 200 countries are due in Poland next week for the latest COP24 climate summit, aimed at renewing and building on the Paris deal and limiting global warming. World leaders have been trying to breathe new life into the 195-nation agreement amid backsliding from several nations -- most notably the United States -- over commitments made when it was signed in December 2015. It is to take effect in 2020 and calls for limiting global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But experts warn that global warming is on track to surpass three degrees by 2100 and urge governments to do more than first planned to rein it in. ""Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life,"" WMO deputy chief Elena Manaenkova stressed in a statement.

An American proverb encapsulates it the best: ""We did not inherit this planet from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children."" Inaction will haunt the entire planet for generations to come. It is evident that many will chose to ignore the report, which is supported by right-wing politicians, the coal industry, unenlightened industrialists and self-appointed experts, many of whom speak not from the high ground of sound technical knowledge and wisdom, but from the pit of scientific illiteracy. Sir John Houghton, former head of the United Kingdom's Meteorological Office, once remarked on climate change: ""Like terrorism, this weapon knows no boundaries. It can strike anywhere, in any form, a heat wave in one place, a drought, a flood or storm surge in another."" The world's ecological health is now linked to an artificial life support system. Irrefutable scientific evidence graphically reveals that forests are disappearing and agricultural lands are eroding. In November 2006 in Nairobi, the United Nations Climate Change Conference discussed that a warmer earth over the next 25 years will put at risk 65 to 95 million Africans, most of them in and around the Sahara. The UN's prediction prompted the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to declare Africa as 'the most vulnerable continent to global warming'. Fish stocks are rapidly diminishing. Land, water and air are being poisoned. Many species of living things are disappearing. The planet is getting warmer, resulting in increasing super storms and dramatic changes in rainfall. We are graphically witnessing the impact of global warming all around us. The past 100 years have seen an unprecedented retreat of glaciers all over the world. In the Alps, around half of total glacier mass was lost between 1850 and 1990. In the US, the 150 glaciers that gave a name to Glacier National Park has been reduced to 48, while the ice caps of Patagonia are melting at an alarming rate creating a deluge of freezing water up to thousand cubic kilometres. In the Himalayas, rapidly retreating glaciers have created 40 huge lakes in Nepal and Bhutan. Hundreds more glacier fed lakes continue to expand an threaten towns, villages and cities in the Tibet, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India. When tress breathe in carbon dioxide from the air, trees absorb and sequester carbon, and they slowly exhale oxygen that all animals breathe. When tress are killed or chopped down for wood or burned for land, the carbon in the trees is released back into the atmosphere. Having too much carbon in the atmosphere has been proven by most scientists and researchers to cause global warming. Unfortunately, humanity is rapidly losing most of the world's forests. Thus, fewer forests indicate fewer trees are sequestering carbon and more carbon is being released into the atmosphere. Global climate change is increasing at an exponential rate, and we are blissfully unaware that we are hurtling towards climatic Armageddon. The writer is based in Johannesburg, South Africa \"

Al Tayer also spoke about the 4th Industrial Revolution, and Artificial Intelligence, AI, Robotics and the Internet of Things, IoT, saying that the digital revolution at DEWA was initiated to support the Dubai 10X initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, to propel Dubai towards the future, taking it 10 years ahead of other global cities through government innovation. \"

A bloc of 44 small island nations -- many facing an existential threat from storm surges engorged by rising seas -- had called on the UN climate body to ""welcome"" a UN report on limiting global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. But the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia blocked the critical word change in the negotiating text of the COP24 summit in Poland. The text was watered down to say that it takes ""note"" of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming. The report had warned that if warming was to be kept to 1.5C this century, then emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be reduced by nearly 50 percent by 2030. With no consensus, under UN rules the passage of the text had to be dropped. The report was ""just insulted really by the governments of the United States and Saudi Arabia and Russia,"" said Gore, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 along with the IPCC for their efforts to build and disseminate knowledge about manmade climate change. ""It was for the three largest producers of petroleum on the planet, to choose a word, 'inconvenient' to welcome the scientific facts,"" Gore said, alluding to his documentaries ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power"".

The $100m pipeline is said to be the largest sustainable trans-emirate pipeline in the country. The pipeline has a peak carrying capacity of 50m gallons per day and supplies water to customers including Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA), and through its connected network to Federal Electricity & Water Authority (FEWA), Utico said in a statement. According to Utico, the pipeline has lower sweating, greater soil movement durability, higher temperatures operation and longer life. These factors are said to contribute to lower energy costs for its operations and a lower carbon footprint. ""The pipeline can be used to pump at both ends or connect in between enabling each emirate to trade water. It also facilitates instant water supply to each Emirate when connected. The investment in the pipeline was only possible due to the firm belief in the future of the UAE as a country of opportunities and in its dynamic visionary leadership,"" said Richard Menezes, CEO of Utico. Menezes said the pipeline is the first of its kind in the country with regards to its size and design. It was built with complete PE 100 HDPE, which is said to make it the most efficient in the country. This project is in line with the sustainability parameters identified for climate change mitigation in generation and transport networks, at the climate change Summit COP24 meeting in Poland. Utico owns over 76m gallons per day (MIGD) of desalination capacity including 40MIGD under construction due for commissioning in 2019/2020.

We all know and understand that if rising global temperatures aren't kept under a certain limit (1.5C above pre-industrial era is a common wisdom), we will see the worst extremes of global warming. So signing on the dotted line of an agreement to that effect should be a no-brainer, right? Now imagine representatives from nearly 200 countries coming together - and failing - to agree to a draft that says just that. That almost happened. In a moral victory for the planet that we are going to leave for our children and theirs, negotiators from nearly 200 countries at the UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP24 , agreed to enforce rules on implementing the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, but not before some eleventh-hour bargaining and histrionics. The dealmakers agreed to the framework on how to compute their greenhouse gas emissions - the first step to actually countering ones that are found at higher than optimum levels. And despite US President Donald Trump's pledge to abandon the Paris Agreement, the US signed the accord, leaving the door open enough for him to stay on if he later decides that climate change is for real, or for any future administrations to re-enter the agreement. Negotiators, however, kicked the proverbial can down the road on certain key decisions - like how richer nations intend to support the poorer ones in meeting the latter's emission targets. Nevertheless, the fact that countries with as diverse economies and national agendas as those of the US, India, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Turkey, Kuwait, Russia and a whole host of others agreed to the 133-page agreement - which entails the basic building blocks for putting the Paris Agreement in force - is a step in the right direction, and leaves breathing space for our children. \"

The situation is dire because, as Attenborough noted, the issue could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world."" ""It has become a matter of now or never for the world community,"" said The Gulf Today in an editorial on Tuesday. Just a few days ago, the United Nations sounded the alarm on the unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. A string of scientific reports and studies indicate greenhouse gas emissions should be drastically slashed or the consequences could be disastrous. COP24 , the two-week 24th conference of the parties of the United Nations Climate Change Convention that has taken off in Katowice, Poland, is the most critical event on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement. It's unfortunate that representatives of some of the most powerful countries and biggest polluters are absent. The United States has gone to the extent of quitting the UN climate process. Yet, on the positive side, most other countries are not giving up on their responsibility and doing their best to alleviate the situation. In fact, to maximise the chances of success in Poland, technical talks began on Sunday, a day early, with delegates from nearly 200 nations debating how to meet the Paris target of limiting global warming to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius. To contain warming at 1.5?C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach ""net zero"" by mid-century. Even with just one degree Celsius of warming so far, Earth has been bombarded with raging wildfires, widespread crop failures and super-storms exacerbated by rising sea levels. If that does not prompt leaders to unite and act, what else will? It is true that expectations for Katowice are low. To have any hope of reaching the 1.5?C goal by the end of the century, emissions from fossil fuel use need to be halved by 2030. The host nation Poland itself is committed to coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels. ""But considering the magnitude of the challenge, any effort aimed at finding a viable solution should be welcomed. World leaders should realise that time is running out on a subject that would affect each and every individual on earth, besides other living organisms,"" concluded the Sharjah-based daily. \"

In a press briefing on Wednesday, Mr. Guterres said that the meetings, both of which he is attending, come at a crucial moment. ""Our world is obviously facing a crisis of confidence. Those left behind by globalization are losing trust in governments and institutions,"" he told journalists at UN Headquarters in New York. ""Inequality is pervasive and increasing, especially within nations. Trade disputes are escalating. And an undercurrent of geopolitical tensions is adding further pressure to the global economy,"" he said. The UN Chief outlined some examples of the stark, climate-related challenges the world is facing, such as Tuesday's UN Environment\~report\~\- calling for a five-fold increase in climate action to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century \- and the World Meteorological Organization's\~announcement\~that carbon dioxide levels have increased to levels not seen in 3 million years. Mr. Guterres made a passionate call for immediate action, pointing out that the social, economic and environmental costs of climate change dwarf the costs of acting now: ""Failure to act means more disasters and emergencies and air pollution that could cost the global economy as much as $21 trillion by 2050."" ""On the other hand,"" he added, ""ambitious climate action will not only slow temperature rise, it will be good for economies, for the environment and for public health. Climate solutions represent opportunity, and technology is on our side.\~They are wise investments in an equitable, prosperous and sustainable future.\~ Green business truly is good business."" Turning to the funding needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation, the Secretary-General recalled the\~pledge\~to mobilize $100 billion per year for climate action in support of the developing world by 2020, and welcomed Germany's Wednesday announcement to donate $1.5 billion to the Green Climate Fund: ""the members of the G20 (group of industrialized nations) are responsible for more than three-quarters of greenhouse emissions. Yet it is equally true that G20 members have the power to bend the emissions curve. They also have the resources to provide the financing needed for both mitigation and adaptation.""

"COP24","UAE","COP24_UAE19","Sustainability gains momentum","December 1, 2018","Gulf Construction",".jpg ) There will be an acceleration in the move towards sustainable buildings as countries worldwide focus on stemming their environment impact and arresting climate change. In these efforts, product transparency will be a key milestone towards more sustainable buildings, Pascal Eveillard, deputy vice-president, sustainable development \- director for sustainable construction at France-based Saint-Gobain Group, told delegates at the International Conference for Sustainable Materials in Dubai, UAE, last month. The conference, hosted by the Dubai Municipality and Dubai Central Laboratory (DCL), was held at the Conrad Dubai Hotel. Speaking to OSCAR WENDEL on the sidelines of the conference, Eveillard said the market now expects manufacturers to provide transparency on the environmental and health impacts of their products as there is a trend towards decarbonisation, circular economy, and health and well-being in the building sector. While these demands are currently  almost a daily expectation of customers in places such as the Nordic countries \- where people have better quality materials in their houses \- the trend is global and the demand will soon be seen everywhere. This drive is compelling manufacturers to get rid of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in their products. Saint-Gobain conducted a survey in 2017 in 25 countries among its customers \- including designers, architects, contractors, installers, and distributors \- to find out what was important to them when selecting construction products and materials.  We have been quite impressed with the answers. More than 75 per cent expect more transparency on the environmental and health impacts of construction products. And more than 75 per cent expect us to develop solutions contributing to the comfort and greener buildings, Eveillard remarks.  So there is a real expectation of the market to deliver better and more sustainable products. The key challenge is to make those solutions accessible to a vast majority of players in the market and to make them affordable. The challenge now is not to demonstrate the availability of a solution; it is to change the mindset of designers and contractors to have them switch to better solutions \- and move to a new way of designing and building. Saint-Gobain, Eveillard says, gives high priority to the safety of people.  So we are committed to getting rid, as far as possible, of any harmful substances in the product that we put on the market. This is something we have introduced in our product stewardship policy. Whenever possible, we substitute hazardous chemicals with safe ones, he said. To demonstrate to the region the leadership role it is playing in this field, Saint-Gobain is building a Multi-Comfort House in Masdar, Abu Dhabi, which is scheduled to open in 2020.  Multi-Comfort is a Saint-Gobain concept to demonstrate what sustainability means, Eveillard explains.  These are buildings that combine a high level of comfort and sustainability. We are addressing four types of comfort: indoor air quality, thermal, acoustical and visual.  And on top of that, we have set a level of requirements regarding energy efficiency, the circulatory of products and water consumption. This concept has been already developed through 30 projects in different countries in the world, mainly in North America, in Europe and Asia and we are very happy to develop our first Multi-Comfort building in Masdar City to be inaugurated at the beginning of 2020. Eveillard points out this will be the first building of this kind in a desert climate zone, which will enable Saint-Gobain to tailor its concept to the region.  We will demonstrate that even in such a hot climate it is possible to have a high level of energy efficiency and to deliver a high level of comfort.  Multi-Comfort is also a way for us to demonstrate all the innovations we have developed over the last years and the benefits they can bring to our customers. In this building in Masdar, we will showcase most of our latest innovations, starting with electrodynamic glasses and high-performance ceiling products, he adds. Starting with this initial project, Saint-Gobain intends to capitalise on the feedback it receives from customers to improve its concept for any subsequent Multi-Comfort buildings. When Saint-Gobain builds a Multi-Comfort building, it tries to benchmark with the most recognised labelling scheme in the country. At Masdar, it is seeking at least a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold certification.  It is crucial for us to let our customers understand that Multi-Comfort is aimed at achieving a very high level of performance. And by showing what corresponds to in existing and the well-known labelling schemes, we offer customers the capacity to benchmark our Multi-Comfort project, he states. Saint-Gobain is also committed to deliver verified Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for its products.  We have strongly advocated for EPDs to be recognised in most of the labelling schemes and we were delighted to see LEED recognising EPD as a mandatory requirement in its new version. We also encourage our competitors to engage on this road, look to promote EPDs through trade associations so that they are better understood by the different industries and convince all stakeholders to move in that direction. It will be a clear signal to the market that lifecycle assessments are key and central to the design and construction of buildings. And if all manufacturers will provide such information, it will also lead to a decrease in the cost of producing such information, he remarks. Eveillard stresses that if the industry takes environmental impact seriously, it must rely on lifecycle assessments (LCAs) and the related EPDs that communicate the results of LCAs.  LCA is a robust methodology to calculate the environmental impact of product systems but also buildings over their entire lifecycle. This is based on robust international standards and on science. And it should be a unique opportunity to eliminate guesstimates and greenwashing and move to fact-based design and benchmarking of solutions and buildings.  When it comes to LCAs at a building level, it requires some maturity in the market. You need to ensure that you have valuable EPDs for the products. If you don\' t have product EPDs, it\' s difficult to calculate LCAs at the building level, he points out. Eveillard sees an increasing number of countries developing EPDs for products and there are already some, like France, the Netherlands, and Finland that have made it EPDS mandatory. He also cautions that when sustainability gains further momentum manufacturers would make unsubstantiated claims about their products.  When it comes to environmental claims, it is essential that those claims are backed by LCA results. In some countries, such as France or in Scandinavia, you can\' t make environmental claims if you don\' t have an EPD, he says. To help designers and contractors reduce the environmental impact of the products they use, LCAs and EPDs provide the necessary information to select materials, work on alternative design options and to compare those alternatives.  To properly use the EPD and LCA results, it\' s essential to using validated tools. There are more and more of those tools for calculation. And these digital tools are made more and more accessible and not very expensive. They are easy to use, easy to access, and are more and more often connected to digital databases that contain the LCA information, Eveillard explains. When linked to the building information modelling (BIM) data of the building, these tools provide all information about the products that are required to be used, the quantities, and from that and using the LCA results, a first estimate of the environmental impact can be made, he says. They can also be used when looking for alternatives, for instance, when replacing massive partition walls with lightweight solutions made of gypsum board and metal frames, to see the impact on the lifecycle of the building. Looking ahead at 2019, Eveillard says:  We see an acceleration in the move towards more sustainable buildings following COP 21 (The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21 held in Paris, France). Decarbonisation has become a priority topic almost everywhere. Circularity is also becoming a priority. People are more and more concerned about the scarcity of materials, which makes them very aware of the need to go for a more efficient way of using natural resources.  So, I think that in more and more countries, people are realising that it\' s time for a change. But this doesn\' t mean that solutions are obvious to people, he adds. To address this issue, Saint-Gobain is creating greater awareness worldwide through presentations, trying to showcase possible alternative design and construction methods  and to explain to people that yes, there are issues, but there are also solutions, accessible solutions \- that are not necessarily more expensive than traditional solutions, he concludes. \"
"COP24","UAE","COP24_UAE20","Climate change is our problem, no single policy is enough","October 9, 2018 Tuesday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","With subsidies and negative incentives gone, Costa Rica's cattle population dropped by a third, taking pressure off grazing lands. Monica Araya & Carlos Manuel Rodriguez The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body tasked with providing scientific evidence and consensus on climate change and its implications for decision-makers and the public, has just issued its latest, long-awaited report. The challenge it presents to all of us is huge. To avoid severe economic and social shocks and protect essential ecosystems, we urgently need to limit the increase in global temperature to within 1.5 Celsius of the pre-industrial level. Achieving the required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will require boldness, creativity and some hard choices. But Costa Rica's experience shows that, in the long run, what is gained far outweighs the sacrifices for all. Climate change is not the first daunting challenge our country - among the world's most biodiverse countries per square metre - has had to overcome to preserve its natural beauty. Deforestation for cattle grazing nearly halved the land covered by forest over the four decades prior to 1986. Government investment in protecting these natural assets was essential, which meant eliminating subsidies for the cattle industry and perverse incentives for agrarian reform. With subsidies and negative incentives gone, Costa Rica's cattle population dropped by a third, taking pressure off grazing lands. In the five decades since, forests have recovered and now cover more than half the country. And while forest cover doubled, Costa Rica's per capita income tripled. From this foundation, the economy has grown sustainably and the country has become a world leader in eco-tourism. Now, as this latest IPCC report makes clear, rising temperature is the new threat to both biodiversity and our economy. We all must combat it. Costa Rica, for its part, has set what President Carlos Alvarado has called the ""titanic and beautiful task"" of decarbonising the economy. One of the goals of the national decarbonisation plan, which will be launched in December, is to ensure that the market properly accounts for the costs of climate change. This policy has the effect of rendering fossil fuels economically uncompetitive - and creating incentives to use Costa Rica's nearly 100 per cent renewable power in the transportation sector to cut our dependence on oil. A moratorium on oil and gas exploitation, respected by five different governments, reinforces these incentives. Making the energy sector work properly - an objective that unites both environmentalists and economists - means recognising that a short-term economic boost cannot justify the long-term costs of fossil fuels. As a minister and a climate activist, we both agree that government has an important role to play in achieving decarbonisation. But the work of non-state actors such as local businesses and communities will also be essential. For this reason, government policy has focused on boosting community-based low-impact tourism initiatives that value local knowledge. The Costa Rican experience shows that environmental stewardship is a job done best by alliances between local people and national leaders, united by the common cause of conservation. At its heart, Costa Rica's approach to climate change is about people, not industry and markets. Our commitment to tackling climate change is based on an understanding of the enormous health risks and costs that arise from inaction. Costa Rica devotes significant resources to tackling problems like dengue fever and malaria because our people remain our most important asset. And staying below the 1.5C limit will mean 3.3 million fewer cases of dengue fever annually in Latin America and the Caribbean, fewer people at risk of malaria, and less food instability and poor nutrition caused by higher temperatures and unstable weather patterns. Costa Rica is proud to be leading the world by putting this approach into practice. As a result, we are one of the few countries ready to exceed our commitments under the Paris climate agreement. Not all of the changes will be easy, and getting them right will require perseverance and a commitment to adaptability. Other countries that agreed as part of the Paris agreement to boost the ambition of their national climate plans by 2020 can learn from our experience in aiming for decarbonisation, investing in natural assets, and recognising the importance of the climate for a healthy population. One of the most obvious lessons is the interdependence of these policies. Climate change is a collective problem, no single policy is enough, and no country can solve it alone. But this interdependence cannot be an excuse for paralysis. Limiting warming to 1.5 Celsius is a goal around which we can all unite in diverse ways. Next month's Climate Vulnerable Forum will bring together leaders from the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change for the first entirely virtual summit of heads of state. Together with the next key intergovernmental meeting, COP24 in Poland this December, political leaders have an opportunity to prove they understand the science underpinning the IPCC report, and are ready to take ambitious steps to achieve the 1.5 target. Unless all of us do so, the consequences will spare none of us. -Project Syndicate Monica Araya is Vice-President of Costa Rica's Electric Mobility Association.

The report reveals there is no sign of reversal of this trend, which is responsible for climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification and extreme weather. ""The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed,"" World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said. The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin shows that global concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide have been increasing steadily over the past years. In addition, the report notes a resurgence of a potent greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting substance called CFC-11, which is regulated under an international agreement to protect the ozone layer. The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin reports specifically on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are what remains in the atmosphere, following a complex process of emissions and absorptions.\~ Since 1990, there has been a 41% increase in the warming effect by the various greenhouse gases on the climate, known as ""radioactive forcing."" CO2 specifically accounts for about 82% of the increase in radioactive forcing over the past decade, according to figures quoted in the WMO report.\~ ""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, when the temperature was 2 to 3\'b0C warmer and sea level was 10 to 20 meters higher than now,"" said Mr. Taalas. The WMO report comes on top of the evidence presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special\~report on global warming\~issued last month, which sounded the alarm on the need to reach zero net emissions of CO2 by mid-century, in order to keep temperature increases to below 1.5\'b0C.\~ The report showed how keeping temperature increases below 2\'b0C could reduce the risks for the well-being of the planet and its people. ""CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere,"" warned WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova. ""Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,"" she insisted. The new report adds yet another building block of scientific evidence to inform decision-making at the upcoming UN climate change conference \- the\~ COP 24 \~\- planned from 2 to 14 December in Poland. The key objective of this meeting is to adopt an implementation plan for the 2015\~Paris Agreement. Against the backdrop of the sobering report, Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has\~sent a letter to all States, telling them they have legal obligations under international human rights law to prevent climate change and try to mitigate its effects. ""Human rights are under threat from a force which challenges the foundations of all life, as we know it, on this planet we share,"" she said, pointing out that the decisions taken CO P24 will govern climate action under the Paris agreement ""for the indefinite future,"" and said that ""the rights of the millions of people [are] threatened by climate change."" \~The global averages presented in the WMO Bulletin, the report says are based on a rigorous tracking of the changing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of industrialization, use of fossil fuels, unsustainable agricultural practices, increases in land use and deforestation.\~ The UN has called for urgent actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the national and sub-national levels. \"

I am actively continuing my education through attending MEPRA workshops and seminars, and I joined the MEPRA and CIPR accreditation scheme in 2018."" Guiding principles I strive to be straightforward and clear, and to maintain quality over quantity or speed. These principles I learned from two of my greatest mentors, Ghali Houri and Mohaned Lafi, who both practise what they preach. For someone coming into the industry my best piece of advice is to ask questions and try and learn something new every week, whether it is meeting a new journalist or how to prepare a budget."" campaign, which today has become a best-practice case study for Havas and CH alike."" Career path ""I've been with Havas PR since 2016.

Guiding principles Never take yourself too seriously. We work in an extremely challenging industry that often requires a thick skin and a sense of humour to survive. Always put your money where your mouth is. Many can talk the talk (after all, we do work in PR), but our value lies in our ability to execute and ultimately let the work speak for itself. JENNIFER LOVE, 27 SENIOR ACCOUNT DIRECTOR, BRAZEN Career path ""My PR career began in London, and in 2015 I returned to the UAE, which is where I was born and raised.

Guiding principles Be an extension of your client's team. Your client needs to know you're always at the end of the phone or email and available to help them out. Learn how to predict the future. Know what your client is going to ask you before they do, and then deliver it. Know what's going on in the world. Whether it's award-winning campaigns, a new social media platform making the rounds or industry news affecting your client, it's important to have your ear to the ground. MEPRA's Outstanding Young Communicator of the Year 2018."" Guiding principles Maya Angelou once said: ""You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."" In PR, storytelling is important to our strategies, with creativity at the heart of it. We're tasked by our clients to generate fresh concepts for our story angles and campaign ideas so often we can have creative burnouts. It's important to take a step back, a few deep breaths and remember that everyone is creative and that we all have our inner creatives; we just need to learn how to unlock and tap into them more often. Nominated by Nathan Wilson, senior vice-president, regional operations ""Mohammed AlSaeed is an integral member of Asda£ BCW's Riyadh team. As a Saudi national, he is able to provide insightful analysis for the agency's corporate clients.

Then I joined Asda£ BCW and was privileged to be part of the teams working on many megaprojects and massive accounts, such as Saudi Vision 2030, Red Sea Project, NEOM, Ford and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition."" Guiding principles Storytelling is a magic key to create a successful campaign for your client, and this comes from real passion and understanding the client's needs. Believing in humanity and teamwork is essential in our industry. Professional networking is a soft skill that helps to win the PR battles. Sarah started her career in 2015 as a PR executive and now is a co-founder and director of her own agency. Sarah has worked on international brands such as Lush Cosmetics, Johnson & Johnson, Neutrogena, Carefree, Vita Coco, Bioderma, Burj Al Arab and Foreo. Key achievements include when Sarah starting working closely with the founders of home-grown food incubator Urban Retreat when it was still in planning stages and helped map out the full strategy to launch to market. Within six months the venue opening was covered in 40 media titles and had a combined PR value of $780,000. Guiding principles Take notes and ask a lot of questions until things make sense to you. I think in our industry, especially at the beginning of your career, it can be a very intimidating environment and people can shy away from not wanting to appear like they don't know the answer. But it's fine to admit you don't know everything and to be open to learning new things \- from all levels of the team. Secondly, about 80 per cent of your job is managing people. The way you interact with them, from media and clients to team members, will have a direct impact on your career. So prepare to learn how to forge relationships, massage egos and become a therapist all at the same time.

She recently created and led an all-agency initiative to start our agency's very own podcast, working late nights and weekends to get the project up and running despite her demanding client workload. She is also well respected and trusted by many of our biggest clients, many of whom ask for her by name. We have been so impressed with her growth and willingness to achieve that we promoted her from a junior account exec after only one year. On top of that, she has also worked simultaneously to achieve four degrees \- at the age of only 24."" Career path ""Magazine writing has always been my favourite pastime since I graduated from the American University of Sharjah in 2015. Before I joined Active DMC, for two years I contributed to key lifestyle and health media outlets as I enjoy researching and drafting opinion pieces about psychology. I also run a full-time mental health blog."" Guiding principles Rules I follow in the work place: Staying positive and having a 'can-do' attitude truly makes a difference in the work that one delivers. Making mistakes and knowing how to fix them is always better than remaining stuck and not learning new skills. Believing that you are capable of achieving anything is the first step to adding value to any task you work on. I learned from Stanislava Burianek, Lauren Brush and Sawsan Ghanem All these three women at Active DMC showed me the true meaning of what a woman is capable of when she empowers herself. They all practically taught me that a woman can be an achiever and excel in all the different areas of life. VIRGINIA KRIEGER, 24 CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS EXECUTIVE, SERVICEPLAN Nominated by Rami Hmadeh, CEO, Serviceplan Middle East ""Virginia is one of the exemplary new talents we have witnessed growing in our agency. She currently runs the corporate communications and business development function.

She has done a great job with building up the overall presence and marketing for Serviceplan in the region across digital, social media, PR, events and sponsorships. At the same time, she has supported the sales process in getting more contacts and leads from the industry. She has constantly shown the right mix of charm, wit and brilliance in her role and has delivered great results throughout."" Career path ""After completing my degree in marketing from the University of Westminster, London, I had the opportunity to move to UAE and start off as an intern with Serviceplan, the largest independent agency network back home in Germany. ""What I expected to be a small role soon turned out to be a career-defining prospect as I was pulled into the wider world of understanding clients, their pitch processes, the agency selection criteria and how the agency brand is built, keeping all these things in mind. I was trained and guided by my seniors here to step up to bigger challenges and define my own scope based on market demands. ""I have, over the last two years, worked with both the business development directors and the corporate communications manager, and developed multiple strategies and initiatives to move our agency's position in the market forward. We have landed and converted multiple new clients from leads. We have managed industry events like Ah-Pe-Ro and Marketing Society conferences that brought industry leaders together.

""In the future I would wish to turn our corporate communications into a client-business division and grow more transformative business for Serviceplan."" Guiding principles Happiness is the key to doing great work. You have to be really content with what you do. Otherwise, it's punch-in-punch-out and life will just pass you by. Greatness comes from outdoing yourself \- you have to exceed your own expectations and not really care about how satisfied others are with the status quo. Likeness is what brings us together \- everyone you meet is more similar in so many ways than they are different. Advertising, after all, is about ""getting"" people. And then getting them to like you. HAROON TAHIR, 24 ENGAGEMENT CONSULTANT, KATCH INTERNATIONAL Nominated by Tricia Jimenea, engagement director, Katch International ""Since joining the company, Haroon has been an integral part of client retention, managing high-demand and high-pressure key accounts such as WASLA under Live Nation, BASE Dubai, Najahi Events' Tony Robbins show, Rove Hotels, Suitsupply, Barbary, Azure and Ammos.

A charismatic individual, he always finds ways to strengthen relationships and build new ones to support his team, the company and his clients."" Career path ""After graduating with an honours degree in economics and communications from AUD, I became a graduate trainee at YouGov, where I was immersed in the world of marketing, communications and brand building. Following my promotion to research executive, I worked with the likes of PepsiCo, GEMS and Nivea. My passion for writing, communications and client servicing led me to a career in PR at Katch International, where I've been able to significantly develop my skill-set. My experience as a content creator with more than 25,000 social media followers has equipped me to successfully execute campaigns and manage influencer partnerships."" Guiding principles I endeavor to follow three Cs: Consistency \- Stay consistent in your learning. Start by applying consistency to the small details, even tasks that seem minor. They're good habits that will guide you as you take on bigger responsibilities. Creativity \- Don't be afraid to think outside the box. It's better to overwhelm your clients with your ideas than to underwhelm them with a lack of creativity. Care \- Genuinely caring about your clients' business cannot be underestimated. Work like it's your own money on the line and you'll service your clients better. This builds trust with your clients. 32 April 21, 2019 FACES TO WATCH - PR ASMA AL JAILANI, 30 ASSISTANT MANAGER, DIGITAL AND CORPORATE MARKETING, MUBADALA Nominated by Rashed Alharmoodi, head of external corporate relations, Mubadala ""Asma is one of the key members of the digital and corporate marketing team at Mubadala.

Over the past months, Asma led an integrated campaign to challenge perceptions around people of determination and support Abu Dhabi Special Olympics \- through an innovative and unique documentary that was featured before and during the massive event in Abu Dhabi. The documentary was featured across digital and broadcast channels and was promoted by HH Sheikh Abdulla Bin Zayed, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, HE Noora Al Kaabi and the UAE's US and UK embassies. Asma was also personally recognised by our deputy group CEO in an internal event at Mamoura. To promote the documentary, she planned and delivered an integrated campaign including digital marketing, influencer outreach and PR, internal comms and other channels. The campaign reached more than 3.5 million, with the documentary viewed hundreds of thousands of times in the UAE."" Career path Asma has been at Mubadala for seven years. She is a senior member of the digital and corporate marketing team. She oversees Mubadala's digital platforms (website, apps, social media) and has led a number of significant projects, including online annual reports, managed a dedicated microsite during the merger in 2016, launched the newly developed website for Mubadala Investment Company (earning it the W3 Award and WebAward in 2017), recently developed a short film as part of the Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi sponsorship activation, and launched an integrated campaign. Guiding principles Three rules I would pass on to anyone in the industry: 1. Keep calm: Changes are constant in this industry, and it can be overwhelming if you let it be. Staying calm when these situations arise allows you to be flexible, and clears your mind to think clearly and pivot to the next course of action. 2. Stay focused: This industry is fast-paced, which can be easily distracting. It's important to identify what the business priorities are and focus on achieving them. Also, don't focus on everything that comes your way \- focus on the right goals for the business and work towards it. 3. Maintain a positive attitude: It may be simple, but it is effective. With your colleagues, it helps in creating a rapport and good energy when working on a team project. For yourself, it is a way to take in setbacks in your stride, and later you will remember the project in a positive light. AMY BRILL, 29 HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, M&C SAATCHI ""Testament to her passion for clients and exceeding expectations lies within Discovery, who doubled their committed revenue following a stellar first year working on a rolling-project basis. Their move to retainer not only lauds the outstanding work delivered under Amy's leadership, but also marks the first time Discovery has taken on a retained a PR agency in the region, with the regional VP stating: 'We didn't just buy into M&C Saatchi; we bought into Amy.'"" Career path ""I started my career in-house at BBC Worldwide before moving agency-side, spending five years at Grayling across London and Dubai, making my first milestone mark in the region as PRCA's 2016 highly commended Rising Star of MENA. ""Since establishing the PR division of M&C Saatchi UAE in March 2017 and joining the regional leadership board, I am pleased to have steered the team toward not only six award nominations, but also our first agency ""Zainab Imichi Alhassan is the co-founder of Pop Communications. I am nominating her because she is a badass PR specialist who takes no prisoners (think Olivia Pope). Zainab started her career in the UAE at the age of 22, and five years later she now runs Pop Communications, which she and I have turned into a million-dollar business in only 20 months. She has built a team of 10, servicing more than 60 clients in just a little bit over a year, and catering to 20 retainer clients. She did all this with no external funding and a start-up cost of AED 20,000. Over the years, Zainab has been responsible for the PR strategies of several international and homegrown brands in the region. Some notable names are The win at the PRCA MENA Awards for Best PR Campaign: B2B. We were also honoured to be the highly commended Small Consultancy of the Year, with judges commending the great strides we've achieved, given the agency's infancy."" Guiding principles Work hard and use your initiative and try to have as much fun as possible. I learned the importance of these from ex-colleagues who believed the same \- and even more so from those who didn't. Luxury Closet, Hilton Garden Inn, Tweezerman, RentSher Middle East, The Smash Room and much more. Zainab recently spearheaded The Smash Room's Anti-Valentine's campaign, which was all over the media when it launched and generated more than $1,278,234 of PR value in earned media."" Career path ""I've worked in the UAE PR industry for several years now. I started out as an account executive and gradually progressed to senior account executive, manager, senior account manager and then went on to co-found my own PR agency, Pop Communications. I also dabbled in journalism, writing for the likes of Sayidaty, Hia Magazine, Vogue US, Bellanaija, etc., and founded homegrown beauty brand Reine Michi Beauty."" Guiding principles My number one career rule is: add value. I've always understood that a job is somewhere you go to add value and not just get a salary. If I get paid $10, how much of that in multiples am I generating for the company I'm working for? Another important principle I try to follow (which I learned from my first PR boss, Rahma Himid of Grace and Garbo) is: Do not burn bridges. It's such a small industry and in PR everything is all about relationships. This is a rule I've struggled with but I cannot stress how important it is to nurture relationships. FACES TO WATCH - PR April 21, 2019 33 MOHAMED NIZAR LUQMAN, 26 SPECIALIST, EXTERNAL CORPORATE RELATIONS, MUBADALA Nominated by Brian Lott, chief communications officer, group communications, Mubadala ""Through his creativity, teamwork and passion, Mohamed brought employees together through a beautifully executed video series of empathy and inclusion. His out-of-the-box thinking and high-quality video production skills engaged employees across the organisation by involving their stories as the core of the narrative. He delivered a high quality, unique, cinematographic-style series that showcased the power of exceptional videography."" Career path ""My career journey started two years ago with Mubadala's group communications team, and it's been absolutely wonderful. I wear two hats: of internal and external corporate comms. ""Untold Stories, an internal video series project I lead, won BroadCastPro2017. In 2014/2015 I was awarded Best Aspiring Filmmaker for my short film The Final Chapter at the Zayed University Middle East Film Festival. I gave a TEDx talk at the Canadian University Dubai, and was invited by Emirati women in leadership roles to give a speech on women's empowerment. I also spoke at Tawteen 360."" Guiding principles Push the envelope of creativity. It's OK to go crazy with your ideas, because that allows you to find something that works. If you don't do that, you miss out on great ideas that make a difference. Embrace storytelling. Telling and hearing stories is something that is ingrained in our human DNA. Today it's used in a gamut of multimedia platforms, from technology to social media to traditional media. Compelling stories make up our everyday lives. Most importantly, I live by the rule of humanness and humanity; it's so important to understand empathy, and the power in real human stories. I think everyone is a teacher \- you learn different things from different people \- so you ought to embrace the diversity of knowledge that is available to you. It also teaches you to be humble. You don't know everything and, quiet frankly, you never will. But you'll always learn something new every day, and that's important: the constant evolution of oneself. However, I truly believe that the most influential teacher is my father, who always encouraged me to be creative, tell stories and embrace humanity with compassion and humility. BATOUL AL BEITOUNI, 24 SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE, FINANCE PRACTICE, ASDA'A BCW Nominated by Sophie McNulty, senior consultant, finance practice ""Batoul joined the finance practice in 2017 and has quickly proven to be absolutely indispensable. If I had to pick her three best qualities, it would be her ability to stay calm under pressure; her design and PowerPoint skills \- incredibly handy on business development pitch decks; and thirdly and most importantly, her ability to just get things done. All these skills came to the fore when Batoul led this year's edition of the Emirates Islamic Banking Index. Her management of the project helped amplify the annual survey to new levels. Batoul also supported on our recent IPO campaign for Network International, where her engagement with the Arabic dailies mitigated potential issues and highlighted the investment narrative. Definitely one to watch out for."" Career path ""I never imagined myself working in PR for financial sector clients but life had different plans. I now work on a day-to- day basis with blue-chip banking clients, and it has been a tremendous learning experience; every day brings a new set of challenges and opportunities. ""Previously, I was an Account Executive at Gvolin MENA \- Corporate, working on a diverse client base. At Golin MENA, I worked on AXA Gulf's 'Health on Track' campaign, which went on to win ""Results on a Budget"" at PRCA MENA Awards."" Guiding principles Always do your best and move on. If you make a mistake, just simply turn it into a valuable lesson and avoid repeating it the next time \- never fear failure. Always plan ahead and be prepared. Prepare your own checklist one day ahead, and list down tasks to be completed during the day. Stay organised to get more work done. Find a role model at work: find someone in a leadership position to emulate, and this will give you a clear image of what you want to achieve. Having a role model can give you extra motivation to succeed in your career, helping you realise your potential in the process. RAWYA ABDEL KADER, 28 SENIOR ACCOUNT MANAGER, EDELMAN Nominated by Rohan Cornelio, associate director/head of technology, Edelman ""A real regional champion, Rawya has shaped into a growth-focused PR pro. Her efforts have led us to deliver great results with Facebook through various issues and leading community programmes locally across the region; with Dubai World Trade Centre, driving a solid media relations programme for their portfolio of technology shows; and with Amazon Web Services. Across all her clients she is viewed as a trusted advisor from comms to the leadership. Her clients have regularly called her out as a key reason for communication success, especially for her knowledge of PR across the region and relationships across markets. This has also led to media requesting to feature her in reports."" Rasha Kashkoush, head of communications for Facebook MENA and Turkey, says: ""Rawya is a talented comms and PR professional who dedicates herself to learning and understanding the needs of her clients. She is particularly apt at anticipating the needs of her clients, and thinks ahead, adding much needed value. Rawya also takes initiative to learn about the wider organisation, building a network outside of the communications team. Building these networks allows her to grow an in-depth understanding of our business so that she's able to answer questions and find solutions as though she is a member of the team. Rawya excels at media relationships, building strong connections with journalists, acting as an adept middle person between the client and the journalist. She is always reliable during a crisis, going over and above to show steadiness and responsiveness when most needed. I'm grateful for all the incredible work she's done. Rawya is kind, generous and thoughtful and is an integral part of the success of our work in the region."" Career path ""Since I've joined the communications industry, I've seen it evolve rapidly with the rise of digital channels, growing use of influencers and the blurring of lines between online and offline. This hasn't been truer than in the technology and government sectors my clients belong to. Working with clients such as Facebook, Amazon Web Services and Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, across 10 MENA markets, my knowledge of English, Arabic and French has helped deliver successful client programmes and also manage multiple crisis scenarios. Working across such diverse markets, I've also come to be known as the 'the contacts book', supporting colleagues to grow their networks across the region."" Guiding principles I follow my 'Triple P' mantra: following my passion; building relationships with people and finding purpose in all that I do. Passion: Storytelling with the aim of earning trust and creating newsworthy stories. How can you believe a story if you are not yourself convinced? People: Seeing my team grow year-on-year and further building their confidence and achieving success stories while having my direct report get her first promotion while working closely with me was very satisfying. Purpose: Any story I create and communicate needs to evoke an emotional connect and allows its respective content to connect with a relevant community. \"

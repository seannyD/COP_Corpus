The Secretary-General will head a delegation to attend the world's largest annual gathering of leaders around the issue of climate change, which takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from 6 to 18 November. At the summit, Secretary-General Scotland will advocate for ramped-up climate action through more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national plans and targets. She will also seek to amplify the shared concerns of the 56 Commonwealth countries, including crucial issues around climate finance, sustainable energy transition, loss and damage, and partnerships and coordinated action. Ahead of her arrival in Egypt on 5thNovember, the Secretary-General stated: "" COP27 takes place in the midst of overlapping, interlinked and accelerating global challenges. The lasting impacts of COVID-19 combine with the effects of conflict, including in Ukraine, to destabilise global economic, energy and food systems. Against this backdrop, the climate crisis has continued to worsen, and its profound impacts are being felt by families, communities and countries across the Commonwealth. ""I understand the pressure world leaders are under, but I urge all decision-makers, advocates and allies at COP27 to ensure the promises already made are delivered, and accelerate efforts to mitigate and adapt to the urgent threat of climate change. We must never lose sight of the crushing consequences of inaction, for the for the millions who face the dangers of climate change every day, and for generations to come. We need urgent action now."" Thirty-two of the total 56 Commonwealth member countries are small states, including 25 small island developing states, while 14 are classified as least developed countries - among the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. Commonwealth heads of government recognise that developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing states are particularly at risk of their development gains being reversed by the impacts of climate change. During their meeting ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3U7jWRt ) in Kigali, Rwanda in June, they called on developed countries to deliver on their promise to jointly mobilise US$ 100 billion per year to support developing countries in coping with climate change, stressing the importance of transparency in implementing their pledges. The Secretary-General added: ""We must build on the substantive progress made at the previous COP26 summit, and urgently translate these commitments into action. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. But to achieve this, developing countries will need enhanced support."" The COP27 event will also provide the opportunity to raise awareness about Commonwealth initiatives that support member countries to tackle climate change, such as the Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3A8WlYP https://bit.ly/3A8WlYP HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3T3M4U9 https://bit.ly/3T3M4U9 HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3T5X03O https://bit.ly/3T5X03O HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3A8WuLR https://bit.ly/3A8WuLR For more information on Commonwealth events at COP27 , follow #CommonwealthForClimate, or visit HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3E0cyBE Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The Commonwealth.

COP27 is described as Africa's COP and will significantly shape the future. To deliver on adaptation, a transformative adaptation agenda is needed now. Titled 'Adaptation Dialogue: Implementing the Vision', ( https://bit.ly/3F6hsOB https://bit.ly/3F6hsOB HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3DoKPKC ) so far, notably its contribution to narrowing the adaptation gap and accelerating the implementation of the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI). The AAI represents Africa's bold and innovative step to galvanize the support needed to significantly scale up adaptation across the continent. Speaking on behalf of Dr. Kevin Kariuki, Vice President, Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth, Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank, underscored the urgent need for accelerated adaptation action. Dorsouma called for accelerated action against climate change while making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid a mounting loss of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure. He noted that progress on adaptation has been uneven so far, with increasing gaps between action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director and Africa Regional Director at the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), highlighted the need to improve climate resilience and adaptation in Africa. He estimated the cost of climate change at $ 579 billion by 2030, with global finance skewed towards mitigation. Only 7.2% of global finance goes to climate adaptation. Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, Special Advisor to the President of the Gabonese Republic and the Permanent Secretary of the National Climate Council, endorsed the AAAP as a primary vehicle for implementing the Africa Adaptation Initiative's mandate. The program seeks to mobilize $ 25 billion to accelerate climate change adaptation actions across Africa. The AAAP is an Africa-owned and Africa-led response to the continent's expressed needs and priorities to reduce its vulnerabilities to climate change and harness the opportunities that result from climate change. Since its launch in April 2021, the AAAP upstream financing facility, managed by GCA, has enabled mainstreaming adaptation into investments worth over $ 3 billion.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK13","COP 27 Agreement Rightfully Calls for Assistance for the Smallest and Poorest Nations but Misses Opportunities To Reaffirm 1.5C Limit","November 21, 2022 Monday","ENP Newswire","As the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) ends, Ceres CEO and President Mindy Lubber reacts to the final agreement: ""At COP27 , the issue of helping small developing countries mitigate, adapt and recover from the devastating effects of climate change was rightfully at the top of the agenda. The poorest countries in the world did not cause the climate crisis but they are bearing the brunt of its devastation. We are pleased to see the final COP 27 cover decision includes terms for establishing a loss and damage fund to help the most vulnerable and economically disadvantaged countries. We also agree with its call for reform of the priorities and processes of multilateral development banks to fit the purpose of addressing the climate emergency, align with the global goal of net zero emissions, and better facilitate private climate investment in developing countries by providing de-risking mechanisms. Private capital will follow. Achieving our collective global climate goals necessitates that the entire globe be included in solutions and benefits and that all countries move jointly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that will bring climate stabilization. However, climate stabilization will not happen if countries abandon the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. While we are relieved that the governmental negotiators reaffirmed the need to keep global warming within the 1.5 Celsius limit, we are disappointed that they did not agree to pathways or means to achieve it. Ceres stand with 200 businesses, investors and other nonprofit organizations in affirming our commitment to 1.5 C as a limit that must be achieved - and we are working towards it. Thousands of companies, investors, cities and states have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and are working on meeting interim targets by 2030 in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - including 290 of the world's largest asset managers. We need governments to join us in this commitment and enact policies that facilitate capital flows and infrastructure investment towards a net zero emissions future."" Ahead of COP27 , more than 600 large institutional investors managing a combined $ 42 trillion in assets called on world governments, through the 2022 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis, to implement the policy actions needed to address the climate crisis and accelerate the transition to a net zero emissions economy, including stronger 1.5 degrees Celsius aligned Nationally Determined Contributions with domestic policies to support those goals and emphasis in setting and meeting 2030 targets. Specifically, the signatories call for: - Developing mechanisms to price carbon - Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and the use of thermal coal and establish plans and targets to peak and then phase out the use of other fossil fuels. - Developing transition plans for affected workers, communities and individuals - Supporting the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030 and reduce all non-CO2 emissions. - Ending deforestation globally. - Strengthening climate disclosing, including mandating disclosure of climate risks and opportunities for all large companies and financial institutions; require climate transition plans and drive for consistency across global financial regulation on disclosure. - Delivering on their promises of significant climate finance for developing countries to allow for a clean energy transition, mitigation and adaptation as they grapple with climate intensified weather disasters. The global economy's transition to net zero emissions provides huge opportunities for investors and companies, including in developing nations. Ceres is working with investors to help them seize the opportunities unleashed by the global transition and is encouraging companies to utilize the incentives from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate their shift to clean energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation. Across the globe, effective policies in line with limiting global warming are essential for accelerating and scaling up private capital flows needed for a climate resilient, net-zero transition. These can include repurposing fossil fuel subsidies, efficiency standards, enhancing climate disclosure protocols, or implementing carbon pricing. Lubber added, ""Negotiators are right to recognize that realizing our collective climate goals must include helping those countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis and least responsible for causing it. We are pleased to see terms for establishing some form of a loss and damage fund to help small island and equatorial nations cope and recover from with the extreme weather disasters that are pummeling their lands.""

She called for a bespoke climate fund to support grassroots women to tackle climate change and build resilience. The African Development Bank organized the session held during COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh under the theme, Gender Sensitive and climate just finance mechanisms. The panelists said facilities tailored to supporting women, who are helping to build climate resilience, must be visible, simple, and easily accessible. ""There is a problem about the visibility, transparency and accountability, and although there is some money floating around, we don't have a properly dedicated climate fund or a permanent climate fund to support women entrepreneurs in combating climate change,"" Robinson said. Robinson gave the example of some women-led projects in Uganda which could do ten times more if they had access to targeted climate resources. ""They had no prospects of getting the money that could be available for their sector -- they didn't even know who was getting the money or where it was going."" Opening the session, African Development Bank Group Vice President Vice for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Kevin Kariuki, said the Bank had earmarked funding for ten capacity-building projects, focusing on gender and climate through the Africa Climate Change Fund. ""Moreover, we are committing $ 100 million in loans to public and private sector projects to address gender and climate issues,"" Kariuki said. ""The Bank is also developing an adaptation mechanism to enable individuals and groups, including women and children, to borrow money for climate adaptation projects,"" he added. The African Development Bank hosted other side events to mark Gender Day at the COP27 to highlight the successes, challenges and issues surrounding gender equality and climate change. They included the launch of the Gender in Climate Action Accelerator, a tool to support private sector companies improve the gender responsiveness of their corporate climate governance. The Accelerator will support governments in promoting gender-sensitive climate sector policies, accelerating their green transition to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a joint initiative by the Egyptian government, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the French Development Agency, AFD. At a session opened by Kenya's First Lady Rachel Ruto, experts agreed that as the efforts for greener economies grow, the focus should be on upskilling and reskilling to help women and girls to access green jobs. The panel, titled ""Enabling and Tracking Gender-responsive Green Jobs Recovery,"" also highlighted access to information for women and strengthening gender-responsive capacity building. The Bank also held a session on ""Accelerating gender-responsive climate investment for a resilient Sahel, which discussed good practices to ramp up gender-responsive climate finance in the Sahel. In his remarks, Al Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank called for a more equitable distribution of climate resources in the Sahel.

The Dutch grant is from infrastructure funding vehicle Invest International, while the facility from the EIB is to build green hydrogen and renewable energy projects in Namibia, Reuters reported on November 8. One of the world's sunniest countries, Namibia has the potential to produce green hydrogen and position itself as a renewable energy hub in Africa. The country's first hydrogen power plant is expected to be up and running in 2024. Hydrogen is categorised ""green"" when it is made with renewable power and is seen as key to help decarbonise industry, though the technology remains immature and relatively costly, writes Reuters. In May, the EU's energy strategy set a goal of importing at least 10mn tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, with another 10mn tonnes to be produced within the bloc. Namibia has been identified as a strategic enabler of the EU's decarbonisation agenda through its ability to export clean energy to Europe. According to Reuters, Namibia on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Union on renewable hydrogen and rare raw materials. President Geingob gave no specifics on the agreement but said experts from both sides would soon meet to outline joint plans. \"

""As far as I understand, a handshake with Egyptian state head Abdul Fattah al-Sisi at this point was not preferred, despite the normalisation [in relations] with Egypt,"" Barcin Yinanc wrote on 7 November. ""I am guessing that the normalisation process was halted after it became clear that Erdogan was not coming,"" she added, referring to the recent slowdown in rapprochement talks between Egypt and Turkey. The Turkish and Egyptian foreign ministers have both acknowledged a halt in normalisation talks amid continued disagreements, particularly following maritime boundary and energy agreements Turkey recently signed with Libya. ""The risk of [Erdogan] doing the Rabaa salute... may have played an important role in the decision to not go to Egypt,"" Yinanc added, referring to Erdogan's previous adoption of Egyptian protesters' ""Rabaa"" salute. She also argued that Erdogan's lack of attendance at COP27 contradicts his recent rhetoric about being a ""voice of the poor"" in the world. ""The summit in Sharm el-Sheikh is seen as an opportunity for the South, most importantly Africa, to raise its voice against the North, which is pressing the South to 'not pollute' the world despite itself doing so for years,"" Yinanc said. ""[But] Turkey, a G20 country that purports to be the 'voice of the poor', the representative of the South in the North, is not attending at the head-of-state level,"" she added. Erdogan had been scheduled to attend the COP26 summit in 2021, but he cancelled the visit due to a reported dispute over security protocol.

And the chief political correspondent at The Sun, Natasha Clark. Today: REPORTER: How big does the crisis need to get, Home Secretary? Pressure grows on Suella Braverman over the migrant crisis and her own security breaches. Rishi Sunak promised a government of integrity, professionalism and accountability. At the moment we haven't got any of those things. There's more to do, but we're making progress. But we've got to stop these people being exploited. Will Rishi Sunak U-turn over his decision not to attend the UN's climate change summit, Cop 27 ? Also, preventing protesters from getting too close to abortion clinics. We'll ask the new Minister for Women why she's against buffer zones. And will younger people pay the price when the Chancellor announces his spending cuts? Welcome. Let's start with the story here in the Independent. You heard it in the headlines. Rishi Sunak could go to Cop27 , says the minister. He will go to Egypt if he has time. My opening question, starting with you, Maria, is, will the Prime Minister changed his mind and go to the United Nations climate change conference after all? I don't think it is a hard no. It is the timing. We know we have got of the fiscal announcement coming up November the 17th and Cop27 finishes the day after that. We know how vital it is to get of the fiscal statement is right because we have seen the impact of the mini Budget when mistakes were made, as Rishi said. I think he is minded to go if he has time but the fiscal statement has to be the absolute priority at the moment. We know the outcome when that is not done well. And that is his absolute priority right now. Do you think you will end up going? I think he is showing he is weak. He is flip-flopping around. We can't make up his mind. The UK is the president of Cop27 . It is our opportunity to show leadership. One country will win on this climate change race. Why not the UK? We need to have that strong leadership from the beginning. I think he should go and make his mind up and stop flipping around and saying, if he has time, if you can fit it in his diary. He is the Prime Minister, I'm sure he can make time. Is it not a priority? Of course it is. Look at are track record. The reason we are now experiencing some of the energy shortages others are, it's because we have renewable energy. -- we are not experiencing. We have not been so reliable and Russian oil and gas. We have led the way. We were president at last year's conference. This is the handover. And Alok Sharma is going. It will be handing over. But we must not underestimate the importance of the fiscal announcement in November. That is his absolute priority right now. The impact on the day to of everyone... Including rising energy prices. Does this have anything to do with it? Number-macro alarmed as Boris Johnson plans to attend Cop27 climate Summit. It is the United Nations climate change conference . We call it Cop27 . Do you think that has featured in perhaps now thinking about going? If the country that has the presidency, as the UK does, doesn't it sound either the head of government or the head of state, because the King has been told not to attend, there is an opportunity for a former Prime Minister to steal Rishi Sunak's thunder because the absence of those two figures is showing an absence of leadership. And of course there is opportunity for attention. It is expected Boris Johnson might try to capitalise on that. I think Rishi Sunak will probably end up going, if only for part of it, simply because it looks rather odd for one of the leading nations in the global economy and on the fight for climate change not to have a presence there whatsoever, especially as he has demoted the Cop27 minister from a Cabinet role. It is not great if you are trying to say, we are making climate change a key priority, but here all the decisions we have made that show the opposite. What decisions should he make a Natasha?

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK22","Scotland leading way ahead of COP27 - Leslie Mabon","November 1, 2022 Tuesday","Scotsman","The baton passes to Egypt for COP27 this month. Now is a good time to take stock of what\' s happened since COP26, and look forward to what we might expect at COP27 . Since COP26 we have seen continued progress on loss and damage; the ongoing dialogue over high-polluting nations\' financial responsibility to compensate least well-off nations for climate change impacts. These talks will grind on at COP27 , but in the absence of formal binding agreements a few nations are starting to break ranks \- with Scotland leading the way. Scotland committed \£31 million to address loss and damage ahead of COP26. The Scottish Government then hosted an international loss and damage conference in Edinburgh in October 2022. Denmark followed by becoming the first UN member state to formally pledge loss and damage funding to less-wealthy nations. Countries are continuing to enhance their pledges for reducing emissions and adapting to climate change. It was agreed in Glasgow that all nations would revisit and strengthen their targets for reducing emissions by the end of 2022. This continual ratcheting-up of climate change targets is a built-in feature of the climate talks, designed to ensure that national commitments become ever-more ambitious over time as technologies develop. By COP27 , we should have a much clearer picture of who is planning to do what to reduce emissions. However, perhaps the biggest developments since COP26 have come away from the negotiating table. 2022 started with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which illustrated how a continued reliance on fossil fuels leaves us and our energy bills at the mercy of authoritarian regimes. The nature of the energy markets and networks means that despite producing a lot of power from renewable sources, Scotland \- and especially our rural communities relying on electricity for heat \- faces big bills this winter. A summer of extreme heat in the Northern Hemisphere saw the suburban fringes of London go up in flames, and Scotland\' s railways met speed restrictions due to heat stress on tracks. Heavier than usual monsoon rains, melting glaciers and a legacy of poor urban planning left a third of Pakistan under water and over two million people displaced. Climate protestors have resorted to ever more frequent and dramatic actions as exasperation and distress at a lack of action from governments grows. COP27 therefore happens against a backdrop of greater societal awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis than there was 12 months ago. What\' s more, the unequal nature of climate impacts is feeding a growing sense that our responses don\' t just need to be fast and ambitious, they also need to be fair. Just as it is unfair to expose those in Pakistan to heightened flood risk due to our reluctance to reduce emissions in the UK, so it is unfair to expect those in the Highlands of Scotland to accept large-scale tree planting without consultation as a means of offsetting the emissions of those elsewhere. Soaring energy bills are leading to an ever-broadening consensus that insulating our homes, renewing our heating networks, and accelerating the shift to renewable energy sources makes good economic sense and has the potential to create fair, decent and stable work for many. So, my message to world leaders prepping their delegates and negotiators for COP27 would be: Be bold, be ambitious, and be fair.

Africa has contributed very little to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and yet key sectors are already experiencing the damaging consequences of climate change. The United Nations has observed that increased temperatures or drought have sharply reduced agricultural productivity growth in Africa in the past six decades and caused regional economic losses of $ 70 billion in the past 50 years. 'In nuclear science and its applications we have the tools to adapt to climate change conditions,' said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. 'The IAEA is at the centre of global efforts to make sure no one is left behind when it comes to benefiting from these indispensable assets.' Over the past ten years, the IAEA has carried out almost 50 per cent of its climate change adaptation projects in Africa, more than in any other continent, aimed at increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities in multiple sectors. This includes land use management, soil erosion, climate-smart agriculture, food production systems, improved crop varieties, analysis of GHG emissions, water resource management, coastal protection and ocean change monitoring. The report describes various areas of intervention, supported by case studies offering concrete examples of how nuclear science and technology have benefitted Africa. Ocean, food, water: How nuclear technology helps Africa adapt to climate change The report highlights IAEA projects that support countries in Africa in cultivating and exporting food, including growing drought-tolerant crops and applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eradicate insect populations, such as tsetse flies, fruit flies and mosquitoes, that harm both human health and the economies. IAEA projects have also strengthened Africa's capacity to collect and analyse data on the quality of water in river basins and the ocean, allowing policymakers to put measures in place for better resource management, including water security in the Sahel and adapting to ocean acidification in coastal areas, which aims to protect the African fishing industry, and thus prevent environmental and social crises. The report emphasises the importance of partnerships in upscaling such projects. COP27 is an opportunity to forge and strengthen partnerships, and to raise awareness in decision making bodies, development organizations and financial institutions of the potential of nuclear science and technology to feature in national strategies, plans and programmes, including agri-food strategies and disaster risk reduction planning. IAEA experts will be available to discuss IAEA climate adaption projects as well as the use of nuclear power, not only for climate change mitigation but as a reliable, secure source of energy with stable costs that can enable the clean energy transition, at the IAEA COP27 pavilion, #Atoms4Climate, which will be open throughout the two-week event, until 18 November.

This includes land use management, soil erosion, climate-smart agriculture, food production systems, improved crop varieties, analysis of GHG emissions, water resource management, coastal protection and ocean change monitoring. The report describes various areas of intervention, supported by case studies offering concrete examples of how nuclear science and technology have benefitted Africa. Ocean, food, water: How nuclear technology helps Africa adapt to climate change The report highlights IAEA projects that support countries in Africa in cultivating and exporting food, including growing drought-tolerant crops and applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eradicate insect populations, such as tsetse flies, fruit flies and mosquitoes, that harm both human health and the economies. IAEA projects have also strengthened Africa's capacity to collect and analyse data on the quality of water in river basins and the ocean, allowing policymakers to put measures in place for better resource management, including water security in the Sahel and adapting to ocean acidification in coastal areas, which aims to protect the African fishing industry, and thus prevent environmental and social crises. The report emphasises the importance of partnerships in upscaling such projects. COP27 is an opportunity to forge and strengthen partnerships, and to raise awareness in decision making bodies, development organizations and financial institutions of the potential of nuclear science and technology to feature in national strategies, plans and programmes, including agri-food strategies and disaster risk reduction planning. IAEA experts will be available to discuss IAEA climate adaption projects as well as the use of nuclear power, not only for climate change mitigation but as a reliable, secure source of energy with stable costs that can enable the clean energy transition, at the IAEA COP27 pavilion, #Atoms4Climate, which will be open throughout the two-week event, until 18 November.

The undergraduate and graduate students, all taking Cornell's Global Climate Change Science and Policy course in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), will travel to the United Nations Climate Change Conference at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 6-18. 'I've been looking forward to taking this class since I was a freshman, with the hopes of attending the UN COP conference, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it,' said Rebecca Foody '23, who will be assisting the delegation of the Earth Child Institute, a non-governmental organization that represents children and youth to rebuild a normal-climate future. 'I am eager to see how international climate negotiations take place,' Foody said, £nd see what I can do on a global scale to fight climate change.' The class is taught by Allison Chatrchyan, senior research associate in the departments of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Global Development (CALS), who has been taking students to interact with global leaders since COP22, in 2017. This year, for the first time, the U.N. has invited students from Chatrchyan's class to join the selective Climate Change and Universities Partnership Program. Through that partnership, a Cornell student team that includes doctoral student Charlie Tebbutt, in Natural Resources and the Environment (CALS), will be conducting research on land-use planning and climate change needs for Peru. Doctoral student Valentina Rubio, in the School of Integrative Plant Science, Soil and Crop Sciences (CALS), will attend COP27 as an official representative of her home country, Uruguay. She said Uruguay focuses on renewable energy and sustainable agriculture - her expertise as an agronomist. 'Soil has a huge potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere,' Rubio said. 'I'm interested in the discussions regarding soil practices by farmers. And at COP27 , I expect to be learning how to communicate my research to policymakers, which is a new forum for me.' Another team including Foody, Rubio and Andy Shin '23 is conducting research on the needs for climate-smart agriculture tools in Zambia. Katherine Cornett '23, Arden Podpora '23, and graduate students Nick Hamp-Adams and Courtney Schneider, in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy, were invited by the ambassador to the U.N. from the Kingdom of Tonga - a tiny Pacific-island nation - to help their COP27 delegation. Tonga is vulnerable to rising seas and the effects of climate change. Other students participating on the Cornell student delegation are undergraduates Eva Fenningdorf '23, Alana Becker '23, and Elena Martin Hernandez '22, who are helping the Cornell exhibit and side events. Nearly 15,000 delegates are expected to attend COP27 , including about 90 heads of state. Several countries are expected to announce new 2030 emission targets as part of their commitment to the Paris Agreement, with many fortifying their existing 2030 targets before the meeting, according to the White House. Since late August, the students in the class have been steeped in global climate issues, as they learn about the science behind policies through the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). After taking the class last year and now serving as a teaching assistant this semester, Podpora is eager to absorb COP27 . 'We will be able to network with experts from around the world and listen to differing perspectives,' she said. 'I think that's the coolest part about traveling to Egypt: The world is my classroom.' Funding for student travel was provided through Cornell student travel grants and support through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; the College of Arts and Sciences; the College of Engineering and the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy. In addition to the students, Cornell's presence at COP27 includes faculty and staff who will be engaging partners and leading discussions. Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability is providing an online resource for the delegation.

Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Egypt in November, the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation participated in a series of events at the Africa Climate Week to build consensus among African countries and stakeholders. COP27 is described as Africa's COP and will significantly shape the future. To deliver on adaptation, a transformative adaptation agenda is needed now. Titled 'Adaptation Dialogue: Implementing the Vision,' the session called for strengthening collaboration on adaptation across the continent. The speakers highlighted the progress made by the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) so far, notably its contribution to narrowing the adaptation gap and accelerating the implementation of the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI). The AAI represents Africa's bold and innovative step to galvanize the support needed to significantly scale up adaptation across the continent. Speaking on behalf of Dr. Kevin Kariuki, Vice President, Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth, Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank, underscored the urgent need for accelerated adaptation action. Dorsouma called for accelerated action against climate change while making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid a mounting loss of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure. He noted that progress on adaptation has been uneven so far, with increasing gaps between action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director and Africa Regional Director at the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), highlighted the need to improve climate resilience and adaptation in Africa. He estimated the cost of climate change at $ 579 billion by 2030, with global finance skewed towards mitigation. Only 7.2% of global finance goes to climate adaptation. Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, Special Advisor to the President of the Gabonese Republic and the Permanent Secretary of the National Climate Council, endorsed the AAAP as a primary vehicle for implementing the Africa Adaptation Initiative's mandate. The program seeks to mobilize $ 25 billion to accelerate climate change adaptation actions across Africa. The AAAP is an Africa-owned and Africa-led response to the continent's expressed needs and priorities to reduce its vulnerabilities to climate change and harness the opportunities that result from climate change. Since its launch in April 2021, the AAAP upstream financing facility, managed by GCA, has enabled mainstreaming adaptation into investments worth over $ 3 billion.

The annual gathering of nations to discuss the global environment is due to take place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in November. During his time as the Prince of Wales, Charles often spoke about the issue of climate change and his desire for creating a sustainable world. In September 2021, he wrote exclusively for the Daily Mirror on his personal lifelong quest to help future generations and said: ""I have spent some forty years of my life trying to indicate what needs to be done to ensure we do not bequeath a destroyed world to our children and grandchildren."" He went on to warn that the world was ""on the brink"". It was thought the King would be delivering a speech at this year's conference but the prime minister is believed to have rejected the idea -Ms Truss herself is unlikely to attend. A senior royal insider told The Times : ""It is no mystery that the King was invited to go there. He had to think very carefully about what steps to take for his first overseas tour, and he is not going to be attending Cop."" It is said the choice to stop the King attending the meeting was due to Government advice, although Charles will find other means to support the event. The COP events are also know as the United Nations Climate Change Conference this year runs between November 6 and 18. At last year's COP26 in Glasgow the then-Prince of Wales gave a speech before urging world leaders to unite together and tackle climate change. But since the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September, the monarch has intimated that his role would change and some saw this as him potentially turning more apolitical. The Queen also gave a speech at COP26, which The Times source described as ""entirely non-political"" and called it an ""error of judgment"" by the Government not to allow the King to attend. \"

She called for a bespoke climate fund to support grassroots women to tackle climate change and build resilience. The African Development Bank organized the session held during COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh under the theme, Gender Sensitive and climate just finance mechanisms. The panelists said facilities tailored to supporting women, who are helping to build climate resilience, must be visible, simple, and easily accessible. 'There is a problem about the visibility, transparency and accountability, and although there is some money floating around, we don't have a properly dedicated climate fund or a permanent climate fund to support women entrepreneurs in combating climate change,' Robinson said. Robinson gave the example of some women-led projects in Uganda which could do ten times more if they had access to targeted climate resources. 'They had no prospects of getting the money that could be available for their sector - they didn't even know who was getting the money or where it was going.' Opening the session, African Development Bank Group Vice President Vice for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Kevin Kariuki, said the Bank had earmarked funding for ten capacity-building projects, focusing on gender and climate through the Africa Climate Change Fund. 'Moreover, we are committing $ 100 million in loans to public and private sector projects to address gender and climate issues,' Kariuki said. 'The Bank is also developing an adaptation mechanism to enable individuals and groups, including women and children, to borrow money for climate adaptation projects,' he added. The African Development Bank hosted other side events to mark Gender Day at the COP27 to highlight the successes, challenges and issues surrounding gender equality and climate change. They included the launch of the Gender in Climate Action Accelerator, a tool to support private sector companies improve the gender responsiveness of their corporate climate governance. The Accelerator will support governments in promoting gender-sensitive climate sector policies, accelerating their green transition to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a joint initiative by the Egyptian government, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the French Development Agency, AFD. At a session opened by Kenya's First Lady Rachel Ruto, experts agreed that as the efforts for greener economies grow, the focus should be on upskilling and reskilling to help women and girls to access green jobs. The panel, titled 'Enabling and Tracking Gender-responsive Green Jobs Recovery,' also highlighted access to information for women and strengthening gender-responsive capacity building. The Bank also held a session on 'Accelerating gender-responsive climate investment for a resilient Sahel, which discussed good practices to ramp up gender-responsive climate finance in the Sahel. In his remarks, Al Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank called for a more equitable distribution of climate resources in the Sahel. Sidi Mohamed EL Wavi, Director of Climate and Green Economy at the Ministry of Environment in Mauritania, underscored the importance of eliminating barriers to quality education for women to enhance their representation at all levels.

During his speech, Mr Cassis stated that this year's edition must not be the one to abandon the 1.5\'b0C target. The conference's aim is to promote implementation of the Paris climate agreement. During his speech at the summit, which was opened on 7 November 2022 and attended by around 100 heads of state and government, Mr Cassis strongly emphasised the fact that climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Mr Cassis, who is also head of the FDFA, went on to state that ""climate change has left a particularly devastating legacy this year"" in reference to the floods in Pakistan as well as heatwaves and droughts in several parts of the world. He added that Switzerland would therefore continue to maintain its climate targets, despite the current energy crisis. Switzerland is committed to halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. Mr Cassis also lent his support to the ambitious commitments of the COP27 agenda, which includes a clear and concrete timetable for all states to divest from fossil fuels. In addition, he made a clear commitment to a work programme aimed at advancing climate policies in different countries and to strengthening climate adaptation, development and humanitarian efforts at the global level. Responding to needs in developing countries To meet the Paris climate agreement targets, COP27 participants underscored the need to step up financing for the poorest and most vulnerable countries (LDC), including those in the small island developing state (SIDS) category. ""Countries that need the financial support to make this transition must receive it; those with the capacity to assist them must contribute"" stressed Mr Cassis. Switzerland acknowledges the serious adaptation needs facing these countries, as well as the need to support them in mitigating and addressing the increasing loss and damage related to climate change. Against this backdrop, over the next four years Switzerland will, subject to parliamentary approval, contribute CHF 155,4 million to the Global Environment Facility, CHF 11,8 million to the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and CHF 16 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) in order to meet the target of doubling financing for adaptation. Both of these funds prioritise climate adaptation measures in LCDs and SIDS. Switzerland will also contribute an additional CHF 8 million to the World Bank's Disaster Risk Insurance and Financing (DRFI) programme to help strengthen the resilience of its partner states, as well as CHF 4 million to the CREWS initiative, which provides a funding mechanism to address the needs of LDCs and SIDS. This sum is in addition to Switzerland's current CHF 9 million contribution for developing early warning systems for all. Bilateral meetings on conference margins Mr Cassis signed a bilateral climate agreement with Morocco's Minister for Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali on the margins of the conference. He also participated in a round table on food security. At COP27 , President Cassis exchanged views with the new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, the new Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority Mohammad Shtayyeh as well as the Presidents of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, Romania, Klaus Iohannis, and Israel, Isaac Herzog. The second week of COP27 will see environment ministers meeting to discuss issues at a high political level. Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga, head of the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, will represent Switzerland at the meeting.

Mr. Ndoye requested additional support, particularly in the areas of fisheries, livestock and agriculture and recommended that, given the cross-cutting nature of the collaborative work, the initiative should be expanded to include other ministries as well as the private sector. For its part, the delegation of Guinea, led by Mr. Fassou Thea, Advisor to the Prime Minister, requested data support in the areas of disaster planning, watershed management, agriculture, and food production. The impetus for the call of member countries for additional support is the high impact delivered by the collaboration between IsDBI and Global Partnership in promoting quality data systems in support of evidence-based policymaking. Such multilateral collaborations on advancing innovative data sources are imperative to drive accelerated achievement of the SDGs in time for the 2030 Agenda Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Islamic Development Bank Institute (IsDBI).

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK34","King Charles told to stay away from Cop27 climate summit by Liz Truss","October 1, 2022 Saturday 6:35 PM GMT","Express Online","Buckingham Palace has confirmed that the King will not attend the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt next month. The news comes after it was reported that Prime Minister Liz Truss ""advised"" the King not to attend. King Charles III is very passionate about the issue and was very vocal about climate change as the Prince of Wales. Related articles King Charles III had reportedly intended to deliver a speech at the conference but it appears Ms Truss - who will likely not attend - advised against it. The news comes amid speculation that the Government may abandon its 2050 carbon net zero target. A senior royal source told The Times: ""It is no mystery that the King was invited to go there. He had to think very carefully about what steps to take for his first overseas tour, and he is not going to be attending Cop."" The source said the decision was made on Government advice but that the King would still strive to make his presence felt at the summit. The source added: ""Just because he is not in physical attendance, that doesn\' t mean His Majesty won\' t find other ways to support it."" King Charles III had previously said that his role would change now that he had become the Sovereign following the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II. Some took this to mean he would become more apolitical - he was known for pursuing causes as the prince of Wales which were close to his heart. However, the source speaking to The Times pointed out that the Queen gave a speech for Cop26 last year. READ MORE: Prince William may not get invested as Prince of Wales like Charles The source added: ""The Queen gave an entirely non-political address at Cop last year...it sounds like he is not being given the choice. That is an error of judgment on the part of the government. ""The King could absolutely go and deliver the government\' s message and give it credibility, given all the kudos he has in that space."" Cop27 - shorthand for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference - is set to take place November 6 to 18 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Last year, the King delivered a passionate speech during the opening ceremony of Cop26 which was held in Glasgow, Scotland.

He said: ""I can only urge you, as the world\' s decision-makers, to find practical ways of overcoming differences so we can all get down to work, together, to rescue this precious planet and save the threatened future of our young people."" Before becoming monarch, King Charles III previously commented on Government policy including expressing alarm privately at the Government's policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. He reportedly called the practice ""appalling"". This month, the Government announced that it had lifted the moratorium on fracking, something which is likely at odds with the Sovereign's environmentally-minded views.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK35","The UK's Presidency of COP26 ends as world leaders meet in Egypt for COP27","November 7, 2022 Monday","ENP Newswire","One year on from hosting COP26 in Glasgow, the UK has handed over the Presidency of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to Egypt as world leaders, including the UK's PM, Rishi Sunak, meet at Sharm el Sheikh for COP27 . The UK's Presidency of COP26 made progress on each of its four goals of: mitigation (reducing emissions), adaptation (helping those already impacted by climate change), finance (enabling countries to deliver on their climate goals) and collaboration (working together to deliver even greater action). Most importantly, if countries which agreed the Glasgow Climate Pact deliver on their commitments to phase down coal power, halt or reverse deforestation and speed up the switch to electric vehicles, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is still possible. This will be critical for preventing devastating climate impacts and protecting vulnerable countries like Pakistan. At COP26 the UK pledged \£355m in financial support to Pakistan to assist with building climate resilience and tackling climate change. This support is in addition to \£326.5m provided by the UK Government and \£330m donated by UK citizens to provide relief following this year's devastating floods. Having handed over the Presidency, the UK is maintaining its ambitious goals on climate change. This year the UK is launching the 'Accelerating to Zero Coalition' which will promote the use of more electric cars worldwide. The UK is also initiating the 'Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership' to halt and reverse forest loss and will be working with developed countries to increase the availability of climate finance to countries such as Pakistan. Development Director at the British High Commission, Islamabad Jo Moir, said the following: This year's floods are a stark reminder of impact climate change is having on our lives. Globally, we will face more climate catastrophes, and climate-vulnerable countries like Pakistan face enormous challenges. Business as usual is not enough. At COP27 we need to make further progress on ensuring countries which have been affected by climate related disasters have the necessary tools to build-back smarter. The UK will be a leading voice on this. Notes to editors: 1 Important achievements of COP26 include: International partners mobilising over $ 20 billion for a just and inclusive transition from coal to clean energy. 137 countries committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 in the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use. The COP26 Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% Zero Emission Cars and Vans brought together over 35 countries, 6 major carmakers, 43 cities, states and regions, 28 fleet owners and 15 financial institutions and investors, all committing to work together to achieve this goal. It currently has over 180 signatories. Building on the ZEV declaration, the UK will formally launch the Acceleration to Zero (A2Z) Coalition- this will comprise of a group of governments, manufacturers and businesses that will take the lead in ensuring that all new vehicles are zero emission by 2035 in leading markets and globally by 2040. 2 On 2 November, as part of its Climate Finance Accelerator programme the UK announced that seven low-carbon projects from across Pakistan would receive technical support to improve their ability to attract long-term investment from financers, worth up to \£3148m. These projects have the potential to benefit communities across Pakistan, through clean energy access, green transportation and pollution reduction while creating jobs. The ultimate objective however is to improve the flow of much needed climate finance which will allow Pakistan to build back smarter. 3 At COP27 the UK is launching the 'Forests and Climate Leaders' Partnership' FCLP- it is a core group of high ambition countries to accelerate global progress to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation. The partnership will keep the forests and land use sector high on the political agenda and more strongly linked into global climate processes and actions. The FCLP ministers will meet every year on the side lines of COP meetings.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK38","-IAEA COP27 Event Highlights How Nuclear Science Helps Island States Tackle Climate Change Impact on Water Resources","November 18, 2022 Friday","M2 PressWIRE","November 18, 2022 Release date- 17112022 - IAEA COP27 Event Highlights How Nuclear Science Helps Island States Tackle Climate Change Impact on Water Resources. Growing demands from tourism and agriculture in many island states are putting stress on limited water supplies that are under increasing pressure from climate change. This situation makes it challenging for them to secure reliable water supplies. To face the challenge, many countries are over-abstracting groundwater, which leads to a greater risk of contamination, depletion, and saltwater intrusion. Here's where nuclear science comes into play: Isotope hydrology increases the capacity of island states to monitor and better manage their water resources. It also helps them optimize their groundwater resources, highlighted speakers of an IAEA #Atoms4Climate side event at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, pointed out that 70 per cent of his country's population live within 5 km of the coast in low lying areas. The coastal zones are more vulnerable to sea level rise and associated problems such as salinization of groundwater. 'It's absolutely critical that we mobilize funds for mitigation and adaptation,' he said. 'And it is reassuring to have the IAEA giving us the science to better understand our water resources and the sort of certainty on where we must invest.' Another island nation, Malta, a water scarce country for centuries, has long been actively investing in their water resources. But climate change is presenting a new set of challenges as sea level rise threatens the groundwater resources on which they depend. Manuel Sapiano, CEO of Malta's Energy and Water Agency, emphasized that this was a critical issue for his country. Malta has historically been dependent on groundwater and is focussed on protecting this resource. 'Knowing whether it is fresh water or old seawater helps to define the interventions that we take today,' he said. A key component of such interventions are isotope techniques to determine the age of the groundwater resources, which may range from months to millions of years. This helps scientists detect the presence of contaminants and to understand how quickly aquifers are replenished. Yuliya Vystavna, a senior IAEA technical officer who moderated the event, explained one of the key activities of the IAEA: producing scientific knowledge and transferring it to countries through national, regional or inter-regional projects. 'IAEA technical cooperation projects support countries across the world in strengthening national capacity to plan and manage water resources,' she said. The IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme indeed offers dedicated programmes for island states, added Martin Krause, Director of Programme Coordination at the Agency's Department of Technical Cooperation. 'We build capacity for young scientists who want to acquire specific expertise in nuclear techniques through fellowships, training events, networks,' he said. It may not be realistic to create capacity in all the aspects of nuclear science on each island, he added. 'Sharing laboratories across a number of islands, sharing knowledge could be one way of increasing the capacity to deal with sophisticated scientific technologies. The University of the West Indies in Jamaica can help pool the intellectual resources to serve the whole region.' You can watch the full recording here.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK39","-Nuclear Science can Help Save Wetlands, IAEA COP27 Event Highlights","November 15, 2022 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Wetlands are a window into the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle. At an #Atoms4Climate side event at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, panellists discussed the important ecological and hydrological functions that wetlands provide and why we must protect them. Wetlands are ecologically diverse environmental systems and understanding where the water that supports them comes from is a key focus of the IAEA's water resources programme. Using isotope hydrology tools and techniques, the different sources of water feeding a wetland can be identified and properly accounted for. 'Knowing whether a wetland is fed principally by groundwater or by precipitation is a key piece of information needed to effectively manage these systems,' said Jodie Miller, Head of the IAEA Isotope Hydrology Section, at the event, entitled Halting Wetland Loss through Innovative Science Approaches. To generate the data needed to manage wetlands effectively, the IAEA is investing in technical capacity in countries to build up analytical laboratories. The goal is to enable countries to not only generate their own data, but also to develop water resource management projects and to build human resource capacity to both run the laboratory equipment and to interpret the data generated. Building human capacity is a critical issue for Africa, emphasized Guy Midgely from the Centre for Climate Studies at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. 'Only 4 out of the 1,000 top climate change scientists are from Africa,' he said. 'This reflects the ongoing poor state of investment in science and technology in Africa and means the continent is on the backfoot in climate science.' And this has serious consequences for wetlands preservation. Lake Chad, for instance, has lost more than 90% of its wetland since 1960 and much of this can be attributed to poor water management stemming from a lack of scientific understanding of the interconnected processes that affect wetlands. Wetlands are also often a target for agricultural development due to the availability of water combined with nutrient-rich soils. The wetlands of the Nile Delta, for example, have been exploited for over a thousand years for agriculture. 'Many of the world's poor rely on wetlands for their livelihoods and food production,' said Bisher Imam, a senior programme management officer at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 'In addition, anthropogenically driven biodiversity changes, such as declines in migratory bird populations, also have direct socio-economic consequences for these people.' Exploitation of wetlands requires careful management, emphasized Mark Schmidt, Director General of the International Water Management Institute. 'Bringing science and technology, such as isotope hydrology, into management strategies is essential to bridge the gap between science and policy,' he said. 'Science and data and information can be the catalyst to bring people from different perspectives together to solve common issues.' Data and information, capacity development, innovation: these are some of the key accelerators of UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation, panellists at the event agreed. The UN Water 2023 Conference will discuss how these accelerators, along with governance and finance, can help bring SDG6 back on track. Accelerating SDG6 implementation will also require a better understanding of wetlands, which act as the interface between atmospheric and groundwater systems. Isotope hydrology helps us gather the knowledge to ensure their resilience now and for future generations.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK41","At COP27, Investors, Companies, and Policymakers Must Accelerate Urgent Action on the Climate and Water Crises To Cut Emissions in Half by 2030","November 4, 2022 Friday","ENP Newswire","COP27 provides a critical moment to build upon historic U.S. climate action and investments, as public and private sector leaders raise their ambition, deliver on commitments, implement policies to capitalize on the opportunities in the necessary transition to a zero emissions future, and ensure public finance to support adaptation and resilience for developing nations - With 2030 only seven years away, the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) presents a critical moment for galvanizing more public and private sector momentum on the climate and water crises, which are only growing worse, and accelerating urgent action at speed and scale to slash global greenhouse gas emissions in half by decade's end. Ceres, along with its partners, will call on investors, companies, and policymakers to build on the progress since COP26 and turn commitments into even more ambitious actions and implement bold policies in line with the scientific need to limit average temperature rise to no more than 1.5\'b0C. The risks to global economies, natural systems, and communities are beyond catastrophic if urgent action isn't taken in the near term to reverse climate change. On the eve of COP27 , Ceres joined its partners in the Investor Agenda to release the most ambitious investor call for government action on climate change. The Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Crisis urges world leaders to adopt five key policy recommendations including: developing medium- and long-term climate strategies, transitioning energy away from fossil fuels, ending deforestation, strengthening disclosures, and bolstering climate finance, including adaptation and resilience financing for developing nations. The statement was signed by 602 investor signatures representing US $ 42 trillion in assets under management. COP27 comes following a year of big gains in climate commitments among companies and investors and historic climate policy wins. Hundreds of companies and investors including nearly 300 asset managers with a combined $ 68 trillion in assets have made net zero commitments. As global leaders convene, more investors are developing Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs), detailing how they will achieve their goals. While companies likewise have made progress on developing their transition plans toward meeting their emission reduction targets within their operations and across their supply chain, Ceres continues to push for more aggressive steps to ensure deeper emission reductions in the near term and support companies looking at how to implement a just transition for workers and front-line communities. On the U.S. policy front, the Inflation Reduction Act, opens up major opportunities for public and private sector acceleration of climate solutions. Moreover, it could help motivate other countries to follow suit in raising their own policy ambitions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also on the cusp of finalizing a rule for mandatory corporate climate disclosure that would require consistent disclosures about the material and financial risks of climate change from all publicly listed U.S. companies. The work at COP27 can further support the U.S. and other countries related to climate disclosure. ""Now is the time for the most ambitious and urgent action on the global climate and water crisis. We've seen another record year of deadly, extreme weather events that are costing us lives, impacting vulnerable communities, and amassing hundreds of billions of dollars in damages. For the next seven years, we must marshal our collective forces and bolster commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 to avoid more irreversible effects of this growing crisis. The window for limiting global warming is fast diminishing."" - Mindy Lubber, Ceres CEO and President At COP 27 , Ceres experts will participate in a number of events to highlight the massive opportunities for investors, companies, and policymakers in the transition to a more climate resilient and water-secure future and the various groundbreaking initiatives and resources that can continue to help guide them as they map out their next actions. These include the Investor Agenda, Climate Action 100+, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the Valuing Water Finance Initiative, and the Ceres Ambition 2030 initiative, among others. Featured events with Ceres experts include: Sustainable Innovation Forum 2022 November 9-10, 2022 | Innovation Zone | Online The Sustainable Innovation Forum 2022 will run alongside COP27 , convening heads of state, ministers, CEOs, investors, and UN and multilateral dignitaries to discuss adaptation, mitigation and implementation, and provide a collaborative platform to push for stronger, more decisive national action plans and spotlight effective business action and innovative climate solutions.

The world's biggest plastic producer was chosen as a supporting sponsor for this year's global summit by Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. And the selection has not gone down well with NGOs, climate activists and companies working on global warming mitigation either. Read more: Ireland still biggest producer of plastic packaging per head of population in EU Green Party politician Grace O'Sullivan said: ""Unfortunately we are seeing more and more greenwashing surrounding these events -even the fact it is being hosted by a country that has just increased gas exports to the EU along with Israel and is guilty of egregious human rights offences. ""Oil, plastic and abuses all go hand in hand,"" she added. ""Coca Cola is the largest producer of plastic and plastic waste in the world, four years in a row in 2021. ""This case shows how the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and pollution are all interlinked and stained by big money and big oil. The climate movement does not want their money."" Egypt announced the deal with Coca Cola on September 28, saying ""climate is a key area of focus"" for the company as it works towards net zero by 2050. Irish climate adaptation worker Peter Dynes from MEER.org says it's like big tobacco sponsoring a World Health Organisation conference. He told us: ""Coca Cola are basically a plastics company with added syrup. ""They produce three million tonnes of plastic packaging a year. ""The fossil fuel industry continues to develop new extraction and processing capacity to meet this growing demand. All this is adding to the emissions problem, never mind the pollution."" US-born drinks firm Coca Cola's products are the world's biggest polluters according to audits by Breakfree from Plastic. They said: ""Global beach cleanups were carried out by more than 11,000 volunteers in 45 countries to identify the most common plastic polluters. This year's 2021 Brand Audit found nearly 20,000 Coca-Cola branded products, which represents more pollution than the next two top polluters combined-as has been the case each year since 2019."" While 99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels, plastic pollution and litter also harms wildlife, sea life and impacts lives around the world. Greenpeace said in a statement about the move: ""Coca-Cola produces 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year - and 99% of plastics are made from fossil fuels, worsening both the plastic and climate crisis. ""They have yet to even acknowledge this is a problem or explain how they will meet their climate goals without ending their plastic addiction. ""This partnership undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor."" COP27 takes place in Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt this November 6-18. The global climate summit aims to encourage nations to reach agreements on tackling climate change, which is caused by carbon emissions mostly from burning fossil fuels. Deforestation, wetland and bogland loss doesn't help, as it reduces vital carbon sinks that can remove CO2 from the air. Countries have already committed to keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees over pre-industrial levels, but even Ireland did not meet legally binding targets in 2020 while its 2021 emissions were up 4.7% according to the EPA.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK43","Kenya's Kikuyu radio criticises Ruto's 'bloated' COP27 delegate list","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Africa - Political ","By BBC Monitoring Journalists on a radio station that broadcasts in the central Kikuyu region stronghold have criticised President William Ruto for travelling with hundreds of delegates for the UN-sponsored COP27 climate summit in Egypt earlier in November. Ruto had said austerity measures will be put in place to enable Kenya's economic recovery. The following are selected comments from Kameme FM's Arahuka (wake up) programme that broadcast on 22 November 2022 between 0447 and 0455 GMT hosted by Gatonye Mbugua and Muthee Kiengei: [Gatonye] On to today's People Daily newspaper on page one, there is this story about the just concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt and it was really important because the danger in the world right now is not nuclear bombs but climate change. We now have animals and creatures that are extinct. Even some trees are no longer in existence and human survival is under threat because of climate change.&#160; We are now experiencing prolonged drought, some regions you hear of reports of massive flooding and deserts keep extending for instance the Sahara. These are some of the dangers. So, this was one very important conference, even though there are now reports that Kenyan delegation was the second largest in Africa and fourth globally at the world event and this coming at a time when the government has announced that it intends to cut down on its spending and save 3 billion shillings [US$20 million].&#160; In fact allowances for government employees are set to be reduced, &#160;seminars will no longer be held in resorts to cut down on spending and that is why these hotels are now planning to sack their employees because the major customers in Mombasa and Naivasha are the government.&#160; But now Kenya sent 386 delegates to the COP27 conference, which is a huge number compared to America and China, which had 71 delegates. It seems Kenya had such a huge interest in this conference.&#160; The UK had sent 80 delegates. It seems Kenya was competing with Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which had a total of 450 delegates. But this is Kenya and we are not fully informed on those who were in the delegation and I hope that they were all government employees on official duty. But still, in this country you hear of reports of huge delegations sent abroad during the Olympics or other competitions, and the number of officials always exceeds the participants. [Kiengei] You can recall what happened during the championships that were held at Rio [in 2016]. [Gatonye] Some of the participants could not be booked in hotels and were stranded because the officials took up all the rooms. There is this time when volleyball team players had to depend on well-wishers to buy them food. This is often a chance for many senior officials of various departments to travel with their side chics. Their is that possibility and [trade union] COTU boss Francis Atwoli stated this - I do not remember at which conference - that there were people who were asked to leave their hotel rooms because their time was up yet they were not even aware that the conference had come to an end. [Kiengei] You can trust Kenyans to jump at any opportunity that arises. Do you remember the delegation that accompanied retired President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, then William Ruto, to the Hague, Netherlands [where they were facing crimes against humanity cases at the International Criminal Court in 2013]. There are people who did not know where the court was, having spent an entire week there. [Gatonye] If they had travelled at their own cost, that is very okay, but if they are not government officials on duty, it will trigger a heated debate back home. I really thank God because Kenya is not participating in the World Cup, because the officials will have exceeded the team players. Do you recall when the MPs went to watch the World Cup [in Russia in 2018] under the disguise of bench marking. One of them was the former Nairobi senatorial candidate Millicent Omanga flying the Croatian flag so high. Source: Kameme FM, Nairobi, in Kikuyu 0747 GMT 22 Nov 22 \"

The Times was told:  The Queen gave an entirely non-political address at Cop last year \'e2\€ \£6 it sounds like he is not being given the choice. That is an error of judgment on the part of the government."" King Charles is known for caring about issues surrounding the environment, and in 2015 he called for a  vast military-style campaign to tackle climate change at COP21 in Paris. Last year, the King also delivered a speech at COP26, which has held in Glasgow, and gave a speech in which he urged world leaders to adopt a  warlike footing to deal with the climate crisis. Charles not attending the conference has reportedly annoyed John Kerry, who is US President Joe Biden\' s special envoy for climate change. Mr Kerry has previously said he  very much hoped the King would be at COP27 , and that he would be allowed to participate in the climate change debate  within the constitutional process . In an interview with the BBC, the envoy said:  He is an enormously important convener and somebody who has the ability to be able to leverage the kind of action we need now on a global basis.

Mr Sharma also added that he hoped King Charles would attend. He explained:  I would certainly welcome the king\' s attendance at COP27 . The Times has reported that Mr Sharma lobbied to allow the King to attend the conference but was overruled by the Foreign Office over Protocol concerns.

A source has said Canada is  top of the list for a potential visit after the King made it clear he would prefer his first trip abroad be in a Commonwealth country. The Goverment has announced it will begin negotiations with a new trade deal with Canada next year, as Britain is already the third largest Canadian trading partner. A source from the Foreign Office suggested the visit to Canada may be part of a bigger royal tour which could bring King Charles to America as well as some areas in the Caribbean.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK46","-University of Pennsylvania : At COP27, Penn showcased its diverse climate expertise on the world stage","November 30, 2022 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","University of Pennsylvania : More than 30 representatives from the University traveled to Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for two weeks of negotiations at this year's United Nations climate change conference . Penn played its largest role yet in this year's United Nations climate change conference , COP27 . The conference, held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from Nov. 6-20, and attended by more than 30,000 people, included policy discussions, climate events, and negotiations that resulted in a deal to fund 'loss and damage' related to climate change. In its third year with accredited observer status, the Penn delegation contributed to both the negotiations at the center of the conference, including significant work on loss and damage conversations, and the series of events at its perimeter, called the 'blue zone.' 'Penn has real expertise on climate solutions, so it's really important for us to participate in these international venues where finding solutions is the number one priority,' says Cornelia Colijn, executive director of the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy and one of two heads of Penn's delegation, with Michael Weisberg, the Bess W. Heyman President's Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy. More than 30 representatives from across the University-including the Kleinman Center, Perry World House (PWH), School of Arts Sciences, Penn Carey Law School, School of Veterinary Medicine, Stuart Weitzman School of Design, Penn Institute for Urban Research (Penn IUR), and more-participated in COP27 . 'Penn is an international leader in the fight against climate change,' says President Liz Magill. 'Focused research and teaching on all issues related to climate is a top institutional priority across the University, and it's a testament to our broad expertise on climate change that so many from Penn could share their knowledge and insights in front of an international audience of this caliber. This type of engagement is crucial to finding solutions to one of the biggest challenges we face today.' A MESSAGE ABOUT PENN'S ENDOWMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY From President Liz Magill and Board of Trustees Chair Scott L. Bok The world gathering in Egypt for COP27 reminds us of the urgency of our collective fight against climate change. Faculty, student, and staff attendees from Penn represent the energy and talent that so many Penn community members contribute to this crucial effort. This is an opportune moment to share our thoughts on the role of Penn's endowment in combatting climate change. The complexity of the issue and the urgency of the climate challenge merit a thoughtful consideration and explanation of Penn's policies. Penn's endowment exists to provide long-term support for Penn's educational mission. This year, Penn will spend a record $ 960 million from its endowment to support student financial aid, faculty salaries, faculty teaching and research, Penn's health system, and countless other programs that rely heavily on endowment spending. While the core purpose of Penn's endowment is to provide this financial support, some have argued that large endowments should play a role in mitigating climate change and, in particular, that fossil fuels do not have a place in university endowments. Read the full announcement in Penn Today. Shortly after the conclusion of COP27 , Magill and Penn Board of Trustees Chair Scott L. Bok published a statement-which will also run in the Dec. 6 issue of the Almanac-articulating how Penn is responding to the challenge of climate change in its management of the endowment (see the sidebar). The University has also launched a new website designed to centrally curate its work on sustainability in the hope of making it easier for the University community to follow Penn's efforts to combine its research, educational, operational, and investment initiatives aimed at addressing climate change. Overall, the 27th Conference of Parties brought together nearly 200 nations that had signed on to the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Climate Agreement was adopted at COP21 in 2015, when nearly every country in the world agreed to curb emissions to prevent global warming from surpassing 1.5-degreeC above pre-industrial levels, the temperature at which dangerous climate 'tipping points' become increasingly likely. Since then, the annual conferences have focused on enacting policies and measuring progress to keep warming under that level, as well as taking actions that protect humans and ecosystems as the planet warms. This year, the three major objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement guided the talks: adaptation, mitigation, and financing. Adaptation addresses how countries will adjust to the unavoidable effects of climate change. Mitigation concerns how countries will moderate their emissions to prevent further warming. Financing addresses who will pay for these efforts. The agreement surrounding loss and damage is a significant win, says Scott Moore, director of China programs and strategic initiatives at Penn Global. 'This is the biggest thing to happen in international climate diplomacy since Paris-by a mile,' he says. 'I don't think many saw it coming.' Experts from across Penn brought their insight to COP27 . Top row, left to right: Andrew Hoffman (School of Veterinary Medicine), Andy Stone (Kleinman Center for Energy Policy), Allison Lassiter (Stuart Weitzman School of Design), Cornelia Colijn (Kleinman Center), and Amy Montgomery (Penn Institute for Urban Research). Row two: Michael Weisberg (School of Arts Sciences), Hoffman, Steven Finn (College of Liberal Professional Studies), Lauren Anderson (Penn Global), and Stone. Row three: John Kerry speaking with Weisberg and Aminath Shauna (Maldives), Penn Carey Law students with Mauricio Rodas (3rd from left) and William Burke-White (Penn Law, 5th from right), and Eugenie Birch (Weitzman School of Design). While global events like this often spotlight political leaders, nongovernmental organizations and research institutions like Penn also play a key role in sharing knowledge and lending legitimacy to the negotiations, says Weisberg, who is also director of postgraduate programs at PWH. 'One thing of great importance that university researchers can do,' he adds, 'is to be there at the right moment to offer their expertise to the governments and civil society organizations trying to solve the climate crisis.' Adapting to a changing world Despite efforts to limit emissions, increased incidence of droughts, wildfires, floods, and extreme weather events around the world show that the effects of climate change are here and unavoidable. This reality made adaptation one of the most pressing issues at this year's COP and stoked an urgent need for solutions, says Melissa Brown Goodall, senior director of the Environmental Innovations Initiative in Penn's Office of the Provost. Adaptation strategies won't look the same around the world, and they'll require specific expertise to tailor them to each environment and circumstances. 'The adaptation narrative is particularly important to Penn,' Goodall says, because multiple centers at the University focus on adaptation research. For instance, climate change threatens global food supply chains, requiring a holistic solution that considers the welfare of animals, people, and the environment to prevent future food shortages. That was the subject of an address by Andrew Hoffman, the Gilbert S. Kahn Dean of Veterinary Medicine at Penn Vet, at the Nairobi Work Programme Focal Point Forum, which focused on agricultural adaptation and food security. We're taking our research and bringing it to bear on what's happening within the venue. But we're also learning while we're there and bringing those new ideas and relationships back onto campus. Cornelia Colijn, executive director of the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy and one of two heads of Penn's delegation Specifically, it provided an opportunity for researchers and delegates to interface and discuss how countries will ensure their food systems remain resilient in the face of a changing climate. Under Hoffman's leadership, Penn Vet opened its Center for Stewardship Agriculture and Food Security earlier this month, a research hub for issues of agricultural adaptation that aims to promote responsible use of natural resources in agriculture. Eugenie Birch, the Lawrence C. Nussdorf Professor of Urban Research in the Weitzman School and co-director of Penn IUR, joined the launch of several campaigns on urban adaptation. One, called 'Roofs Over Our Heads,' is an effort to publicize and address the needs of informal settlements, led by PWH visiting fellow Sheela Patel. Another looks at ways to finance projects to beat urban heat; visiting scholar and former mayor of Quito, Ecuador, Mauricio Rodas, who is now affiliated with the Kleinman Center, PWH, and Penn IUR, is a key leader on this work. Other engagements of Birch's included those focused on integrated urban development in 20 cities, resilient food initiatives, technology transfer, and urban resilience. Beyond that, she attended the first COP urban ministerial meeting as a partner and stakeholder for a project called 'Sustainable Urban Resilience for the Next Generation' and participated in a process that summarizes for lawmakers the highly technical Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings. 'They translated those findings into this simple, hopeful message: 'Cities are hotspots of global climate emissions and risk, but they are also hubs for innovation, action, and resilience,'' Birch explains. 'It's up to us to plan and implement climate-resilient cities around the world.' Mitigating emissions Dealing with climate change isn't just about adapting to a new world; there are still ways to mitigate the problems that emerge in a warmer planet and to thwart further warming. The latest IPCC report states that to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels, countries need to cut their emissions in half by the end of 2030 and implement sustainable alternatives. At COP27 , Colijn shared the Kleinman Center's research on climate mitigation with global decision-makers. In addition to the talks and negotiations, COP27 featured many art installations drawing attention to the climate crisis, like this panda bear made from plastic waste. (Image: AP Photo/Thomas Hartwell) Every year, the Kleinman Center releases policy digests on climate issues from renewable energy sources for water-stressed regions to the influence of the Inflation Reduction Act on mining rare earth elements, the minerals used to produce wind turbines and electric vehicles. Through the conference, the center has had the chance to 'connect those policy digests to people who can use them,' Colijn says. Sharing tools like these, which include policy suggestions and outcomes, at a place like COP is essential to accomplishing the Kleinman Center's mission of a just energy transition, she adds. 'COP really acts as a platform for deepening our policy engagement in this multilateral space.' Financing climate solutions Without financial backing, conversations around mitigation and adaptation are sure to stall, Weisberg says. 'To have any hope of keeping global warming below 1.5-degreeC, the entire global economy will have to realign with the goals of the Paris Agreement,' he says. Developed countries set a target of $ 100 billion in climate financing every year from 2020 to 2025; at COP27 , one big aim was to close the existing gap in funding arrangements, as the world has not yet mobilized that funding. For the first time in the history of Penn's COP involvement, Penn students got to join the delegation on the ground. This semester, William Burke-White, a professor at Penn Carey Law and the inaugural director of PWH, co-taught a course on subnational climate adaptation finance with Rodas. The professors brought 10 students to Egypt to observe the finance negotiations in real time. 'There is nowhere better to be these two weeks if you want to learn about climate change than in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt,' says Burke-White. 'It's at the heart of the action.' The law students spent their semester studying how subnational actors-cities and states-receive climate financing after the U.N. negotiations distribute funds to countries. During the second week of the conference, they observed negotiations and developed a white paper to inform future finance negotiations. They are also each writing blog posts that will appear on the Kleinman Center site. Hannah Sachs, a graduate student earning a joint JD and Master in Social Policy from Penn's School of Social Policy Practice, co-wrote one about private finance for the world's most vulnerable cities. Sachs says traveling to COP27 offered an unparalleled learning experience: 'Attending COP in person allows a much more in-depth understanding of both the substance and dynamics of the negotiations.' Loss and damage Even with the efforts to adjust to climate change impacts, some of its effects are unavoidable. Colijn says one of the biggest issues at COP this year was the topic of loss and damage, which refers to the financial burdens caused by extreme and irreversible climate change circumstances. This issue of financial arrangements for addressing loss and damage isn't a new one, but this was the first time it appeared on the agenda as a formal negotiating topic. In an episode of its podcast 'Energy Policy Now,' the Kleinman Center covered loss and damage at COP27 , one of a series of audio dispatches produced to highlight the conference. Podcast host Andy Stone and PWH Lightning Scholar Stacy-ann Robinson discussed why loss and damage is such a critical matter, especially for small island states ill-equipped to financially recover from the destruction of extreme weather events. The Republic of Maldives is one island nation vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Weisberg and Zeid Ra£d Al Hussein, a PWH Professor of Practice of Law and Human Rights, joined the delegation for the Maldives, assisting during its negotiations and providing high-level policy advice and strategy. 'Michael and Zeid have provided invaluable support to the Maldives climate team since COP26,' says Aminath Shauna, Maldives' Minister of Environment, Climate Change, and Technology. 'Their technical guidance and knowledge, drawn from their vast experience in the fields of politics and international multilateral systems, helped us enormously.' Two days after the conference was originally supposed to end, the parties at COP 27 reached an agreement-what's been described as a 'landmark deal'-on loss and damage. It establishes funding for particularly vulnerable developing countries to aid in their response to global warming's biggest challenges. Many of the agreement's details will get firmed up in the months to come, including which countries will finance this and which will benefit from it. A year-round commitment Though the U.N. climate change conference has concluded, the conversations that took place during those two weeks will influence Penn for the entire year to come. 'COP is a process and an event-but the work doesn't just happen in two weeks,' Weisberg says. The priorities countries raise at COP27 will continue to guide research directions at Penn, he adds, and the relationships built in Egypt will form the foundation for future climate negotiations. 'The transfer of knowledge goes both ways,' Colijn adds. 'We're taking our research and bringing it to bear on what's happening within the venue. But we're also learning while we're there and bringing those new ideas and relationships back onto campus.' Representatives from Penn at COP27 included the following: From the School of Arts Sciences: Michael Weisberg, the Bess W. Heyman President's Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy, and Santiago Cunial, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science.

The PM\' s spokesman said he was not aware of the Prime Minister and Mr Johnson  doing anything jointly together on the climate, nor does it seem likely that Mr Sunak could offer his former Downing Street neighbour a lift to Egypt to reduce their carbon footprint. Last Friday Mr Sunak said he was  focusing on the depressing domestic challenges we have with the economy as he explained why he would not attend the summit.  I think that\' s what people watching would reasonably expect me to be doing as well, he said. Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Sunak had agreed to go  to avoid embarrassment not to provide leadership and seized on his change in language, saying:  The guy is a phoney. Cop27 by the torrent of disbelief that he would fail to turn up, Mr Miliband added.  Yet again we see a Prime Minister who only makes decisions for reasons of political management not the national interest. The key day for world leaders is Monday, when high-level talks are scheduled, and US President Joe Biden is expected to attend. COMMENT BY STEPH SPYRORishi Sunak confirmed he will take time from dealing with the country\' s  depressing domestic challenges to travel to Egypt for the United Nations Climate Change Conference . As one Government source put it, it was only a matter of time before the new Prime Minister  read the room and showed up at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh. Activists and green officials heaped pressure on Mr Sunak to attend and showcase Britain as a world-leader in the fight against climate change. But the biggest blow came when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed his appearance at the summit, prompting Mr Sunak to leave the Autumn Statement planning in the safe hands of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt Activists hope Mr Sunak has realised that what happens at this summit will have just as much of an impact on Britain as discussions taking place from Downing Street ahead of the November 17 Autumn statement. Record-breaking temperatures and a lack of rainfall this year has plunged swathes of the country into drought. Several major storms have battered the UK over the past year, with some of the highest wind speeds recorded in over 30 years. Mr Sunak now has the opportunity to understand the full extent of the harm caused by the climate crisis, and promote Britain\' s race for cheap and clean renewable energy. The Prime Minister said he would attend COP27 to  deliver on Glasgow\' s legacy of building a secure and sustainable future. But the UK government has work to do to rebuild its climate reputation after a year of rowing back on commitments. The PM quashed plans to revive fracking which was a good start to his time in No. 10 but eyes will now turn to delivering on commitments to help communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis The hope is that he will take to the world stage and advocate for proper support for the world\' s most vulnerable, and highlight the UK\' s drive to keep 1.5C alive.

Project leader Dr Boroka Bo, from the Department of Sociology at the University of Essex, said: -While many of us knew our coast is home to the UK-s largest protected area for native oysters, with oyster farming sustaining our communities since the Roman times, what most oyster consumers don't realize is that oysters also protect our community from coastal erosion and floods. -In addition to being ecosystem engineers by creating natural storm barriers, an adult oyster can filter almost 190 litres of water per day. By doing this, oysters remove pollutants from our water and protect us from harmful algal blooms. -We are thrilled that our session at COP27 will give our team the chance to share our collaboration with Colchester Council to build a circular economy around oyster shells.

The growing participation of the IAEA and the nuclear community reflects of changing attitudes to nuclear energy as the climate crisis worsens. Over the past five decades nuclear energy has avoided the release of more than 70 gigatons of carbon dioxide, and today globally, more than 400 reactors produce about a quarter of the world's low-carbon energy. Nuclear's comeback At the opening of the nuclear pavilion, Mr Grossi announced a new IAEA Atoms for Net Zero Initiative. 'Increasingly states with little to no nuclear experience approach us for guidance on meeting their climate goals with nuclear energy, this new initiative is aimed at supporting them and ensuring no one is left behind in climate solutions,' he said. The Director General took part in numerous events at the conference, including leading a panel on Affordability, Resilience and Security of Energy Supply. There, Mr Grossi shared the stage with International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Secretary Fatih Birol, who said that, 'Nuclear power is making a comeback-and in a strong fashion.' Mr Birol has in the past expressed that in addressing the climate crisis, nuclear power can play a role in the countries where it is accepted to address both energy security and climate. In June, the IEA released a report identifying the potential policy, regulatory and market changes that could create new investment opportunities for nuclear, and explored the role of new technologies and their potential development and deployment. At COP27 , Mr Grossi engaged with young nuclear activists, saying he was inspired by their efforts to change skeptics' minds with science and facts. On Thursday - the COP's Youth and Future Generations Day - Mr Grossi joined a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field, to hear their thoughts and take their advice on avenues to pursue more inclusive climate action. 'The IAEA works with the young generation, works with a new generation of scientists and technologies so that they have the opportunities to work together to face these problems, to provide the necessary solutions,' Mr Grossi said. As part of United Nations Climate Change's official programme, Mr Grossi took part in the event 'Interplay of low carbon technologies for resilient net zero energy systems', where he joined the heads of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). All three emphasized that decarbonizing energy systems to achieve net-zero carbon emission targets will require utilizing all low-carbon technologies, including nuclear energy. UNECE is supporting policy makers in making informed energy decisions to achieve climate goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development through a new Carbon Neutrality Toolkit, said UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova. 'Given the enormous challenges faced by our society to avoid a climate disaster and the urgency and scale of the challenge, we need the full deployment of all reliable and carbon-free sources of energy,' added UNIDO Director General Gerd Muller. Engaging decision makers The United Nations conference attracts governmental leaders from both the energy and the environment arenas. Mr Grossi met with China's Special Envoy Xie Zhenhua and Vice Minister of Ecology and Environment Zhao Yingmin, to discuss small modular reactors, nuclear safety and waste solutions, and nuclear's role in addressing climate change. China is a major producer of nuclear energy with 55 nuclear power reactors in operation and another 18 under construction. Mr Grossi also met with Ghana's Minister of Energy Matthew Opoku Prempeh to discuss IAEA support to the country as it considers nuclear power, and UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Grant Shapps on the use of nuclear technologies and science in climate adaptation. With Cuba's Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Elba Rosa Perez Montoya, Mr Grossi agreed to closer cooperation in addressing cancer care access in the country and tackling marine plastic pollution. Next year's COP will be held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Mr Grossi met with the country's Director General for the conference, Majid Al Suwaidi. He said he looked forward to working more closely with the UAE in showing the importance of nuclear science and applications is addressing climate change. The UAE is the first Arab country with an operating nuclear power plant. Mr Grossi held meetings with United Nations organization heads, including World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas with whom he discussed climate adaptation and cooperation on energy infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather events, and UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova to exchange on nuclear energy's role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions targets. He also met with European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) President Odile Renaud-Basso to discuss energy policy, energy decarbonization and joint activities on Ukraine's nuclear facilities, including Chornobyl where the IAEA and EBRD are working with the country's authorities towards safe and cost-effective solutions to decommission the nuclear power plant and manage radioactive waste in the Exclusion Zone.

The PM's predecessor Liz Truss had been planning to go to the UN summit in November. Mr Sunak pulled out because of ""domestic commitments"" ahead of the Autumn Budget on November 17. Green groups have written to Sunak uging him to take planet-saving decisions. Ms Truss, angered green campaigners with her ""attack on nature"", including a return to fracking. In their letter to Mr Sunak, the groups said: ""As members of the UK's environmental movement, on behalf of our eight million members, we ask you to make the right choice. Please honour the 2019 pledge for environmental ambition, green jobs and a sustainable economy. y ""Set aside misguided plans for deregulation for deregulation's sake and an old-fashioned fossil fuel, extractive economy Instead, please focus on implementing bold and popular plans for thriving wildlife, unpolluted air and water, resource efficiency, and regenerative agriculture.

Sunak took to Twitter to reveal his plans after criticism from climate activists and within the government from Indian-origin COP27 President Alok Sharma, who said it was important for the prime minister to be present to show the UK's commitment on the issue of climate action. The pressure mounted further as his ex-boss, former prime minister Boris Johnson, confirmed that he would be attending the summit scheduled between November 6 and 18. ""There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change, tweeted Sunak. ""There is no energy security without investing in renewables. That is why I will attend COP27 next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future,"" he said, with reference to the COP26 summit chaired by the UK in Scotland last November. The Opposition Labour Party described the reversed decision to attend as Sunak being ""dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing; embarrassing"". The Green Party called it a ""screeching U-turn"" and ""an embarrassing mis-step on the world stage"" to initially announce plans not to attend. Earlier this week, Downing Street said Sunak's attendance at the summit was under review as progress was being made with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on the preparation of a crucial economic statement scheduled for November 17. Many world leaders, including US President Joe Biden and France's Emmanuel Macron, are due to go to the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). India's Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav will lead an 18-member delegation at COP 27 , with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance yet to be confirmed. King Charles III, a passionate climate campaigner who will not be attending, is to host a COP27 pre-summit reception for world leaders at Buckingham Palace on Friday.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK63","-EIB at COP27: Financing a global just transition to climate neutrality","November 4, 2022 Friday","ENP Newswire","The EIB is set to step up its support for decarbonisation projects across the world. The Bank will present a framework to support environmental sustainability projects. The EIB boosts clean energy financing in support of REPowerEU Plan. New partnerships will be unveiled to finance climate action and environmental sustainability projects. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group will convey the urgency of mobilising massive resources for global warming mitigation and adaptation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. The EU bank will affirm its unwavering commitment to deploying its full range of financial tools in support of the swift decarbonisation of our economies. The EIB Group (European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund) will launch new initiatives under its Climate Bank Roadmap, supporting a just transition to climate neutrality globally, and a framework to promote environmental sustainability. In addition, the EIB will team up with partners to announce new green financing projects and initiatives. EIB President Werner Hoyer commented: 'Russia's war against Ukraine is a catastrophic human tragedy. It has also exposed the world's vulnerability and dependence on fossil fuels. Decarbonisation has now become a prerequisite not just for saving the planet from climate disaster, but also for energy security and safeguarding cohesion at a global level. This is why our response to the crisis must focus on renewables, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies that will power sectors such as heavy industry, shipping and aviation. I therefore call on the COP27 conference to put partnerships to support new technologies at the centre of its discussions. The EIB stands ready to work with all our partners to finance the green solutions of the future.' EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle added: 'To meet the Paris goals we must halve global emissions by 2030. To do so, we must get climate finance right and make sure we support those countries and communities that find it hardest to make the green transition a success. At COP27 , the EIB will report progress on the implementation of its Climate Bank Roadmap and launch new initiatives to support environmental sustainability. Through our dedicated arm for operations outside the European Union, EIB Global, we are stepping up our efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa.' EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said: 'We have worked closely with Egypt as the incoming COP27 Presidency to deliver a successful outcome of the United Nations climate conference in Sharm El Sheikh. The EIB has worked with Egypt since 1979. We will continue our partnership to support the country's ambitious National Climate Change Strategy 2050, including investments in energy, transportation, agriculture and water resources.' The EIB boosts clean energy financing in support of REPowerEU Plan The EIB Group will support the European Commission REPowerEU Plan with an additional EUR30 billion in loans and equity financing over the next five years. The additional funds from the EIB Group will be directed to renewables, energy efficiency, grids and storage, electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, and breakthrough technologies, such as low-carbon hydrogen. The package of new, targeted financing approved by the EIB's Board of Directors on 26 October is expected to mobilise up to EUR115 billion of new investment by 2027, thus making a substantial contribution to the REPowerEU objective of ending dependency on Russian fossil fuels. It is a supplementary envelope, on top of the EIB Group's already robust support for the energy sector in the European Union, averaging around EUR10 billion of financing per year over the past decade. Just transition everywhere The EIB pledges to expand its range of financing tools for projects aimed at supporting a just transition to a climate-neutral economy across the world. At COP27 , the EIB will release a statement to offer financing and advisory services in regions that combine carbon-intensive production with socioeconomic fragility. Moreover, in the context of a just resilience strategy, the EIB will pledge to support adaptation actions explicitly addressing the needs of population groups most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Environment framework At COP27 , the EIB will launch its environment framework to support environmental sustainability projects globally, thereby pursuing a green, resilient, equitable and inclusive development approach. The EIB will support operations helping to reduce pollution and protecting health and human well-being, the sustainable use and protection of water resources, and the development of a sustainable blue economy protecting marine and coastal resources. The EIB will also help speed up the shift towards a more circular world and increase its contribution to supporting the reversal of the global trend of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Accelerating gender-smart climate finance The full participation of women as leaders, employees, entrepreneurs and consumers is essential for climate finance to be effective and tackle the climate crisis at the speed and scale necessary. The EIB, together with its partners, will at COP27 call for urgent action to improve gender equality in climate finance. On gender day, 14 November, the EIB will co-host a high-level event with the Council of Europe Development Bank and Hivos to discuss avenues for accelerating gender-smart climate investments, from enhancing access to quality green jobs and leadership opportunities for women to developing inclusive low-carbon infrastructure. The EIB Climate Survey The EIB has launched the fifth edition of the EIB Climate Survey, a thorough assessment of how people feel about climate change. Conducted in partnership with market research firm BVA, the EIB Climate Survey aims to inform the broader debate on attitudes and expectations in terms of climate action. More than 28 000 respondents from the EU27, the United States, China and the United Kingdom participated in the survey in August 2022, with a representative panel of people aged 15 and above for each of the 30 countries polled. In addition, the EIB is supporting a report carried out by Debating Europe/Debating Africa called Securing Our Future: 100 African and European Voices on Climate Change, Conflict and Security. A series of focus groups asked young people across both continents how the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war have affected their perception of threats, as well as the role governments and financial institutions should play in resolving them. The report will be released during the first week of COP27 .

The Fridays for Future founder told an audience at London\' s Royal Festival Hall that she will not be participating in the United Nations HYPERLINK Climate Change Conference in HYPERLINK Egypt this year, as the events were a spectacle that was not  really going to lead to any major changes . Speaking to journalist Samira Ahmed, the 19-year-old was candid, saying that it was  very symbolic that it\' s held in like a tourist paradise in a country that violates many of the basic human rights . Thunberg posted a tweet with a petition against Egypt\' s human rights violations on 20 October, adding that she stood by  in solidarity with prisoners of conscience in the country. She also joined protesters on Saturday (29 October) calling for the release of British-Egyptian blogger Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who has been on hunger strike in prison for the past six months in the north African nation. She went on to say that COP had instead become an opportunity for leaders and people in power to  get attention . This was highlighted in Thunberg\' s keynote address which accused leaders of preferring to  stay in power and serve the forces of rules than to take their responsibility and safeguard present and future existence . NationalWorld attended the event which showcased her new book, looking at the urgency and importance of preventing climate change. She described the writings as  educational and then joked that it was  ironic given her position in the School Strike for Climate action. She added that she believed that  once we fully understand the climate emergency and the consequences of it, then we will know what to do , and that her book was a contribution to that idea. Her publication includes explanatory articles from over 100 climate experts, including renowned climate scientists Katharine Hayhoe and Michael Mann, as well as authors including HYPERLINK /arts-and-culture/books/booker-prize-2021-longlist-announced-full-list-of-13-books-in-contention-for-literary-award-including-kazuo-ishiguro-3324790 Margaret Atwood . Ahead of the event, she said:  I want to use my platform to share the reality of the climate crisis \- to communicate a holistic picture of how the world is changing and what we need to do about it. Asked what she thought about recent protest actions by HYPERLINK https://www.nationalworld.com/topic/just-stop-oil Just Stop Oil activists HYPERLINK /news/uk/what-happened-to-vincent-van-goghs-sunflowers-painting-why-just-stop-oil-activists-threw-tomato-soup-at-it-3880827 Vincent van Gogh\' s \' Sunflowers\' at London\' s National Gallery, Thunberg said:  People are trying to find new methods because we realise that what we have been doing up until now has not done the trick. It\' s only reasonable to expect these kinds of different actions. Given his enormous wealth and power, Ahmed also asked Thunberg what she thought of\~ the likes of Tesla CEO /topic/elon-musk Elon Musk , his HYPERLINK purchase of the social media platform Twitter , as well as his plans to send a SpaceX Starship rocket to space instead of using the money towards climate change action. Thunberg responded that perhaps Musk should  stay grounded longer than travelling in space . And he wasn\' t the only mogul mentioned. Former US President HYPERLINK /topic/donald-trump Donald Trump has in the past been known to make disparaging remarks about Thunberg, including posting memes mocking the teen environmentalist. In response to a question about how she deals with this, Thunberg ridiculed him, saying that he was  useful as she ended up sharing those same memes with her friends when communicating and taking credit for it. In the end, Thunberg said that while there are many individuals including politicians who are trying to help in the fight against climate change, their actions were not going far enough. Even though she said she would never be a politician herself, the teenager said if it was up to her, she would  leave the table and say this is not working anymore . The book therefore catalogues ways to combat climate change with concrete examples.\~ Thunberg called for more people to get involved in climate activism, saying the time had come for  drastic changes to the status quo.  In order to change things, we need everyone \- we need billions of activists, she said. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK67","Our planet is still in the emergency room, says DR LAURENCE WAINWRIGHT","November 20, 2022 Sunday 4:31 PM GMT","Express Online","Efforts to address climate change consist of two different yet interconnected parts: adaptation, and mitigation. Adaptation is about countries, cities, organisations and individuals taking practical steps to deal with the consequences of the human-induced climatic change that has already taken place, as well as that which is coming. Related articles For instance, the NHS adapting to deal with the public health consequences posed by longer, hotter summers. Or a less-developed country improving its infrastructure to deal with the more frequent and intense storms. COP27 The most significant development was the establishment of a so-called loss and damages scheme, whereby richer, more developed, countries assist less developed countries that are being badly affected by climate change \- and lack the means to manage on their own. The rationale here is that because developed countries like the UK have been responsible for most of the emissions which have caused the warming so far, they should have to compensate other countries for these  adverse effects . The wording of the final agreement was vague, and there is much detail to be decided in subsequent discussions and at COP28. There are complex ethical and philosophical dimensions to this debate \- and significant ambiguity in terms of how the system will work in practice. Mitigation refers to steps towards reducing the emissions which are causing climate change. This means weaning ourselves off non-renewable energy sources \- particularly coal and oil - and onto ones that have minimal or no emissions. The wind turbines jotted along the coastline of Britain are perhaps the most visible sign of progress. However, we also need to think about other areas. For instance, the cultivation of cattle for the pub lunch roast many of us enjoy has significant emissions associated with it. COP27 scores a D for mitigation.

And ahead of COP27 - the United Nations Climate Change Conference that starts on 6 November - we now call for action alongside the others in CEO Climate Leaders with an open letter. What CEO Climate Leaders ask for When it comes to the private sector, Scania and our allies call on others to: Set science-based targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Collaborate within and across sectors and value chains to drive transparency, advocacy and action in alliances and initiatives. Contribute to the development of internationally harmonised reporting standards. With COP27 just around the corner, the participating leaders at the conference have the chance to make a historic turning point towards cleaner, more affordable and secure energy and food systems. We think governments need to: Set bold ambitions and follow through on commitments. Accelerate the transition. The decade of action This is the decade of action, so we must all work side-by side with governments to scale up in the drive to net zero. Representatives from CEO Climate Leaders, and also from Scania will be present in Egypt during COP27 to discuss with world leaders, government officials and civil society representatives how, together, we can take positive action to tackle the climate crisis. We and our allies encourage all business leaders to set science-based targets to halve global emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 at the latest. The global impact on food and energy prices notably due to the war in Ukraine continues to hurt households, businesses and economies worldwide. The crisis is a stark reminder of the fragile nature of the current energy and food systems, which are still dominated by fossil fuels.

My daily newspaper featured it every day and Channel 4 News reported similarly. And as the conference ended, the outcomes, or lack of them are clear. Little commitment from the worst fossil fuel polluters, and although a Loss and Damage Fund has been opened in favour of the most vulnerable countries, cheques hitting the mat are conspicuous by their absence. This begs the question, given no grand plan to postpone the end of the world as we know it, what are we, individually and collectively going to do about it? We could do worse than cease to be indignant about the suggested Cambridge congestion charge. As Martin Cooper's complaint was lack of news, he might criticise the Ely Standard and The Hunts Post's reporting of the Greater Cambridge Partnership proposal, which, as far as I can see, has somewhat lacked editorial balance. I believe the proposed charge is but one element of a plan which is, at this stage, a consultation. An implementation date, if a charge is ever applied would not be until be 2027/28 and in any case, would be part of a substantive series of public transport improvement measures. And yet the tenor of the responses, as reflected by your reporting and in correspondence, is 'they can't do that to me'. Echoes of COP 27 . Worth noting perhaps is that between 28,000 and 36,000 UK deaths annually are attributed to polluted air. I wonder if we killed that many on our roads what we would say? (It's about 1600 p/a, in case anyone asks). Anecdotally, I did drive into Cambridge on a Sunday a week or so back to drop someone at the station but I could have been forgiven for thinking it was Monday morning rush hour. My passenger had to walk the last half mile for fear of missing his train. A central Cambridge location I visit routinely was, last week when I checked, exceeding three WHO air quality measures. I accept this is far from empirical research but it's also worth noting the reduction in energy consumption since prices have skyrocketed. Maybe it's a blunt instrument but pain in the purse or wallet is a powerful deterrent. I wholly accept that for some, being able to drive into Cambridge is more than just a convenience. But as constraints on ways of life we have enjoyed to date become inevitably greater, maybe it's beholden on all of us to be part of the solution. COP28 take note. Peter D Harvey, Ely \"

While some parts of the continent are gripped by drought, places such as South Sudan and my homeland, Nigeria, are experiencing devastating flash floods that sweep away homes, businesses and livelihoods. And https://www.interregional.com/en/growing-risks/ up to 116 million Africans will face severe risks from rising sea levels this decade. As we approach the United Nations climate change conference , Cop27 The pre- Cop27 event I attended in October in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) put a spotlight on Africa\' s specific climate vulnerabilities. But delegates also focused on the vast opportunities that ambitious joint climate action could create to drive progress across the sustainable development goals (SDGs). And so they should. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country brimming with immense potential and innovative climate solutions. It is home to most of the world\' s second-largest rainforest, and has major deposits of cobalt, copper and aluminium \- the minerals required for the key transformations we need for renewable energy and digital economies. The Congo basin has the ability to absorb around 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year \- 4% of global emissions. However, African nations cannot fight the climate crisis, protect their rich rainforests and safeguard their biodiversity alone. The international community must stand in solidarity with Africa and help to provide the significant resources needed. Africa requires $2.8tn by 2030 to play its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C and to address the impacts of climate change. Yet the whole continent received HYPERLINK https://techeconomy.ng/2022/06/africa-requires-2-8-trillion-climate-finance-investments-by-2030/ only $30bn of global climate finance in 2020. Ministers at the pre-Cop meeting in DRC made it clear that African countries need finance urgently to build resilience and adapt to the devastating impacts of a crisis they did nothing to cause. They called on developed countries to deliver on their promises, starting with the pledge made at last year\' s Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow to double adaptation finance to at least $40bn annually. The failure of developed countries to honour their commitments is not just an injustice and a failure of global solidarity. It contributes to the serious tensions and divisions that are preventing global action on a host of other issues, from peace and security to human rights. As the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu said:  Exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice. African countries need support from both public and private sources of finance, especially from the multilateral development banks. Vulnerable countries cannot make the shift to renewables and provide access to energy for all unless these banks overhaul their operating models. Governments are their shareholders and must use their influence to get the banks to step up. Many developing countries, including 15 in Africa, are heading into our current cost of living crisis while facing debt distress or default. They need fiscal space to invest in climate action and the SDGs. While some countries need comprehensive assistance to restructure their debt, the international community should also look at innovative solutions, including debt-for-climate adaptation and debt-for-nature swaps. The renewables revolution on the African continent will fail unless it expands access to energy. Some 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity. Achieving universal access will require massive investment in renewables, creating millions of jobs and driving economic development and prosperity. But it cannot add to the debt burden of African countries. African countries need a new generation of partnerships with donors, multilateral development banks and private financiers. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships \- with a focus on phasing out coal and speeding up the deployment of renewables \- are one innovative model. Climate action and the renewables revolution are not luxuries or add-on extras on the African continent. They are indivisible from building peace, security, stability and prosperity. The DRC itself has endured nearly three decades of conflict and fragility, and up to 5,000 children become soldiers each year. In DRC and elsewhere, climate change is exacerbating conflict by causing flooding, deforestation and drought, deepening poverty and competition for resources. I was encouraged by the frank dialogue between governments in Kinshasa. This is crucial to building trust \- a prerequisite for joint climate action. But much more is needed to turn these murmurs of solidarity into gusting winds of change. The people of Africa need action. At Cop27 and beyond, they need concrete plans to deliver finance at scale, ensure a just transition to renewables, build climate resilience and address the loss and damage caused by this crisis.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK75","Cop27 in Egypt: What is it and what is the agenda?","October 26, 2022 Wednesday 4:15 PM GMT","thetimes.co.uk","Egypt\' s most glamorous resort is playing host to delegates from nearly 200 countries as they strive to chart a course to avert climate catastrophe  against a background of natural disasters and abnormal weather events. What is Cop27 The 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference follows last year\' s event in Glasgow and comes after a year of record-breaking floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Europe and Hurricane Ian across North America. The Cop, which stands for  conference of the parties , is an annual gathering of every nation that has signed up to the UN\' s climate change treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). When is Cop27 The event started in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh on November 6 and will run until November 18. The conference began with a world leaders\' summit, which will be followed by discussions on topics such as climate finance, decarbonisation, climate change adaptation and agriculture. The second week is expected to cover gender, water and biodiversity. Who will attend Cop27 ? More than 120 heads of state are attending, including HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/joe-biden President Biden . This year\' s meeting will attempt to capitalise on promises made during Cop26, which took place in Glasgow last year. Cop meetings are regularly attended by heads of state but there has been a concern in Westminster about allowing the King to make his first trip as monarch to a non-Commonwealth country. When she was prime minister Liz Truss HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/liz-truss-advised-king-charles-to-stay-away-from-cop27-climate-summit-573sg09tm advised Charles , a passionate environmental campaigner, to stay away. The move is understood to have irritated John Kerry, Biden\' s special envoy on climate, who had hoped HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/prince-charles the King would be able to use his  leverage to make further progress on the agreement reached at the previous meeting in Glasgow. Rishi Sunak first indicated he would not attend the summit, preferring instead to focus on domestic issues, then changed his mind. What will happen at Cop27 ? At meetings over the two weeks, decisions negotiated between countries will attempt to find a way to honour targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep warming below 1.5C and  well below 2C at worst. HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/cop26 Cop26 countries made a commitment to upgrade their emissions plan this year, to put the world back on track for the 1.5C goal. However, recent analysis has shown we are on course for between 2.4C and 2.8C because new plans by countries have been too weak. What will be the hot topics? Cop27 is likely to have a lower profile but is still seen as key to persuading more G20 countries, which release about 80 per cent of emissions, to issue more ambitious climate plans. Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam are among those that have yet to do so. The EU is hoping to upgrade its target of a 55 per cent cut by 2030 on 1990 levels, although it is unclear when it will do so. Unfulfilled commitments on cash for developing countries look likely to continue to plague negotiations. A recent report by Canada and Germany showed that rich countries have failed to deliver on their decade-old promise to deliver $100 billion to poorer countries by 2020. Despite the overdue money, countries at Cop27 will need to attempt progress with talks on what a new finance goal looks like for beyond 2025. Another major issue will be  loss and damage , or the idea of richer countries compensating poorer ones for the impacts of climate change, such as Pakistan\' s floods. At Cop26, the US and other high income countries resisted the idea of creating a loss and damage fund, but agreed to further talks on the subject. The topic of adapting to climate change is also expected to feature more prominently than at previous summits. Adaptation is important to the Egyptian hosts, who will want to make tangible progress on a new global goal on adaptation. What metric to pick for measuring adaptation is tricky, which is some observers think another money goal will be picked. What are the expectations for Cop27 ? This was always going to be a minor event compared to Glasgow, which coincided with deadlines set by the landmark Paris Agreement. But despite being overshadowed by inflation and war in Ukraine, some observers think the meeting can still achieve progress. What do political leaders say?  The planet has become a world of suffering, President Sisi of Egypt said as he opened the event. However, he added that there were rays of hope.  Every government knows what it must do. The sombre tone was in stark contrast to Boris Johnson\' s upbeat speech at Glasgow last year, which combined James Bond references with talk of jobs from a green industrial revolution. What might be achieved? Progress on the four main issues  cutting emissions, adaptation to a warming world, finance from rich to poor countries and the idea of compensation for climate impacts  is likely to be modest. The UK believes Cop27 could be considered a success if countries agree the principles for a new global goal on adaptation  which is a key Glasgow promise  scaling up adaptation finance and plotting a way forward for countries to produce new emissions plans before 2030. What are the potential flashpoints? The biggest topic dictating success or failure is whether there\' s any agreement on the idea of  loss and damage . This is the principle that rich countries which have driven the most warming to date HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-gavin-williamson-cop-27-egypt-latest-news-k9nbt83xw should compensate poorer ones for climate impacts such as Pakistan\' s floods. Egyptian diplomats say they are  sparing no effort to ensure progress. The issue was adopted for the summit\' s official agenda but with a deadline of 2024. Compensation and liability are not on the table during the talks, just further cooperation on the principle. Isn\' t there a problem with past promises on money? Mistrust has been stoked by continued failure on a 2009 promise by rich countries to give $100 billion a year to poorer countries by 2020, to cope with climate change. Just $83 billion was given in 2020, and the totemic $100 billion is not expected to be met until next year.  They [rich countries] come into this Cop, having apologised last year, with nothing in hand. Rich nations have not fulfilled their obligations, said Tasneem Essop, of the Climate Action Network International, an alliance of 1,800 civil society groups. Nations at Cop27 also need to lay the groundwork for a new, post-2025 equivalent of the $100 billion goal. What can we expect this week? Today we\' ll get the first findings of a group of experts commissioned by the UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres to ensure corporate net zero targets don\' t amount to greenwashing. On Thursday, a new report will give a provisional estimate of this year\' s carbon emissions. They should be falling fast to meet the world\' s 1.5C climate target but last year increased by 5.4 per cent as economies bounced back from Covid-19 restrictions. Will Cop27 Not singlehandedly. Only 24 of nearly 200 countries delivered a new emissions plan after promising to do so in Glasgow. Collectively, the plans would lead to 2.4C of warming by 2100. Such a high level would result in much more frequent and intense extreme weather events than the floods, fires and drought the world is facing at today\' s 1.1C of warming. A good outcome at Cop27 would include a path for countries to upgrade their 2030 emissions plans. What might the final deal look like? Guterres wants a  climate solidarity pact which would commit countries to bolster their plans to curb emissions by 2030, plus more money transferred from rich to poor countries to speed up the switch to renewable energy. Even if the final outcome is weak, and despite what one UN official called the  notable absences of China, India and Australia\' s heads of state, the presence of key leaders at Cop27 , including Biden, Sunak and President Macron of France, sends an important signal to businesses to stay the course on reaching net zero emissions by 2050. What impact is the geopolitical climate having? Cop27 is the war in Ukraine, as attempts by European countries to wean themselves off Russian gas have sent gas prices soaring and forced governments to HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/green-power-firms-face-windfall-tax-to-fund-lower-energy-bills-8lf5c5sz8 subsidise energy bills this winter. While there have been some short-term backward steps on climate action, such as the UK government making deals to extend operations at coal power stations, the high price of gas has made low-carbon options look much cheaper. The UK\' s Climate Change Committee said in June that if gas prices remained high, rather than being a 0.5 per cent cost to GDP by 2035, pursuing net zero would now be a 0.5 per cent saving. Since that estimate, gas prices have risen even higher. What is happening away from the formal talks? Cop27 , researchers should also have published their preliminary projection for carbon emissions in 2020. That will give an idea of how fast a post-Covid economic bounce is driving up global emissions, and how difficult it will be to meet the 1.5C goal. Reaching that goal requires a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030, on 2010 levels, which looks a Herculean task. With the Cop being held in Egypt, there will also be heated debates about how much of Africa\' s fossil fuels should be exploited for its future energy needs. Will there be protests? Cop27 is likely to be far more tightly secured and surveilled than in Glasgow last year, when large protests and fringe events received much media coverage. According to Human Rights Watch, Egyptians  live under the harsh authoritarian grip of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and scores of journalists and dissidents have been imprisoned. Such large protests are therefore unlikely to take place this year. At the African Commission on Human and Peoples\' Rights in April it was reported that the authorities delayed or prevented participants from obtaining visas or delayed delivering the badges needed to attend the official summit. However, developing nations hope that HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/egypt Egypt , as a middle-income developing nation and the host, will give a stronger platform to their demands. \"

As the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change marks its 30th anniversary, the impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent over the past year with worsening weather extremes across the world, including in the UK which saw record-breaking heatwaves during the summer. The conference seeks to accelerate global climate action through reducing emissions, increasing adaptation efforts, and improving sufficient funding, while also making sure the transition is just and fair. Dr Rachel James is a climate scientist, focusing on African climate systems and developing climate science to inform and advance climate change policy. Her previous research has been designed to progress international climate policy discussions, including the COP process, and analysed the impacts of global mitigation goals comparing different warming scenarios. Dr James has also looked at how science can support the negative impact, known as 'loss and damage', from climate change. Her wide-ranging expertise will help further relevant meetings and discussions at the gathering. Dr James said: 'With the war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis, it would be easy to lose sight of the importance of climate action. But we can't afford to wait, the urgency of addressing climate change has never been greater. And that's particularly true for African countries, which are projected to experience some of the most damaging impacts of climate change. 'There have already been many devastating extreme weather events in African countries this year - tropical cyclones in Mozambique and Madagascar, flooding across West Africa, and drought in Ethiopia and Uganda. These barely get a mention in the UK news. That's why an Africa-led COP is so important: to highlight the loss and damage associated with climate change, and the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, to adapt to the changes that are already underway, and for action and support to address inevitable loss and damage.' Dr Alix Dietzel is a Senior Lecturer in Climate Justice and Associate Director for Impact and Innovation at the Cabot Institute. Focusing both on global and local climate policy, she is interested in how fair and equitable the response to climate change is and how to ensure a just transition is achieved. Her role at COP27 will be to observe the negotiations and critically reflect on whose voices were heard and whose are left out of the discussion, as well as concentrating on whether topics such as loss and damage and just transition are being given adequate space and time during the negotiations. Dr Dietzel's previous work includes a study into how decisions on just transition are made in Bristol, as well as extensive research on how well the global governance of climate change, including COPs and outcomes like the Paris Agreement, protect human rights and ensure those responsible for climate change do their part to address it. Dr Dietzel said: 'This COP is extremely important for moving forward on a just transition that is socially inclusive and ensuring loss and damage is properly financed. It is increasingly clear the effects of climate change are highly unequal and we have to look to those who have caused the most damage to ensure people are compensated, while also ensuring we move forward on climate change in a fair and inclusive manner at the global and local level.' Dr Colin Nolden works on energy and climate policy across a range of different academic disciplines, including law, geography, engineering and business. His research, which intersects energy demand, markets, and communities, spans governance frameworks to support energy poverty alleviation efforts at a community level to international climate clubs to raise ambition among countries implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change objectives. Dr Nolden said: 'Recent reports by various United Nations bodies indicate the revised Nationally Determined Contributions put forward by the 195 signatories of the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions are still insufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial level. 'As it stands, we are likely to witness warming exceeding 1.5 degrees in this decade, a level beyond which we start significantly increasing the risk of passing irreversible tipping points in the climate system. 'Raising ambition to reduce carbon emissions, and sharing the burden of the rapid transition of our energy, economic, and social systems that such rapid decarbonisation entails, is essential to limit global warming and its detrimental effects, especially among countries least responsible but most affected.' There are also more than 300 other climate scientists and researchers at the University of Bristol who will be following the COP27 proceedings, sharing their expertise and insights with local, national, and international media. Professor Guy Howard, Director of the Cabot Institute and Global Research Chair for Environmental and Infrastructure Resilience, said: 'The world needs to take urgent actions on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow global heating, and to support countries and communities to adapt. Building resilience will be critical given the changes the world is already experiencing. Ensuring that the breadth excellence of the research at Bristol in tackling these issues is visible at COP27 is important in our mission to help solve global crises. As we have observer status with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Alix, Rachel and Colin will have the chance to engage with policy makers and negotiators to help provide them with the best evidence to help inform future actions.'

It was thought King Charles III would deliver a speech at the conference, however it's believed the Prime Minister rejected the idea.

The following is a joint statement from Human Rights Watch and participating groups: On 12 November, for the first time in years, representatives of 12 independent Egyptian, regional, and international human rights organizations met in person in Cairo for a roundtable hosted by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), to discuss opportunities to promote and protect human rights in Egypt in the months and years ahead. Participants in the meeting welcomed the opportunity, made possible by the government's partial easing of restrictions on travel into Egypt for international civil society organizations during the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), to resume in person consultations between partners that should be a routine part of our work. The participants believe that opening civic space and enabling engagement between human rights experts are prerequisites for Egypt to be able to meet the many challenges currently facing the country in the civil, political, economic, social and environmental rights spheres. This is being demonstrated now at COP27 , where the slogan ""No Climate Justice without Human Rights"" has gained currency. We encourage all national, regional, and international actors to support the basic rights and freedoms of people in Egypt. The participants look forward to future constructive engagement with the Egyptian government. We hope that Egypt will soon emerge from the human rights crisis that has undermined essential human interaction and creative collaboration to the detriment of the Egyptian human rights NGOs and the international community. Since the continuing crackdown on human rights organizations intensified after 2013, the Egyptian government has sometimes blocked travel to Egypt for international human rights organizations. During COP27 , a representative of the Danish Institute against Torture was barred from entering Egypt at Cairo International Airport, preventing the organization from participating at the roundtable. Moreover, several leading Egyptian NGO directors and staff remain arbitrarily banned from travel abroad, some stemming from the notorious Case 173 of 2011 (foreign funding case), which continues to impair the free functioning of independent civil society.

T h e A r a b The Arab Weekly WASHINGTON - Egypt, which is hosting the upcoming COP27 climate negotiations, is working on how to include compensation for economic losses due to climate catastrophes on the formal agenda of the November summit, as pressure grows from vulnerable countries to prioritise the issue, the country's special representative of the summit said on Wednesday. Wael Aboulmagd, Egypt's special representative of COP27 , told reporters that the host country is ""putting a lot of effort"" into ensuring that the question of how to compensate countries that have experienced heavy economic loss due to climate catastrophes is prioritised at the forum, which will be held from November 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh. ""We need to find a practical solution that accommodates the various concerns and it's up to us as the incoming presidency, to sort of navigate and finesse this process,"" Aboulmagd told reporters. ""We are inching closer."" Including ""loss and damage"" on the agenda is a complicated task because lower-income and climate-vulnerable countries are seeking compensation for damage from climate-induced extreme weather events while industrialised nations are wary of creating a fund because of the liabilities they may face. Aboulmagd said as the incoming COP president, Egypt needs to ""navigate"" the disparate positions and that it has appointed two ministers to come up with a plan for how to include ""loss and damage"" on COP27 's formal agenda. The two ministers are Germany's special envoy for international climate action, Jennifer Morgan and Chile's environment minister, Maisa Rojas. At last year's COP26 in Glasgow, the United States and the European Union rejected calls for a fund to compensate countries for climate-driven losses. But as different countries grapple with extreme weather this year, pressure is growing for ""loss and damage"" to be prioritised at COP27 . COP27 ""with the seriousness it deserves."" ""At COP 27 we need to work together to show leadership and move forward on addressing this very important issue, particularly when it comes to finding a creative way ... to find financing for countries who are in extreme need to address the immediate losses and damages that wipe out a significant part of their annual GDP,"" Aboulmagd said. \"

The Bank will present a framework to support environmental sustainability projects. The EIB boosts clean energy financing in support of REPowerEU Plan. New partnerships will be unveiled to finance climate action and environmental sustainability projects. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group will convey the urgency of mobilising massive resources for global warming mitigation and adaptation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18November2022. The EU bank will affirm its unwavering commitment to deploying its full range of financial tools in support of the swift decarbonisation of our economies. The EIB Group (European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund) will launch new initiatives under its Climate Bank Roadmap, supporting a just transition to climate neutrality globally, and a framework to promote environmental sustainability. In addition, the EIB will team up with partners to announce new green financing projects and initiatives. EIB President Werner Hoyercommented: ""Russia's war against Ukraine is a catastrophic human tragedy. It has also exposed the world's vulnerability and dependence on fossil fuels. Decarbonisation has now become a prerequisite not just for saving the planet from climate disaster, but also for energy security and safeguarding cohesion at a global level. This is why our response to the crisis must focus on renewables, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies that will power sectors such as heavy industry, shipping and aviation. I therefore call on the COP27 conference to put partnerships to support new technologies at the centre of its discussions. The EIB stands ready to work with all our partners to finance the green solutions of the future."" EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolleadded: ""To meet the Paris goals we must halve global emissions by 2030. To do so, we must get climate finance right and make sure we support those countries and communities that find it hardest to make the green transition a success. At COP27 , the EIB will report progress on the implementation of its Climate Bank Roadmap and launch new initiatives to support environmental sustainability. Through our dedicated arm for operations outside the European Union, EIB Global, we are stepping up our efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa."" EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliottisaid: ""We have worked closely with Egypt as the incoming COP27 Presidency to deliver a successful outcome of the United Nations climate conference in Sharm El Sheikh. The EIB has worked with Egypt since 1979. We will continue our partnership to support the country's ambitious National Climate Change Strategy 2050, including investments in energy, transportation, agriculture and water resources."" The EIB boosts clean energy financing in support of REPowerEU Plan The EIB Group will support the European Commission REPowerEU Plan ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3DsLGJ8 https://bit.ly/3DsLGJ8 ) with an additional EUR30 billion in loans and equity financing over the next five years. The additional funds from the EIB Group will be directed to renewables, energy efficiency, grids and storage, electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, and breakthrough technologies, such as low-carbon hydrogen. The package of new, targeted financing approved by the EIB's Board of Directors on 26 October is expected to mobilise up to EUR115 billion of new investment by 2027, thus making a substantial contribution to the REPowerEU objective of ending dependency on Russian fossil fuels. It is a supplementary envelope, on top of the EIB Group's already robust support for the energy sector in the European Union, averaging around EUR10 billion of financing per year over the past decade. Just transition everywhere The EIB pledges to expand its range of financing tools for projects aimed at supporting a just transition to a climate-neutral economy across the world. At COP27 , the EIB will release a statement to offer financing and advisory services in regions that combine carbon-intensive production with socioeconomic fragility. Moreover, in the context of a just resilience strategy, the EIB will pledge to support adaptation actions explicitly addressing the needs of population groups most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Environment framework At COP27 , the EIB will launch its environment framework to support environmental sustainability projects globally, thereby pursuing a green, resilient, equitable and inclusive development approach. The EIB will support operations helping to reduce pollution and protecting health and human well-being, the sustainable use and protection of water resources, and the development of a sustainable blue economy protecting marine and coastal resources. The EIB will also help speed up the shift towards a more circular world and increase its contribution to supporting the reversal of the global trend of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Accelerating gender-smart climate finance The full participation of women as leaders, employees, entrepreneurs and consumers is essential for climate finance to be effective and tackle the climate crisis at the speed and scale necessary. The EIB, together with its partners, will at COP27 call for urgent action to improve gender equality in climate finance. On gender day, 14 November, the EIB will co-host a high-level event with the Council of Europe Development Bank and Hivos to discuss avenues for accelerating gender-smart climate investments, from enhancing access to quality green jobs and leadership opportunities for women to developing inclusive low-carbon infrastructure. The EIB Climate Survey The EIB has launched the fifth edition of the EIB Climate Survey ( https://bit.ly/3T3Hbua https://bit.ly/3T3Hbua ), a thorough assessment of how people feel about climate change. Conducted in partnership with market research firm BVA, the EIB Climate Survey aims to inform the broader debate on attitudes and expectations in terms of climate action. More than 28000 respondents from the EU27, the United States, China and the United Kingdom participated in the survey in August2022, with a representative panel of people aged 15 and above for each of the 30countries polled.

The Prime Minister plans to unleash a package worth millions of pounds to cement the UK's COP27 legacy before meetings with world leaders in Egypt. Mr Sunak arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh last night for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ahead of talks with the likes of France's Emmanuel Macron. The PM is scheduled to say: ""The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. ""The question today is: Can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. ""By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. ""And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future.That's a legacy we could be proud of."" Mr Sunak will host an event to launch the Forests and Climate Leaders' Partnership, a new group initially comprising of 20 countries. They will meet twice a year to track commitments on the landmark Forests and Land Use declaration - aimed at halting and reversing forest loss by 2030 - that was made at COP26 in Glasgow last year. The UK will also commit \£390million for conservation in the Congo Basin. That is a vital rainforest home to tropical plants and several endangered species, such as mountain gorillas. Mr Sunak is set to confirm \£365million in funding for the Nature, People and Climate Investment Fund, which supports indigenous and local forest communities. He plans to meet Kenya's President William Ruto to commit funding on a number of green investment projects. These will include new solar and geothermal power plants in his country. Mr Sunak will hold a whole series of bilateral meetings, including ones with President Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He will also attend a round-table discussion focused on energy transition partnerships and he will deliver a national statement later in the day setting out all the UK's climate commitments. The Prime Minister's appearance at the summit, which began yesterday, was welcomed after uncertainty over whether or not he would attend. He initially said he would remain in Britain to focus on ""depressing domestic challenges"" ahead of the Autumn Statement due on November 17. But he U-turned last week after pressure from green groups and from his government climate advisers. King Charles, who was a keen advocate for the environment as the Prince of Wales, will not attend the talks after Liz Truss's government blocked him from making the trip. But he hosted a Buckingham Palace reception on Friday to encourage world and business leaders to act on climate change. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, COP26 President Alok Sharma and Environment Secretary Therese Coffey are due to make appearances at the conference before it finishes on November 18. They will play a key role in strengthening the view of the UK's green pledges after a year of rowing back on commitments. Climate campaigners welcomed Mr Sunak's decision last month to reintroduce a ban on fracking after Ms Truss ended the moratorium on shale gas. Many have called on the Government to go further by ending the licensing of new gas and oil projects in the North Sea and rejecting a planning application for a new coal mine in Cumbria. Rachel Kennerley, of Friends of the Earth, said: ""With the climate clock ticking ever closer to midnight, tougher action to slash planet-heating emissions is now more urgent than ever. Rishi Sunak's decision to attend the summit is a welcome step but he must back it up with bold government action. ""This must include rejecting a new coal mine in Cumbria, ending UK funding for a hugely damaging gas project in Mozambique and committing more money to poorer nations on the frontlines of a crisis they have done the least to cause. ""Fast-tracking the transition to a cleaner, greener future will also bring huge benefits for people and the economy - and help to provide long-term solutions to the cost-ofliving and energy crises."" She said Mr Sunak should remove barriers to onshore wind and solar energy. OPINION: PAGE 12 \"

Ambassador Patricia Espinosa, former executive secretary, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  You either get ahead of climate change or you are going to be buried by it. Saudi Arabia is committed to being ahead of it. When you look at many world problems, or potential problems, they have to do with climate change, whether there is not enough food or not enough water. These become sources of conflict and we need to get ahead of this in order to eliminate them and to provide a better future for our children and grandchildren. Adel Al Jubeir, Saudi Arabia\' s Envoy for Climate Affairs  We\' ve been working with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia to establish a regional centre in the middle of Riyadh to advance emissions reduction. It will be a powerful platform to represent regional voices, influencing global narratives and developing a roadmap to lower emissions. HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\' s Minister of Energy  Climate change is real. That\' s why we are here today. It\' s time to stop thinking and start acting. Tourism has a vital role to play within sustainability. Although today our industry represents around only 8% of greenhouse gas emissions, the number of travellers is expected to double by 2013. Which only means that the environmental impact is going to grow. In Saudi Arabia, we have tourism at the forefront of our efforts to diversify our economy . We are developing 10 destinations across 13 different regions. We need to create regenerative tourism and leave those places in a much better place than when we started. Tourism is too big to fail. HRH Princess Haifa bint Muhammad Al Saud, vice minister of tourism for Saudi Arabia  When governments and the private sector work together, we can journey further. Just last month our Voluntary Carbon Market Initiative [where companies buy carbon credits to offset the unavoidable emissions], was the first of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa region and was the largest carbon credit auction in the world: 1.4 million tons of carbon credit offset certificates were sold to 15 Saudi and regional entities.

Delivering Ghana's national statement at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , on Tuesday, 8th November 2022, President Akufo-Addo bemoaned the fact that climate adaptation costs are currently outstripping current international public finance flows. According to the President, ""we must, as a matter of urgency, mobilise and scale up adaptation finance inflows, to ensure that vulnerable countries are able to meet their adaptation needs."" He continued, ""It is critical, in this regard, that the developed world makes good its long-delayed pledge to mobilise and make available one hundred billion dollars ($ 100 billion) annually to the poorer countries to assist in the fight against climate change, and commit, as agreed at COP 26 in Glasgow, to doubling resources for adaptation."" It will be recalled that thirteen (13) years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, the rich nations of the world promised to channel US$ 100 billion a year to developing countries by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change, and mitigate further rises in temperature. President Akufo-Addo noted that extreme climate occurrences, such as severe precipitation and floods, prolonged drought and heat waves are happening all over the world, both in the developed and developing worlds. ""Climate change is a global emergency, and Ghana calls on all Parties to act with equity and a sense of responsibility,"" he said. Africa, for her part, the President stressed, must commit herself to resolve the issue of climate change by implementing ambitious measures within her reach. With Africa's vast land, he stated that Africa has the greatest potential to help decarbonise the world by absorbing carbon dioxide through regenerative agriculture, that requires less fertilisers, and reforestation with strong biodiversity content. ""My government is happy to announce that Ghana is about to launch projects in these areas, which will tackle, at the same time, climate change at global and domestic levels, and social issues, by providing people with dignified and sustainable jobs, and I am also happy to announce that Ghana has launched her Energy Transition Framework, and is co-Chair of the Forest Climate Leaders' Partnership with the United States of America,"" President Akufo-Addo said. As President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, the President expressed delight at the announcement made by the Managing Director of International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, on the operationalisation of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), to help vulnerable countries meet their long-term challenges. In furtherance of this, he called for a ""radical restructuring of the global financial architecture"", as proposed by the African Finance Ministers, to accommodate the demands of the developing world is of urgent necessity, adding that ""it is evident that with these poly-crises that it is not fit for purpose. I also urge those who hold African debt to commit to debt-for-climate swap initiatives."" Whilst urging the world to take a better look at Africa as ""a land of opportunities and growth"", in spite of the dire situation most of the continent finds itself in today, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Akufo-Addo stated that ""as far as adaptation to climate change is concerned, nothing can happen without Africa"". With its vast, arable land, vibrant youth who aspire only to take their rightful place on the global scene, and a deeply rooted sense of innovation, he stated that Africa has a massive role to play. ""It is Ghana's hope that we will leave this Summit with bold and concrete decisions that will help the world tackle its most pressing challenges, help us achieve our climate goals rapidly, and provide the needed development and prosperity for all the peoples of the world. No one will win if Africa loses"", he said. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The Presidency, Republic of Ghana. \"

Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the London-based oil major will carry out several studies to evaluate the technical and commercial feasibility of green hydrogen production in the West African country. Green hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water, powered by renewable energy. BP plans to carry out an initial data collection campaign to assess the suitability of wind and solar resources in Mauritania for large-scale renewable power generation. The agreement, which was signed on Tuesday at a meeting alongside the COP27 climate meeting in Egypt, builds on BP's long-standing relationship with Mauritania. The company and its partners, including the Societe Mauritanienne Des Hydrocarbures, are currently working to complete phase one of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim liquefied natural gas project, approved in 2018. COP27 , otherwise known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, is a global conference at which nations in attendance are expected to demonstrate action towards commitments made under the Paris Agreement in 2015. This year, it is running from the past Sunday to November 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, BP's executive vice president of gas & low carbon energy, expressed her excitement about expanding the company's partnership with Mauritania. ""Together with the Mauritanian government, we will now work to understand how green hydrogen could best be delivered, applying our technical skills and expertise to help unlock the country\' s clean energy potential,"" she argued. For the third quarter ended September 30, BP reported capital expenditure on oil production and operations of GBP1.40 billion, up 27% from GBP1.10 billion a year prior. It also reported capital expenditure on gas of GBP872 million, up 18% from GBP736 million. Meanwhile, capital expenditure on low-carbon energy was considerably reduced, down 74% to GBP86 million, from GBP336 million the year prior. BP shares were trading 1.4% lower at 494.95 pence each in London on Tuesday around midday.

High inflation, soaring energy bills and Russia\' s continuing military aggression against Ukraine have all, understandably, dominated the political agenda in recent weeks. Amid this backdrop, the Cop27 conference risks being overlooked by some, but it will be critical to shaping how we respond to what is, arguably, the most pressing issue of our time. This summer, the Square Mile sweltered in temperatures unlike any seen in its long history. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, devastating floods displaced over 33 million people. We need to act now to tackle climate change. And everyone in society must play their part. The City has a \- well-earned \- reputation as a buzzing financial centre, home to the headquarters of some of the biggest businesses in the world. Read more HYPERLINK https://www.cityam.com/cop27-blog-what-next-for-climate-change/ COP27 blog: what next for climate change? But small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of the City and make up a staggering 98 per cent of all businesses within our boundaries. For the Square Mile to reach net zero by 2040, we need small and medium businesses to be able to reach net zero alongside larger financial institutions. I know that this can feel daunting for firms that don\' t have big teams or budgets to help them navigate the path, especially when there is already an abundance of uncertainty over the future economic climate and the costs of running their business. But there is help out there. The City Corporation funds a programme designed around empowering smaller companies to be able to factor climate action into their forward-planning. We\' ve already had a host of businesses sign up to this, and we want to grow even further. This is a tough time for small businesses, and committing to anything that doesn\' t seem immediately essential can feel impossible. But net zero is not just  nice to do : it\' s a necessity. HYPERLINK https://www.cityam.com/banks-and-lenders-step-in-push-esg-reporting-without-waiting-for-new-laws/ Banks and lenders can step in to push ESG reporting without waiting for new laws Businesses are regularly being asked to demonstrate their environmental credentials when bidding for work or interviewing talented people for jobs. And customers increasingly look at a business\' record on the climate when they part with their hard-earned cash. Rising energy bills are a huge concern for small businesses. Renewables are generally considered to be cheaper and more reliable than oil and gas, which presents yet another reason to get to net zero. The yearly climate conferences will be a checkpoint to assess progress against the targets businesses large and small have set for themselves. At the City Corporation, we\' re working hard to deliver on our Climate Action Strategy \- our plan to reduce emissions, build climate resilience and champion sustainable growth. We have made great progress so far, cutting our annual carbon emissions by 31 per cent since the financial year 2018/19. But there\' s still a way to go to hit our target of achieving net zero in our own operations by 2027. With its roots as an ancient Roman settlement, the City wasn\' t built in a day. Neither will our efforts to become net zero materialise overnight, it requires constant work and commitment to the project.

Pertamina targets New Renewable Energy (NRE) capacity to reach 60GW from solar, hydro, wind power and geothermal, to be able to meet 15 percent market share in 2060,"" the company's President Director and CEO Nicke Widyawati said in a panel discussion of COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, on Sunday (November 6). It also has a battery production capacity of up to 80 GWh, and sales of 800,000 two-wheel electric vehicles with 1.5 TWh charging station in 2060, as well as an increase in hydrogen energy with an optimal capacity of 3 MTPA. Through the development of the green refinery, Pertamina is committed to increasing the production capacity of biofuels from the current 3,000 bpd to 200,000 bpd in 2060 by focusing on hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). We are also targeting to be able to produce up to 600,000 bpd of B30 and A20 by 2060,"" Widyawati noted. Considering Indonesia's potential for large carbon capture storage which is estimated to reach about 80 gigatonnes to 400 gigatonnes of C02, Pertamina is eyeing such potential to be a new business of oil and gas. ""And the majority (of carbon capture storage) are onshore, so we have a competitive advantage compared to other countries in the region,"" she concluded. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP27 Sharm El-Sheikh, Indonesia voiced various actions, strategies, innovations and achievements as a concrete manifestation of leading climate action to prevent global temperature increases. Through soft diplomacy, the Pavilion Indonesia displays the policies and concrete results of previous work, as well as paving the way for future climate ambitions together with relevant parties. ""Multilateral, collective and integrated action is needed as the only way to overcome a real global threat. We must maintain the spirit of collaboration at COP27 ,"" Indonesian Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya stated in her speech at the opening of the Pavilion Indonesia during the COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Sunday. In recent decades, governments have shared climate change responsibilities with academia, business, civil society organizations and others. However, the practice of climate change mitigation and adaptation sometimes experiences challenges and limitations, such as the decision making process influenced by politics as well as disputes due to the priority interests of socio-economy and environment. ""Sometimes this becomes a paradox, a form of discrepancy in social relevance, so that policies are less effective into action. Therefore, joint action on climate change requires leaders to guide action,"" Nurbaya said. Under the theme of Stronger Climate Actions Together, Pavilion Indonesia reflects the mission carried out by Indonesian delegation to take urgent action in combating climate change and its impacts, as mandated by goal number 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Today's engagement forms part of South Africa's preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , which will take place in Sharm El Sheikh from 6 November. President Ramaphosa will travel to the Summit next week as leader of the South African Government delegation. Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership South Africa ahead of COP27 requires a financing package that is aligned to the country's fiscal realities and demands; upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries, and is inclusive and just. The Presidential Climate Commission is focused on creating a social partnership around a just transition; defining a vision for a just transition, and means of achieving that vision, covering the necessary sectoral shifts, technological innovation, employment opportunities, and climate finance, as well as conducting independent analysis into climate change impacts on jobs, the economy, and policy. To these ends, the Commission engages with a wide range of stakeholders, including all spheres of government, business, labour, academia, communities, and civil society.

I have been asked by several constituents to raise this matter in parliament and I was happy to do so. Those affected by pancreatic cancer talk about the failure in our medical system. As wonderful as the NHS is, there is a failure to detect this cancer earlier. I told MPs and the Minister that I was asked to raise the failure to get people to properly understand the symptoms of this cancer. As one of my constituents said: -The clue is in the loo,- which I like as a slogan. In the debate I talked about one of my constituents: a young woman, my age, a mum, businesswoman, super-bright and a cancer survivor who went backwards and forwards to her doctor for five years with symptoms. The cancer was not diagnosed. Her tumour was the size of a walnut and internal. Where there is an internal walnut-sized lump-not lumps on breasts or testicles-we are stuck, and it often goes undetected. Sadly, this means that the stage that people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is incredibly late. The Minister confirmed she would look into the prescribing of Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT) because it can improve quality of life and understands we want to see action. COP27 has been taking place in Egypt. Much of what has happened there has been overshadowed by discussions about countries paying reparations to others because of climate change. I would prefer the focus to be on the UK ensuring our technology and expertise helps to mitigate climate change and lower emissions in other countries. I accept we were the first country to industrialise. However, China has emitted more greenhouse gases in the last eight years than the UK has done since 1750, according to newspaper reports. Today the UK emits less than 1% of the world-s emissions. \"

Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, responsible for the energy portfolio of the world's largest oil exporters, promised a ""surprise"" at the UN conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. He told Energy Voice: ""If you come there, we will have the green initiative and the middle east initiative in tandem with the COP 27 ."" COP27 next month, Saudi Arabia's energy minister responded: ""That will be a surprise for everybody."" Prince Abdulaziz is the fourth son of King Salman and brother of Crown Prince and Saudi prime minister Mohammed bin Salman. With power over the energy portfolio, he is one of the most powerful figures in the world oil market. He added: ""You are more than welcome to come and visit us, we have a gallery and events, it's going to be visited by all those who attend the COP, hopefully, and they will see how much we mean to committed to transitioning and transitioning in our way. ""We will hopefully become a model for how we do the transitioning."" The country is a major player in the OPEC cartel which controls a huge chunk of world oil, but it has been accused of using its immense oil wealth for greenwashing.

The minister's talk was hosted by John Defterios, professor of business, NYU Abu Dhabi and former CNN emerging markets editor, featuring Dr. Angela Wilkinson, secretary general for the World Energy Council. Dr Wilkinson thanked the Scottish Government for being ""such good co-hosts"" and Aberdeen city council ""for their generous support"". Going on to say: ""Aberdeen is the fitting location for us to meet today, a clean and just energy transition is unfolding here in this city. ""Aberdeen is known as the oil and gas capital of Europe and earlier this week Nicola Sturgeon outlined her vision, in this venue, for the city to become the Net Zero capital of the world, calling on more people and communities to play a vital role"" The World Energy Council secretary general explained the event theme of 'Transformational solutions in turbulent times', saying: ""These are painfully challenging times, societies are fearful of the coming months and the risk of the cost of living crisis is increasing in all regions.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK100","STURGEON DISAPPOINTED MORE ACTION NOT TAKEN AT COP27 ON CLIMATE CRISIS","November 20, 2022 Sunday 3:19 PM BST","PA Newswire: Scotland","The Cop27 climate summit should be remembered for a ``breakthrough'' that will help poorer nations facing the worst impacts of climate change, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted. The Scottish First Minister hailed as ``groundbreaking'' the decision to establish a fund for loss and damage - although she said it was ``deeply disappointing'' that this was not matched by further commitments on tackling climate change. She insisted: ``The breakthrough on loss and damage is what I hope Cop27 will be remembered for, and that is a vital step forward for the developing world.'' Her comments came as environmental campaigners here urged the Scottish Government to deliver ``concrete actions at home to get back on track to meeting its climate targets''. Mary Church, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, stated: ``The Scottish Government too must turn its climate leadership on the international stage into concrete actions at home to get back on track to meeting its climate targets. ``It must clarify its position on oil and gas and set an end date for fossil fuels within this decade in order to have any chance of delivering on our fair share of climate action.'' Those comments came as Alok Sharma - who was president of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow - said that hopes of limiting global warming to 1.5C were now ``on life support''. The deal agreed early on Sunday morning in Egypt failed to include measures such as a clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels, Mr Sharma said. Ms Sturgeon added: `` Cop27 has finally seen an acknowledgement by developed countries that the people least responsible for global warming are the ones suffering its worst consequences and that we have an obligation to support those experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis in the here and now. ``The agreement to establish a fund for loss and damage is truly groundbreaking and is a testament to 30 years of hard campaigning by the global south and civil society. ``I am pleased that Scotland, in being the first developed country ever to make a financial contribution, has been able to play a small part in that journey working with others over the last 12 months to build the momentum that has led to today's decision.'' While she stressed ``there remains a lot of detail to be worked out'', Ms Sturgeon insisted that by agreeing to set up such a fund, the summit had ``delivered a real breakthrough for vulnerable and developing countries''. However, the First Minister added: ``It is deeply disappointing that the recognition of loss and damage has not been matched by greater action to prevent a worsening of the climate crisis. ``Keeping 1.5 alive and delivering the fastest possible transition away from fossil fuels is key to preventing greater loss and damage in the future. ``Alongside loss and damage, we needed to see progress on adaptation and mitigation, on the submission of new national contributions, a pathway to 2030 and a strengthening of the language of the Glasgow Pact. ``It is vitally important that countries recommit themselves to doing everything they can to ensure we keep 1.5 alive and to building a coalition ahead of Cop28 that protects and drives progress against any further push back.'' Scottish Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said the Cop27 agreement was ``far too little and far too late''. ``After decades of denial, the first meaningful step has been taken to support those who are suffering the most, although actual funds remain largely empty. ``However, the lack of any 'phase out' or even a 'phase down' of all fossil fuels means that ultimately Cop 27 will be remembered as yet another monumental failure.'' Ms Church, meanwhile, said that securing a loss and damage fund was a ``huge victory for global south countries'', but she questioned whether richer counties in the global north ``will actually stump up the money needed''. Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: ``With no agreement reached to phase out fossil fuels at Cop27 , world leaders have failed to build on the progress achieved in Glasgow last year. ``The serious lack of ambition on cutting emissions means we remain on course to climate catastrophe, undermining the positive outcome that was agreed on loss and damage.'' He added: ``Following the limited outcomes of Cop27 , governments everywhere must redouble their efforts to reduce emissions and take the necessary transformative action to keep warming to below 1.5C. ``Scotland has already led the way on harnessing fossil fuel-free power from renewables but we urgently need to see the same kind of progress on cutting emissions from the way we grow our food and the way we heat our homes.'' end \"

World leaders are set to descend on Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in November for the annual gathering of nations to discuss the global environment. During his time as the\\xC2Prince of Wales, Charles spoke about climate concerns and his desire to create a sustainable world. It was thought King Charles III would deliver a speech at the conference, however reports today said\\xC2the Prime Minister rejected the idea. Ms Truss, who is also unlikely to attend the Sharm el-Sheikh gathering, is said to have objected to the King\\xE2s plans during a personal audience at Buckingham Palace last month. A senior royal insider told\\xC2The Times\\xC2: ""It is no mystery that the King was invited to go there. He had to think very carefully about what steps to take for his first overseas tour, and he is not going to be attending Cop."" The source\\xC2said the decision was made on the government\\xE2s advice and was \\xE2entirely in the spirit of being ever-mindful as King that he acts on government advice\\xE2. A source who knows Charles said he would be \\xE2personally disappointed\\xE2 to miss it and was \\xE2all lined up to go\\xE2, with several engagements planned around his Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) which aims to persuade businesses to invest in environmentally friendly initiatives. The source told The Times: \\xE2The Queen gave an entirely non-political address at Cop last year . . . it sounds like he is not being given the choice. That is an error of judgment on the part of the government. \\xE2It\\xE2s disappointing if people don\\xE2t believe he\\xE2d be able to do that, of course he could. He delivered the Queen\\xE2s speech at the state opening of parliament, rattling off lots of policies that went against his personal beliefs. The decision is likely to fuel tensions between the new prime minister and the new monarch, although a Downing Street source claimed the audience had been cordial and there had \\xE2not been a row\\xE2. The news comes amid suspicion that the government may water down, or abandon, its environmental target to achieve \\xE2net zero\\xE2 by 2050. The COP events are also know as the United Nations Climate Change Conference this year runs between November 6 and 18. At last year's COP26 in Glasgow the then-Prince of Wales gave a speech before urging world leaders to unite together and tackle climate change. As Prince of Wales he delivered the opening speech at Cop21 in Paris in 2015, calling for a \\xE2vast military-style campaign\\xE2 to fight climate change and urging world leaders to commit \\xE2trillions, not billions, of dollars\\xE2. He also played a vital role in convening and encouraging world leaders to sign up to the landmark Paris Climate Agreement at the event. He delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of Cop26 in Glasgow, calling on world leaders to adopt a \\xE2warlike footing\\xE2 to deal with the threat of climate change. In a video address to the conference last year, his mother hailed his work. \\xE2It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William,\\xE2 she said. \\xE2I could not be more proud of them.\\xE2 Reacting to the report Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke said claims that Truss ""ordered"" the\\xC2King\\xC2to stay away are ""simply not true"".

Local artists are showcasing Bristol's passion and wide-ranging expertise to combat climate change with an array of thought-provoking artwork, as the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference progresses. Illustrator and designer Jasmine Thompson has created a series of 20 compelling drawings capturing people's thoughts and experiences of climate change, and their messages to leaders at the conference. The illustrations, commissioned by the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment, draw on feedback from people who visited areas open to the public at COP26 last year, which was hosted by Glasgow in the UK. Conservation, biodiversity, united action, urgency, and including underrepresented voices are among the topics explored. Jasmine, aged 28, from Montpellier, said: 'I enjoy producing art with a positive purpose and this felt like a great opportunity to highlight important issues, which people really care about. 'The climate crisis is hitting home now and we're all becoming more aware and concerned about its far-reaching impact. Younger generations are especially invested in tackling the challenge, as they learn about it at school and are also witnessing it first-hand. I hope the drawings resonate with people of all ages and inspire people to think about the future and what we can do to start making a difference today.' The drawings will be shared digitally during COP27 , which runs until 18 November, on social media under the strapline Every Voice Matters and displayed in the Richmond Building at the Students' Union, open to the public, from 15 until 18 November. Jasmine said: 'I've lived in many different parts of the city over the past 10 years and there's a strong sense of community here - people want to look after the environment and each other. 'I'm pleased with the final outcome. Now it's about focusing the minds of policy makers and empowering everyone to get behind the necessity to adapt and change for a brighter, more sustainable future.' Looking ahead, a painting depicting a futuristic, greener Bristol in the 2030s, having achieved a just and fair transition to a carbon neutral environment and economy, has also been created. Local artist Andy Council painted a verdant scene of the city full of trees and greenery, people walking or cycling, and buildings with solar panels. Andy, aged 48, who has lived in the city for 20 years, said: 'The green transition absolutely needs to happen, so it was great being part of this project. Art has more of an impact on society than people think and I hope, in this case, it helps people take on board a message and get behind the changes. We can all be part of the solution and make little changes, which could be as simple as leaving your car at home and cycling locally and making more sustainable choices with what you eat and how its packaged.' Water fountains and vegetarian food outlets also feature in the uplifting green vision, which was funded by Research England and supported by the Cabot Institute for the Environment and Policy Bristol. The father-of-two, from South Bristol spent a week completing the piece, using spray paints and acrylic. Andy said: 'I wanted it to be really positive and optimistic. My children, aged nine and 14, have been looking at it a lot when I was completing the finishing touches at home, and it has prompted questions. It would be great if it sparks conversations more widely about the challenges climate change is posing and how we can help overcome them by all pulling together.' The painting will be presented to Bristol One City representatives to remind policy makers of the pressing issues and potential solutions and the City Office is exploring ways that it can be displayed in public in future. It was commissioned by Dr Alix Dietzel, Senior Lecturer in Climate Justice and Associate Director for Impact and Innovation at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment, who is attending COP27 which is being hosted by Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. Dr Dietzel said: 'Imagining a just transition, like the one Bristol has set out in its climate plans, can seem quite abstract and far off. In this piece, we wanted to lay out a vision that was clear and hopeful, one that shows Bristol in the midst of a heatwave but ready for it due to careful climate planning. 'There is plenty of greenery around, there are water features, and the city would be quite cool despite the heat. You can see bikes, heat pumps, solar panels and vegetarian food, and most importantly a community meeting which shows the city working together to prepare for heatwaves. At the heart of this vision is hope for a brighter future.' [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk newswire@enpublishing.co.uk \"

Net zero is entirely incompatible with continued investment in fossil fuels, the 17 experts said in a report published at the Cop27 climate conference today.

Recent polling found that eight in ten large businesses across five continents backed regulation of net zero targets.  The problem is that the criteria and benchmarks for these net zero commitments have varying levels of rigour and loopholes wide enough to drive a diesel truck through, Guterres said. Catherine McKenna, chairwoman of the net zero expert group, told The Times that firms could no longer get away with failure to count all emissions, or rely on targets that reduce the intensity of emissions but not the absolute amount.  You need to cover all your emissions, she said.  We\' ve seen a lot of companies are only doing a percentage of their emissions, in particular they\' re not doing emissions across their supply chain. And you need to reduce your actual emissions. While intensity can be an important measure, the planet cares about emissions actually going down.

[But] it\' s really important we move to regulation, she added. The net zero expert group consulted with more than 500 organisations worldwide for the report, which concluded that cheap carbon offsets of the kind employed by some budget airlines should be dropped. Some carbon credits considered  high integrity could still be used in some circumstances, it added. McKenna said that despite her team\' s recommendations on HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hsbc-invested-sustainable-bonds-in-fossil-fueks-8hm2pnvff fossil fuel supply, oil and gas giants had a key role to play in decarbonisation.

The event was aimed to raise awareness about climate change, to put the topic on the public agenda, inspire and encourage youth to find climate solutions. The pre- COP27 debates united about 30 students of International Relations, Economics, and Law faculties from KazGUU University, forming 4 teams to discuss countries\' collaboration, climate change mitigation,\~adaptation\~and sustainable\~finance. Addressing the students, UN Resident Coordinator in Kazakhstan Ms. Michaela Friberg-Storey noted: Today\' s event is a continuation of a good tradition. It\' s time to regain trust and work together constructively to build on Glasgow and deliver a package of concrete outcomes at HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ COP-27 HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ . UN Country Team collaborates with the Government of Kazakhstan in terms of updating NDC for further submission to the Conference of the Parties this year. It won\' t be easy, but scientists say that it is possible-and that each degree matters, each year matters, and each decision matters. In this regard youth is a strong force, which helps us to accelerate the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and make us more accountable. Ms. Kathy Leach, British Ambassador to Kazakhstan said: The Glasgow COP brought together close to 200 countries (including over 120 world leaders) and gave the world the tools needed to keep 1.5C alive. The Glasgow Climate Pact remains the blueprint for accelerating climate action in this critical decade.\~Yet the Pact is simply words on a page without action. This is a pivotal moment to redouble our efforts. Every country must revisit and strengthen their climate change targets. We must also support climate vulnerable countries by making sure commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured, driving real, practical action on the ground. None of this will be possible without mobilising climate finance. We continue to work with countries, international financial institutions and private financial institutions to meet the commitments they have made and help secure greater access to critical finance. Mr. Marco Alberti, Ambassador of Italy to Kazakhstan, said: HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/ COP26 messages were pretty clear: ensuring promises on emissions reductions; delivering for climate vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured; getting finance flowing; working together and continuing to be an inclusive Presidency. This is the very core of the message we would like to deliver to our Egyptian friends. The strapline of COP27 ,  Together for implementation is made up of 2 key words: implementation, which is the common goal we must share to save the planet; and together, which indicates the path we must pace if we want to reach out to that goal. Next month, Egypt will be hosting COP27 \~with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition. Ms. Manal Elsayed Yehia Elshinnawi, Ambassador of Egypt to Kazakhstan, said: Egypt\' s COP27 Presidency believes in the necessity to have inclusive, rules based, ambitious and substantive outcomes, up to the scale of the challenge and reflective to the political will, based on science and guided by principles, building on decisions and commitments from Rio 1992 to Glasgow 2021. Effective implementation requires meaningful and inclusive engagement with all stakeholders. This acquires particular significance in relation to youth, as we live in a world where 52% of its inhabitants are under 30 years old. Youth as well are leading at the frontline of creative and effective solutions that support their local communities and the broader global response to the climate crises. Thus, the incoming Egyptian Presidency is keen to make COP27 a hallmark for youth inclusive and meaningful engagement. Ainur Karbozova, Deputy Chairman of the Board of M. Narikbayev KAZGUU University, commented: Since Kazakhstan joined the UN back in 1992, our country is one of the most active members of the United Nations with all the important political initiatives being put forward from the UN headquarters. The United Nations is a solid supporter of all the reforms in Kazakhstan, but at the same time facilitates successful implementation of SDG Agenda by engaging students to tackle climate change issues as well. We are therefore very thankful of our students having such a unique chance of wearing hats of the global politicians and facing current challenges of humanity. The conference will provide an opportunity for multilateral collaboration between countries to phase out fossil fuels, accelerate the shift to renewables and implement energy efficiency measures to support demand reduction.

Mr Frolick leads SA Parliamentary delegation attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP27 ) currently taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, until 18 November. He was addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting for legislators yesterday organized jointly with the Egyptian House of Representatives in Sharma El-Sheik ""We need to reform multilateral lending institutions and their lending policies. As things stand the current policies have the potential to bind developing countries on the African continent and elsewhere into long term loans that will result in a debt trap for future generations,"" said Mr Frolick, while addressing delegates from more than 150 countries attending the meeting. He called on fellow MPs from developed countries to hold their Executives accountable to honour their commitments made at previous COP conferences. As an example, he emphasized that the current financial package of $ 8.5bn from the US, EU, UK, France and Germany to South Africa consist of 97% loans and only 3% grants. ""This places multilateral support out of reach for most developing countries due to its onerous costs and conditionalities. It will result in making the attainment of the Paris Agreement very difficult and unimplementable,"" said Mr Frolick. The meeting adopted an outcome document that emphasizes the need for concrete action by governments and Parliaments around the world to address the urgency of the climate crisis. Discussions focused, amongst others, on climate action and sustainable development, prioritizing accountability for climate justice and Parliaments' role in sustainably powering our future. In his closing address the Secretary-General of the IPU, Mr. Martin Chungong, made reference to House Chairperson Frolick's input that questioned the speed at which developed countries pass emergency budgets for war but are reluctant to meet their financial commitments to combat climate change.

Local artists are showcasing Bristol's passion and wide-ranging expertise to combat climate change with an array of thought-provoking artwork, as the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference progresses. Illustrator and designer Jasmine Thompson has created a series of 20 compelling drawings capturing people's thoughts and experiences of climate change, and their messages to leaders at the conference. The illustrations, commissioned by the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment, draw on feedback from people who visited areas open to the public at COP26 last year, which was hosted by Glasgow in the UK. Conservation, biodiversity, united action, urgency, and including underrepresented voices are among the topics explored. Jasmine, aged 28, from Montpellier, said: 'I enjoy producing art with a positive purpose and this felt like a great opportunity to highlight important issues, which people really care about. 'The climate crisis is hitting home now and we're all becoming more aware and concerned about its far-reaching impact. Younger generations are especially invested in tackling the challenge, as they learn about it at school and are also witnessing it first-hand. I hope the drawings resonate with people of all ages and inspire people to think about the future and what we can do to start making a difference today.' The drawings will be shared digitally during COP27 , which runs until 18 November, on social media under the strapline Every Voice Matters and displayed in the Richmond Building at the Students' Union, open to the public, from 15 until 18 November. Jasmine said: 'I've lived in many different parts of the city over the past 10 years and there's a strong sense of community here - people want to look after the environment and each other. 'I'm pleased with the final outcome. Now it's about focusing the minds of policy makers and empowering everyone to get behind the necessity to adapt and change for a brighter, more sustainable future.' Looking ahead, a painting depicting a futuristic, greener Bristol in the 2030s, having achieved a just and fair transition to a carbon neutral environment and economy, has also been created. Local artist Andy Council painted a verdant scene of the city full of trees and greenery, people walking or cycling, and buildings with solar panels.

He had intended to deliver a speech at the meeting of world leaders in Egypt. Truss, who is also unlikely to attend the Sharm el-Sheikh gathering, objected to the King\' s plans during a personal audience at Buckingham Palace last month. The decision is likely to fuel tensions between the new prime minister and the new monarch, although a Downing Street source claimed the audience had been cordial and there had  not been a row . The news comes amid suspicion that the government may water down, or abandon, its environmental target to achieve  net zero by 2050. A senior royal source said:  It is no mystery that the King was invited to go there. He had to think very carefully about what steps to take for his first overseas tour, and he is not going to be attending Cop. They said the decision was made on the government\' s advice and was  entirely in the spirit of being ever-mindful as King that he acts on government advice . The 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as Cop27 , will run from November 6 to 18. Charles is still determined to make his presence felt there, and how he will do that is  under active discussion . A senior royal source said:  Just because he is not in physical attendance, that doesn\' t mean His Majesty won\' t find other ways to support it. A source who knows Charles said he would be  personally disappointed to miss it and was  all lined up to go , with several engagements planned around his Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) which aims to persuade businesses to invest in environmentally friendly initiatives. The source said:  The Queen gave an entirely non-political address at Cop last year . . . it sounds like he is not being given the choice. That is an error of judgment on the part of the government.  The King could absolutely go and deliver the government\' s message and give it credibility, given all the kudos he has in that space.  It\' s disappointing if people don\' t believe he\' d be able to do that, of course he could. He delivered the Queen\' s speech at the state opening of parliament, rattling off lots of policies that went against his personal beliefs.  He absolutely can put the government seatbelt on and drive at 30 miles per hour. He has already shown he is more than equal to that task. A government source said:  The palace and the government considered separately, and then agreed jointly, that there might be more suitable options for the King\' s first state visit. The King is respected as a prominent voice on environmental issues and has been campaigning on them for more than 50 years. He delivered the opening speech at Cop21 in Paris in 2015, calling for a  vast military-style campaign to fight climate change and urging world leaders to commit  trillions, not billions, of dollars . He also played a vital role in convening and encouraging world leaders to sign up to the landmark Paris Climate Agreement at the event. He delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of Cop26 in Glasgow, calling on world leaders to adopt a  warlike footing to deal with the threat of climate change. In a video address to the conference last year, his mother hailed his work.  It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William, she said.  I could not be more proud of them. During the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, William delivered a speech after pictures of the planet were projected on to Buckingham Palace.  As I watch those extraordinary images, it does make me think of all the monumental and pioneering work of so many visionary environmentalists that have gone before, he said.  I\' m so proud that my grandfather and my father have been part of those efforts.

In his HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/king-charless-speech-in-full-phjtc3fqd address to the nation and the Commonwealth following the Queen\' s death, the King pledged to  uphold the Constitutional principles at the heart of our nation and to  hold in the greatest respect the precious traditions  and responsibilities of our ... system of parliamentary government . He added that  my life will of course change as I take up my new responsibilities , acknowledging that  it will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the ... issues for which I care so deeply . When heir to the throne, Charles had a history for interfering in government business. Earlier this year he privately criticised the government\' s policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda, calling the practice  appalling . Last month Truss appointed the Conservative MP Chris Skidmore to lead a review of the government\' s net-zero policy. The former energy and climate minister has been given until the end of the year to present his findings to the prime minister. His appointment comes amid concerns that Truss may row back on emission cuts. She has promoted Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has expressed concerns about  climate alarmism , to business secretary. Other ministers, including Suella Braverman, the home secretary, questioned the wisdom of the net-zero goal during the Tory leadership contest. Last month, ministers set out plans to lift the moratorium on fracking, ease planning laws, scrap long-standing environmental regulations on water and chemical pollution and lower the bar for new offshore oil and gas projects. The RSPB described the flurry of announcements as a  full-on attack on the laws that protect nature . However, HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/net-zero-tsar-chris-skidmore-we-wont-ditch-target-cf3rxrnpx The Times last week that he could  100 per cent rule out the prospect of his report recommending that the target of 2050 for reaching net zero be delayed or abandoned. \"

The financing agreements were announced at a ceremony held at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. The funds will go directly to the South African government via its National Treasury. The Treasury described the loans from France's AFD and Germany's KfW as ""highly concessional,"" saying they were substantially cheaper than market borrowing, Reuters reported. AFD's \€ 300mn loan is for 20 years and has a five-year grace period. The interest rate is 3.6%, or six-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) plus 129 basis points (bps), the Treasury said in a statement on November 10. KfW's \€ 300mn loan is also for 20 years and, with a five-year grace period and at 3% interest, or six-month Euribor plus 69 bps. According to the Treasury's statement, the estimated cost for the government of South Africa to raise an equivalent loan today in the market would be around 8.9%. Therefore, replacing market lending with much cheaper concessional loans, allows South Africa to reduce its cost of funding and overall debt burden. ""By lowering debt service costs, the government of South Africa creates more fiscal space for critical social and other priorities,"" the Treasury said. Under President Cyril Ramaphosa, Africa's most industrialised nation has been trying to nurse its public finances back to health after a decade of steep debt accumulation, writes Reuters. South Africa's mid-term budget, presented by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana in October, showed an improved fiscal outlook, with deficits shrinking quicker than before and debt stabilising at a lower level. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK118","Key Cop27 takeaways","November 21, 2022 Monday","The Independent - Daily Edition","There were moments when a final deal at Cop27 looked like it might never happen, but a breakthrough was finally made in Sharm el-Sheikh. The decision was signed off by nearly 200 countries - from the major polluters and emerging economies to small island states - early yesterday morning after a marathon overnight session. Here are some key takeaways from the 12-page agreement: Loss and damage Cop27 reached a historic agreement on a fund to compensate developing countries for losses and damage caused by the climate crisis. These countries, which suffer the most extreme impacts despite small carbon footprints, have called for loss and damage to be addressed for the past 30 years. The issue finally made it into Cop27 negotiations after the Egyptian presidency shepherded it onto the official Sharm agenda. Rich countries, particularly the US, had long opposed a loss and damage fund fearing legal liability for years of spewing out greenhouse gas emissions. But they reversed their stances, leading to the breakthrough on what vulnerable countries see as a central matter of climate justice. The agreement sets up a transitional committee, with representatives from 24 countries, that will establish how the fund should work, and where the money should come from. The group will then present its recommendations at Cop28 in the United Arab Emirates in 2023, with a view to getting the fund up and running. Keeps 1.5C £live' - but barely Despite the progress on loss and damage, Cop27 So in the Glasgow agreement, countries agreed to ""revisit and strengthen"" their 2030 climate plans by the end of 2022. But in the past year, only a limited number have done so. The emissions-reduction plans submitted ahead of Cop27 would take less than 1 per cent off projected global emissions in 2030. Scientists say global emissions must be cut by 43 per cent to hold temperature increases by the end of the decade to remain at 1.5C. A number of ""high ambition"" countries pushed for the final Sharm el-Sheikh agreement to include a reference of the need to peak emissions in 2025 - the deadline for keeping 1.5C ""alive"", according to the latest climate science. However, this failed to make the final text. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, did not mince his words on the outcome. ""Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text,"" he said. Fossil fuels drop out The final Cop27 decision failed to call for the winding down of all fossil fuel use - the primary cause of the global climate crisis -in a major blow to many countries and climate activists. There was a failure to progress from Glasgow, with the Sharm agreement simply repeating the call for ""accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"". The document again called for providing ""targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition"". India, supported by several countries and the European Union, proposed a statement on ""phasing down"" all fossil fuels in the Cop27 agreement. Late on Saturday, the High Ambition coalition made a final push for the Cop27 pact to put the world on a path to phase out all fossil fuels amid strong pushback from countries with economies reliant on oil.

This year\' s UN climate conference ( COP27 ) will take place against a backdrop of global crises.

These compounding crises underscore the urgent need for countries to\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub?utm_medium=redirect&utm_source=vanityurl&utm_campaign=cop27 work together at HYPERLINK COP27 \~to accelerate climate action and rebuild confidence that global, collective action can solve humanity\' s greatest challenges. COP27 takes place in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt from 6-18 November. It\' s essential that decision-makers make progress across six key tasks to advance future international climate action and support: Create a financing mechanism for addressing loss and damage At the closing of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, one of the headline questions centered on how countries would address the need for\~ HYPERLINK finance to address loss and damage Yet due to pushback by developed nations such as the United States and European Union, countries instead agreed to establish the Glasgow Dialogue on Loss and Damage, dedicated to discussing possible funding arrangements and set to run through 2024. The first session of the dialogue kicked off at the UN\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/news/statement-loss-and-damage-takes-center-stage-bonn-climate-talks-concrete-progress-missing climate negotiations in Bonn Developing countries and civil society\~ HYPERLINK https://us.boell.org/en/unpacking-finance-loss-and-damage experts \~counter that existing finance is grossly inadequate, and that loss and damage finance needs are distinct and additional to finance for adaptation, humanitarian assistance or development assistance. At a bare minimum,\~ COP 27 should kickstart a process to formalise funding arrangements to respond to loss and damage under the UNFCCC. At the same time, initiatives beyond the formal UN negotiations must also play a role to meet scale of what is needed. Countries were not originally scheduled to formally discuss funding arrangements for loss and damage at COP27 , but the Group of 77 and China (which essentially includes all developing nations) has requested it be added to the agenda. This will require consensus across all countries, both developed and developing, on the first day of the talks. If countries fail to agree to this agenda item, proceedings at the climate summit could derail right from the start. In some good news, building on HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/insights/cop26-key-outcomes-un-climate-talks-glasgow \~commitments \~made by Scotland and Wallonia (Belgium) and a group of philanthropies during COP26, Denmark\~ HYPERLINK https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6978678225715531776?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6978678225715531776%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BndKXWFguSV%2BPf8tP%2FbwNiw%3D%3D announced \~in September 2022 a pledge of 100 million Danish Krone (approximately US$13 million) for loss and damage. The Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Vulnerable Twenty (V20) Group will also launch a\~ HYPERLINK https://thecvf.org/paymentoverdue crowd-sourcing loss and damage funding campaign \~in early October 2022. These are positive developments that underscore the need to elevate loss and damage at COP27 . In addition to possible discussions about creating funding arrangements to address loss and damage, at COP27 , negotiators are on the hook to operationalise the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage. This network was created in 2019 to provide countries with\~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/santiago-network/about#:~:text=The%20Santiago%20Network%20will%20connect,and%20addressing%20loss%20and%20damage. knowledge and technical assistance COP27 . Scale up support for adaptation As an increasing number of countries finalize their national adaptation plan documents (NAPs) and\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/research/nationally-determined-contributions-enhancing-adaptation-ambition make more detailed, ambitious commitments \~in the adaptation components of their NDCs, the global focus is shifting from planning to implementation  and not a moment too soon. The recent\~ HYPERLINK IPCC report \~noted that intensifying climate change impacts require that adaptation action be sped up and scaled up to adequately address the needs of vulnerable countries and communities. Finance must scale significantly to support adaptation needs. At COP26, developed countries agreed to at least double finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025, which equates to roughly US$40 billion. Many stakeholders are calling for much greater levels of adaptation funding, and for adaptation finance to match that dedicated to curbing emissions (the latest available figures show that adaptation finance only amounts to approximately a third of total climate finance). A HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/finance-usd-100-billion-goal recent report \~from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) shows an increase in adaptation finance from 2019 to 2020 (the most recent year for which data is available) from US$20.3 billion to US$28.6 billion, but such increases will have to continue if the US$40 billion target is to be met and exceeded. At COP27 HYPERLINK locally led adaptation Countries will also be pressed to make progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) in Egypt. Established under\~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf Article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement COP27 will host another of the year\' s four workshops under the work program. During the upcoming GlaSS workshops, countries must focus on making tangible, substantive progress; leaders must ensure that setting an ambitious goal with robust tracking mechanisms is a high priority politically. The GlaSS discussions also provide an opportunity to help advance equitable, locally led adaptation. The GGA could include metrics for tracking progress on locally led adaptation, including to account for quantity and quality of finance reaching local communities. The GlaSS program could also establish common definitions of \' local\' and \' locally led\' , formally recognise the\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/initiatives/locally-led-adaptation/principles-locally-led-adaptation#:~:text=%20Principles%20for%20Locally%20Led%20Adaptation%20%201,can%20be%20accessed%20more%20easily%3A%0ASupporting%20long-term...%20More%20 Principles for Locally Led Adaptation , and ensure local communities and organizations can participate in discussions around the global goal.

Strengthen national emissions-reduction targets HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact-key-outcomes-from-cop26 Glasgow Climate Pact Major emitters that have submitted more ambitious climate plans include India, Australia, Indonesia and Egypt.

By COP27 , all countries, especially major emitters, should strengthen their 2030 emissions targets. These targets also need to be backed by policies  and crucially, investment  to turn them into action. And while there is no room for backsliding on climate commitments, in 2022, some stakeholders\~ HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/orsted-to-use-more-fossil-fuels-as-energy-crisis-continues.html have expressed concern HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/b209933f-df7f-49ae-8f82-edc32ed622a6 more than US$48 billion Time will tell if these investments are a temporary blip or will undermine national climate targets. At the same time, we recognise that Europe is taking unprecedented steps to scale up renewable energy, increase energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption. The UN Climate Change secretariat will publish a report in late October 2022 synthesising the commitments made by countries in NDCs and long-term strategies. Given the lack of progress thus far, the UN report is certain to show a gap between countries\' current emissions targets and trends and the emissions levels needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. The Glasgow Climate Pact established a work program to  urgently scale up mitigation ambition and implementation in this critical decade . Earlier this year, countries began negotiations on how this work program will operate, including its objectives, scope, outcomes, arrangements and timeline. For instance, the work program could aim to set goals in critical sectors for 2030. In Egypt, however, countries will start these negotiations from scratch and are expected to finalise a decision on a work program as one important outcome at COP27 . Climate finance will again be a key topic at COP27 , with a significant number of\~ HYPERLINK scheduled discussions In 2009, developed countries committed to mobilize US$100 billion per year to developing countries to support their climate action. Official UNFCCC and independent reports consistently show that developed countries are missing the US$100-billion-per-year target. For example, a\~ HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/finance-usd-100-billion-goal recent assessment \~from the OECD found that developed countries only mobilized US$83.3 billion of climate finance in 2020. Ahead of COP26, ministers from Germany and Canada presented a Climate Finance Delivery Plan, which detailed the failure of developed countries to meet their commitment and expressed confidence that the US$100 billion would be met in 2023. An update of the Delivery Plan is expected to be released ahead of COP27 and is set to also shed light on progress on the commitment to double adaptation financing by 2025. The delivery of finance is crucial because it is a symbol of global solidarity and an important element to continue building trust in the multilateral system and accelerate climate action in the developing world. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) could also do more with their current capital structure, as called for in the Glasgow Pact, and, more recently, through the Independent Review of the Multilateral Development Banks\' Capital Adequacy Frameworks (initiated by the G20). MDBs continue to be an integral part of the climate finance architecture and must scale up their climate action even further, particularly for adaptation. MDB financing goes beyond  climate finance, so all types of financing they provide must align with global temperature goals and help build climate resilience. COP27 needs to provide certainty around delivery of the US$100 billion by 2023, including by meeting the pledges made in Glasgow to the Adaptation Fund, communicating new and additional pledges to multilateral funds and in bilateral support. COP27 also needs to signal that adaptation grant-based finance will substantially increase since finance for adaptation remains far underfunded in comparison to mitigation. Further provision of public finance, private sector mobilisation, improved access to finance, and debt sustainability will all be key elements of the COP27 discussions aiming to shift the trillions of dollars to close the investment gaps necessary to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries are also preparing to outline a new collective finance goal to go into effect after 2025, with a\~ https://unfccc.int/NCQG series of expert dialogues \~underway. An agreement on the new finance goal is expected in 2024, based upon technical and political dialogues over the next two years, including high-level ministerial discussions. The lessons learned on the provision and mobilization of the $100 billion target are an important marker for issues pertaining to scale, scope, quality and accountability for the new goal, with the potential addition of loss and damage finance as a thematic area. Additionally, in 2021, South Africa announced a\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/insights/top-takeaways-un-world-leaders-summit-cop26 new partnership with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to mobilise US$8.5 billion to support a\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/just-transitions just transition \~to a low-emissions, climate-resilient economy. Turning this announcement into tangible progress requires donor countries to ensure the funding arrangements meet South Africa\' s fiscal needs, and for South Africa to articulate\~ HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/six-month-update-on-progress-in-advancing-the-just-energy-transition-partnership-jetp an investment plan , which is expected to be unveiled by COP27 . COP27 . The Paris Agreement established a\~ HYPERLINK Global Stocktake , a process conducted every five years to assess collective progress toward the Agreement\' s long-term goals. The first Global Stocktake kicked off in 2021 at COP26 and will conclude in 2023 at COP28, to be held in the United Arab Emirates. COP26 opened the first Global Stocktake by calling on countries and non-state actors to submit information that can feed into the process; technical dialogues will continue at COP27 to consider the information collected. This year, new and innovative formats of the Global Stocktake  including a world caf\'e9 set of discussions  allowed for interesting conversations amongst countries, experts and non-state actors. Yet the Global Stocktake will need to spend the next year advancing the technical assessment of collective progress toward the Paris Agreement\' s goals before concluding at COP28 with a political package that will drive forward action. It needs to do so while considering synergies with several of the other dialogues and processes launched at COP26  including discussions on the Global Goal for Adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and the new finance goal  to ensure a cohesive and ambitious response for climate action and support in this critical decade. Ultimately, it is essential that the outcome from the Global Stocktake is politically relevant and not just an information-sharing exercise coupled with vague, unactionable recommendations. COP27 can help in shaping the Stocktake\' s direction by offering the space for countries, experts and non-state actors to develop a common vision. Convert the treasure trove of Glasgow climate commitments into action In Glasgow, governments, businesses and other stakeholders made a number of\~ HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/insights/cop26-key-outcomes-un-climate-talks-glasgow exciting pledges  to curb methane emissions, halt and reverse forest loss, align the finance sector with net zero by 2050, accelerate the phase-out of coal, double 2019 levels of adaptation finance by 2025, scale locally led adaptation, and end international financing for fossil fuels, to name just a few. But these pledges must translate into concrete action; evidence of progress toward lofty targets must become visible. Discussions around accountability are increasingly important as additional pledges are made. At COP27 Earlier this year, the UN Secretary-General appointed a\~ HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/high-level-expert-group High-Level Expert Group on Net-zero Emissions \~from non-state actors to identify strong, clear standards for the growing number of pledges to reach net-zero emissions. This group has been consulting with a wide range of stakeholders, including on how to define net-zero, governance of targets, alignment with shorter-term targets, and just transition plans, among other topics. The group will deliver recommendations to the UN Secretary General later this year, but can and should also elevate conversations of accountability at COP27 . COP27 COP27 may take place against a backdrop of an unsettled world, but it also offers the possibility to foster greater cooperation at a time when the world needs it most. That\' s the potential that leaders, governments and businesses should seize.

And while the world\' s attention is gripped by war in Ukraine, prompting an energy, food and cost-of-living crisis, and other conflicts, Mr Guterres said:  Climate change is on a different timeline and a different scale .  It is the defining issue of our age. It is the central challenge of our century. It is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner. He warned:  Today\' s crises cannot be an excuse for backsliding or greenwashing. The latest round of talks comes amid high geopolitical tensions sparked by Vladimir Putin\' s invasion of Ukraine, worsening extreme weather, and calls for rich nations to provide finance for the loss and damage hitting poor countries as a result of the climate crisis. Leaders including Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi called for an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine as they spoke to the opening ceremony of the summit. HYPERLINK https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/boris-johnson-declares-he-is-the-spirit-of-glasgow-at-cop-27-3908033 Attending a side event at HYPERLINK Cop27 , Boris Johnson warned the fight against climate change had become a  collateral victim of the invasion of Ukraine, with countries questioning the goal of cutting emissions at a time of soaring energy prices. And he warned against the risk that  some people will go weak and wobbly on commitments to cut emissions to zero overall \- known at net zero \- to tackle the crisis. His comments come ahead of Rishi Sunak\' s speech to the conference, which the Prime Minister is attending following what opponents called a  screeching U-turn , having planned to stay home to work on domestic financial issues. Mr Sunak will use his speech to the conference to call for a  global mission for clean growth . He will say it is essential countries stick to commitments made at the Cop26 summit hosted by the UK in Glasgow, if it is to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. At the same time, he will argue that the transition away from fossil fuels has the potential to drive growth and deliver jobs in the new green industries of the future, while cutting off funding for Russia\' s war in Ukraine. But as he passed on the baton to the Egyptians, he faced criticism at home over the Government\' s decision to issue more licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and its continued opposition to new onshore wind. Mr Sunak\' s attendance at the gathering in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh alongside leaders such as US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, marks his first outing on the international stage since becoming Prime Minister last month. In a packed day at the conference, the Prime Minister was holding a series of bilateral meetings, including with Italy\' s new far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen amid ongoing tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, travelling to Egypt with the PM, was due to announce investments worth more than \£3100 million to help developing countries to respond to climate-related disasters and adapt to the impacts of climate change. After wrangling between delegations, the issue of funding for loss and damage from climate change, such as destruction of crops, buildings and infrastructure in poorer countries, is now an item on the official agenda for the talks \- a move supported by the UK. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is also at the talks, said there is an obligation on richer countries that have largely caused climate change to help those suffering the impacts of it. Funding for loss and damage is a key demand for some of the world\' s most vulnerable countries, who are on the frontline of climate impact and yet have done least to cause the crisis, though developed countries have historically been reluctant to discuss it. In a statement as the summit kicked off, the Alliance of Small Island States called for a new loss and damage response fund that is operational by 2024, as well as for emissions to peak and decline immediately and reform of the financial system away from fossil fuels. In his speech to world leaders, Mr Guterres called for action to double support to help poorer countries adapt to climate change, but also for acknowledgement of a  harsh truth that it was not possible to adapt to the growing number of catastrophic events around the world.  The deadly impacts of climate change are here and now. Loss and damage can no longer be swept under the rug. It is a moral imperative, he said, calling for concrete results on the issue at Cop27 . Mr Guterres also called for a pact between developed and developing countries, in which all nations make an extra effort to reduce emissions, richer countries provide financial assistance to help emerging economies speed their own renewable transition, and to end dependence on fossil fuels. He said the United States and China had a particular responsibility to join efforts to make the pact a reality, warning humanity had a choice to  co-operate or perish . \"

The UK is one of the world's most nature-depleted countries, with only just over half of species remaining. Mya-Rose said: ""As someone who's grown up throughout endless COPs, I know as well as anyone the dangers of pledges without real action. ""The stakes couldn't be higher. Look around you.

Mr Thomas said: ""Reversing nature loss by 2030 is in line with Government policy. ""It might sound abstract, but let's remember what it means for our everyday lives - and for our collective future. ""It means healthier farms and food security, new skills and jobs across the board. And it means better health outcomes and a boost for people's wellbeing."" The Daily Express Green Britain Needs You campaign has urged the Government and the public to do their bit to help make space for nature. A survey of 12,000 people released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) yesterday, showed the public sees protecting marine environment as vital. More than eight in 10 regard protecting the oceans from marine litter and plastic pollution as essential. Four in five believe spending time in those environments improves mental health. And more than over half found it a good source of social and family connection. Marine minister Lord Benyon said the Government had championed the goal of safeguarding 30 per cent of the global ocean by 2030, to help conserve marine environments that are ""evidently precious to many"".

Although she has no seat at the top table in Egypt, the First Minister claimed that her government's decision to commit \£32 million for HYPERLINK ""loss and damage"" at last year's Glasgow gathering set an example.

Her intervention came after UK negotiators backed a last-minute agreement HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/11/07/rishi-sunak-news-rishi-sunak-news-gavin-williamson-cop27-latest/ to address loss and damage payments Rishi Sunak, the UK Prime Minister, will appear at the conference on Monday, where he will pledge \£365.5 million for green technology in developing countries. Pakistan is leading a push by developing countries, including Bangladesh and the Maldives, for compensation from richer countries responsible for most of the world\' s pollution. The UK backed the issue being on the Cop27 agenda during two days of negotiations ahead of the Egypt summit and is understood to accept that a deal must be done over the economic cost of climate change, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2050. Ms Sturgeon has faced criticism over her government's record on climate change not matching her rhetoric, with her deputy slashing \£3133 million of energy efficiency funding only days before she flew out to Egypt. But she argued that she and her government had played a crucial role in getting the developed world to sit up and pay heed to calls for them to pay reparations to developing nations that have suffered from the impact of climate change. ""Certainly the action the Scottish Government took at the outset of Cop26 in Glasgow I think has given a real momentum boost to the issue of loss and damage. You'll hear plenty of people not associated with the Scottish Government say that,"" she said. ""It is arguable that it wouldn't be on the agenda this year had we not put such a focus on it in Glasgow, but that's a first step. ""It's really important we keep that momentum going. We'll make further commitments on the part of the Scottish Government to loss and damage funding over the course of this Cop and we're encouraging other governments to step up and do likewise since we did it."" Sturgeon: Obligation on richer countries Ms Sturgeon said Wallonia, in Belgium, and Denmark had also made similar commitments. She said she was European co-chairman of the Under2 coalition, a global network of states, regions and provinces committed to achieving zero emissions. The EU and US blocked a proposal at the Glasgow talks to establish a fund, agreeing instead to a ""dialogue"" without a clear end goal. Over the past month, they have signaled more openness to discussing compensation at Cop27 , but remain wary of creating a fund amid fears of spiralling liabilities. But Ms Sturgeon argued there was an obligation on richer countries that have largely caused climate change to help those suffering the impact of it. ""I think this Cop is an opportunity for the global north and the global south to come together and have a proper, grown-up conversation about how we make progress,"" she said. ""There is an obligation in the spirit of solidarity for the richer countries that have largely caused climate change to now make a big effort to help those dealing with the impacts address that."" \"

Manchester trio will put breakthrough technology to test as part of climate change relay to COP27","October 4, 2022 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Volunteer runners are set to break-in their new and innovative graphene-enhanced trainers to help launch COP27 . Joe Wilson, Nathan Lumb and Dr Paul Wiper were asked to run past their workplace, the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC), based at The University of Manchester, as part of the Running Out of Time event, a 7,000km non-stop relay from Glasgow - which hosted the COP 26 climate change conference - to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, which will stage the follow-up COP 27 summit. The team, named the Graphene Harriers, will set off on their 11 km section at 5.40BST on Monday (3 October). 'Nothing beats running first thing in the morning (even 5am!). It sets the rest of the day in the right path and it's a great feeling, getting your exercise done before most people who are now starting their day,' said Joe Wilson, Reception and Administrative Assistant at the GEIC. The GEIC is a milestone on the Running Out of Time route because of the pioneering applications of the nanomaterial graphene into a diverse range of net zero applications, including sustainable building materials, lightweighting, next-gen battery technologies and improved recyclability of materials. The trio are wearing inov-8 running shoes - featuring award-winning tech developed with the National Graphene Institute at The University of Manchester to improve wear and comfort. This technology has recently been sthortlisted for a national 'Best of the Best' Innovate UK award. Graphene Harriers 1 The team will begin their part of the relay from the graphene-enhanced concrete 'living lab' outside the GEIC, made from emission-busting Concretene, which has shown in trial pours the ability to remove up to 30% of CO2 from floor-slab applications. Nathan Lumb, a project manager who was part of team that raised the PO and wrote the contract for Concretene, agreed: 'It's a good example of GEIC teamwork, and not just those of us running - it's created conversations in the office. It demonstrates the work that we are all doing towards better solutions.' COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, will run from 6 to 18 November.

Egypt is enmeshed in a full-scale human rights crisis, said Hossam Bahgat, a prominent Egyptian human rights activist who says he has been banned from leaving the country since 2016 and has had his assets frozen.  Our current government has one of the worst records of human rights around the world. Rights groups say tens of thousands of government critics including journalists, human rights defenders and activists have been imprisoned under Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who was elected into office in 2014 after a military coup. The rights of freedom of expression in the country are severely repressed and the conditions for those in detention are cruel and inhumane, according to campaigners, while unauthorised protests are banned in the HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/24/egypt-political-prisoners-sissi-fear/  republic of fear.  That is the situation in which HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-crisis Cop is taking place, said Mr Bahgat, the founder and executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, one of the most prestigious rights groups in the country. Mr Bahgat said the group currently has three open criminal lawsuits against its staff that all carry possible prison sentences. Some activists have suggested that the above amounts to a clear set of reasons why HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/egypt-cop27-climate-summit-africa-pakistan-b2216522.html Cop27 should not be taking place on Egyptian soil. The country playing host to a climate summit in which protest traditionally plays a crucial role in pressuring government delegations into action is not only likely to be unproductive but also amounts to greenwashing, they say. Dozens of people were reportedly detained in Cairo last week in connection with calls for protests on 11 November. And United Nations human rights experts warned recently that restrictions against rights defenders had created a  climate of fear for Egyptian civil society organisations to engage visibly at Cop27 . HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/egypt-cop27-cairo-alaa-abdelfattah-sisi-b2205797.html Sanaa Seif , the sister of a British citizen at risk of death on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail, is among those to have described Egypt hosting the summit as a  big mistake. On the flip side, there are those who see the summit as a rare opportunity for the country and its human rights crisis to be propelled into the world spotlight. For many barred from leaving the country, it also offers an opportunity to partake in an international gathering which they are usually unable to attend. A group of Nobel Prize laureates urged world leaders this week to raise the issue of human rights when they travel to Egypt for the summit. Jess Kelly, a British journalist whose human rights defender husband Karim Ennarah is barred from leaving Egypt, said she was hopeful that the renewed focus on the country might offer a window of opportunity for foreign governments to push Cairo to allow Mr Ennarah to travel to the UK. Mr Ennarah, who worked as Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights\' criminal justice director, was arrested along with two of his colleagues after meeting with European diplomats from several countries including the UK and slapped with terrorism-related charges two years ago, before being released but banned from leaving Egypt. Many believe the meeting was the trigger for their detention. Ms Kelly has been campaigning for him to be allowed to travel to London ever since.  Time is slipping by and nothing has changed, she said. Mr Bahgat agreed that Cop27 offered rights defenders an opportunity. He said his organisation was using the summit to call for the release of political prisoners, the unblocking of independent media outlets and websites, and for the participation of civil society in the summit itself. In the run up to the summit there have already been signs of possible progress. In the past year, hundreds of political prisoners have reportedly been HYPERLINK https://www.wsj.com/articles/egypt-released-hundreds-of-political-prisoners-this-year-some-say-they-were-tortured-11665048602 released from Egyptian jails Despite widespread scepticism and speculation as to the government\' s motivations, the move has been tentatively welcomed by some opposition figures. At the same time activists are not holding their breath for systemic reform, and say tens of thousands of people remain in jail and that political arrests have continued. Critics of the Egyptian government who want to attend the Cop27 climate summit still face significant hurdles and risks, they add. Before Cop27 But one Egyptian environmentalist, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns for his safety, said the majority of the accredited groups are close to the government -and none are human rights organisations. Mr Bahgat accused the United Nations of having  washed its hands of the affair by saying the selection process was solely controlled by the host country. The UN Climate Change division said it was committed to ensuring all meetings are inclusive and to providing an opportunity for civil society to participate. It said it was committed to upholding UN values, including human rights. The summit is not open to the general public, but activists could possibly travel to Sharm El Sheikh. The Egyptian government has said it will allow climate activists to protest in a facility  adjacent to the conference centre. But first they have to get there. The road between Cairo and the resort town is subject to multiple security checkpoints even on a normal day, and it remains unclear if activists will be allowed to pass, said the Egyptian environmentalist. Then HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/egypt-cop27-climate-summit-africa-pakistan-b2216522.html hotel prices are also cripplingly expensive for many grassroots organisations.  It\' s a fortress, he said.  It\' s not accessible. HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/egypt-cop27-climate-summit-africa-pakistan-b2216522.html Hosting Cop27 in Egypt, nevertheless presented an opportunity for Egyptian civil society to carve out additional space that hopefully can be maintained beyond the summit, he said. It is also a chance to push for climate justice that incorporates human rights and social justice, he added. Others are concerned about what will happen once the spotlight leaves Egypt.  The fear of reprisals after Cop is very much on everyone\' s mind here, said Mr Bahgat.  We had to make a choice because the alternative would have been to stay silent and not make the best use of this big opportunity that Cop27 presents for us. Egypt\' s chief negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr said the  overwhelming majority of the activists\' accusations were not true and warned that  we should not be mixing different agendas together at Cop27 .  We are there to discuss climate change, he added.  We don\' t go to the Human Rights Council and discuss climate change and stop the human rights agenda discussion because  climate change actions are not happening in other places. \"

DSM has made rapid progress to reduce its GHG emissions during recent years. An initial target to cut total direct emissions from 2016 levels by 30% by 2030 was confirmed in 2019. This was updated to 50% in 2021 and again to 59% in August this year following considerable action and a continuous assessment of DSM's plans to achieve net-zero by 2050 if not sooner. This new target is now validated alongside the plans to achieve it by the SBTi. As part of this ambition, DSM is already aiming to source 100% of its electricity worldwide from renewable sources by 2030. Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze, Co-CEOs of DSM, said: 'It is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5-degreeC but the latest climate science warns we are dangerously close to exceeding that threshold. The urgency for action has been repeated throughout the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 so aligning with the science is the responsibility of all businesses everywhere. As a long-term leader in climate advocacy, we routinely evaluate what DSM can do to go further and faster towards net-zero and this independent validation by the Science Based Targets initiative gives us confidence that we are on the right track.' The SBTi is a collaboration between the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), the CDP and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to drive ambitious corporate climate action. DSM was one of the first companies to align its efforts with the science presented in the IPCC Special Report 'Global Warming of 1.5-degreeC' of 2019 and immediately set a pathway to reach net-zero GHG emissions across its operations and value chains by 2050. DSM's science-based targets are the foundation to achieve this goal, supported by ambitions on renewable electricity and energy efficiency, as well as intense work with key suppliers and customers.

Objections raised to proposed electricity tariff hike Opposition politicians and the country's electricity sector regulator on 30 November raised objections after the cabinet on 29 November approved an increase in electricity tariffs in two stages, in January and June 2023. ""Confusion and contradictions reigned"" on 30 November when the government revealed that the cabinet had approved the two-phase hike in electricity tariffs, privately-owned English-language Daily FT newspaper reported. Electricity regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), said the move was ""illegal"" and made ""without its consent"", the news report noted. The cabinet of ministers has granted approval for the tariff hike ""as the increase made in the recent past is insufficient"" to cover losses made by the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the report added. However, PUCSL chairperson, Janaka Ratnayake, has said that ""no decision has been taken"" regarding the electricity tariff hike yet, according to a report by privately-owned Tamil-language Tamil Mirror newspaper. Parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka, who heads the Parliamentary National Council's sub-committee on identifying short and medium-term programmes related to economic stabilisation, said that if electricity tariffs were increased to cover the CEB's losses, ""businesses could collapse as a result"", privately-owned English-language The Island newspaper reported. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition, Sajith Premadasa, has requested the government not to increase electricity tariffs again, ""at a time when the people of the country are under severe economic pressure"" according to a report on the website of privately-owned Sinhala-language daily Lankadeepa. The developments received widespread and largely factual coverage in several privately-owned English, Sinhala and Tamil-language press outlets. President&#160;Wickremesinghe says COP27 outcome 'discouraging' President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in an official statement said that the outcome of the summit was ""discouraging"". He said that countries had failed to reach a ""collaborative plan"" on climate action. President Wickremesinghe said that the agreements reached at COP27 ""failed to place the nations of the world on a complementary and progressive course of redress"", privately-owned English-language Ceylon Today newspaper reported. Wickremesinghe said that if the countries that can provide effective solutions to climate change do not directly intervene, this could threaten the survival of humanity, state-owned Sinhala-language Dinamina newspaper reported. He also said that the ""biggest obstacles"" to the success of the COP27 conference were ""politicisation"" and ""stagnation"", the news report said. ""The absence of leadership by those countries who were historically accountable for the greatest damage and who are capable of meaningful contributions has stymied the furtherance of climate action,"" Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying in a report by privately-owned English-language Daily Mirror newspaper. The development received prominent and largely factual coverage in state and privately-owned English, Sinhala and Tamil-language press outlets. Headline inflation falls to 61% in Nov 22 ""The annual headline inflation in Colombo district for November fell for the second consecutive month,"" as food prices ""eased off"", Daily Mirror reported, adding that however, ""the prices of services remained rather sticky"". According to the National Consumer Price Index, inflation in November has decreased by 5% compared to October, as per latest data from the statistics department, Lankadeepa reported. The food category contributed 24.8% to November's inflation of 61%, while the non-food category contributed 36.2%, the news report said. Food inflation has dropped to 73.7% in November, compared to 85.6% in October, privately-owned English-language The Morning newspaper reported. Meanwhile, health costs have gone up 5.7%, according to a report by privately-owned English-language online news outlet, EconomyNext.

King Charles is also not attending, though His Majesty will host a gathering of scientific experts at Buckingham Palace in advance of the summit. It is reported that Boris Johnson is planning to attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, thereby drawing even greater attention to the absence of his successor (but one) in Downing Street. Opposition leaders and green activists are predictably fulminating at Mr Sunak's rebuff, accusing him of a ""failure of leadership"" and claiming it demonstrates indifference to globalwarming trends. Their anger will doubtless fuel a further round of brainless protests by those who believe they can save the planet by gluing themselves to a motorway. Mr Sunak's arguments for not attending the summit are perfectly valid. There is to be a critical economic statement on Nov 17. His focus on this underlines its importance to the future of the country and his premiership. Moreover, unlike last year's climate-change gathering in Glasgow, this one is less important, in that specific targets are not due to be agreed. In fact, the reality of these summits could not stand in greater contrast with the self-righteous rhetoric of climate activists. They leave a deep carbon footprint as thousands of delegates travel from across the globe for what look more like jamborees than serious efforts to reduce carbon emissions. If they are so effective, why are we on the 27th meeting with little progress having been made, according to UN climate forecasters? Many world leaders won't be there, but President Biden is going and Emmanuel Macron is likely to, putting more pressure on Mr Sunak to stage a U-turn. He is relying on other ministers to put the UK's case, such as Alok Sharma, the climatechange envoy. However, Mr Sharma has joined the criticism of Mr Sunak's decision, an unwelcome first sign of dissent in the ranks since he entered Downing Street on Tuesday. This will be an early test of Mr Sunak's resolve: can he be pushed into adopting a position he evidently regards as a waste of his time when he has pressing domestic matters to address? If he gives way now, he will look weak, and a good deal of political capital will have been expended on defending his position. \"

Related articles It comes after it emerged that Mr Johnson intends to turn up to the Sharm El-Sheikh summit to keep up the pressure on international leaders to stick to climate change goals. US president Joe Biden is among the key figures also planning to attend. Downing Street sources said the Prime Minister has  not totally closed the door on going to Cop 27  depending on progress but the priority  first and foremost has to be on domestic issues. The source insisted the new PM is  totally relaxed about Mr Johnson\' s plans and  supports him in his intention to attend. Mr Sunak has faced a backlash from environmental campaigners since it was confirmed he will not attend. The Prime Minister remains committed to the government\' s previous commitments on tackling climate change and hosted a finance day at last year\' s summit in Glasgow where he  got a lot of allies on board , sources said. Alok Sharma, the UK president of last year\' s Cop, who was demoted in last week\' s reshuffle, criticised Mr Sunak\' s decision not to attend.

The Levelling Up Secretary said:  When it comes to attendance at Cop, I know that across Government we want to field the strongest possible team at Cop, but there are strong pressures on the Prime Minister\' s diary. Mr Gove also confirmed that he is considering ditching Liz Truss\' s plans for low tax, low regulation investment zones, saying anything that might undermine the environment  is out . He said:  We need to make sure that any change that we make is one which of course helps to support economic growth and good jobs for people, but also one of the concerns raised about investment zones was the impact on the environment.

The 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP27 , will be held from 06 to 18 November 2022 at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Conference Centre. With COP27 taking place in Africa, it presents an opportunity to advance African priority issues, namely. o Recognition of Africa's special needs and circumstances; o Raising the ambitions on mitigation, adaptation and support to developing countries. o Advance financing arrangements for loss and damage. o Build on progress made in Glasgow on the importance of Just Transitions. o Advance discussions on the special needs and circumstance of Africa. The programme for the participation of Heads of State and Government(HOSG) will include an official opening ceremony, high-level round tables, delivery of national statements and high-level side events organised by World Leaders. During the summit, the Government of Egypt will convene 6 high-level Round Tables on Just Transition; Food Security; Innovative Finance and Climate Development; Investing in Future of Energy; Climate Change and Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities and Water Security. These roundtables will be attended by the HOSG, Heads of observer organisations and specially invited guests. President Ramaphosa will on 07 November 2022 Co-Chair the High Level Roundtable on Just Transition, which will allow discussions on innovative approaches to addressing climate change in the context of Just Transition, inspired by the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). President Ramaphosa yesterday during the special sitting of the Presidential Climate Change Commission(PCC) unveiled government's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) outlining government's comprehensive priority investment and financing interventions required to achieve decarbonisation commitments and ensuring an equitable and just transition. On 08th November 2022, the President will deliver a national statement during the high-level segment of the summit. The Summit further provides a platform for discussing how climate actions can be supportive of broader Just Transitions imperatives, highlighting the need for the COP to agree on a Just Transition Financing Framework under the mitigation work programme as a potential model for supporting energy transition in middle income countries. The high-level segment for Heads of State and Government during the summit signifies the importance for World Leaders to implement and transform key climate related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans, continue raising ambition, building up from previous Conference of the Parties, including the Glasgow COP 26 outcomes. The segment also keeps the high level commitment on climate change issues, with an aim to fight back climate emergency and promoting coordinated action to tackle climate change. South Africa's UNFCCC negotiating positions on climate change, are fully aligned to the African common position, as adopted by the African Union's Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).

Unveiled today ahead of the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, the structure also heralded the beginning of an initiative aimed at cleaning the planet for the next 100 years. The massive pyramid took five days to be constructed and was built in Egypt's Western Desert, just outside Cairo. Standing taller than a three-story building, the gargantuan statue is made up of the equivalent of 1 million plastic water bottles and rubbish collected from the Nile River. Related articles The unveiling of this pyramid was accompanied by the beginning of a movement called the 100YR CLEANUP, which is an initiative led by zero-waste company Zero Co and mission-led wine The Hidden Sea. The project aims to fund large-scale rubbish clean-ups for the next 100 years and will look to drive accountability for the global single-use plastic waste crisis. Consumers can look to take part in this initiative by sponsoring the removal of ""bundles of trash"", while businesses can do their bit by contributing funds towards the initiative. Justin Moran, founder of The Hidden Sea, which is a wine company taking plastic out of the ocean every time a bottle is bought, said: ""Despite its epic size, the pyramid shows just a fraction of what is an incredible crisis. ""Powered by wine drinkers, The Hidden Sea has removed 18 million plastic bottles from the ocean so far; this demonstrates that consumers simply need a clear way to be part of the solution. This COP27 , our message is clear. ""It\' s time to draw a line in the sand and change how we manage the crisis. Those who have the ability, have the responsibility."" 100YR CLEANUP founder, Mike Smith, said:  We can\' t fix the plastic problem alone, but we can give everyone the ability to take action. ""By working together with businesses, industry leaders and inviting the public to take direct action, we\' ll be able to build a scalable solution to the problem and have a huge impact."" READ MORE: Climate change is threatening our archaeological record, experts warn The two companies aim to raise a million dollars over the next which they estimate will help remove 15 million water bottles worth of rubbish and drive the initiative\' s mission year on year, for the next 100 years. Mr Smith continued: ""We want to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to experience untouched wilderness in all its powerful forces. Whilst we inherit this planet from our ancestors, we also borrow it from our children."" With sufficient funding, the two companies will build full-time teams in South-East-Asia and Australia, dedicated to cleaning the planet 5 days a week, every week, every year, for the next 100 years.

He is also expected to make decisions on where else to focus his time, with the NHS, schools and crime said to be likely areas, but is holding off from detailed policy decisions until he has spoken to cabinet colleagues. Downing Street sources insisted that he did not have time to go to the climate conference, arguing that it was less important than last year\' s in Glasgow, where countries agreed commitments.  That was a big political Cop where targets are set. That\' s not what this Cop is, said one. Downing Street confirmed for the first time yesterday that the King had been advised by Truss\' s government not to attend the summit.  As is standard practice, government advice was sought and provided under a previous PM, and it was unanimously agreed it would not be the right occasion for the king to visit, a spokeswoman said. Even if the government were to change its mind now, HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/prince-charles Charles would be unlikely to attend in person because of difficulties in making travel arrangements at short notice.

Coffey acknowledged that  King Charles has always taken a very deep interest in the environment and climate change , telling Sky News:  It would be up to him to decide how he chooses where to put his priorities in his reign.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK150","Legal Strategy for Saving the Planet at COP 27","November 7, 2022 Monday","Law.com International (f/k/a Legal Week) Online","As the COP 27 climate conference kicked off in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, pushing an effective plan forward to prevent a further warming of the planet faces headwinds in light of the war in Ukraine and global recession fears. We recently discussed legal challenges and opportunities of the conference with Covington & Burling partner Daniel Feldman, former chief of staff to Secretary John Kerry, when he was appointed the first special presidential envoy for climate by President Joe Biden, as well as Covington senior adviser and former U.K. ambassador to Morocco Thomas Reilly. The interview has been edited for length. The COP27 climate conference is happening at a time of growing global insecurities due to the war in Ukraine as well as global recession fears. Has global climate change moved to the sidelines? Thomas Reilly:\~The Russia-Ukraine war has\~in some ways\~pushed everything else off the front page, but if you look at what happened with the weather across Europe over the summer, and if you look at Pakistan and Nigeria and the terrible floods there, people would probably take issue with saying that the one issue that is in front of us is the Russia-Ukraine war. It certainly preoccupies the West, but I think climate change is still very much on the front page. And\~in\~some respects actually, the Russian-Ukraine war should serve as an impetus to think about how we can accelerate the energy transition because one thing that's become very clear from the Russian-Ukraine war is the overreliance on Russian gas. Indeed, not just on Russian gas, but on gas more generally. If you can use the first war on the European continent in nearly 80 years as an accelerator to think about how you move away from dependence on gas, how you move away from dependence on Russian gas, and about adaptation and mitigation in the developing world, COP27 could be a major lever for progress. The U.N. published a report last week that said we're on target to reach 2.8 degrees Celsius warming by the end of the century. In some respects, the need for action has never been more urgent than it is now. These are already staggering events. The effects of climate change are just going to be devastating. I agree, while there may be a short-term reliance on coal and fossil fuels as an immediate aftereffect of Ukraine, I hope it will serve more to galvanize the global community to really move towards energy security and to accelerate the energy transition over the coming years. In terms of our role, there's a very significant role to be played by the private sector in all of this. The IEA\~estimates\~$4 trillion a year would be needed for the energy transition. No government can do that on its own, there has to be a partnership with the private sector. We help to serve as facilitators and translators between governments\~and the private sector. As the global policy and regulatory environment about climate change starts to be reflected in laws that directly apply to companies, there's a significant role for attorneys like us, especially those\~with\~backgrounds\~of\~working between government and the private sector. There's been a lot of talk about the effectiveness of these conferences. After being actively engaged in last year's COP26, when I was still in government, what I would say is without an annual or regular\~COP\~process we wouldn't have tangible results. It's a critical opportunity for countries to take stock of what's been accomplished and how to continue to ensure that we are actually on a path to net-zero as effectively as possible. The climate finance piece will be important at COP27 , mobilizing the billions of dollars\~needed\~for development country mitigation and adaptation and the trillions that are\~needed\~from the private sector.\~This\~is a very significant component of the relevance of these multilateral convenings. TR: There is a huge amount\~of tension in the world, between Russia and Europe, between the U.S. and China. And actually, the one thing that unites all of those different tension areas is the impact of climate change. There is no country that escaped from it. China's rivers dried up, the U.S. has been subject to forest fires. The U.K. hit 40 degrees, 41 degrees Celsius on one day this year. There is no disagreement that we need to act globally and together to tackle climate change. You could view COP27 as an opportunity to demonstrate that the global community, despite those tensions, is able to face up to the common challenges that, in fact, are uncontentious. We'll probably come to the loss and damages\~question, which is contentious. But the need to address climate change is globally recognized. You could view COP27 as a kind of sheltered island-maybe this is idealistic-where people can agree to address a common problem for the world, leaving aside\~geopolitical tensions. You mentioned the private sector playing a key role in the equation of addressing global climate change. In light of recession fears, inflation and supply chain shortages, how have you addressed the issue of financing the energy transition with your clients? DF:\~There is clearly an enormous commitment by the world's major financial institutions and others to try to align assets and capital with the transition.\~The broader issue is how we help our clients assess legal and regulatory risk and advise on ways that they can mitigate that and, at the same time, make\~a real difference on the climate front. In the U.S., companies see opportunities for climate funding in the Inflation Reduction Act. We are\~actively\~evaluating\~and advising\~what recent\~and potential\~regulatory\~actions\~may mean for our clients, such as\~the\~SEC's proposed climate-related disclosure rules\~in the U.S. or the\~Corporate\~Sustainability\~Reporting\~Directive\~in the EU. What challenges do you anticipate when you're talking with your clients about risk mitigation? DF:\~First of all,\~we're just helping our clients keep\~abreast of the very fluid state of developments and regulatory proposals and their impact. But\~we're\~also assisting clients with policies and plans that help to operationalize their corporate commitments to reduce their carbon footprints and, at the same time, keeping them apprised on developments with carbon pricing mechanisms or taxes and border adjustments. We are also advising\~companies\~on\~greenhouse gas accounting and life-cycle assessment,\~opportunities for\~renewable energy generation,\~and public reporting on sustainability. There's a vast array of questions that are arising given the\~fluidity in this area. Just in the U.S.\~over this year\~we've seen the SEC roll out its draft\~climate-related\~disclosure rules,\~then\~the Supreme Court decision\~in\~West Virginia v. EPA,\~ which will likely constrain some climate-related regulatory actions,\~and then the passage of the Investment Reduction Act,\~the biggest climate legislative package in U.S. history, which\~now companies\~are eager to access. There is a\~lot of\~high\~demand from companies for guidance and counsel as they position themselves with their\~climate\~commitments. TR: There are EU directives on a range of ESG [environmental, social and governance] issues-supply chain, modern slavery, the green deal. There is the EU's corporate sustainability reporting directive, and other nonfinancial reporting directives, there's a plethora of legislation that comes out from the EU. And even some of our really big clients are struggling just to keep up with what is in those directives, what does that mean for them? How do they implement them in a way that is sort of streamlined? What are the tensions between potentially complying with those in the EU or the U.K. or the U.S.? Do you have three different levels of compliance? Do you have one level? Is there an international system of mutual recognition of compliance? Adding to this complexity is the merging phenomenon of activist shareholders. If a company decides that its strategic goals are going to be 50% CO2 emissions reduction by 2025, and it doesn't make it, do they end up in front of court because their activist shareholders\~take\~them\~there? If they're not sufficiently ambitious in their strategic objectives, could they also be taken to court for not being ambitious enough? Companies have to make a really difficult judgment call about how ambitious they need to be in order to keep shareholders happy without being too ambitious and setting unrealistic objectives. Companies are looking at this and trying to work out what does that mean for us? What are the reputational and cost implications of noncompliance? What are the costs of compliance? With regards to mutual recognition, there are a number of different taxonomies in different stages of development around the world. How does a company that is operating in all those jurisdictions comply with the different taxonomy requirements? Just the very process of trying to comply with them is a reporting nightmare for the companies. Trying to help the companies think their way through that maze is really important. You mentioned activist shareholders, has this become more of an issue now than it was maybe five years ago? TR: If you look at the questions asked at annual general meetings (AGM), where there used to be maybe one or two questions on the floor about net-zero and energy transition, now at the same companies' AGMs, you can't really get away from those questions. I think, attitudes are shifting quite quickly and shareholders' demands and expectations reflect that shift in attitude. DF:\~In the U.S. there's clearly much more engagement of shareholders about this-and\~you\~see it on both sides of the equation. You see\~both efforts to drive\~the acceleration on the energy transition, but also increasingly, and it wouldn't surprise me in the new year to see, more shareholder resolutions counter to ESG efforts. That just speaks to the range of stakeholders that are involved. Obviously, there are not only shareholders and investors, but also employees, consumers, communities and so many other\~engaged stakeholders that all feel at this point that they have a very personal stake in this\~climate\~issue and are driving increased shareholder activism. Do political transitions in the U.S. in the midterms and then again in two years with the presidential election, as well as the recent turmoil in U.K. politics, make it harder to strategize and advise clients in this field? There is some significant work that the U.S. has\~accomplished on climate\~since the beginning of the Biden administration, which will be very hard to turn\~the clock\~back on.\~These are significant facts on the ground now in terms of\~the U.S.'s\~NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] that was made last year committing to\~cut U.S.\~emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels.\~And then the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which really helps to drive that and operationalize that\~commitment. Of course, if there's a change in administration in 2024, there may\~be attempts to roll back some of the climate commitments. But I think that the U.S. is\~already\~fairly\~advanced in terms of operationalizing and accelerating its climate commitment, and this has also driven\~recognition around the world\~of\~the importance of this\~energy transition\~shift. If there is a change to Republican control of one or both houses of Congress, we will\~almost\~certainly see more anti-ESG questions coming from Congress, including\~in\~hearings and potential investigations. It's certainly not the easiest time. It's pretty challenging for companies seeking to make long-term investments. We have talked a lot about challenges. Where do you see the opportunities at COP27 ? DF: Just given the scale of the energy transition and the need for acceleration of it, I think there are going to be enormous opportunities for a whole range of companies across many different sectors that will look-as Secretary Kerry likes to say-like the next version of the industrial revolution. We're seeing in the U.S.\~that\~among the top growing jobs in the country are solar panel installers and wind turbine engineers. As the pace and scale\~of the energy transition\~continues, there will be equal opportunities in a whole range of\~industry sectors. But this will be a turbulent area for quite a while given the geopolitical state of the world,\~and\~given pro- and\~anti-ESG pressures\~on companies. TR: I would add hydrogen to that. Hydrogen is a real growth area. I can't see how to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors\~without it. You can't get net-zero by 2050 without considerable volumes of hydrogen. There are huge investment opportunities for energy companies in the energy transition and in the development of the supporting infrastructure. \"

His absence from the international gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh will allow him to focus on 'other pressing domestic commitments', No10 said. The Cop-27 summit is being held between November 6-18 with world leaders expected to attend in the first week. Mr Sunak has unveiled plans for an Autumn budget on November 17 as he seeks to deal with a blackhole in the public finances following recent economic turmoil. Labour accused the PM of a 'massive failure of leadership' and claimed he would now be 'missing in action' on climate issues. Downing Street also confirmed that Mr Sunak had downgraded the status of climate minister Graham Stuart, who will no longer be attending Cabinet. It comes after Alok Sharma, the Cop-26 President, also lost his right to attend Cabinet meetings as part of the new PM's reshuffle this week. Mr Sunak's predecessor as PM, Liz Truss, had been expected to travel to Cop-27 - although she was claimed to have objected to King Charles attending. US President Joe Biden is also reportedly planning to attend. The summit's Egyptian organisers have claimed about 90 heads of state had so far confirmed their attendance. The Red Sea gathering will come 12 months after the UK hosted the Cop-26 summit in Glasgow, which was attended by a string of Cabinet ministers - including Mr Sunak himself as Chancellor. Confirming Mr Sunak won't be attending this year's follow-up summit, a No10 spokeswoman said: 'The PM is not expected to attend Cop27 and this is due to other pressing domestic commitments including preparations for the Autumn budget. 'The UK will be fully represented by other senior ministers as well as the Cop President Alok Sharma.'

However, this year's figures have yet to be published despite it being more than a year since the last statistics were produced.

Speaking at a special event at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 HYPERLINK https://www.spaceforgiants.org Space for Giants , the audience at the Children and Youth Pavilion was warned that no group is more disenfranchised by climate change than young people, and especially the young people of Africa. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who recently left after two terms in office, said:  While there were positive noises made at COP26 last year, it is quite clear that the global community, especially wealthy nations, have taken a step backwards from their commitments. The war in Ukraine has, perversely, incentivised more oil and gas exploration rather than encouraging the transition to renewable, green, energy. Self-preservation stands in the way of saving humanity and saving our children, from the greatest existential crisis in our history.  I have been heartened by the legitimate voices of indignation expressed by the global south at this COP, especially the voices from Africa and those from small island states. There is no group that is more disenfranchised by climate change than young people, and especially the young people of Africa. You can be rightly angry about the futures that are being stolen from you. He stressed that Africa does not need to wait on assistance from the governments of wealthy nations. Rather, he told the audience, the continent can engage directly with companies that control the world\' s trade and drive the consumption that is contributing to a warming planet. He continued:  The restoration and management of Africa\' s great tropical forests, our savannas, our swamps, our mangroves, our coral reefs, and all our natural ecosystems avoid and remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere, helping to combat climate change and the species extinction crisis. And by happy coincidence these interventions create nature-based carbon credits, which are hugely coveted by those who want to offset their emissions. Prof Lee White, Gabon\' s Minister of Water, Forests, the Sea, and Environment, charged with Climate Change, SDGs and Land-use Planning said:  On the African continent, climate change is a question of life and death. Twenty-two million people in Africa risk starving to death because of the change occurring right now. And the science tells us that with all the small commitments being made here we are still heading to a world that is 2.5 degrees warmer, and I would not be surprised if by Dubai we are told it is three degrees. He stressed that Africa could nevertheless be part of the solution to this problem. Gabon is in the process of using its forest conservation to generate carbon credits, because they absorb and store the gases that would otherwise contribute to global warming. Minister White said that his government has as a result calculated that carbon could become as much as 20 per cent of the country\' s economy.  I believe that is the case for many countries in Africa, he told the audience. Dr Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda\' s Minister of Karamoja Affairs, stressed that present CO2 emissions from Africa were negligible but warned  the impacts that we are feeling are so enormous. It is, she said, the  youth who are going to bear the brunt of what it is to come. She continued:  It is the youth who are going to bear the brunt of what is to come. Know that we are doing will affect you and will affect you in future. That is why we need education. We need innovation. And we need a unified voice voice coming from the youth. She called on the young people present to be in vanguard of campaigning for change. But she called them on them to engage with national leaders around policy change rather than seeking solutions that were  unscientific and could disproportionately cause economic strain on people already struggling to survive in countries like Uganda. Professor Foday Jawad, Sierra Leone\' s Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said:  This COP27 summit in Egypt comes in a year when we have seen severe weather extremes, food shortages, fossil fuel price hikes and the rising cost of living. So far this year, Sierra Leone and Africa as a whole has seen floods and storms killing hundreds of people all over the continent. Meanwhile drought has caused famine for millions of people in the whole of Africa. This summit should aim to shift the focus from negotiations and planning to action on the ground. We have been talking too much for far too long. We need action now. He continued:  I see green finance as a driver for the next wave of growth. Africa is blessed with assets that attract green financing and carbon credit is one such asset. For example, Africa as a whole has a long stretch of coastal areas with mar groves, and Sierra Leone does so in particular. Such an asset through green financing can attract millions of dollars. That is why my country intends to introduce a carbon policy to take advantage of such green finance so as to benefit the youth and future generations. At the event, President Kenyatta was announced as the new Climate Change Champion of the Giants Club. The Giants Club brings together the highest levels of leadership across the political, financial, conservation and business spheres to catalyse the protection of Africa\' s most important natural ecosystems for the benefit of humanity and the web of life on which we all depend. The Heads of State of Botswana, Gabon, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda and Uganda are the Presidents of the Giants Club and membership is open to individuals and corporations to ensure the Club is populated by those who can make a profound difference and truly care about the cause. In his capacity as the HYPERLINK https://www.spaceforgiants.org/giants-club Giants Club\' s Climate Change Champion , President Kenyatta will seek to support African governments wishing to put in place the appropriate policy frameworks and transparency to attract transformational carbon finance. It is hoped that this will help drive new investment into protecting Africa\' s nature and biodiversity. Currently the market is able to meet only a fraction of the 2 gigatonnes forecasted to be required by global corporates in order to meet their net-zero targets. President Kenyatta said:  I am proud to have taken on the role of Climate Champion for the Giants Club. Over the next year I will be working to put in place the appropriate policy frameworks and transparency to attract transformational carbon finance. Friends will empower the creation of a new African industry, a green industry, that will not only combat climate change but will also enable a transfer of wealth from the global north to the global south to offset the immorality of climate change. I look forward to working with likeminded partners in rolling out this noble initiative. At COP26 in Glasgow Space for Giants launched a new initiative to build the enabling environment in Africa for nature-based carbon credits in Africa. This has resulted in the creation of a new company, Green 14, which has already built a pipeline of nearly 20 projects, across 8 Africa countries, which would collectively involve the restoration of nearly 100,000 km2 of key ecosystems in partnership with government and local communities. Together these projects will aim to generate more than 100 million tonnes of carbon credits over the next 20 years and tens of thousands of jobs in rural Africa. \"

Ahead of this year-s event, COP27 , here-s everything you need to know. What is COP27 ? COP stands for Conference of Parties and involves the meeting of the 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. COP27 -s goal is to move from negotiations and planning to implementation. When is COP27 ? The conference will begin on Sunday, November 6 and will end on Friday, November 18. COP27 ? COP27 takes place in the green city of Sharm El-Sheikh, in Egypt. Who will be attending COP27 ? COP27 will be attended by a number of politicians across the globe.

However, the Prime Minister could U-turn on his decision if he feels sufficient progress has been made in planning for his highly anticipated autumn budget, No 10 has confirmed. The Scottish Government confirmed that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will be attending the event in Egypt. US President Joe Biden is also expected to attend. What does COP27 hope to achieve? The COP27 website says it hopes to -seek to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance.- It has broken the aims down into 4 sections: Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance and Collaboration. Mitigation involves uniting to limit global warming to well below 2c and work hard to keep the 1.5 c target alive. Adaptation involves adapting so that weather events from heatwaves, floods, forest fires stop becoming an everyday reality of life. Financial goals are important in COP27 in ensuring climate commitments are followed. Finally, Collaboration involves -turn[ing] the Glasgow outcome into action, and commence with its implementation.- You can read the full vision and mission for COP27 on the website here. \"

Developing countries housing forestland, like investors managing it, will naturally look to promote a framework that pays them to not harvest natural resources. For the array of investors on both sides of the GP/LP nexus that have established - or are in the process of establishing - vehicles dedicated to the suite of natural capital markets building out from timber's established role in carbon credit markets, the Sharm El-Sheikh meeting will raise policy questions both specific and general. Potential policy change often lurks somewhere within assumptions about future voluntary and compliance carbon markets, but attributable opinions about which level of government can realistically be expected to regulate carbon in 10 years remain scarce. The COP 27 meeting provides an opportunity to re-examine such projections and gauge how the post-covid call to collective climate action has weathered the events of 2022.

""When corresponding adjustments and national registries come online through Article 6, we are probably going to see a migration towards compliance. Compliance, especially with the Paris Agreement, has tended to signal quality and receive premium pricing.""

Ms Thunberg told listeners: 'Of course it's difficult to talk about these individual decisions because they always have many different factors behind them but the fact that among one of the most powerful people in the world doesn't have time for this, it's very symbolic and says that they may have other priorities. 'Which of course can be understandable, but as long as we use these excuses we won't get anywhere.' Mr Vine referenced reports that former Prime Minister Liz Truss or 'her people' said 'they didn't want King Charles to go to the summit' before asking Ms Thunberg if she thought the Monarch should be there. 'It's a very clear signal that the government has its own agenda and decides who can go and who cannot go because it might damage them or their image,' she replied. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par No10 today admitted Mr Sunak could perform a U-turn by attending the Cop27 summit. The Prime Minister is reconsidering after sparking a backlash by saying he would be too busy assembling the crucial Autumn Statement package in the coming weeks. But Downing Street said 'substantial progress' was being made on the fiscal plans - due to be unveiled on 17 November - and so Mr Sunak's decision to snub Cop-27 was now 'under review'. The renewed possibility of the PM travelling to Egypt comes as his predecessor Boris Johnson considers going to the summit - causing anxiety in No10 about Mr Sunak being outflanked. 'So any attendance at Cop would depend on progress on preparation for that fiscal event, and that work is ongoing. 'The PM fully recognises the importance of the Cop summit and is fully committed to addressing climate change.' It was earlier reported that Rishi Sunak is standing by predecessor Liz Truss's decision to stop King Charles from attending the Cop 27 climate summit in Egypt next month, despite him 'champing at the bit' to go. Mr Sunak has been accused of a 'massive failure of leadership' after himself deciding not take part in the event, despite Truss having planned to travel to represent the UK there. Critics say it calls the new PM's climate stance into question. The PM is reportedly under pressure to let the King attend and allies have suggested he should let Charles go to demonstrate the UK's commitment to combating climate change in his absence. A source told the newspaper: 'He will be champing at the bit but knows it would need government blessing. The PM has reversed the fracking decision so this could be another smart environmentally focused move.' Ms Thunberg herself said on Sunday she will skip next month's COP27 talks in Egypt, slamming the global summit as a forum for 'greenwashing'. 'I'm not going to COP27 for many reasons, but the space for civil society this year is extremely limited,' she said during a question and answer at the launch of her latest book at London's Southbank Centre. The 19-year-old activist had previously expressed solidarity on Twitter with 'prisoners of conscience' being held in Egypt ahead of the UN's 27th conference on climate, opening in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on November 6. 'The COPs are mainly used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing,' she said. The COP conferences, she added, £re not really meant to change the whole system', but instead encourage gradual progress. 'So as it is, the COPs are not really working, unless of course we use them as an opportunity to mobilise.' Released on Thursday, Thunberg's 'The Climate Book' includes about 100 contributions from various experts, including economist Thomas Piketty, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and the writer Naomi Klein. Thunberg's royalties for the book will go to her eponymous foundation, which will distribute them to charitable organisations working on environmental issues. The activist said she wanted the book to 'be educational, which is a bit ironic since my thing is school strikes', referring to her protests in front of the Swedish parliament starting in 2018. Ms Thunberg also publicised her book as she appeared on the Jeremy Vine show today. She also told the radio show she doesn't plan to stop protesting on climate change - as well as saying the reason she started was because she was 'very worried hardly anyone seemed to be reacting'. She said she couldn't understand why people could continue living their lives as usual. The activist told Jeremy Vine she didn't expect things to 'blow up' when she first began speaking out. She also claimed on the show she didn't have any school friends because she was a 'nerd' and said she was ignored by teachers. 'I would be sitting there reading by myself,' she said, adding: 'I was very invisible, it's a very big contrast [to how well known she is now.]' \"

These additional funds will cover the costs of an emergency response to food insecurity as well as those generated by inflationary pressures, due in part to the Ukrainian crisis and insecurity. The project activities target the poor and vulnerable, including women, young people, and internally displaced persons. 'These additional resources will increase the number of households receiving direct cash transfers from about 40,000 to 193,000 households, and will help alleviate the food insecurity they face,' says Clara De Sousa, World Bank Country Director for Mali. She specifies that in addition 'with women playing a dominant role in subsistence farming and in the sale of processed foods in rural and urban markets, the households headed by them and women farmers will be targeted to amplify the benefits of the project.' With these additional funds, PDAZAM will be able to assist a larger number of eligible recipients in the intervention area, i.e., the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Segou, Mopti, and elsewhere in the event of a food crisis declaration. The rapid spread of food insecurity across the country has led to the emergence of affected areas needing support. These additional funds, provided a few days after the launch of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, address the World Bank's objectives of strengthening the production and resilience of food systems, facilitating trade, developing inclusive value chains, and supporting vulnerable households and producers.

The Egyptian diplomat and minister of foreign affairs has come under fire for insisting Cop27 should focus on climate and not on the jailed hunger striker Alaa Abdel Fattah, saying, ""Other issues that are not directly pertaining to the climate might detract from the issue and, potentially, give justification to those who would prefer to concentrate on other issues to avoid having to deal with what they need to do."" Mia Mottley The Barbadian prime minister Mottley made waves at Cop26 for her no-nonsense speech, in which she condemned the failure to provide critical finance to vulnerable countries, claiming the inaction would be ""measured in lives and livelihoods"".

Less than a month later, Shell sent shockwaves through the industry by announcing it would be pulling out of Cambo, and for a while it looked like the project had no future. But a bounce back in the oil price, as well as Westminster's focus on energy security, gave the oilfield legs again.

Maybe they have other, more immediate or pressing concerns, but I am surprised a few didn't use the platform to give high profile to electrification and sustainability strategies. The IEA estimates that transport as a whole accounts for 38% of end-use carbon emissions and road transport accounts for the majority of that. There's a pretty positive story around how the transport industry - which we all depend on - is dealing with that. Progress in developing zero emission vehicles and getting them to market in volume is one obvious highlight. There are also a whole bunch of less obvious sustainability initiatives going on of course, right across the automotive value chain from raw materials through manufacturing and to retail and the final product offering. Occasionally, something pops out from a less obvious source. For example, there are the huge data centres that companies operate these days. As data needs and volumes proliferate, the computing power and equipment to serve growing data processing needs gets greater, as do the energy requirements. Volkswagen Group has announced its goal of making its data centre operations net carbon-neutral by 2027. To achieve this goal, the group has expanded its computing capacities at Green Mountain, a Norwegian operator of CO2-neutral data centres. By leaning on Norway, with its hydro-electric power strengths, VW can take a lot of CO2 out - it claims annual CO2 savings of 10,000 tons. Not bad going. VW Group aims for carbon-neutral data centres by 2027 Volvo Cars seemed to be one of the few car companies at COP27 . Volvo Cars used the occasion to has announce it is joining the Accelerating to Zero Coalition, which consists of a broad group of stakeholders committed to facilitating and increasing the pace of the transition to zero emission mobility. The car company is calling for more climate action from governments. It's not exactly turkeys voting for Christmas, but a cynic might say that the Scandinavian brand's core values fit the COP27 vibe better than those of most car companies.

Elected governments set the tone but cannot be expected to drive change on the scale required. There is one group of people we should be focusing on more than ministers: engineers. As National Engineering Day has highlighted this week, they design and make things, solve problems and shape the world around us for the better. There can be no greater recent example than the development of the Covid-19 vaccines. Although climate change presents a different set of challenges, the stakes are just as high. We have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at scale and at speed, and change the way we live our lives. If we accept that climate change is the most pressing problem of today, we must accept that the solution lies in engineering, not rhetoric. We need practical solutions to a practical problem.

HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/19/five-crucial-issues-in-fight-to-save-planet-and-what-cop27-did-about-them There were hopes Cop27 would lead to new commitments on emissions reduction, renewed commitments for the transfer of resources to the developing world, strong signals for a transition away from fossil fuels, and the establishment of a loss and damage fund. By any estimation, the big breakthrough of Cop27 was the agreement to HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-20/cop27-accord-overdue-climate-fund-approved/101675524 establish a fund for loss and damage. This would involve wealthy nations compensating developing states for the effects of climate change, especially droughts, floods, cyclones and other disasters. Most analysts have been quick to point out there's still a lot yet to clarify in terms of donors, recipients or rules of accessing this fund. It's not clear where funds will actually come from, or whether countries such as HYPERLINK China will contribute, for example. These and other details are yet to be agreed. We should also acknowledge the potential gaps between promises and money on the table, given HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3 the failure of developed states to deliver on US$100 billion per year of climate finance for developing states by 2020.

In Paris, nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 , and preferably to 1.5 this century, compared to pre-industrial levels. So far, the planet has warmed HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/this-is-the-most-sobering-report-card-yet-on-climate-change-and-earths-future-heres-what-you-need-to-know-165395 by 1.09 , and emissions are HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/global-carbon-emissions-at-record-levels-with-no-signs-of-shrinking-new-data-shows-humanity-has-a-monumental-task-ahead-193108 at record levels . Temperature trajectories make it increasingly challenging for the world to limit temperature rises to 1.5 . And the fact keeping this commitment in Egypt was a hard-won fight casts some doubt on the global commitment to mitigation. China in particular HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/climate/cop27-global-warming-1-5-celsius.html had questioned whether the 1.5 target was worth retaining, and this became a key contest in the talks.

Perhaps even HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/b3a6ea05-1357-4564-a448-27b16a376a4a more worrying was the absence of a renewed commitment to phase out fossil fuels, which had been flagged in Glasgow.

And as United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2022/nov/19/cop27-fears-15c-target-danger-negotiations-overrun-live lamented : ""Our planet is still in the emergency room."" Beyond Cop27 In the end, exhausted delegates signed off on an inadequate agreement, but largely avoided the backsliding that looked possible over fraught days of negotiations. The establishment of a fund for loss and damage is clearly an important outcome of Cop27 , even with details yet to be fleshed out. But otherwise, the negotiations can't be seen as an unambiguously positive outcome for action on the climate crisis - especially with very little progress on mitigating emissions. And while the world dithers, the window of opportunity to respond effectively to the climate crisis continues to close. It's important to note, however, that while COPs are clearly significant in the international response to the climate crisis, they're not the only game in town. Public mobilisation and activism, market forces, aid and development programs, and legislation at local, state and national levels are all important sites of climate politics - and potentially, significant change. There are myriad examples. Take the international phenomenon of HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/how-young-climate-activists-are-making-their-voices-heard-at-cop27-over-egypts-protest-suppression-193210 school climate strikes HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cannon-brookes-shakes-up-agl-what-now-for-australias-biggest-carbon-emitter-194625 takeover of AGL Energy. They point to the possibility of action on climate change outside formal international climate negotiations. So if you're despairing at the limited progress at Cop27 , remember this: nations and communities determined to wean themselves off fossil fuels will do more to blunt the power of the sector than most international agreements could realistically hope to achieve.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK173","The International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Egypt Host a Panel Discussion on Cotto....","November 10, 2022 Thursday","FinancialWire","On the sidelines of the ongoing 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el Sheikh, the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) ( HYPERLINK http://www.ITFC-idb.org http://www.ITFC-idb.org This session highlighted the strategies for boosting the ability of value stream participants to fully realize the potential of the climate-resilient textile and cotton sector in Egypt and Sub-Saharan Africa while increasing competitiveness and integration in regional and global value chains. Egyptian cotton is mostly renowned for its outstanding physical fiber qualities, exceptional aesthetic performance, and unmatched durability. However, in the Egyptian cotton-textile value chain, cotton is both a contributor and a victim of climate change. In response to these challenges, the UNIDO multistakeholder project, ""The Egyptian Cotton Project,"" supported by ITFC, began supporting Egyptian farmers in June 2020 to execute a methodical strategy for sustainable cotton growing as advocated by The Better Cotton Initiative. On the regional level, evidence shows that the main issue of the African cotton and textile industry remains the low level of local processing of the fibre and the valuation of by-products. Despite some issues in the cotton and textile sector, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which came into force on January 1st, 2021, offers a large market of more than 1.3 billion consumers, as well as several business opportunities. This large market should further stimulate industrialization and investment opportunities in the cotton value chain. Moderated by Ramamurthi Krishnan, Advisor, Abc Oqqo'gr Agro Cluster Limited Group of Companies, the Panel Discussion was joined by Aymen Kasem, Division Manager, Trade Development, ITFC, Dalia Tadros, Director of Operations, Industrial Development Group Representing Ministry of Public Sector(Ex- Assistant Minister of Public Business Sector of Egypt), Sara Berlese, Program Officer, UNIDO Regional Office in Egypt; and Babajide Sodipo, Senior Manager, AU/AfCFTA Relations at Afreximbank. With unique areas of expertise, the panelists discussed the policies, practices, and processes that can push pledges into action to enhance the traceability and transparency of the Sub-Saharan African and Egyptian cotton-textile value chain. These pledges will allow for a just transition towards a low-carbon, resource-efficient, and more circular economy. During his keynote speech, Eng. Hani Salem Sonbol reiterated- ""The African cotton sector has been a key focus of ITFC, particularly in all major producing countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\'f4te d'Ivoire, and Mali with US$ 1.4 billion in financing the cotton sector. Since its inception, ITFC has provided approximately US$ 7 billion in financing to the food and agriculture sectors. Farmers are one concrete example of how our impact manifests. ITFC also collaborates with UNIDO through the Better Cotton Initiative because of our long-standing involvement in the African cotton sector. Together, we assist brands and retailers in achieving more consistent quality and sourcing their products from Egyptian cotton producers who adhere to national and regulatory agricultural practices."" Krishnan Ramamurthi, the moderator of the session stated that ""without sound traceability, measuring progress to ESG Goals and commitments is limited. Furthermore, commodity supply and value chain traceability is a two-step process, wherein both digital chains of custody and cutting-edge ""fingerprinting"" of the origin for verification are required components."" Aymen Kasem, Division Manager, Trade Development of ITFC added that ""Traceability provides the ways and means to overcome non-tariff-related barriers, thereby enhancing trade. ITFC supports aggrotech solutions that enable sustainable farming -- especially in the least developed countries."" Sara Berlese, Program Officer, UNIDO Regional Office in Egypt said, ""Traceability is a powerful enabler for more sustainable, transparent, and inclusive cotton-textile value chains in Africa. UNIDO is keen to further support multistakeholder initiatives, focusing on skills development and innovative digital solutions to foster new opportunities for the African cotton textile industry."" Dalia Tadros, Director of Operations, Industrial Development Group, Representing the Ministry of Public Sector commented, ""The Egyptian Cotton Reform Project covers the entire supply chain from farming to complete processing; aims at availing traceable and sustainable inputs for private finished goods producers; thus, creating sustainable value added for the crop that supports the livelihoods of many families and women across the African Continent."" In his remarks, Babajide Sodipo, Senior Manager, AU/AfCFTA Relations at Afreximbank, commented on how women in the producing nations dominate the African cotton business. He noted that the cotton industry is the source of livelihood and survival of some of the most vulnerable people in society. UNIDO and ITFC are committed to continuing to support practical and scalable solutions to improve the performance and competitiveness of the Egyptian cotton-textile value chain-one of the country's most iconic industrial productions-while preserving its environmental and social sustainability and inclusivity for future generations.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK174","-University of Leeds : COP27 and research at Leeds","November 11, 2022 Friday","ENP Newswire","The 2020s have been described as the critical decade for climate change. The COP27 climate talks in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt will help determine whether global warming can be kept within the critical 1.5 degree centigrade target set in Paris in 2015. Even keeping within an average of 1.5 degrees centigrade rise in warming will have an impact on people and on biodiversity, already evident with an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, flooding and drought. But scientists warn that even a small increase in warming above that target will result in more devastating and extreme weather events. For the next nine days, an eight-strong delegation of researchers from Leeds will be at COP27 to raise awareness of the work they are doing to reduce the impact of climate change. Professor Richard Beardsworth, an expert in the politics of climate change and Head of the School of Politics and International Studies, said: 'The delegates will play a role as key ambassadors for the University on an issue that affects everyone on the planet. 'They are at COP27 to share the findings of their research and where they can, to help shape policy that will reduce the impact of climate change and the global injustice it causes. But I am hoping they will also have opportunities to meet other researchers and activists from around the world with whom they can collaborate on future research into climate change and its ever-increasing impacts.' Leeds at COP27 These are some of the activities that the delegates at COP27 will be involved with: Congo peatlands: Professor Simon Lewis, from the School of Geography, has published research in Nature which reveals how vulnerable the peatlands of the Congo Basin are to drought. During drying conditions 5,000 years ago, the peatlands switched from being a carbon store to emitting carbon dioxide before eventually switching back to storing carbon about 2,000 years ago. If modern-day climate change causes the Congo Basin to become dryer, then the peatlands could once again emit carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas. That could have a devastating impact on climate change. Then Congo Peatlands Image: the Congo peatlands. Credit: Bart Crezee, University of Leeds The peatlands hold around 30 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide: that is equivalent to the global emissions from burning fossil fuels for three years. At COP27 , Professor Lewis is involved in talks and discussions to raise awarness about the vulnerability of the Congo Peatlands and how they can be protected. Climate co-benefits tool: climate action can often have benefits that go beyond reducing the risks of climate change. For example, climate policies may have wider benefits in terms of promoting better health, reducing pollution, or creating jobs. And of course, there are climate policies that require a trade-off. An online portal has been developed by the University and the UK's Met Office that will enable policymakers to identify the wider benefits and trade-offs of different climate policies. Dr Bianca van Bavel, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Climate Change and Health, showcased the online portal at COP27 . The launch of the online tool was streamed on the UK Government YouTube channel. Just transformation: Rebecca Sarku, Research Fellow in Climate Change and Food Systems, has been involved in research analysing ways to ensure that policies adopted under the Paris Agreement at COP21 in 2015 can be applied to the agricultural sector in such a way so as not to see a repeat of historical injustices where people were the victims of land grabs or were denied workers' rights. Rebecca was presenting her research in the Food System Pavilion at COP27 . COP27 at Leeds Artist and University manager James Mckay has painted a large mural on campus with his vision of what a greener and cleaner Leeds - a zero carbon city - would look like. His mural can be found near the benches on the path linking the social sciences building with side entrance to the students' union building. Simon Jenkins, from the University's engagement team, used a time-lapse camera to capture the artwork being created. At Leeds, researchers and academics are providing expert insight and commentary on the progress of COP27 through media interviews and blogs. Professor Beardsworth set the scene for COP27 with an analysis of how political leaders need to square the circle of the transition to a net-zero carbon economy while ensuring short-term energy security. Ask a researcher: the Priestley International Centre for Climate has also produced a series of videos addressing some of the key issues surrounding COP27 . In each short video, an experts answers questions including 'What is COP?' and 'What are the links between climate change and gender?' 'Who Ya Gonna Call?' On Wednesday, a one-man show called 'Who ya gonna call?' by Steve Scott-Bottoms asked why more has not already been done given the scale of the climate challenge facing the world. Hosted by Stage@Leeds, the show drew on research with sustainability officers, flood risk managers and others. The performance was one of the outcomes from Steve's research project which saw him embedded with the flood risk management team at Leeds City Council and Yorkshire and Humber Climate Commission's adaptation and resilience panel. Water security: On Monday (Nov14) Water@Leeds is hosting an online seminar to discuss the six important themes that should help guide research into water and sanitation and water security. The online seminar takes place between 13.00 and 15.00 and tickets are available from Eventbrite.

Li\'e8s, IDF Steering Committee chairman, and chairman of Zurich Insurance Group, said: ""Our actions at COP27 -including the announcement of another in-country sovereign risk transfer projects, and significant operational progress and momentum in the pioneering GRMA and GRII programmes-are a testament to how insurance can influence systemic change, and what can be achieved through true cross-sector collaboration. This progress and its impact is a reflection of incredible hard work, dedication and resources committed by the IDF, its members and partners and is indicative of significant mobilisation of new resources in support of the climate and disaster risk financing agenda. And yet, as has been noted throughout COP27 , time is not on our side. The urgency of the climate crisis affects us all, and calls for even greater speed and dedication. Only through the three pillars of implementation, engagement and advocacy can we consolidate and deliver on our operational priorities, deepen and expand our engagement across public and private sectors, and strengthen the convergence between insurance and disaster risk management and its contribution to society. There is much more to do, and I am confident that the IDF will remain a key institution for bringing about systemic change, increasing collaboration and influence as we head into 2023.""

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK176","Egypt FM says COP27 focus should be climate, not jailed activist","November 11, 2022","Al-Arab Weekly","Numerous foreign leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have raised the case with Egypt during their visit this week. T h e A r a b The Arab Weekly SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt- UN conference on climate change Asked about the case of Alaa Abdel-Fattah, now in a prison hospital after going on hunger strike over his imprisonment, Sameh Shoukry, who is both foreign minister and chairing this year's summit, made clear it was not a priority for him as president of the 27th annual climate talks, known by their acronym COP27 . Numerous foreign leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have raised the case with Egypt during their visit this week. Shoukry suggested such concerns could distract from some countries' failure to live up to their climate commitments. During the interview, Shoukry took a swipe at media outlets, which he said ""had decided that the issue of climate change is not as important as the issue of the provision of foods and drink for delegates and for participants."" He acknowledged there had been ""glitches,"" blaming them on the large number of participants and traffic delays due to VIP visits during the first days of the meeting. ""Other issues that are not directly pertaining to the climate might detract from the attention and relieve, potentially, and give justification to maybe those who would prefer to concentrate on other issues to avoid having to deal with what they need to do, how they need to implement their obligations and responsibilities,"" he said. ""It is up to the parties to put the emphasis on the issues that are most important to them."" The November 6-18 talks have moved from high-level appeals for more climate action, heard from world leaders early in the week, to the nitty-gritty stage of negotiations. Diplomats are trying to forge a broad package of agreements covering issues such as cutting emissions and aid for poor nations that would need to be agreed by consensus at the end. In an early win for negotiators, a deal was reached at the start of talks to put the issue of compensation for poor countries suffering severe losses from climate change on the official agenda. ""This in itself is a positive development and one that we should hail,"" said Shoukry. ""What happens next is going to be dependent on the degree of flexibility that the parties will demonstrate."" ""As presidency we will certainly provide the opportunity for as much progress as possible on the agenda item and hopefully we will have a landing zone that will be satisfactory to all the parties,"" he said. Egypt is already feeling the harsh effects of climate change itself, with rising sea levels threatening fertile lands in the Nile delta. At the same time, the country remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels for the energy needs of its growing population, projected to reach 160 million by mid-century. Hosting the annual climate talks has helped Egypt recently clinch several deals to promote the roll-out of renewable energy, something Shoukry said the government is committed to pursuing further. ""If we could, overnight, transfer to full renewables we would,"" he said. ""But then again, we are limited as many of the developing countries are, with the high cost of finance, with the lack of investment and with having to deal with other priorities in terms of the interests of our citizens."" Asked how the vast Zohr gas field in the Mediterranean fits in with Egypt's green goals, Shoukry said it would be irresponsible for developing countries not to use the resources that rich nations have exploited for many decades. ""But we do so with the recognition that it is our objective to decrease our dependency on fossil fuels and on gas, provided the resources, the investments and the facilitation that can be provided to us is forthcoming,"" he said. In the longer term, Egypt sees itself as a producer and exporter of 'green' hydrogen, made with solar and wind power, to Europe, he added. Like many other developing countries, Egypt is also hampered by large debts that make it harder to borrow money for much-needed investments. Shoukry said he hoped agreements could be reached, including at the upcoming Group of 20 meeting in Bali in Indonesia, to support a change in the debt rules to make it easier for countries to redirect their resources toward boosting renewable energy and adapting to climate change. US President Joe Biden was scheduled to briefly visit climate talks Friday on his way to the G-20. Shoukry said he understood the president's stopover in Sharm el-Sheikh to be ""an indication of the political will to move the process forward"" on tackling global warming. ""We hope ... it will resonate within the collective will of the negotiating groups that the United States is party to, but also in creating a momentum for the conference, for the parties to deliver what is expected,"" he said. ""I think there's a heightened sense of the crisis that we face because of the devastating weather patterns that have resulted during this year of a vast devastation. Of course, Pakistan immediately jumps to the forefront,"" said Shoukry. Pakistan suffered devastating floods this summer that put one third of the country underwater, killing over 1,700 people and causing an estimated $40 billion in damage. Extreme weather is worsening in many parts of the globe as the climate warms. ""People are now waking up to the science,"" he said. ""If we don't move more expeditiously or effectively to deal with climate change, we will transcend the point of no return and see a dramatic deterioration of the planet."" \"

The prime minister is attending COP27 in Egypt next week after a U-turn but Charles will miss the gathering. The King has long campaigned on environmental issues and last autumn he told the COP26 talks in Glasgow that the world has had enough of talking and commitments needed to be put into practice. But the ""soft power"" diplomacy of the monarchy will be absent from the gathering at Sharm El-Sheikh. During Liz Truss's brief premiership, a ""unanimous agreement"" was reached that the King should not attend COP27 after advice was sought by his office from the government. Speaking at a reception staged in the Buckingham Palace ballroom yesterday, the prime minister said: ""As recent events have shown, delivering on the promise of Glasgow is more important than ever. ""More important because as we have seen so starkly with the war in Ukraine, it is vital to invest in secure, renewable sources of energy and sustainable food production. ""More important because every moment we allow climate change to ravage our planet we will see more human suffering like the floods in Pakistan. ""And more important because if we do not act today, we will risk leaving an ever more desperate inheritance for our children.""

Fashion designer and sustainability activist Stella McCartney was asked at the reception if it would be a ""good idea"" for the King to attend COP27 and she replied: ""I think it's good to have him everywhere talking on this subject matter, but I don't think it's realistic to do so."" McCartney, who joked with the King when she first met him, went on to say: ""That's really the beauty of today and the work that King Charles has been doing, he is truly getting the world leaders in business and the world leaders in politics into the same room. ""They're all here for one reason - people are facing problems, we need solutions and we all have to work together.""

The United Nations Climate Change summit in Egypt signifies the world's best opportunity to turn the Paris Agreement into concrete action, to help limit global warming to 1.5-degreec and create a sustainable future for all. This year's summit has focused attention on climate justice as communities across the globe look for leadership on ways to recover from current climate disasters, as well as improving the resilience of infrastructure for extreme weather events in the future. Water scarcity and ensuring a just transition to renewable energy are also priority areas for COP27 , especially on a host continent that experiences the devastating impact of droughts and with an estimated 600 million Africans still lacking access to electricity. Commenting on the summit, our CEO and Chairman Vincent Clancy, said: COP27 has returned climate to the forefront of many minds, amidst an increasingly complex set of global challenges from economic headwinds to ongoing conflict and geopolitical tensions. Tackling climate change and making the necessary progress to reach net zero, must remain a priority for us all. We advise clients on their net-zero strategies so they can transform their own climate action efforts. 'Our industry has a critical role to play in this - both as a key enabler for a more sustainable future but also given the significant contribution that the built environment makes to carbon emissions. We need to present a united front in transforming our ways of working, and the outcomes of major projects and programmes we are delivering while keeping up the pressure for change. 'Inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption have had a significant impact on delivering complex major projects and programmes, but by driving efficiencies we can stay the course and continue to advance towards net zero.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK182","Saudi Arabia to launch own climate initiatives during COP27","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political ","By BBC Monitoring Saudi Arabia will announce the second iteration of its Saudi Green Initiative and Middle East Green Initiative during the UN COP27 summit, the kingdom's media have reported. Regional outlets including Egypt's privately owned Sada al-Balad website have relayed reports that Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman will use COP27 as a platform to promote his initiatives from Sharm el-Sheikh. The influential London-based Saudi Asharq al-Awsat daily said the ""second inauguration"" of the Middle East Green Initiative ""during the COP27 proceedings"" would reflect Saudi Arabia's ""rejection of the premise that there needs to be a choice between preserving either the economy or the environment"". A report by popular news website Sabq meanwhile said Bin Salman would head ""a summit for the second version of the Middle East Green Initiative in partnership with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi"", coinciding with the World Leaders Summit at COP27 on 7 November. Domestic Saudi paper Al-Watan likewise said the Saudi Green Initiative would have a ""strong presence"" at COP27 - painting it as part of the Saudi efforts at this year's UN summit. In contrast, the green projects' initial unveiling in Saudi Arabia to much fanfare last year came weeks ahead of the COP26 summit. The UN conference was subsequently overshadowed in the kingdom's media, as reporting continued to be dominated by Bin Salman's own initiatives. Saudi outlets' and social media support for his projects at the time spilled over into their usual defence of the kingdom against outside criticism, with one influencer even retweeting posts engaging in climate change denial in order to rebuff Western scrutiny of Riyadh's oil dominance.

The latter is despite Russia being the second biggest oil and gas producer in the world, and carbon emissions from HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/10/carbon-emissions-from-fossil-fuels-will-hit-record-high-in-2022-climate-crisis fossil fuels being the overwhelming cause of the climate crisis. The event began with protesters repeatedly shouting  you are war criminals , before being swiftly removed from the room.  The event is about the climate agenda, not the political agenda, the chair said. However, in the 75 minutes that followed, the role of fossil fuels was not mentioned by the six men who comprised the panel. Sergei Anoprienko, the deputy environment minister, spoke first about the economic damage being caused by melting permafrost and about eliminating refuse landfill sites. Kirill Komarov, from the state-owned nuclear company Rosatom, spoke at length about Russia\' s nuclear power capabilities. He said  the arguments against nuclear are very often coloured politically and are emotional , and that a floating nuclear power plant in a remote peninsula had allowed  children to see for the first time that snow can be white . A scientific adviser to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, talked about monitoring greenhouse gases and a special breed of poplar tree that could absorb more carbon as it grew. Also on the panel was Vyacheslav Fetisov, the UN Environment Programme\' s goodwill ambassador for Russia, a deputy in the Russian Duma and a former ice hockey star, who spoke about the need to preserve access to water. He also railed against the sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine:  We are ready to cooperate but we are hit with sanctions, which includes green and energy-saving technology. I don\' t understand. As the event turned to questions, the BBC\' s climate editor Justin Rowlatt approached the stage with a camera operator, asking:  Are you going to pay for the environmental damage you have caused in Ukraine? , as a result of the invasion, but was quickly removed from the room. The final question from the audience was what Russia thought about India\' s proposal to include the need to  phase down all fossil fuels in Cop27 \' s final decision text, rather than just  phase down coal as was in the Glasgow pact agreed at Cop26. This produced the gnomic response:  Coal is still alive, so let us wait. The panellists had described Russia as a  climate responsible nation. But the event provided little evidence of that. Asked later why she had disrupted the event, the Ukrainian activist Svitlana Romanko, from Razom We Stand, said:  I am glad that I named evil by name and I was able to tell them what all Ukrainians would like to tell them if they were here. You are a terrorist state, you are genociding, torturing and killing us daily for nine months, your oil and gas are killing us. You are war criminals, you must not be here but in international court. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.59pm GMT block-time published-time 5.56pm GMT Fears countries backsliding on commitments to 1.5C and climate finance The Guardian\' s environment editors, Fiona Harvey and Damian Carrington, as well as senior climate justice reporter Nina Lakhani, have written that the Cop talks on Tuesday have been dominated by fears that countries are backsliding on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis, as the first tentative drafts started to emerge of key potential decisions.

Negotiators cautioned that the situation was still highly fluid, and threats by some to renege on previous promises may be merely a gambit at this early stage. Many countries may be setting out extreme negotiating positions on some issues in order to win concessions on others. This feels potentially very alarming, but as one delegate says:  It\' s all still up for grabs.

It details the position of developing nations which centres around a new fund separate and additional to the current climate adaptation and mitigation funding facilities  to assist developing countries in meeting their costs of addressing non-economic and economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events. It would create a 35-member transitional committee \- with representatives from 20 developing and 15 developed countries \- which would begin work in early 2023, to establish the  objectives, principles and operational modalities of the new fund over the next year or two. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, a network of civil society groups in countries around the world, lists what he thinks are the HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/harjeet11/status/1592540390691049472?s=20&t=4hM5yToZrxWVhqX5CSKVlg  must haves of the G77 plus China proposal here . At this stage in the Cop process, no firm conclusions can be drawn on what the end result of the negotiations will be. But we know that loss and damage is for many climate vulnerable countries the most important and most contested aspect of the climate finance negotiations. The G77 chief negotiator Nabeel Munir told the Guardian.  There is 100% unity [in the G77] on this. We want a loss and damage facility established this year. We are pushing for this and not talking about compromises... Loss and damage is the main banner headline for this Cop, we are not giving up. The rest of climate finance [adaptation and mitigation] is also slow moving but is in process. In contrast, developed countries such as the US, EU and Australia appear to want to keep talking before deciding on whether a new facility for loss and damage is warranted, and the G7 has been promoting the Global Shield insurance initiative as an alternative. Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, said the EU was supportive of talks on loss and damage but that there was not yet broad agreement among developed and developing countries on what form any new finance mechanism for loss and damage should take and how it should operate. He said:  I don\' t see today an agreement emerging on a new facility, but the EU is building bridges [with other countries]. However, the EU does not seem wholly united.

On the global stage, she writes, India presents itself as committed to clean energy and the environment. Yet at home, it makes no secret of the fact that it will need coal for decades to come, even as it increases its reliance on renewables and moves towards its net zero 2070 target. This has led to it walking a delicate balance as part of the Cop negotiations. Hannah writes:  It was one of the most dramatic moments at the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow last year when India, backed by China, made a last-minute intervention to water down the language of the final agreement, changing the commitment to  phase down rather than  phase out coal power.

Here\' s a dispatch from senior climate justice reporter, https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nina-lakhani Nina Lakhani : In an alternative universe, a mile or so south of the Blue Zone, aka the Sharm conference centre, a shiny over-the-top outdoor arts space with recycled wood benches is the Cop27 Green Zone. It\' s a sprawling set-up with gawdy water fountains, exhibition tents, two dome-shaped event rooms and environmentally skewed art installations including a trio of metal sculptures representing the eyes of endangered species and a huge panda bear made from plastic containers. The Egyptian Cop authorities had been keen that activism and dissent be confined to the Green Zone and a designated protest area somewhere in the desert, but that didn\' t pan out, and this is primarily a place for those who weren\' t able to secure accreditation for the main summit or are simply here doing business or promoting government and academic programmes.

Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images Mexico has announced plans to expand renewables \- specifically, to deploy an additional 30GW of combined wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectricity capacity by 2030, writes Nina Lakhani. This national renewable goal  will be a foundation for achieving Mexico\' s updated nationally determined contribution, including an unconditional target to reduce emissions by 35% from business-as-usual levels by 2030, HYPERLINK https://mx.usembassy.gov/united-states-welcome-mexicos-commitments-announced-during-cop-27/ said the US embassy in Mexico HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/mexico/ Mexico\' s emissions are projected to continue rising until 2030. Carlos Flores, an energy policy expert in Mexico, said that coming up with 30GW of new clean energy in eight years will be  almost impossible . Since being elected in 2018, Andr\'e9s Manuel L\'f3pez Obrador (Amlo) has repeatedly tried to dismantle the 2013 energy reforms which gave renewables an advantage due to their low costs. And while he\' s been thwarted by the courts, his policies and anti-renewables rhetoric has caused uncertainty and mistrust among investors.  While there is a global appetite for investing huge amounts in renewables, why would anyone come to Mexico after what Amlo has done, said Flores.  Between 2010 and 2018, 14,000MW of renewables were built in Mexico. Today, with everything against them, how will they build more than double? Another sticking point is the transmission network, which is the responsibility of the national electricity commission. All expansion projects were halted after Amlo took office. The 35% unconditional pledge may be good news, but it\' s impossible to say given that Mexico will not define cuts in relation to a specific baseline year, only on a  business as usual scenario. Climate Action Tracker\' s Mexico analyst, Maria Jose de Villafranca, from the NewClimate Institute, said:  President Lopez Obrador has largely focused on dismantling climate policies and prioritising fossil fuels. A stronger target would be welcome, but until we can understand what baseline he is using, we cannot quantify whether this announcement is an improvement. The Mexican government has been approached for comment. On a side note, Amlo is among several G20 leaders from some of the biggest polluting nations that include Brazil, India, and Australia, who didn\' t show up for Cop.

The second point relates to the $100bn that was pledged to be delivered by rich countries by 2020 but HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/nov/07/us-uk-fall-billions-short-climate-funding-cop27 has yet to be delivered The HYPERLINK https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52730/g20-leaders-declaration-final.pdf G20 declaration in Italy in October 2021 said:  We note the Climate Finance Delivery Plan, which shows, based on OECD estimates, that the [$100bn] goal is expected to be met no later than 2023.

The 100bn promise is left unmet for the second year in a row, but instead of pledging new money, the reference to striving to finally hit the target in 2023 is now completely gone, said Roder. She continued:  While it\' s early days on a Cop cover decision, the first signs are far from promising.

In HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/news/achieving-a-swift-reduction-in-global-coal-emissions-is-the-central-challenge-for-reaching-international-climate-targets a special report on coal There are about 9,000 coal-fired power plants around the world, which vary significantly in age, from an average of 40 years old in the US to less than 15 years in developing economies in Asia. The IEA said in a scenario in which current national climate pledges were met, output from existing coal-fired plants would need to fall by about one-third between 2021 and 2030, with 75% of it replaced by solar and wind. To hit net zero emissions by 2050 and limit global heating to 1.5C, coal use must fall by 90%. Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine has sent countries in Europe scurrying back to coal to ensure the security of energy supplies this winter. In the UK, three large coal-fired plants have been put on standby, although a pledge to phase out the use of coal by 2024 still stands. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said: Coal is both the single biggest source of CO 2 emissions from energy and the single biggest source of electricity generation worldwide, which highlights the harm it is doing to our climate and the huge challenge of replacing it rapidly while ensuring energy security. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.36pm GMT block-time published-time 12.49pm GMT Reaction to the HYPERLINK $20bn climate finance deal for Indonesia is pouring in from home and overseas, with experts unanimously calling for transparency and respect for human rights to be built into the deal.

All discussion on the (Just Energy Transition Partnership) JETP deal should be transparent and involve communities most affected by the climate crisis. So far in Indonesia, these decisions have lacked transparency and if this conversation only involves the elite, it will become a space for false solutions from wealthy corporations. Ahmad Ashov Birry from Trend Asi, said: The JETP is important for solving the climate crisis to ensure the success of these packages, there must be transparency on the details as well as genuine engagement and participation of civil society. Indonesia is only the second country to announce a JETP deal. The first with South Africa was announced at Cop26 and has been subject to numerous issues including a lack of transparency around its financing. A similar deal with Vietnam is in the works. Tata Mustasya , the head of the Climate and Energy Campaign of Greenpeace Indonesia, said the JETP could help accelerate the energy transition and signal that developed countries and recipient countries are translating commitment into implementation. To meet the expectations, JETP should be conducted in a transparent, participatory and accountable manner and inline with a bigger regulatory framework that places clear and firm disincentives for coal and scalable incentives to clean and renewable energy and institutional reforms. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.57pm GMT The Cop27 climate summit is not the only big UN environmental meeting at the end of 2022.

India needs greater investment in coal production, said Nirmala Sitharaman at the Delhi launch of India\' s biggest ever coalmine auction, where 141 new sites for coalmines will be sold off to the highest bidder. At a time when the world\' s future hinges on a dramatic global reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and global leaders are gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh to try to limit the impact of the climate crisis \- with decarbonisation on the agenda \- the Indian government is continuing on its biggest ever push for domestic coal production, even toying with the idea of producing so much it could become a future coal exporter. This was the sixth, and largest, such auction the Indian government has held since 2020, when it privatised the coal industry. Two-thirds of the 968 sites that are allocated for mines, known as coal blocks, are on untouched land and many sit under India\' s most ecologically rich and fragile forests, and rural areas populated by tribal communities that will be destroyed if the new projects go ahead.  The worst part is that in order to open up more coal, the government is allowing mining in dense forested areas. Forests are sinks of carbon dioxide so if you are getting new coal to burn by chopping down forests, it\' s a double whammy of environmental disaster, said Sudiep Shrivastava, a lawyer who has fought back against new coal blocks.

The groups, which include the WWF and Environmental Defense Fund, said in a HYPERLINK https://foodsystemspavilion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Korinivia-signed-letter.docx-3.pdf joint letter that the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture ( KJWA ) should include  food systems approaches . Sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all, without compromising the welfare of future generations through harmful economic, social and environmental practices. In the context of the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, this means taking a particular focus on sustainable food production, nutrition and dietary shifts, as well as food loss and waste. The KJWA is a landmark decision under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It addresses six interrelated topics on soils, nutrient use, water, livestock, methods for assessing adaptation, and the socio economic and food security dimensions of climate change across the agricultural sectors. Morgan Gillespy, the executive director of one of the signatories, Food and Land Use Coalition, said: If food security and the livelihoods of farmers are truly to be at the heart of climate negotiations in the future, then food systems need to be recognised in the Koronivia Process and this process decisively taken forward at Cop27 . Cop27 is therefore a make-or-break moment for the food systems and climate agenda. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.46am GMT Mongolia\' s minister of environment and tourism, B Bat-Erdene, who is at Cop27 this week, has said his country needs  urgent green finance . As a nation which is proud of our nomadic heritage, a key focus for Mongolia at Cop27 is ensuring that we practice nature-based solutions in adapting to climate change while maintaining our traditional livelihoods and working patterns, for example in the agricultural sector, animal husbandry and crop production. In my meetings with our international partners this week, I have been discussing how we can unlock the urgent green finance, which will allow Mongolia and other developing countries to scale up and deploy new technologies at the national level, helping to both safeguard our traditional ways of life and contribute to the global action to fight against climate change. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.47am GMT Indonesia to get $20 billion of finance to help shut coal power Cop27 A coalition of countries will mobilise $20 billion (around \£317bn) of public and private finance to help Indonesia shut coal power plants and bring forward the sector\' s peak emissions date by seven years to 2030, the United States, Japan and partners have announced. Indonesia is the world\' s 5 th largest greenhouse gas emitter. The Indonesia Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), more than a year in the making,  is probably the single largest climate finance transaction or partnership ever , a US Treasury official told reporters.

The summer heatwave is scorched into the collective memory of the British populous and they rightly expect a solution to be a high priority for those who serve them in government.

The European Union Horizon 2020-funded DOWN2EARTH project, led by Professor Michael Singer, Deputy Director of the University's Water Research Institute, will debut two short films about water and food security in HAD at the world event. COP27 will also see the launch of a podcast series created by the research team and its sister projects, also funded by the EU, which have been recorded in the rural communities of East Africa and focus on climate adaptation. 'This Africa-facing COP is of huge importance. Urgent action is needed to address adaptation to climate change,' said Professor Singer. 'Our DOWN2EARTH project is focused directly on impacts to people, institutions, and policy within and beyond the affected rural agricultural and pastoralist communities of HAD. That's why we're uniquely placed to share our work with the COP27 delegates. 'It's an honour to be invited to the event to present our latest research on the impacts of climate change on vulnerable subsistence communities in Africa - those who had very little to do with causing climate change, but are bearing the brunt of its impacts.' The films and podcasts will be featured within two side events at COP27 , one in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Science Pavilion and one in the European Union Pavilion, that Professor Singer has co-organised with the sister projects. 'This is a great opportunity to raise awareness of the adaptation challenges for communities within Horn of Africa, who are currently facing the prospect of famine after multiple failed rainy seasons in a row,' added Professor Singer. COP27 takes place in Sharm el Sheik between 6 and 18 November. Professor Singer's events take place on Nov 14 (WMO Science Pavilion) and Nov 16 (EU Pavilion).

Belgium, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, and the US have joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (Gowa) at Cop27 , to work together to remove barriers to the development of offshore wind. The alliance has been initiated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), Denmark, and the Global Wind Energy Council and will bring together governments, the private sector, and international organisations to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind power, Gowa claims. Both Irena and the International Energy Agency expect that offshore wind capacity will need to exceed 2,000GW in 2050, from just over 60GW today, in order to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and achieve net zero. The emergence of ""loss and damage"" funding as a key issue at Cop27 has pleased attendees to the summit - especially those from flood-hit Pakistan. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy as Climate Action Network International, says that while the next two weeks will be focused on the shape and financing of the fund, the principle of rich countries owing money to poor communities is what matters. ""It is time for the world to understand that our actions and inaction have repercussions. We are paying today because of our inaction in the past"". he said. Farooq Sayyad, a 22-year-old student from Pakistan's impoverished Balochistan province, who is attending the UN climate summit for the first time, shares that his community is still living underwater from the massive flooding in August. ""We are here to tell the world what people in our areas are going through, our houses are still underwater and our lives have not gone back to normal since the flooding hit. It's going to take us years to recover."" Tuvalu leads calls for treaty to phase out fossil fuels The Polynesian island state of Tuvalu has joined Vanuatu to call for an international treaty to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Tuvalu is the first nation at Cop27 and only the second country in the world to call for what is formally known as the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. It follows Vanuatu, the Pacific island state, that called for a treaty at the UN General Assembly in New York in September. The proposed treaty is backed by more than 70 cities around the world, including London, Los Angeles and Paris, and has been called for by Nobel laureates, parliamentarians, scientists and NGOs across the world. It follows The Independent's Stop Fuelling The Climate Crisis campaign which shone a light on fossil fuel production in the UK when Glasgow hosted Cop26 last year. \"

The Sharm el-Sheikh summit is almost certain to continue into today - and perhaps even tomorrow - as countries remain divided on how to tackle some of the biggest issues of the climate crisis. An alert was sent to delegates late on Thursday to inform them that essential services, such as transport and food stalls, would run until midnight tomorrow. Some exhausted attendees raced to the Egypt Air counter inside the venue to change their flights. The conference halls had largely emptied out, and many of those remaining came to the venue with bags and suitcases after hotel stays ran out. Country pavilions, set up to tout their climate progress, began closing on Thursday, leaving an eerie silence behind. And despite assurances by the Cop27 presidency, some services have become challenging to track down. Water filters, touch and go throughout the conference, had run out entirely in some areas. On the bright side, queues for food stalls were much shorter. It's not unusual for Cop summits to run over. Eight of the 10 previous Cops have been extended, according to a Carbon Brief analysis. Only six in the 26 previous summits have ended on time. At Cop26 in Scotland last year, the final Glasgow Climate Pact was not signed off by all countries until more than 24 hours after the official end time. As of yesterday evening, there was still only a first draft of the Cop27 agreement. It was littered with placeholders on major issues including on a funding arrangement to pay for the loss and damage suffered by vulnerable countries because of climate change. ""I remain committed to bring this conference to a close tomorrow in an orderly manner, with the adoption of a series of consensus decisions that will be comprehensive, ambitious, and balanced,"" Egypt's Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry said on Thursday. \"

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK191","Listed real estate sector snubs COP27","November 16, 2022 Wednesday 11:39 AM GMT","Investorschronicle.co.uk","No major listed property companies mentioned in COP27 participant list Property accounts for 37 per cent of energy-related carbon emissions The significance of COP27 hardly needs repeating. The world is currently on course to breach 1.5 degrees C of warming compared with pre-industrial levels within the next five years. Doing so would mean not just breaking the pledge the contributors made in Paris in 2015, but also increasing the risk of severe heatwaves, fires, droughts and floods. Yet, the listed real estate industry appears nonplussed. According to Investors\' Chronicle\' s analysis of the conference\' s provisional participant list, no one from any of the world\' s largest public property companies \- including any in the FTSE 100 \- was set to attend the conference. The high-profile snub comes despite property sustainability campaign group the World Green Building Council (GBC) calculating that buildings and construction account for 37 per cent of energy-related carbon emissions. The UK-listed real estate companies\' nonattendance is in stark contrast to the approach from energy companies and banks \- with Shell (SHEL), BP (BP.), HSBC (HSBC) and Barclays (BARC) all sending multiple people. Companies such as telecoms group BT (BT.A) and bank Standard Chartered (STAN), which have similar market caps to warehouse developer Segro (SGRO), have sent participants. Real estate presence at COP27 is down across the non-listed parts of the industry, too, with the world\' s largest private real estate owner Blackstone absent. One real estate body which is at the conference in force is the World GBC which has sent five people as well as additional 11 from the US, UK and Emirates GBCs. When asked about the lack of attendance from other property institutions, World GBC chief executive Cristina Gamboa said there was a  coalition of the willing within the sector but that it still needed to do much more.  For several decades, we have unfortunately designed average infrastructure that is not as energy efficient as it should be. It is infrastructure that wastes resources, she said. She added:  The industry has not stepped up at scale. They need to improve how they design today because their designs have a huge carbon footprint. Gamboa suggested that one of the reasons the industry is not doing enough is its disparate nature. Whereas the majority of oil and gas emissions can be pinned on a handful of companies and while a handful of manufacturers build the bulk of the world\' s cars, real estate ownership and development is spread across multiple organisations and individuals. She added that a big chunk of the real estate\' s future emissions will come from the developing world where small businesses and individuals might not be aware of property\' s carbon emissions. Another reason for real estate\' s slow response is a lack of hard government rules. The World GBC is calling on governments to require property companies to publish the lifetime carbon footprint of their assets. The lack of government regulation implies low awareness of real estate\' s impact \- particularly with regards to embodied carbon. The phrase is scarcely mentioned in the UK government\' s net zero strategy from last year. Despite the document\' s role in outlining how the UK will reach its legally-binding target of net zero emissions by 2050, it makes no commitment to enforcing the regulation or even the reporting of real estate\' s embodied emissions. The UK GBC\' s chief executive, Julie Hirigoyen, said last week the government had to do more. ""The built environment is directly responsible for around a quarter of the UK\' s carbon footprint,"" she said. ""Many of the solutions to delivering the net zero transformation across the UK economy lie within our sector. However, we need the government to put in place the strategic long-range policies that will enable these and turn around the UK\' s fortunes on energy security and cost of living."" Despite the challenges the sector faces, the World GBC\' s Gamboa expressed optimism. She calculated that there were around 160 conferences and events focused on real estate and the built environment at COP27 and that this was an improvement on COP26 in Glasgow last year. Land Security\' s (LAND) sustainability head Jennie Colville said the company was  hopeful that COP27 will deliver collective action that can support the development of ambitious frameworks to achieve a lower carbon economy across nations, including the UK . Commenting on its non-attendance at the conference, she added:  We engage regularly with the UK government and do not believe travelling to Egypt is necessary to further this work. \"

That was the message on full display at Highland Council headquarters. But it wasn't elected officials shouting the message in Inverness - it was children as young as six making their voices heard through art, writing and conversations with each other. Highland Council played host to a Mock COP27 , organised by the Open University in Scotland, jointly with the Highland One World Global Education Centre, and Developing the Young Workforce. Inverness Royal Academy pupil Adnan Hussain said it's time for young people to get serious. ""We live in a world of instant gratification. We're all consumers, but we don't realise that our consumption is damaging the environment,"" he said. ""We need to be more mindful about how we treat the world."" Pupils from 11 schools across the north - from Ardnamurchan to Gairloch to Speyside - crowded into the Highland Council chambers to debate a new global climate policy. Teams of five or six from each school were each assigned a specific country or organisation to represent. There were delegations from the UK, China and Ethiopia; representatives of corporations such as Shell and BP; and advocates for small island nations, refugees and indigenous peoples. Students had to promote their personal values and those of the organisation they represented. Inverness Royal Academy's Mark Fernando found this difficult, saying: ""I only did it because I heard my school was playing China. ""I thought it was going to be really interesting to see how I could argue from a standpoint that I flat out disagree with. ""I have to actively fight against myself and say things like: 'Yes, I do want more coal production.'"" Catriona Willis, co- ordinator for Highland One World Global Education Centre, said the discomfort was intentional. COP27 they're developing negotiation skills, but they're also developing empathy. ""They've all got an agenda. By negotiating, they have an opportunity to listen to others from another point of view and come to a shared understanding. ""That's a really important thing for young people to develop."" Gemma Burnside, partnership manager at the Open University and Mock COP27 's lead organiser, said that she has seen young people spurred into action by climate talks. ""They feel like they can actually do something,"" she said. ""When you listen to young people, they want to follow through. They want real action and they want to see a change and make a change."" Taking on the role of different groups helps them reconsider the reallife climate debates.

Countries promised last year at COP26 in Glasgow to submit more ambitious pledges for cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases but they did not deliver at COP27 . And as Just Stop Oil has warned, the UK, like other fossil fuel producers, is still planning to dig up more coal, oil and gas, even though burning existing global reserves would cause dangerous climate change. We are on track for the global temperature to be 2.5C higher by the end of this century than it was before industrialisation began in the 18th century. That would mean a temperature that last occurred on Earth about three million years ago. The polar ice caps were smaller back then and global sea level was five to 25 metres higher than today. We can and must cut our emissions to avoid a potentially catastrophic return to a prehistoric climate. But it now seems likely that the global temperature, which has already increased by 1C, will now rise at least another half a degree in the coming decades. This means we will need more protection against, and stronger responses to, our changing climate. COP27 agreed that poor countries should receive financial help to deal with climate-related loss and damage. But rich countries will also need to deal with a more hostile climate. In London, we are already counting the cost. This summer we suffered hundreds of deaths and suburban wildfires during the record-breaking heatwave. And in summer 2021, more than 1,500 properties were flooded across the capital when parts of the city received more than twice the average monthly rainfall in just two hours. We now need a proper Londonwide strategy to make us climate-resilient. We must also invest more heavily in cooler buildings, bigger flood defences and better drainage. But we will also have to face up to more death and more damage as we pay the price for the world's failure to react decisively when scientists warned us about where we were heading.?

""Sometimes when we work only focusing on our own sector, we never think about a global point of view. So I'm sure this COP27 will inspire and encourage everyone to think globally in order to accelerate contributions in dealing with climate change through industries that we each work on,"" Purba said during a discussion organized on the sidelines of COP27 , at the Indonesian Pavilion in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Friday (November 11) . Reducing carbon emissions is one of the ways to tackle climate change, Purba added. Through the COP27 event, he continued, all nations around the world are reminded that there is still a lot of work to do to save planet Earth from the impacts of climate change, and it is not only for the benefit of future generations, but also for the sustainability of the business environment. ""I hope that after the implementation of COP27 , everyone will realize that they have to play a role in saving the Earth. And that effort is not just a jargon, but must become a reality, our mindset and lifestyle that encourage us to save our planet,"" Purba said. As a concrete step to tackle climate change, Indonesia is committed to achieving net zero emissions (NZE) by 2060, and Pertamina is supporting the realization of that commitment by decarbonizing its existing businesses and developing green businesses. ""Currently Indonesia has committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2060 so that Pertamina, as a state-owned company, supports this commitment and we have also prepared various work programs to achieve this national (NZE) target,"" he pointed out. The decarbonization measures taken by the company include encouraging energy efficiency, zero-flare oil and gas activities, as well as carbon capture and utilization. Apart from that, Pertamina has also developed a number of green business initiatives, including those related to biofuels, renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles, hydrogen as well as carbon businesses. ""Of course, we also view the energy transition period as a very good opportunity for us to build some green businesses,"" Purba said.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK196","From commitment to action on climate change","November 1, 2022 Tuesday","FinancialWire","Telefonica.com Just a few days before the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), the concept of a climate ""emergency"" is more relevant than ever. The situation, aggravated by the energy crisis, has led the Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres to state that ""the climate crisis is killing us"". However, according to the latest reports, ""despite the challenges, there is clear evidence that immediate action could still save the lives of millions, with a rapid shift to clean energy and energy efficiency"". Towards net zero Companies remain a critical part of delivering on the Paris Agreement. However, it is vital for the climate commitment to become a genuine business strategy aimed at substantial emissions reductions to make net zero a reality before the deadlines set. This is one of the findings of the ""2022 Corporate Climate Reporting Performance Report"" EcoAct, published this week. A study that recognises Telef\'f3nica as the international leader on climate issues, with a score of 81.5%. Do you know what aspects carry the most weight in this ranking? Addressing climate change has formed part of our management strategy for 20 years; therefore, it forms a cross-cutting element of the latter and this is increasingly integrated into the day-to-day running of the company. Our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 across our footprint and value chain is a decade ahead of the United Nations targets and the Paris Agreement. To achieve this, it is very important to start acting now and we have specific emission reduction targets in the short, medium, and long term in all scopes (1, 2, and 3). Moreover, these commitments are itemised and have been validated by science, specifically by the SBTi initiative. We have a robust Climate Action Plan aligned with the most ambitious scientific recommendations designed to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the neutralisation of emissions that we cannot reduce, with lines of action aimed at continuing Telef\'f3nica's process of transformation, in the way we purchase, operate, finance ourselves, and even sell. We demonstrate maximum transparency and thoroughness in meeting our commitments (our emissions data are verified annually by AENOR). In six years we have reduced all our emissions by over 40% (70% for Scope 1+2 since 2015 and 27% for Scope 3 or the value chain since 2016). Leading the EcoAct study confirms the importance of developing long-term climate action strategies designed to ensure business growth that is compatible with decarbonisation goals. We have come a long way and our top-of-the-table position is proof of that. There is still a long way to go, however, both as a company and as a sector and this is essential to facilitate the transition of other industries towards net zero as well. In this regard, involving customers and suppliers is key. Together, we can accelerate change. #EverythingIsConnected (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \"

The summit in Egypt agreed a historic deal to award vulnerable developing countries compensation for the impacts of rising temperatures, but failed to come to a consensus on further cutting world emissions, leaving the aim of limiting global warming to 1.5C in doubt. Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor in atmospheric physics at Imperial College London, said COP27 , which ended on Sunday, had been ""very disappointing"" as the main issue causing climate change was the burning of fossil fuels. She told BBC Radio 4: ""That is creating the greenhouse effect and causing global warming, leading to the extreme weather impacts we're seeing more and more of. ""It's not going to go away. It's just going to get worse and worse, unless we stop emitting greenhouse gases."" The Government's COP27 representative, Alok Sharma, warned that hopes of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C are ""on life support"" in his summing up remarks.

His hope is to be able to share important research results to decision-makers, officials and organizations. Gustaf Hugelius at the Bolin Centre for Climate Research at COP27 . Gustaf Hugelius at the Bolin Centre for Climate Research at COP27 in Egypt. On 6-18 November, the COP27 climate summit is held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The parties must then negotiate how the climate work will be carried out and how to follow up previous decisions. Gustaf Hugelius, reader at the Department of Physical Geography and associate director of the Bolin Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University, is one of the researchers who will participate in COP27 . Expert on the Arctic and permafrost thawing He is going to COP27 to present research on how human emissions cause irreversible damage to the frozen parts of the Earth's climate system, what is sometimes called the cryosphere. 'My own expertise is surrounding permafrost. Permafrost thawing causes additional greenhouse gas emissions that within a few decades will be greater than the entire EU's total emissions.' Gustaf Hugelius will present research in the Cryosphere Pavilion on how climate change affects the Arctic, permafrost and wetlands. The Bolin Center for Climate Research is one of the co-organizers of this pavilion. The purpose of the Cryosphere Pavilion is to serve as a focal point for research, communication and conversations about the cryosphere (sea ice, glaciers, snow and permafrost). He will also try to sit and listen in cases where negotiations are open to participating researchers. What do you hope COP27 will result in? 'Overall, I hope that more countries will advertise, and argue for, more ambitious emission reductions (so-called nationally determined contributions). There will be important negotiations around 'loss and damage', i.e. how developed countries with a large emission debt will take economic and moral responsibility for the damage caused by climate change. Other important issues concern how the use of coal as an energy source can be quickly reduced and a potential common global market for emission rights. For the Bolin Center, I hope that we can get out our important research results to decision-makers, officials and other organizations', says Gustaf Hugelius. Read about Gustaf Hugelius' research.

Joining fellow organisations who are members of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, the letter warns that without urgent action on climate change there will be catastrophic harms to health, but with action there will be global benefits to health. Commenting on the letter, Claire said: 'The impact of climate change on health is becoming more and more stark, especially in the global south. The letter published today demonstrates there is consensus from healthcare leaders across the UK that health should be a priority at COP27 and that urgent action is needed to bring down emissions'. 'We hope that our calls are listened to and put into action by our political leaders at the COP27 negotiations'. Referencing the 2022 Lancet Countdown published in October, the leaders say that despite the health harms of global warming, governments and companies continue to prioritise fossil fuels to the detriment of people's health. At the same time, high-income countries have failed to deliver the US$ 100 billion commitment to support a just transition. They say, ' COP27 will be a pivotal point for national governments to demonstrate how they will deliver and implement legislation and policies in their home countries to meet obligations to the Paris Agreement, and to make progress in the four priority areas of mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance.' The letter outlines specific policy recommendations for global and national implementation and highlights the recent publication of an editorial co-authored by 16 African biomedical journal editors saying, 'it is imperative that the suffering of frontline nations is at the core of COP27 negotiations because in an interconnected world, environmental shocks in vulnerable nations have severe consequences for all nations.'

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK201","Fossil fuel demands take Cop27 talks to the wire","November 20, 2022 Sunday","The Independent - Daily Edition","Dozens of countries have demanded that the final Cop27 pact should put the world on a path to phasing out all fossil fuels as negotiations went down to the wire on Saturday, The latest draft agreement from the Sharm el-Sheikh summit has failed once again to include a call to wind down fossil fuel use, the primary cause of the global climate crisis. Late on Saturday afternoon, the High Ambition Coalition (HAC), an informal group of around 60 countries including small island states and vulnerable nations, demanded more. ""We must emerge from Cop27 with a package of outcomes that keeps 1.5C alive and protects the world's vulnerable,"" said Tina Stege, the Marshall Islands climate envoy said. She was joined at the briefing by Alok Sharma, the British MP and Cop26 president, and Jennifer Morgan, Germany's climate envoy, among others. 1.5C is the more ambitious global temperature limit of the 2015 Paris Agreement, where all countries also pledged to hold global warming ""well below 2C"". At Cop27 , reports have emerged of major fossil fuel users including Brazil, China and Russia and Gulf states backsliding on this goal. Many small island states and African nations say that failure to keep 1.5C ""alive"" would be a death sentence for their communities. Ms Stege said that to keep 1.5C in reach, the Cop27 decision must reflect the latest scientific findings that require emissions to peak by 2025 at the latest. ""This Cop decision must put the world on a path to phasing out all fossil fuels, and an urgent just transition to renewables,"" she added. The coalition also said that it was not acceptable for the ""Sharm"" agreement to go backwards on what had been agreed last year in Glasgow and needed to be more ambitious. Along with a commitment to 1.5C, a fund for loss and damage caused by the climate crisis in vulnerable countries was also ""fundamental"", HAC said, along with swift action to get it up and running by next year. ""But one without the other doesn't make sense because otherwise we will be accepting catastrophe and not pushing forward towards avoiding the worst of climate change,"" Colombian minister and HAC member Susana Muhamad said. ""We don't resign ourselves to not achieving what we need to achieve otherwise we will be telling the world that there's nothing we can do anymore."" Earlier this week, India, supported by other countries and the European Union, proposed a statement on ""phasing down"" all fossil fuels in the Cop27 ""cover text"" - which functions as the world's collective vision on progressing the climate fight and must be signed off by all parties. But the latest draft, published on Saturday, had no reference to ""phasing out"" or ""phasing down"" of fossil fuels. Instead, it calls for countries to accelerate ""efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"". The language is a repeat of the Glasgow Climate Pact made at Cop26, and ""very weak"" in ambition, analysts said. Tom Evans, policy adviser with think tank E3G, said that several fossil-fuel-dependent economies, including Saudi Arabia and China, want the Cop27 agreement to focus on emissions overall, instead of energy sources. And while the rhetoric may have been strong on fossil fuels by some in public, a number of countries, including the United States, didn't champion the issue inside the negotiation rooms, he added. Climate activists have lambasted the lack of progress at the conference. ""The fossil fuel industry and the elites in their pocket rallied to take over Cop27 ,"" said Catherine Abreu, founder and director of Destination Zero, which campaigns for a move away from fossil fuels. ""This is the last act of desperate men who first denied climate science, then delayed climate policy, and now want to usurp real climate solutions with false ones. It's unfortunate this Cop failed to live up to the science of 1.5C by addressing the root cause of the climate crises - coal, oil and gas. But don't be fooled: their actions won't stall the inevitable progress unfolding on the ground away from fossil fuels and toward efficient, renewable energy."" Additional reporting by Stuti Mishra \"

Whether or not this is of interest to aspiring vegans is a matter of choice but, in the spirit of COP 27 There is no longer any excuse for ignoring the fact that a plant based diet is better for the health of the planet, as well as being better for human health. While once again making my voice heard on the subject of man-made climate change, it really worries me when I overhear conversations in which some of the participants appear to be suggesting that fossil fuels are not to blame for rapidly melting glaciers and the polar ice caps. As reported in last Tuesday's Lynn News, exhibitions planned to mark the 70th anniversary of the 1953 floods, appear to be intended to calm the fears of people who might have to move out of their homes in the event of a similar tidal surge.

As a result, MDBs tend to undersupply instruments and deal structures that would crowd in the private sector and encourage greater co-investment. In my view, a far greater importance needs to be given to mobilising total investment into EMDEs, and this requires a revamping of the incentive structure of the MDBs and the development finance institutions (DFIs) so that they focus on mobilising private capital. \~ A number of MDBs made a HYPERLINK https://www.eib.org/attachments/press/cop27-mdb-joint-statement-en.pdf joint statement at COP27 , pledging that they would expand their support for countries\' climate transition efforts through a number of measures, HYPERLINK https://www.esginvestor.net/live/cop27-mdbs-pledge-integrated-support-for-transition including mobilising blended finance vehicles.

The UK said it would allow some debt payment deferrals for countries hit by climate disasters, while Austria and New Zealand put forward funding for loss and damage, which is the cost of rebuilding in poorer nations after unavoidable climate impacts. The provision of funding by rich, polluting nations to those vulnerable nations that have done little to cause the climate crisis is HYPERLINK central to any success at HYPERLINK Cop27 . Beating global heating requires every nation to act but without progress on finance, developing countries will not trust developed countries and collective action will fail. The UK said its export credit agency, which loans money to overseas buyers of British goods and services, will become the first agency to include  climate resilient debt clauses in its lending. These stop debt payments for two years if a nation is hit by a climate disaster, freeing up funds to deal with the emergency.  Climate shocks are increasing in frequency and severity which is why we are supporting countries hit hardest, said James Cartlidge, a UK Treasury minister.  In the wake of a disaster, they face painful trade-offs between rebuilding their communities and making debt repayments. The move was strongly backed by Avinash Persaud, a special envoy to the Barbados prime minister, Mia Mottley, the most prominent backer of HYPERLINK major reforms to the global financial system to deliver climate finance.  Adopting these clauses in debt instruments is the single most impactful way of making the international financial system fitter for the new world of shocks and for international development. I cannot commend this initiative by the UK government enough. Mottley\' s Bridgetown Agenda, which sets out sweeping proposed reforms to the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral development banks (MDBs), received the backing of France at Cop27 . That is significant as it is the first developed country to support the agenda.

The latter is the most controversial and has been blocked for years by rich nations who fear being liable for huge sums of compensation. Scotland was the first nation to break what campaigners called a  taboo on providing loss and damage money, followed by Denmark, Belgium and Germany. Austria joined the group on Tuesday at Cop27 , HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/cop27-austria-commits-50-mln-climate-loss-damage-2022-11-08/ pledging $50m (\£344m).

Emily Wilkinson, of the ODI thinktank, said:  The growing number of country pledges on loss and damage funding are significant and welcome. We expect more countries to pledge during Cop27 . This puts further pressure on negotiators to agree to the development of an appropriate financing mechanism. The creation of a loss and damage fund is a key demand of developing nations at Cop27 . However, the millions being pledged are far short of the sums that will be needed, which could run to $1tn a year under some estimates. Mottley raised the idea at Cop27 of a 10% tax on soaring fossil fuel profits to fund loss and damage.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK210","New carbon accounting standards crucial in matching changing climate investment landscape","November 1, 2022 Tuesday","FinancialWire","Specific accounting standards are urgently needed for new asset types such as certified carbon offset credits, according to a new report from Imperial College Business School. The report shows how emerging global carbon markets and new investable assets make the need for new accounting regulations more pressing in the fight against climate change. New accounting standards will be a major step towards achieving ""transparency"" the researchers note, pointing to the need for openness in accounting practices ahead of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) which opens on 6 November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Despite the lack of clarity around accounting standards, in 2021 global carbon markets grew to a record EUR 760 billion ($ 851 billion). With discussions around greenhouse gas emissions reduction set to continue at COP27 , the report proves timely, with accounting standards - particularly around carbon credits - widely considered crucial to scaling up carbon markets and achieving net zero by 2050. According to the report, Financial Accounting for Carbon Finance: A New Standard for a New Paradigm, from Imperial's Centre for Climate Finance Investment, the changing investment landscape demands new accounting standards. In particular, certified carbon offset credits (also known as carbon offsets) - measurable emissions reductions from certified climate action initiatives - remain misunderstood as financial instruments, which creates a barrier to standard setting in this space. Authored by Ra\'fal Rosales, a Senior Executive Fellow at the Centre for Climate Finance Investment at Imperial College Business School and Mar\'eda Angeles Pel\'e1ez, Global Head of Accounting Regulatory Reporting at Spanish bank BBVA, the report assesses the current accounting framework for global carbon markets under IFRS, the global standard-setting in accounting, and makes several policy recommendations. Dr Rosales, via the report, notes that the current lack of clarity and guidelines around carbon markets' financial accounting and risk management has significant implications for banks' regulatory capital requirements in their role as intermediaries in the emissions trading system. According to the report, a change in accounting standards that amplifies the importance of developing a new category of financial instruments at fair value that reflects the management and goals of financial entities in their financial statements is needed. Achieving all of this, Rosales notes, starts with re-thinking the definition of carbon offsets. Rather than being classed as intangible assets or inventories, carbon offsets should be considered as investable assets used as part of a bank's offering to corporate clients for 'offsetting' and 'hedging' purposes. The report was created with the support of the Singapore Green Finance Centre, which is co-managed by Imperial and Singapore Management University, and strategic insights from financial firms, banks, asset managers, and senior officials from policymakers. Reflecting on the report, Dr Rosales says: ""We need accounting standards that reflect both the market at present as well as the direction that it is going in. With such markets evolving rapidly, there is an urgent need for the establishment of a carbon instruments accounting project in the near term. This report is timely as it coincides with the new sustainability reporting standards being developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). It is crucial to develop new financial accounting standards alongside these, to achieve global harmonization. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is in our opinion the most qualified international body to address this."" The report is published a year on from the IFRS Foundation's unveiling of the ISSB at COP26, which took place in Glasgow in late 2021. Aware of this timeline, Dr Rosales adds: ""Last year, we witnessed a major milestone moment: the announcement of the ISSB at COP26. A year later, now is the time to build on that development. ""As this report highlights, markets are changing. As such, standards too are evolving. This report offers policymakers and those operating within the industry a number of valuable recommendations to ensure that, amongst all of this change, transparency remains.""

Many of the bottles pictured feature the distinctive red label of Coca-Cola, the global multinational that has been allowed to sponsor the event despite producing 120bn plastic bottles a year and facing claims it is one of the world's worst polluters. Sharm, which is visited by hundreds of thousands of British holidaymakers a year, was given a green makeover ready for the start of the COP27 conference, with a new fleet of busses that run on natural gas, charging stations for electric cars, a multi-million pound solar park, mass clean ups and a drive to use reusable plastics.

The 33ft high and 39ft wide structure - constructed in the Giza desert to mimic the ancient pyramids - was created by eco startup Zero Co with the help of Egyptian environmental group VeryNile. A study 'Coming To Grips With Plastic, Egypt's Waste management Challenge' published earlier this year by the Economist Impact and the Nippon Foundation concluded: 'Egypt is awash in plastic. 'So are its river and coastal waters, including those of the Nile, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea... 'This leakage, as well as the large amounts of discarded plastic bottles, bags and other items littering Egypt's city streets and tourist areas, is the result of a poorly functioning system of plastics management.' Ola Elhoufy of YouThinkGreen-Egypt, which is seeking long term solutions to plastic use, said the lack of recycling facilities was a major problem 'It's not easy. Recycling is not commonplace in Egypt. 'It's not done as a matter of course during garbage collections so it's down to the individual to find a recycling centre, but these are often not easily available.' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Meanwhile over 75 per cent of fish bought from local sellers in Cairo contained microplastics in their digestive tract, a 2020 study found. It made Nile River fish in the Egyptian capital 'potentially among the most in danger of consuming micro plastics worldwide', the report by researchers at Denmark's Roskilde University found. John Hocevar, oceans campaign director at Greenpeace USA, said: 'It is baffling that Coca-Cola - the world's biggest plastic polluter in all global brand audits - will sponsor this year's COP. 'This partnership undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor.' Coke sold 275 million drinks in Egypt in 2020 bringing revenues of \£3300,000,000. As well as the waste, Coke said Packaging represents around 30 per cent of our carbon footprint. Announcing the sponsorship with Coke in late September, Egyptian Ambassador Achraf Ibrahim, who is in charge of the financial aspects of COP27 , highlighted the major role played by the international private sector in promoting sustainable business models and supporting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. A Coca-Cola spokesman said: 'We share the goal of eliminating waste from the ocean and appreciate efforts to raise awareness about this challenge. We are prepared to do our part and have set ambitious goals for our business, starting with helping to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one we sell - regardless of where it comes from - by 2030. 'Our support for COP 27 is in line with our science-based target to reduce absolute carbon emissions 25 per cent by 2030, and our ambition for net zero carbon emissions by 2050.' \"

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK216","Cop27: The key points so far","November 8, 2022 Tuesday 1:01 AM GMT","thetimes.co.uk","Cop27 has been billed as the world\' s last chance to prevent global warming of more than 1.5C above historic levels, but progress since last year\' s summit in Glasgow has stalled. Recent analysis has shown we are on course for between 2.4C and 2.8C because new plans by countries have been too weak. The more than 120 heads of state gathered in HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cop27-egypt-when-agenda-dates-king-charles-brkvxkhl Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt , will address more than just emissions, however, with reparations for the global south, biodiversity and deforestation all on the table until the conference ends on November 18. Despite the attendance of President Biden, many European leaders  and even Boris Johnson  the absence of Greta Thunberg, who attended HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/did-cop26-achieve-goals-success-failure-cop27-chlwpp2h Cop 26 , and of Larry Fink, chairman of Blackrock, have lent the impression that this summit is less star-studded than that in Glasgow. Key points on Wednesday, November 9 Gas race after Putin\' s invasion threatens 1.5C climate goal A dash for gas as countries scramble to secure energy supplies after Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine risks derailing efforts to meet the world\' s 1.5C climate change target, researchers have warned. In a report published at the Cop27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh today, the Climate Action Tracker group found that greater use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is putting the Paris Agreement\' s headline goal at risk. LNG is a carbon-intensive fuel that involves supercooling natural gas to -162C, shipping it and returning it to a gaseous state at dedicated port terminals. Germany, previously a major importer of Russian gas, is among the nations building new LNG terminals. Climate Action Tracker said the resulting CO emissions from LNG projects planned between 2021 and 2050 would eat up 10 per cent of the total the world can emit before breaching the 1.5C goal.  There\' s really a shocking amount of LNG under construction, proposed and approved. It surprised us that there is so much. It\' s a non-trivial problem, said Bill Hare, an author of the report. The expansion of LNG supply will lead to 1.9 billion tonnes of CO a year above what the International Energy Agency has said is needed to hold temperature rises to 1.5C. About 70 per cent of the LNG is expected to be supplied from North America, led by the US. Germany and Italy are among the countries expected to see the biggest increase in capacity to import LNG. The UK is already home to three of the biggest LNG terminals in Europe. Climate Action Tracker also found that governments had failed to  revisit and strengthen their national climate plans, a promise they made at last year\' s talks in Glasgow. Those plans were expected to lead to 2.4C of warming by 2100. But despite Australia and a handful of other countries issuing new plans in the year since Glasgow, the figure today still stands at 2.4C.  It\' s not good. We came out of Glasgow with countries promising to do more. It\' s very disappointing progress all around, said Hare. That frustration was echoed by the EU on the HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cop27-summary-key-points-day-speech-climate-change-m28wx670p fourth day of talks at HYPERLINK Cop27 . Jacob Werksman, a senior EU climate official, said:  The EU comes to these negotiations with a strong sense of urgency, as a result of what the latest science has shown us, as a result of the summer that we\' ve all experienced around the world, of extreme impacts. Formal talks have also begun on the issue of  loss and damage , the principle that rich countries that have caused most of the climate change to date should eventually pay for the damages caused by extreme weather. In an unusual twist for closed-door talks usually led by officials, private negotiations started with an intervention by Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. He earlier used a public speech to say that fossil fuel firms should contribute to a loss and damage fund, echoing calls by Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados. Key points on Tuesday, November 8 Egyptian MP heckles sister of activist on hunger strike An Egyptian MP heckled Sanaa Seif, the sister of a British-Egyptian activist detained by Cairo, as she held a press conference at Cop27 (Ben Cooke writes.) Seif was pleading for the UK government to put pressure on the Egyptian government to prove that her brother, HYPERLINK Alaa Abd el-Fattah , was still alive when Amr Darwish, an MP, interrupted her to say that the case was a matter for the Egyptian government. Fattah, an activist arrested by Egyptian authorities in September 2019, then convicted of spreading false news and sentenced to five years in jail, has been on hunger strike since April. He has refused to drink water since Sunday, the first day of the Cop27 conference. Rishi Sunak yesterday expressed his  deep concern about Fattah\' s imprisonment to President Sisi of Egypt. Before the interruption Seif had told spectators that  right here in this conference centre Egypt\' s foreign minister, who is also the Cop president, has been giving interviews saying there\' s nothing to worry about and that the prisons have medical facilities.  President Sisi made a commitment to President Macron that Alaa\' s health will be preserved. These statements really worry me. Are they force-feeding my brother right now? Is he handcuffed in a bed, put on IVs against his will?  This is what it sounds like to me. We know that they are happy for him to die; the only thing they care about is that it doesn\' t happen while the world is watching. When she invited questions from the audience Darwish took the microphone and asked why Seif had described her brother as a political prisoner. He accused the family of resorting to foreign pressure and Fattah of summoning foreign pressure to attack the Egyptian military.He was escorted out by UN security officials. Companies\' net zero pledges should not be taken seriously if they invest in new fossil fuels, UN says Companies pledging to reach net zero emissions should no longer be taken seriously if they keep investing in new fossil fuel supply, a UN-backed group of experts has concluded (Adam Vaughan writes.) In a first step to imposing regulation on a  wild west of corporate net zero targets, the group laid out a series of red lines to prevent  dishonest climate accounting .  Net zero is entirely incompatible with continued investment in fossil fuels, the 17 experts said in a report published at the Cop27 climate summit. They said companies trying to eliminate their emissions could no longer buy cheap carbon offsets, fail to count all their emissions - such as oil firms counting emissions from rigs but not from their customers burning petrol in cars - or engage in lobbying that undermined ambitious government climate policies. Antonio Guterres, UN secretary general, said:  We must have zero tolerance for net zero greenwashing. Governments are under growing pressure to force universal standards and accounting rules on net zero targets. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Michael Bloomberg, the businessman, are working together to create a new digital data portal where corporate pledges can be interrogated. Recent polling has found that eight out of ten large businesses across five continents back regulation of net zero targets. Guterres said:  The problem is that the criteria and benchmarks for these net zero commitments have varying levels of rigour and loopholes wide enough to drive a diesel truck through. Catherine McKenna, chairwoman of the net zero expert group, told The Times that firms could no longer get away with failure to count all emissions, or rely on targets that reduce the intensity of emissions but not the absolute amount. She said:  You need to cover all your emissions. We\' ve seen a lot of companies are only doing a percentage of their emissions, in particular they\' re not doing emissions across their supply chain. And you need to reduce your actual emissions. While intensity can be an important measure, the planet cares about emissions actually going down, she said. Cop27 president announces first comprehensive plan for adaptation The president of Cop27 , Sameh Shoukry, has announced the first comprehensive plan to help the world adapt to the impact of climate change (Ben Cooke writes). The Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda calls for countries to undertake 30 actions to  address the adaptation gap and achieve a resilient world by 2030 . The agenda\' s focus is on reducing the impacts of climate change on the 4 billion people living in countries most vulnerable to it. These actions are intended to reduce the threat of climate change to several areas of society, including agriculture, urban areas, and coastlines. They include halving food waste, adopting climate-resilient agricultural methods such as growing heat-resistant crops, installing early warning systems to alert people to oncoming climate disasters, and investing $4 billion in the restoration of mangrove forests that protect coastlines from flooding. They also include providing electricity access to 679 million people currently without access, and improving water infrastructure to reduce leaks. Shoukry described the agenda as  a critical step at Cop27 , the implementation Cop . As climate change progresses, limiting its damage increasingly involves adapting to the warming that has already happened. A report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in February, showed that even if the world achieves its goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, by 2030 nearly half of the world\' s population will be at severe risk from the impact. Key points on Monday 7 November Gas supply deal with US Rishi Sunak is set to announce a gas deal with America at the end of the Cop27 climate conference (Harry Taylor writes). The US will sell billions of cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Britain, according to The Daily Telegraph. Sunak hopes that this will help to ease Britain\' s energy security worries amid the war between Russia and Ukraine. Warnings have been given of possible blackouts this winter. Russia had been a big source of LNG but countries in Europe have snubbed Russian supplies since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. About 17 per cent of the UK\' s gas in 2021 was LNG, mainly from Qatar, the US and Russia. The  energy security partnership with the US will be announced on November 18, reports suggest. Yesterday the prime minister told Cop27 that world leaders needed to  live up to their promise to tackle climate change. A Whitehall source said that the deal meant gas would be provided  over the next year . HYPERLINK Tackle climate change for sake of world economy, Sunak urges HYPERLINK Cop27 Co-operate or perish, says UN head The UN secretary-general has called on China and the US to help to forge a solidarity pact at the Cop27 conference, as he warned that the world was on a  highway to climate hell (Adam Vaughan writes). Antonio Guterres said his mooted climate solidarity pact between richer and poorer countries would have steeper emissions cuts this decade, high-income nations providing more finance for low and middle-income nations to switch to renewables, and an end to coal in wealthy countries by 2030 and everywhere else by 2040.  This is our only hope of meeting our climate goals. Humanity has a choice: co-operate or perish, Guterres said.  It is either a climate solidarity pact  or a collective suicide pact. Cop27 agenda yesterday, with the backing of the UK and despite fears that the US and other rich countries could block it. However, discussions are proceeding on the basis that any outcome will be about co-operation, not agreeing liability or compensation.  Loss and damage can no longer be swept under the rug. It is a moral imperative. Those who contributed least to the climate crisis are reaping the whirlwind sown by others, Guterres said. Britain has moral and economic duty to tackle climate change, Sunak says Britain faces both a moral responsibility and an economic necessity to tackle climate change, Rishi Sunak has warned, as he made HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-gavin-williamson-cop-27-egypt-latest-news-k9nbt83xw his first speech on the international stage . In an address to other world leaders the prime minister said despite a deteriorating global economy, countries like Britain had to fulfil their financial commitments to help developing countries decarbonise. And he added that in the wake of Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine  climate security now went  hand in hand with energy security with an ever greater need to invest in renewable energy.  They are a reason to act faster because diversifying our energy supplies by investing in renewables is precisely the way to insure ourselves against the risks of energy dependency. Sunak said countries like the UK also had a  moral responsibility to HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-gavin-williamson-cop-27-egypt-latest-news-k9nbt83xw help developing countries decarbonise , saying that he  profoundly believed it was  the right thing to do . Johnson takes a swipe at short-lived Tory fracking plans Boris Johnson arrived at Cop27 and made an immediate swipe at Liz Truss\' s short-lived policy plans (Ben Cooke writes). Speaking at a side event yesterday, Johnson presented himself as  the spirit of Glasgow , and  a supportive spear carrier to swell the chorus . He refused to comment on the timing of his visit, appearing on the same day as Rishi Sunak, saying that the changing climate was not interested in the  microcosmographia of British politics. But in an apparent swipe at members of his own party, he took aim at those who seek to  frack the hell out of the British countryside . He argued that the spike in oil and gas prices after Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine  led some naysayers to adopt a corrosive cynicism about net zero .  People have drawn the conclusion that the whole project of net zero needs to be delayed, mothballed, and put on ice, and for instance we need to reopen coal fired power stations and frack the hell out of the British countryside. I believe here at Sharm is a moment when we really have to tackle this nonsense head on.  This is not the moment to abandon the campaign for net zero. Johnson approved a moratorium on fracking in November 2019, in response to concerns by environmentalists worried about its impact on the climate, and local residents unwilling to have it on their doorstep. Truss secured enough votes to lift the ban, but a large rebellion of her own MPs precipitated her resignation. Her successor, Sunak, will keep the ban in place.

The Roundtable gathered high-level attendees from a host of impactful philanthropies such as Gates Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund, African Climate Foundation, Sawiris Foundation, Community Jameel and Bloomberg Philanthropies among others. It provided an opportunity for potential philanthropic contributions with transformational power in key COP27 Presidency initiatives and expanded the dialogue around the role of philanthropies in mobilizing climate finance and adaptation ambitions. 'The important role of Philanthropic actors is consistently growing, and there is a need to consolidate and develop partnerships with philanthropies and harness it towards mobilizing more resources and help unlock greater climate finance ambition, especially the areas that suffer from major deficits such as adaptation. At COP27 we welcome catalytic contributions from philanthropic partners', said Egypt Foreign Minister and COP27 President-designate Sameh Shoukry ahead of this upcoming convening. Shoukry, added: 'Climate change is at the intersection of several global challenges that require the role of philanthropies in climate solutions. The COP27 Philanthropy Roundtable has brought together representatives from leading organizations in the region and beyond to build aligned strategies for scaling of strategic investments in Africa and beyond and provide a space for funder-to-funder networking and new partnerships. While some governments have stepped up their action and others will hopefully follow suit, the fact remains that the global effort against climate change will benefit from the complementary contributions from and collaboration with all non-party stakeholders across the board. Philanthropies can play a key role in elevating and supporting progress towards COP27 outcomes, and thus the COP27 Presidency is keen to facilitate greater coordination and deeper dialogue with the global philanthropic community.' Recent research has shown that climate and adjacent environmental areas such as air, water and land conservation receive only 2% of the US$ 730 billion global philanthropic grant funding compared with major categories such as health, public safety, community and economic development, and education. A recent estimate suggests that a 10x increase in philanthropic giving to addressing climate change could deliver an extra USD$ 131 billion a year towards helping save lives and livelihoods. Participants also discussed five COP27 Presidency's initiatives which included the Food Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation Initiative (FAST); the Global Waste Initiative 50 by 2050; the African Facility for Just Equitable Energy Transitions; the Decent Life Initiative for a Climate Resilient Africa; and the Sharm El-Sheikh Guidebook on Just Financing.

The privately owned Youm7 website said the rally in Sharm el-Sheikh was a show of solidarity with the MP who criticised Sanaa Seif, the youngest sister of jailed activist Alaa Abdel Fatah, during a press conference to raise awareness about her brother's situation on the sidelines of COP27 . During the press conference on 8 November, Darwish said that Alaa was being held over criminal charges and that his sister is using external powers to exert pressure on the Egyptian authorities to release him. The privately owned Mada Masr news site shared video of the incident on Twitter and cited Darwish as criticising Alaa for attacking ""his own army, police, people and shaming Egypt's women"". Amnesty International has been critical of what it described as the ""human rights crisis"" in Egypt. It said in a report on 6 November that the arrest of ""hundreds of people in the past two weeks alone in connection to calls for protests during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), is a reminder of the grim reality of Egypt's policy of mass arbitrary detention to crush dissent"". The rights group also said that Alaa's life is at risk, and called for his release. Sanaa's speech triggered opposing reactions in Egyptian media. The reactions in opposition media were dominated by widespread criticism of the Egyptian authorities, and such outlets described her speech as exposing ""the injustice"" and ""criminality of the regime"". Pro-government media and social media users supportive of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi criticised Sanaa for using the power of the West - especially the UK where she has citizenship - against her country and ""insulting the Egyptian citizenship"".

The Sharm el-Sheikh summit is almost certain to continue into Saturday \- and perhaps even Sunday \- as countries remain divided on how to tackle some of the biggest issues of the climate crisis. An alert was sent to delegates late on Thursday to inform them that essential services, such as transport and food stalls, would run until midnight on Sunday. Some exhausted attendees raced to the Egypt Air counter inside the venue to change their flights. The conference halls had largely emptied out, and many of those remaining came to the venue with bags and suitcases after hotel stays ran out. Country pavilions, set up to tout their climate progress, began closing on Thursday, leaving an eerie silence behind. And despite assurances by the Cop27 presidency, some services have become challenging to track down. Water filters, touch and go throughout the conference, had run out entirely in some areas. On the bright side, queues for food stalls were much shorter. It\' s not unusual for Cop summits to run over. Eight of the 10 previous Cops have been extended, HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/joejgoodman/status/1592485619720413184?t=vuTJAsZQyFoWW12qmlWCkg&s=19 according to a Carbon Brief analysis.

At Cop26 in Scotland last year, the final Glasgow Climate Pact was not signed off by all countries until more than 24 hours after the official end time. As of Friday evening, there was still only a first draft of the Cop27 agreement. It was littered with placeholders on major issues including on a funding arrangement to pay for the loss and damage suffered by vulnerable countries because of climate change.

Under the theme, Supporting Climate Resilience and a Just Energy Transition in Africa, this year's report highlights climate change as a growing threat to lives and livelihoods in Africa. In a video message during one of the sessions, president and Chief Executive Officer of Bezos Earth Fund, Andrew Steer, urged African and world leaders to think bolder and work more creatively together as they prepare for COP 27 , which will take place in Egypt. Steer, a former World Bank Special Envoy for Climate Change believes that COP 27 gives the world an incredible opportunity to think big about Africa. ""We need to make it Africa's COP. So, what the African Development Bank and the Atlantic Council are trying to do to raise awareness is exceedingly important."" He described the 2022 African Economic Outlook as £n excellent report.' ""It lays out beautifully this sobering time for Africa in particular, but actually for the whole world - a slowing world economy, the perfect storm of rising food prices and energy prices, interest rates, and shocking increases in the impact of climate change and green vulnerability at a time that international resources are not what they need to be."" In a presentation on the report, Acting Chief Economist Urama called for policy coordination and a more holistic approach to tackling climate change. ""We have been losing 5% to 15% of GDP per capita growth in Africa because of climate change, and that is in addition to other issues that climate change is driving on the continent,"" Urama said. ""Amid these difficulties lie opportunities for innovation. Let's think big, act big, and save the planet."" ""As we prepare for COP 27 , honoring the 2009 $ 100 billion yearly climate finance commitment that high-income countries promised to developing countries will help to restore confidence that we are serious about climate change, even though it is not enough."" Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Tyler Beckelman, said the African Economic Outlook ""cogently and convincingly captures the very real and urgent challenges to realizing a just energy transition in Africa."" ""Make no mistake- the crisis is already here,"" Beckelman cautioned. ""Four failed rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa- with a fifth likely to occur this summer- is a direct result of a warming climate, and sadly, it may become the norm."" He said the United States would ensure that its African partners have the ability and resources to develop the foundation for a sustainable and low-carbon economy that provides ample energy for growth. He added: ""While the challenges are enormous, we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Sustained investments in adaptation and mitigation, through renewable energy and climate-smart land use practices, will help provide a pathway for African countries to develop innovative ways, building a more just and equitable future for people across the continent."" Senior Director of the Atlantic Council, Africa Centre, Rama Yade, observed that it has become more important to look at Africa and climate change. The event featured a panel discussion on the report, comprising Anthony Simpasa, Acting Manager of the African Development Bank's Macroeconomic Policy, Debt Sustainability and Forecasting Division; Ayaan Adam, Senior Director and CEO of AFC Capital Partners at the Africa Finance Corporation; Jeffrey Krilla, Vice President for Global Public Policy and Government Affairs, Kosmos Energy; and Queen Quinn, Founding Partner at Kupanda Capital. The African Economic Outlook report 2022 ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/2Z1dRwt https://bit.ly/2Z1dRwt ) provides evidence-based policy options for driving inclusive growth by building climate resilience and a just energy transition in Africa.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK226","OPINION -COP27 was criticised, but what did it get right?","November 23, 2022 Wednesday 9:40 AM GMT","standard.co.uk","There has been a lot of criticism of COP27 , just as there was for COP26 in Glasgow and each COP before. As a planet, we are simply not doing enough to roll back, halt or even start to limit climate change. This justifiably results in boiling rage, particularly from young people about the damage done and the lack of action by those in power. Aside from an important reparations fund, alas the showstopper outputs I hoped for this year (just as in previous years) did not materialise. And yet I am an optimist about our chances of putting things right. And despite the frustrations and disappointments at the outcomes, COP27 has increased my optimism. For a start, we already know that there is strong but under-reported evidence that actions (when taken) can help the planet heal itself. I am advised by my scientist colleague that after landmark legislation and practical changes in the 1990s, damage to the ozone layer that shocked a previous generation has been significantly and substantially repaired. I draw strength from this knowledge. I also believe in the power of a groundswell of people working together to make changes now and every day in the future until collective objectives are achieved. The question -what did you do to help address climate change? -has become a legitimate one for all of us. Many will already be able to answer affirmatively in the future that when it was their turn, they stepped up. So, in the spirit of optimism, rather than dwell on COP27 \' s well-documented challenges I prefer to highlight what I think the world\' s most significant annual climate change event got right. The interactions and networking that took place in COP\' s two-week run were extraordinary. I firmly believe that the bonds made will result in positive change and the means, understanding and will for activists to offer a meaningful and resilient challenge to those who resist action on climate change for years to come. Also, in terms of well-being, enthusiasm and drive, despite their frustrations, many thousands of the 40,000 attendees hopefully had their reserves of will and energy recharged just by being there and feeling part of such an immense and collaborative effort. I believe that the knowledge shared and gained will have been immense. And that life-changing lightbulb moments will have occurred for many individuals including those with power and influence and those in control of large budgets and fortunes. I confidently predict that these people and their new ideas and attitudes will have major and significant outcomes for the world that can change everything for the better. Many will have thought about how they can change an existing business. Particularly one that is a heavy polluter or spends thousands of hours making superfluous products or services that the world doesn\' t really need. Their work will be tough and at times frustrating but meaningful all the same and as long as they remember to celebrate small wins this will help them maintain the stamina and the drive they will need to succeed. I wish them well. COP27 will also have inspired people who are currently wondering how they might start a business focused on making money by providing answers and solutions to address climate change. These people in my opinion have an important role ahead as green capitalists. The opportunity and upside ahead of them are unlimited both financially and in terms of possible delivery and outputs. I firmly believe that addressing climate change is the greatest single business opportunity that has ever existed. As such, all entrepreneurs should be looking at this now. I call this green capitalism, fully aware that this is a term that has been used in the past with a variety of interpretations. My own view is that it is already a movement of business people and others newly invigorated by COP27 who believe in the power of making money by throwing in their energy, knowledge, networks and capital to address climate change. This might be unpalatable to some. After all, should people really need to be financially compensated for doing the right thing? Others might be reluctant joiners. But it is a practical solution and we are so late in the game we have no choice but to appeal to the many, not the few. A belief in green capitalism might bring talented people and get them to refocus. By the way, I think this is already happening for young people, but my particular hope is that mid-career people will do the same. HYPERLINK ""https://carbonaires.com/\\"" title=\\""https://carbonaires.com/"" Carbonaires , the business of which I am a co-founder and CEO, started as a group of mid-career partners who stopped what they were doing and took action. As such, I urge everyone who can to start a business as part of the green capitalism movement whether you were positively influenced by COP27 or not. Additionally, the most important thing that COP27 got right was raising awareness. Indeed, it was during COP27 that my own little boy asked me an amazing question. While driving to school together on a classically British autumn morning he said  Daddy, what is a climate change? . We then had a short and enlightening discussion on a profoundly moving level. And I am willing to bet that similar first interactions on climate change took place not only in this country but all around the world. The amazing work of our teachers and our schools over the last two weeks has made this happen by successfully and intuitively amplifying the messages of COP27 . Similar discussions no doubt took place among business colleagues, friends, passers-by and even commuters many millions of times over during the two weeks of COP27 . COP might not be perfect, but it gets people across the world talking and thinking about climate change -an issue we can no longer afford to ignore -and good things will come from that. \"

Buckingham Palace reported the King had sought advice on the prospect of attending COP27 during a discussion with former prime minister Liz Truss. The Palace asserted the decision for the monarch to miss the climate summit was reached with  mutual friendship and respect between the King and Ms Truss. The SNP MP continued:  The wider issue here is that the Prime Minister said he wasn\' t going to go and now, of course, he is going.  He is following in Nicola Sturgeon\' s wake and following her over to COP27 . Asked if the First Minister\' s plan to attend the UN Climate Change Conference had played a  key part in influencing the Prime Minister\' s change of heart, Mr Flynn suggested it had.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK229","-IAEA Shows How Nuclear Science and Technology Can Tackle Climate Change","November 22, 2022 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","From providing clean energy to protecting water resources and developing smarter agriculture, nuclear science and technology can make a significant contribution to mitigating, monitoring and adapting to the impacts of climate change. This is what the IAEA and partners demonstrated in a series of side events throughout the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The IAEA-led event space #Atoms4Climate - the first ever pavilion at a COP dedicated to the applications of nuclear science and technology - featured more than 40 events, all of which were livestreamed. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi officially opened the #Atoms4Climate pavilion on Wednesday, 9 November, at an event that brought together high level representatives from governments, international organizations, industry and civil society. The speakers included Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Ghana's Minister of Energy; Kathryn Huff, US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; Cecilia Nicolini, State Secretary of Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Innovation from Argentina; Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO); Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director General of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); and others. Mr Grossi's message to leaders at COP was that nuclear science and technology are part of the solution to both mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. 'Nuclear is here. Nuclear is already part of the solution, and nuclear will continue to be in this path,' he said. The Director General participated in numerous events organized in the framework of COP27 . On 9 November, he talked about the issues of peace, non-proliferation, climate change and energy security with William Kennedy, a senior executive editor at Bloomberg News. On the same day, he interviewed Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), and then led a panel to exchange opinions on the role of nuclear energy in achieving net zero emissions. Nuclear approach to the climate crisis The #Atoms4Climate pavilion hosted side events showing how nuclear science and technology can play a role in tackling climate change and its impacts, in areas related to energy, innovations, the ocean, water, food and climate-smart agriculture. The Clean Energy Advocacy: Engaging Stakeholders with Science to Achieve Net Zero event was joined by Richard Betts, a leading scientist from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), there are currently no credible pathways in place to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, unless an urgent and systemic transformation is achieved. Dr Betts called for all available means to slow down the global temperature rise and suggested taking advantage of the benefits offered by nuclear power. An event, Carbon Removal Using Coastal Blue Carbon Ecosystems, showed how the absorption of CO2 by the ocean provides a nature-based solution for reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. A complementary event showing the other side of the coin, Ocean Acidification Adaptation and Resilience in Africa, gathered marine experts to discuss how nuclear and isotopic techniques help assess ocean acidification. They focused on the need to support countries on the African continent in analysing the CO2 uptake of the ocean and understanding how to better protect marine resources. The Sustainable Water Resource Management: Successes and Challenges in the Sahel event focused on building capacity for managing the scarce water resources and its role in promoting regional cooperation in northern Africa's Sahel region. The IAEA assists countries in using isotope hydrology, which allows experts to track the movement of water molecules through the hydrological cycle, thereby helping address the issues of water scarcity. Other similar events focused on applying nuclear and related techniques to study and protect the world's wetlands, as well as monitoring and managing water coming from glaciers in mountainous regions. Other sessions focused on food and agriculture included a Gender-Responsive Climate Action in African Agriculture Using Nuclear Science and Technology event, which highlighted the successes and positive results in scaling up climate-smart agriculture. Experts attending the Global Action for Climate Adaptation: Science for the Future event also touched on the ways of adapting agriculture to climate change by growing drought-resistant crops with the help of plant mutation breeding.

But Therese Coffey defended him on this morning's media round. She told broadcasters: ""The government has postponed the medium term fiscal plan until November 17, I know that the prime minister is very keen to work with the chancellor very closely on this important element, and so he\' s prioritising that. ""While at the same time, of course, the UK continues to show global leadership, as opposed to just a gathering of people in Egypt."" A Downing Street spokesperson told indy100 the government was committed to supporting Cop27 and leading international action to tackle climate change and protect nature.  The UK will be fully represented by other senior ministers, as well as Cop president Alok Sharma, the spokesperson said.  They will be working to ensure that countries continue to make progress on the groundbreaking commitments made at Cop26 in Glasgow. Not a good start to a premiership. It is a simple and fundamental principle that the government derives its democratic legitimacy from the people. The future of the country must not be decided by plotting and U-turns at Westminster; it must be decided by the people in a general election. And for this reason The Independent is calling for an election to be held.

The Agency has worked with Qatar's National Committee for the Prohibition of Weapons (NCPW) over the past year to build its capacity to thwart any attack involving nuclear or other radioactive material. Any such attack during the World Cup - a championship of 64 matches held over 29 days, in 8 stadiums - could have severe consequences on people and the environment. The IAEA works with countries around the world in enhancing security of nuclear and other radioactive material that could otherwise be used in a terrorist act.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK235","-IAEA Shows How Nuclear Science and Technology Can Tackle Climate Change","November 22, 2022 Tuesday","M2 PressWIRE","November 22, 2022 Release date- 21112022 - From providing clean energy to protecting water resources and developing smarter agriculture, nuclear science and technology can make a significant contribution to mitigating, monitoring and adapting to the impacts of climate change. This is what the IAEA and partners demonstrated in a series of side events throughout the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The IAEA-led event space #Atoms4Climate - the first ever pavilion at a COP dedicated to the applications of nuclear science and technology - featured more than 40 events, all of which were livestreamed. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi officially opened the #Atoms4Climate pavilion on Wednesday, 9 November, at an event that brought together high level representatives from governments, international organizations, industry and civil society. The speakers included Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Ghana's Minister of Energy; Kathryn Huff, US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; Cecilia Nicolini, State Secretary of Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Innovation from Argentina; Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO); Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director General of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); and others. Mr Grossi's message to leaders at COP was that nuclear science and technology are part of the solution to both mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. 'Nuclear is here. Nuclear is already part of the solution, and nuclear will continue to be in this path,' he said. The Director General participated in numerous events organized in the framework of COP27 . On 9 November, he talked about the issues of peace, non-proliferation, climate change and energy security with William Kennedy, a senior executive editor at Bloomberg News. On the same day, he interviewed Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), and then led a panel to exchange opinions on the role of nuclear energy in achieving net zero emissions. Nuclear approach to the climate crisis The #Atoms4Climate pavilion hosted side events showing how nuclear science and technology can play a role in tackling climate change and its impacts, in areas related to energy, innovations, the ocean, water, food and climate-smart agriculture. The Clean Energy Advocacy: Engaging Stakeholders with Science to Achieve Net Zero event was joined by Richard Betts, a leading scientist from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), there are currently no credible pathways in place to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, unless an urgent and systemic transformation is achieved. Dr Betts called for all available means to slow down the global temperature rise and suggested taking advantage of the benefits offered by nuclear power. An event, Carbon Removal Using Coastal Blue Carbon Ecosystems, showed how the absorption of CO2 by the ocean provides a nature-based solution for reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. A complementary event showing the other side of the coin, Ocean Acidification Adaptation and Resilience in Africa, gathered marine experts to discuss how nuclear and isotopic techniques help assess ocean acidification. They focused on the need to support countries on the African continent in analysing the CO2 uptake of the ocean and understanding how to better protect marine resources. The Sustainable Water Resource Management: Successes and Challenges in the Sahel event focused on building capacity for managing the scarce water resources and its role in promoting regional cooperation in northern Africa's Sahel region. The IAEA assists countries in using isotope hydrology, which allows experts to track the movement of water molecules through the hydrological cycle, thereby helping address the issues of water scarcity. Other similar events focused on applying nuclear and related techniques to study and protect the world's wetlands, as well as monitoring and managing water coming from glaciers in mountainous regions. Other sessions focused on food and agriculture included a Gender-Responsive Climate Action in African Agriculture Using Nuclear Science and Technology event, which highlighted the successes and positive results in scaling up climate-smart agriculture. Experts attending the Global Action for Climate Adaptation: Science for the Future event also touched on the ways of adapting agriculture to climate change by growing drought-resistant crops with the help of plant mutation breeding.

Climate finance has been one of the thorniest issues in global climate negotiations for decades, but I'm seeing four promising signs of progress at COP27 . First, the goal - getting the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to stop global warming - is clearer. The last climate conference, COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, nearly fell apart over frustration that international finance wasn't flowing to developing countries and that corporations and financial institutions were greenwashing - making claims they couldn't back up. One year on, something is stirring. In 2021, the financial sector arrived at COP26 in full force for the first time. Private banks, insurers and institutional investors HYPERLINK representing US$130 trillion HYPERLINK https://www.greenpeace.org/aotearoa/press-release/offsets-taskforce-hit-by-protest-at-cop26/ accused the financial institutions of greenwashing .

However, the public funding has been hard to lock in. Developed countries' coffers are dwindling, with governments including the U.S. unable or unwilling to maintain commitments. Now, pressure from the war in Ukraine and economic crises is adding to their problems. The lack of public funds was the impetus behind U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry's proposal to use a https://climatechangenews.com/2022/11/09/john-kerrys-offsets-plan-sets-early-test-for-un-net-zero-standards/ new form of carbon offsets Globally, voluntary carbon markets for these offsets have grown from $300 million HYPERLINK https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/the-art-of-integrity-state-of-the-voluntary-carbon-markets-q3-2022/ to $2 billion since 2019, but they are still relatively small and fragile and need more robust rules. Kerry's proposal drew criticism, pending the fine print, for fear of swamping the market with industrial credits, collapsing prices and potentially allowing companies in the developed world to greenwash their own claims by retiring coal in the developing world. New rules to strengthen carbon markets Fourth, new rules are emerging to strengthen those voluntary carbon markets. A new set of HYPERLINK ""high-integrity carbon credit principles"" is expected in 2023.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK237","Mayor in search of funding at Cop27","November 3, 2022 Thursday","Western Daily Press","BRISTOL mayor Marvin Rees will travel to Egypt next week for the Cop27 climate conference to try to raise cash from investors. He said at Cop27 Each year the United Nations hosts a global climate summit, called the Conference of Parties (Cop), to get countries around the world to work together on tackling climate change. Last year, Cop26 was held in Glasgow and this year the summit will be in Sharm El Sheikh. Mr Rees said on Tuesday that the annual climate summit was increasingly about finding investors to help pay for climate projects such as district heat networks or underground metro systems. He told Bristol City Council's cabinet: ""For the world's cities at the moment, particularly off the back of Cop26, Cop is the place where cities are going to connect with the finance they need to go on that journey of decarbonisation. ""There is no decarbonisation without investment, in retrofitting homes, putting in new heat systems, putting in heat networks, investing in mass transit systems. ""Most of the world lives in cities. They have density on offer, that offers greater efficiencies, and they can move faster than national governments. The aim has been to align finance, places and technology. But it's the financial innovation that's needed to allow the technology to be rolled out."" This year's Cop27 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak initially caused controversy by choosing not to attend, before U-turning after criticism about the government not prioritising action on climate change. But Bristol and other cities cannot rely on government funding, according to the mayor. Bristol and other British cities are attempting to raise investment for carbon-cutting projects, through a newly formed group called the Cities Commission for Climate Investment, or 3Ci for short. Mr Rees added: ""I'll be going to Cop myself, as part of 3Ci, along with Susan Aitken who is the leader of Glasgow which hosted Cop last year. ""It's not going to happen if we're reliant on government spending and government money, and it's not going to happen if we rely on the current government for making our case. We have to go there and make the case ourselves."" \"

So, in the year since Glasgow, the UK\' s leadership and hard work has continued. I am proud of what we have achieved. More than 90% of global GDP is now covered by commitments to cut net emissions to zero, up from 30% when we took on COP26 in 2019. We are increasing support for the most vulnerable people around the world. We are working hard to reduce emissions across sectors, from energy to forests, to coal and methane. And business and finance is stepping up too, to seize what is becoming a remarkable economic opportunity.We have had almost daily reminders of why this work is important. An area the size of the UK, flooded in Pakistan. The worst drought in 500 years in Europe. The worst drought in 1000 years in America. And the worst drought on record in China. All whilst Putin\' s brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine has sparked a global energy crisis, highlighting that investing in renewable energy is investing not just in climate security, but in energy security. Economic activity will become unsustainable and uninsurable, food will become more expensive and more scarce, and the pressure on people to relocate because of the climate crisis will be beyond anything we can imagine today. We must seize the ever closing window of opportunity we have to act, and to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact. If we can deliver all the commitments we secured ahead of, at and in the year since COP26, we will reduce emissions this decade by the equivalent of the entire annual emissions of America today. That is a start. But then we must go further still. That is the backdrop against which the Prime Minister and I travel to Egypt for COP27 . We will hand over our COP Presidency to Egypt, but will continue to push for the greatest ambition possible to prevent climate catastrophe.

COP 27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh closed on Sunday (20 November) in much the same manner as COP 26 did in Glasgow a year ago, with a mixture of relief among delegations that they had something to show for their two weeks at the luxury Egyptian resort, and widespread dissatisfaction among external stakeholders with what the conference had achieved. Those striving for a more sustainable, climate-friendly food system, however, may see COP 27 in a more favourable light than other observers. Agriculture and food had a substantially higher profile than at previous COPs, with the conference witnessing a number of significant announcements relating to addressing climate impacts in food and agriculture. Dedicated food pavillion For the first time at a COP there was a dedicated food and agriculture pavilion hosted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation and inter-governmental agricultural research organisation CGIAR. Also new this year was the Food Systems pavilion, hosted by an international coalition of food, agricultural and environmental NGOs, with backing from the EU, which showcased actions aimed at creating healthier, more resilient and more equitable food systems. The FAO announced during COP 27 it intends to publish, by next year&#8217;s conference, a climate plan for the agri-food sector to show how food and farming can align with the UN goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C. FAO deputy director Zitouni Ould-Dada made the commitment at an event hosted by FAIRR, an organisation advising investors on material ESG issues in the animal protein sector. As the conference drew to a close, a group of the world&#8217;s largest agricultural commodity corporations, facilitated by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), launched the Agriculture Sector Roadmap to 1.5\'b0C. The 14-strong coalition comprises leading firms from the livestock, soy and palm oil sectors, namely ADM, Amaggi, Bunge, Cargill, COFCO International, Golden Agri-Resources, JBS, Louis Dreyfus, Marfrig, Musim Mas, Olam Group, Olam Food Ingredients, Viterra and Wilmar International. Of particular note was the launch by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN), aimed at supporting the development of &#8220;win-win&#8221; policy solutions that help tackle climate change and improve nutrition, particularly for children and vulnerable groups. FAST initiative launched The overlap between climate-friendly and healthier diets represents a fortuitous coincidence that remains relatively unexplored by policymakers or food companies alike. Even the recently launched, broad-ranging US national food strategy makes little reference to climate change while attempts to integrate environmental criteria into the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been unsuccessful. Meanwhile, in collaboration with the Egyptian COP presidency, the FAO launched the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST) initiative, aimed at facilitating financing of projects to decarbonise and boost resilience of agricultural sectors in the most vulnerable communities. Given that farming and food production account for around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, the lack of attention and investment on agri-food within national climate strategies represents a glaring omission. While COP attendees from food and farming will have been pleased to see the importance of the agri-food sector being more fairly reflected at COP 27 , reaction to the conference in general was mostly negative. The UN&#8217;s global effort to address climate change has ebbed and flowed over the 27 years since COP 1 in Berlin, enjoying a grand flourish in Paris in 2015 but losing momentum steadily ever since in the face of some severe headwinds. The modest ambition and achievement at COP 27 will have done little to bolster the beleaguered UN-sponsored effort. What is officially known as the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, finally agreed late on Sunday after much wrangling and compromise, represents fairly thin gruel, particularly when set against the huge cost &#8211; both in cash and carbon &#8211; of bringing all the parties physically together in one location. While the creation of a &#8220;loss and damage&#8221; fund to provide financial assistance to poorer countries impacted by climate change appears to remove a long-standing stumbling-block in the Paris process, the thorny issue of who pays into the fund was put off until next year. Meanwhile, COP 27 COP 27 agreement appears to make a concession on fossil fuels, promoting the use of renewables and &#8220;low-emission energy&#8221;, thought to provide a loophole enabling continued investment in natural gas as a &#8220;transition fuel&#8221;. Sense of under-achievement COP 21 in Paris in 2015 was undeniably a major geopolitical event and a milestone in combating climate change. COP 27 was nothing of the sort. World leaders came and went but this year&#8217;s conference underlined once again how climate change struggles for government bandwidth against more immediate challenges, especially when they are of the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. The palpable sense of under-achievement and disappointment following COP 27 was all too familiar. While failing to drive meaningful progress on national reduction targets and other commitments, COPs are increasingly being seen as networking jamborees for the ever-growing numbers of lobbyists, corporations, NGOs and other stakeholders that flock to the conference fringes. The proliferation of fossil fuel lobbyists at COP 27 in particular raised eyebrows. A conference teeming with fossil fuel industry representatives that eschews a commitment to phase down all fossil fuels and gives a tacit thumbs-up to investment in natural gas is arguably beyond satire.That said, it could be argued that the networking and cross-fertilisation of ideas taking place in the pavilions has in itself a crucial part to play in the global climate effort and could even mitigate the failure of a COP conference to increase reduction targets or seal more ambitious joint commitments. The increased presence for food and farming this year suggests COP is developing as a venue for the promotion of climate change initiatives, discussion and the generation of ideas, while the more procedural, inter-governmental functions seem by contrast moribund. With consensus on bolder commitments and faster progress on emissions likely to remain elusive, the broader outreach and purpose of the conferences could become even more important over the next few years. While the widespread criticism of COP 27 by external stakeholders and some member states suggests extensive reorganisation is called for, possibly splitting the COP programme into smaller regional or issue-specific conferences, the UN is not known for turning on a sixpence. In the short term, however, the UN can act in response to the specific criticism that the COP conferences have been &#8220;hijacked&#8221; by corporate interests, applying what was learned from the highly successful and widely praised Food Systems Summit (UNFSS), held during the UN General Assembly last September. Need for greater inclusivity After being criticised in its planning phase for favouring input from the corporate sector, the UN went to great lengths to make the UNFSS a multi-stakeholder event, for example establishing different stakeholder networks and holding a &#8220;pre-summit&#8221; involving a wide range of organisations. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is highly trusted as a source of information and research. There is no indication the extensive corporate presence at COP conferences, and UN collaboration with organisations such as the World Economic Forum, have significantly eroded trust among NGOs or the public but fostering greater inclusivity and multi-stakeholder involvement at future COPs can only help in securing trust in the UN&#8217;s climate work while adding value to the conferences themselves. In addition to assisting the participation of more of the most marginalised farming communities, the UN could look to build consumer awareness of the conferences. While some adverse reaction to COP 27 alluded to lobbyists from the agri-food sector, it was without doubt the presence of as many as 600 representatives from the fossil fuel industry in Sharm el-Sheikh that sparked most dismay on the part of activists, only compounded when they learned COP 28 is to take place in Abu Dhabi. \"

Sunak's allies said yesterday the prime minister's priority ""first and foremost has to be focusing on domestic issues"" but they left open the possibility that he might fit in the summit in Egypt that starts on November 6. ""Going depends on progress,"" said one, adding that Sunak's diary was currently focused on dealing with the economic crisis and the government's Autumn Statement on November 17. Last week Downing Street said Sunak would not attend the COP27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh because of ""pressing domestic commitments"". Joe Biden, US president, and Emmanuel Macron, French president, are among those who will attend. The prime minister's initial decision not to attend the UN conference added to the row over UK representa- tion. King Charles has been advised by Downing Street not to attend. Downing Street's acknowledgment on Sunday that Sunak might find time to go to the COP27 summit came after Alok Sharma, the government's climate tsar, criticised the prime minister's priorities. Sunak removed Sharma from the cabinet last week, and the climate envoy lost his status as a minister. Sharma, president of the COP26 summit in Glasgow last year, said Sunak's expected non-attendance at the follow-up meeting in Egypt was ""disappointing"" and could damage Tory prospects at the next election. ""I'm pretty disappointed that the prime minister is not going,"" Sharma told The Sunday Times. ""I understand that he's got a huge intray of domestic issues that has to be dealt with. But I would say that going to COP27 would allow for engagement with other world leaders. And I think it does send a signal - if the prime minister was to go - about our renewed commitment to the issue."" \"

"" COP27 must equip countries and communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis to prepare for extreme weather, to adapt, and minimize the impact of the climate emergency,"" said Grandi. ""We cannot leave millions of displaced people and their hosts to face the consequences of a changing climate alone."" Climate shocks are combining with conflict, acute food insecurity, rising prices, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to impact people across the globe, but those least responsible for the climate crisis and least able to adapt to its shocks are being hit hardest. This year's UN Climate Conference takes place against a backdrop of climate catastrophes from historic floods in Pakistan to the worst drought in decades across the Horn of Africa. Inside Somalia, nearly one million people have been displaced by drought and the threat of famine. Devastating cyclones in Mozambique have affected tens of thousands of people previously displaced by violence, while South Sudan and Sudan are battling record floods for a fourth consecutive year. More than 3.4 million displaced people and their hosts are facing the consequences of recent destructive flooding in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and the Central Sahel countries of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali -- a region already experiencing one of the world's worst displacement crises. In Cameroon's Far North, intercommunal violence has erupted between herders, fishers and farmers over dwindling water resources as Lake Chad and its tributaries have dried up from drought. Over 100 people were killed or injured late last year, and tens of thousands fled their homes. Meanwhile, drought in Central America's ""Dry Corridor"" has forced farmers to flee to nearby cities where they are vulnerable to violence from street gangs. And in other parts of the region such as Honduras, climate change is one more factor sparking displacement as hurricanes become ever more powerful and frequent. Over 70 per cent of the world's refugees and displaced people come from the most climate-vulnerable countries including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, and Yemen. They have an enormous stake in discussions about the climate crisis, but they are too often excluded. Only bold action and a massive boost in financing for climate mitigation and adaptation can alleviate the current and future humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis on displaced populations and host communities. Investments must be collaborative, inclusive and seek solutions for the most vulnerable. World leaders must look to transformational, lasting, and integrated action that involves local communities, governments, and partners already battling climate extremes. In some contexts, adaptation will not be enough and additional financing will be needed for inevitable ""loss and damage"", a stark example of which is being forced from home. The concerns and solutions for displaced people must be given a place not only in discussions like at COP 27 , but also must receive much more support in the climate ""hotspots"".

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK245","COP27 was a conference of chaos","November 23, 2022","New Scientist","HOSTING a climate summit for 40,000 people in the desert, in the midst of a food and energy crisis, is no mean feat. But sympathy for COP27 host Egypt was running thin within hours of the first delegates arriving at the main venue in Sharm El Sheikh earlier this month. The site itself was a tangle of temporary marquees and prefabricated structures nestled around an existing conference centre. Lost delegates plodded around in the baking sun, desperately searching for signs of their meeting room. Many were loath to download the official conference app for directions amid serious concerns of state surveillance. There were long queues for food and water, and horror stories of people arriving at their hotels only to find their rooms double-booked or the price hiked by hundreds of dollars per night. ""Chaos"" was the verdict of a member of the UK delegation. COP27 delegates' fortnight in the sun felt, at times, more like a test of endurance The difficulties set the tone for a conference that often felt as if it was lacking a clear vision or narrative. One minute, delegates could stroll into a side event to watch the launch of a new scheme to crack down on misleading net-zero pledges that rely on offsets; the next, they could listen to US climate envoy John Kerry tout a new scheme to use carbon credits to allow US firms to meet their climate goals. They could sit in on a press conference where analysts warned that the world risks blowing its climate targets because of Europe's ""dash for gas"" while just metres away, oil and gas firms boasted of gas's role as a transition fuel. Side events designed to demonstrate progress since COP26 on key areas, such as deforestation or fossil fuel financing, heightened the sense of stagnation. At last year's talks in Glasgow, UK, 145 nations promised to halt deforestation by 2030. But just 26 countries joined a partnership launched in Sharm El Sheikh designed to deliver that pledge. In Glasgow, almost 40 nations committed to ending public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad, but the initiative attracted no new signatories in Egypt. Oppressive state policing and Sharm El Sheikh's sprawling layout contributed to the summit's muted atmosphere. Egyptian police tried to relegate activists to a designated ""protest zone"" a car ride away from the venue, until \- in an unprecedented move \- the UN granted permission for a demonstration inside the main venue on 12 November. As the conference went on, there were flashes of excitement. An address from US president Joe Biden was briefly interrupted by the whoops of anti-fossil fuel protesters, while the arrival of Brazil's president-elect Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva on 16 November sparked energetic chants of "" ol\'ea , ol\'e1 , Lula"" through the pavilion halls. Rapprochement in Bali Meanwhile, there was relief as the US and China agreed to restart co-operation on climate issues, after Biden met Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. Keen to underscore their newfound partnership, China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua paid a surprise visit to a US side event on methane at COP27 . ""Even though I currently have a meeting with the German foreign minister, I told her to wait a little bit so I can come and talk to all of you,"" Xie said at the event. But behind the scenes, the formal negotiations had hit trouble. By 17 November, there were fears the summit could collapse altogether as countries butted heads over loss and damage financing. UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres jetted in with a stern warning for the bickering parties: ""This is no time for finger-pointing,"" he said. ""The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction."" It didn't stop countries pushing the talks to their limit, with fraught bargaining continuing well past the summit's official deadline and even as the conference site itself was dismantled. Sharm El Sheikh is usually a destination for sun-seekers looking for a week of relaxation. For COP27 delegates, their fortnight in the sun felt, at times, more like a test of endurance. \"

Unfortunately, climate-driven water challenges are already impacting people's access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)-with the most vulnerable disproportionately affected. As such, dozens of water stewardship advocates have joined together to declare universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene as critical to making humanity more resilient to the near-term impacts of climate change. Today, during COP27 in Egypt, DuPont joined the CEO Water Mandate, Water Resilience Coalition, WASH4Work initiative, and nearly 50 other corporations and WASH experts in signing the COP27 Business Declaration on Climate Resilient Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. The intent of the Declaration is to share a unified belief that, despite making humans more resilient in the face of climate change, rising global temperatures are putting SDG-6 and universal access to WASH at risk. As a signer of the Declaration, DuPont believes that: 1 As global businesses, we are committed to taking action towards universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) across our operations, supply chains and in the communities where we operate - as part of our corporate water stewardship strategies 2 In the face of the growing risks of climate change we recognize that water, sanitation and hygiene access is an important component of climate and water resilience actions 3 Going forward we join global and local stakeholders in developing and applying a climate-resilient WASH framework to our water, sanitation and hygiene access programs and investments. 4 As global businesses we will leverage our broad reach and influence to advocate for climate resilient WASH actions in partnership with global and local stakeholders. Our need to optimize our water supplies-to adapt to impacts of climate change now while preparing for an even more water-constrained future-could not be more urgent. The water sector will be critical to solving this challenge-innovating numerous ways to purify, conserve, reuse, transport, store, and analyze this precious resource. At the same time, climate resilience needs to be a fundamental driver of innovation-helping our customers uncover ways to optimize water more efficiently, use less energy, reduce waste, and reduce the carbon impact of safe water. DuPont believes that safe water can become abundant, affordable and accessible to everyone-and that a focus on climate resilience, sustainability and equity should be our guiding posts.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK247","What asset managers learned from COP27","November 24, 2022 Thursday 10:38 AM GMT","Citywire","The financial industry\' s responsibility to curb climate change was\~high up the agenda at last year\' s COP. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) pledged to mobilise $100tn of finance needed for net-zero emissions targets before 2050; the Climate Investment Coalition initiative pledged $130bn to clean energy and climate investments by 2030; and asset managers representing $8.7tn pledged to eliminate deforestation-related investments from portfolios by 2025. But this year, many of the industry\' s leaders \- including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, and Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters \- didn\' t even show up. Anya Solovieva, global commercial lead on climate solutions at Morningstar Sustainalytics,\~said the absence of bank and asset manager CEOs was her key concern and raised questions about the event\' s effectiveness. Wolfgang Kuhn, a responsible finance veteran and founder of Kuhn Advisory & Research, agreed. \' If asset managers only have their ESG people there, that just means it\' s not really ingrained in the business. It might have been last year\' s hot topic, but CEOs have different concerns now,\' he said. A lack of ambition? Kuhn, who left his role as director of financial sector strategies at ShareAction in August last year, said he was critical of GFANZ when it was launched at COP26. One key difference from last year is that asset managers are now having to match their net-zero pledges with\~practical\~plans \- and their absence at COP27 , Kuhn said, could be a sign that \' it got too embarrassing with all these net-zero statements coming under scrutiny\' . \' What we usually see in sustainable finance is that there\' s a lot of ambition about providing green finance,\' he said. \' But when it comes to turning off the brown finance, the polluting finance, no one wants to do anything. It\' s a mirror image of sovereign states. \' This COP has not been particularly decisive or demonstrated a huge breakthrough on the mobilisation of private finance for a good reason,\' said Jean-Jacques Barb\'e9ris, director of the institutional and corporate clients division and ESG at Amundi. He\~added that developing countries hosting COP events have previously tended to focus on public finance and adaptation. \' As a long-standing participant and observer, I\' m always surprised by how COP is looked at on an individual basis. To me, they are sequences, each dealing with one part of the agenda. There was little adaptation focus in Glasgow, and so, that\' s the focus now,\' he said. Climate-resilient debt clauses The \' loss and damage\' fund and the insurance-based mechanism Global Shield against Climate Risks hogged the limelight at COP27 \~but there were also some key developments in\~the world of sovereign debt.\~ On the summit\' s Finance Day, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) introduced new climate-resilient debt clauses (CRDCs), which will allow more sovereign issuers to defer debt repayments in the event of a severe climate shock or natural disaster. At the time of the announcement, Leland Goss, ICMA\' s general counsel, said countries have become vulnerable to growing debt levels and an increased risk of climate shocks. One month before COP27 , a draft paper from the UN Development Programme proposed that Pakistan should seek to defer on its international debt repayments and restructure loans\~in order to\~prioritise financing the $30bn\~needed to address unprecedented\~flood damage earlier this summer. Irene Lauro, an environmental economist at Schroders, said the CRDCs\~were an important step to help poor countries cope with the economic impact of climate disasters. Kevin Daly, a senior portfolio manager in Abrdn\' s emerging debt team, said CRDCs are not retroactive and that it could take up to 10 years before the measures would bring meaningful change.\~ \' You could trigger the clause in any new bond that is issued with this type of instrument as long as it meets the criteria to defer the payments coming due in the last year or two. But if a country gets wiped out by a hurricane, the CRDCs are not going to be retroactive to the existing bonds that are issued by that country. It\' s going to take time to build up this bond issuance,\' he said. \' It makes it more straightforward to get some form of relief from debt servicing without having to go through a period of six months to a year of negotiating, having a moratorium, or risking credit rating downgrades and other knock-on impacts.\' The objective is to extend CRDCs beyond the Caribbean, where the clauses have already been put into use, to the Pacific, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia. Daly also\~said the list of eligible countries for CRDCs is not just low-income ones, but also Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, Singapore and other middle- or high-income countries. \' Conditional surrender\' ? In terms of the most significant outcome of COP27 \' For years already, industrialised countries have broken their promises to support the Global South in carrying the costs of adaptation and mitigation. (..) Here, the summit delivered a historic result \- the creation of a loss and damage fund \- though it will take much negotiation before it is operational,\' said Lucian Peppelenbos, climate and biodiversity strategist at Robeco. SDG Impact Japan\' s chief investment strategy officer Sasja Beslik, on the other hand, said the fund contributed to a feeling of \' conditional surrender\' on climate emergency as COP27 ended without any progress on global warming targets. \' The rich Western world needs to take responsibility and instead, it pays poor countries in order to continue being irresponsible,\' Beslik said. \' COP conferences are replacing each other on a regular basis, but in practice, they are not delivering any real results.\' He added that there was \' not even a discussion\' on a global CO2 price that financial markets need to be able to price externalities, and said there will be no real progress on capital flows until that is established. Abrdn\' s head of sustainability insights and climate strategy, Eva Cairns, and chief economist, Jeremy Lawson, were also sceptical about the outcomes of COP27 and left the event \' exhausted and with mixed feelings\' . \' As the week went on, it became clear that there was a lack of meaningful announcements to keep 1.5C alive. While the focus on climate justice and adaptation are important, there is only so much one can adapt to extreme climate impacts. \' Ultimately, emissions are still on the rise and are expected to reach record levels in 2022. It is maybe time to consider whether the multilateral COP negotiation process is effective in addressing this with the urgency it requires,\' Cairns and Lawson told Citywire Selector. Amundi\' s Barb\'e9ris said the lack of agreement on the phasing down of fossil fuels was \' disappointing\' and said the task should not be \' passed on\' from democratically elected leaders to the financial sector. \"

Led by Egypt\' s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry between 6 and 18 November \- with environment minister Yasmine Fouad serving as the event\' s ministerial coordinator and envoy \- the summit will follow last year\' s gathering in Glasgow. It will once more unite world leaders, climate organisations and activists to thrash out the big questions about safeguarding the future of our planet. Here\' s everything you need to know about the upcoming conference: What is Cop27 ? Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year is the 27th annual meeting. The 197 signatories, or  parties , to the UNFCCC will all be represented in Sharm El Sheikh, along with tens of thousands of negotiators, government officials, businesses and activists, all hoping to make their voices heard and see a comprehensive plan drawn up to realise the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avert the global climate catastrophe our planet faces. What is the UNFCCC? The UNFCCC was first signed at the June 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by 154 nations and was intended as a treaty to rein in  dangerous human interference with the climate system , primarily by stabilising the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, whose unchecked dispersion drives global heating. The framework called for ongoing collaboration on scientific research and regular meetings, negotiations and policy agreements between world governments to ensure fragile ecosystems were not unduly damaged by climate change, that the global food supply remained unimpeded and that economic development was allowed to proceed sustainably. What is the Kyoto Protocol? The first significant agreement between parties to the treaty was the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in the Japanese city in December 1997 and set strict emission reduction targets on six gases for 37 industrialised nations and the European Union, but not the US or other major carbon-emitting superpowers like China and India. Following ratification by Russia and Canada, the protocol came into effect in February 2005 and aimed to reduce harmful emissions in participating countries by five per cent from 1990 levels in phase one (2008-12) and by an ambitious 18 per cent in phase two (2013-20), an extension agreed in December 2012 and known as the Doha Amendment. While events like the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the global financial crisis of 2007-08 did help to bring down rates of industrial pollution, a UN Environmental Programme report published at the end of phase one in 2012 found that emissions had nevertheless boomed by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010 despite the recent efforts of the protocol\' s participants. It again highlighted the scale of the task and the need to swap fossil fuel dependence for more renewable sources of energy before the damage becomes irreversible. What is the Paris Agreement? The more wide-ranging Paris Agreement, drafted in December 2015, signed in April 2016 and intended as a successor to Kyoto, applied to all 195 signatories and not just the more developed nations, obliging everyone to do their part to keep the global temperature rise well below 2C by the century\' s end and for all nations to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. This time the US was on board, until, that is, Donald Trump succeeded Barack Obama and withdrew from the agreement, only for the Republican to lose the White House after just one disastrous term and be replaced by Democrat Joe Biden, who swiftly rejoined on his first day in the Oval Office. Countries signed up to the Paris accord are committed to nationally-determined contributions, individual emissions reduction targets tailored to their particular circumstances that are reviewed and reassessed every five years. Why does Cop27 matter? Cop27 is seeking to firm up those commitments made in the French capital and those agreed subsequently relating to net zero carbon emissions, state financial commitments, working conditions and protecting communities and natural habitats on the frontline of extreme weather events caused by global heating.  At Cop27 HYPERLINK states on its official website  Building on the outcomes and momentum of Cop26 in Glasgow last year, nations are expected to demonstrate at Cop27 that they are in a new era of implementation by turning their commitments under the Paris Agreement into action. \"

""Climate change is possibly everyone's greatest challenge - and a significant risk to the future of our business [so] Nestle Australia is thrilled that we will be part of this project. ""Planting trees in areas where we source our ingredients helps protect and restore food systems. It helps our supply chain and the local communities that grow our ingredients to be more resilient."" The first step in this project will be to establish the planting of the 10 million trees across the country, which will include a biodiverse mix of some 65 native species hoped to sequester an estimated 2.1 million tonnes of CO2 over 25 years.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK253","COP27 - Infarm seeks support to commercialise indoor-grown wheat","November 10, 2022 Thursday 11:21 AM GMT","MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)","The Berlin-based company, regarded as a vertical-farming pioneer in Europe, has trialled the production of wheat in its indoor R&D laboratory and projects superior yields to the field-farmed crop in a scaled-up scenario. Infarm, set up in 2013, said in a statement: ""The first trials demonstrated exceptional results, allowing a projection of 11.7 kg per m2 yield per year. Further projected at scale, this is the equivalent of 117 tonnes per hectare per year - 26 times that of open-field farming yields."" It is a bold step in what is still a relatively nascent industry only just expanding beyond fresh leafy greens and herbs into berry-type fruits and basic vegetables like mushrooms. High input costs - technology and energy - also tend to make on-shelf prices more expensive than traditional produce, presenting a challenge for wheat grown in a system providing environmental benefits. The business, which is co-hosting the Food Systems Pavilion at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, claims to be ""the first vertical-farming company to tackle staple crop production in a controlled environment"". Infarm plans to use the summit to emphasise the governmental and institutional financial support that many industry participants argue is needed for the alternative-farming technique to become more mainstream, cost competitive and profitable. ""Our first step is to make governments and financial institutions aware of the tremendous potential of indoor vertical farming to enhance climate resilience and food security,"" a spokesperson for Infarm tells Just Food. ""This will help pave the way for the sector to access government grants and subsidies, in addition to private investment."" Scientific endeavourProponents argue controlled environment farming offers some benefits over traditional agriculture such as eliminating the use of soil, less water usage and fewer land resources, zero pesticides and greater yields because of year-round cultivation assisted by artificial lighting. However, traditional wheat farmers might be opposed to the prospect of competition from a crop grown in a controlled indoor environment, a particular challenge in countries where cereal crop production is government subsidised. ""Scaling this project and commercialising indoor-farmed wheat is a significant scientific and engineering endeavour,"" the Infarm spokesperson said. ""Though the technology is feasible, further research and development is necessary to grow wheat commercially and we will continue to focus on that."" In the wider context, Infarm's co-founder and CEO Erez Galonska told Just Food in May: ""Even when you look at COP27 and beyond, we are already speaking with policymakers, NGOs, with different kinds of organisations, to help us galvanise people to start and think about what we eat, what the supply chain is going to look like in the future, where food is going to be produced, the insecurity of food, what we can do and what we can't do - the role of grants, subsidies, and regulatory issues."" With COP27 now underway, Galonska said in the statement: ""Being able to grow wheat indoors is a milestone for Infarm and of significant importance for global food security, as wheat is a calorie-dense but resource-intense crop that is a core component of diets worldwide."" Infarm added via the spokesperson: ""This trial was the first step and successfully demonstrated the potential of producing wheat in an indoor farm. This proof of concept can now be used to develop a path to commercialisation. Food security is a huge issue here at COP27 , following climate shocks and the supply issues of the Ukraine war, and governments are looking at ways to ensure a more food-secure future."" \"

The PM is under mounting pressure to attend the climate conference in Egypt. The Financial Times (FT) had reported that Rishi Sunak could open the door to a possible U-turn over his decision not to attend COP27 . A Number 10 spokesperson said: ""The Prime Minister fully recognises the importance of the COP summit and is fully committed to addressing climate change."" On whether Sunak's decision could change, the spokesperson added: ""I think that the Prime Minister set out that the public would rightly want him to focus on the domestic issues, particularly on restoring fiscal credibility and delivering on a budget that works for the British people. ""There is substantial progress being made on that and so we are keeping the position on COP under review."" The FT reports that, on Sunday, Sunak-s allies said the Prime Minister-s priority -first and foremost has to be focusing on domestic issues- but they left open the possibility he might be able to fit in the summit which begins on November 6. Tory minister Mark Spencer told BBC Breakfast on Monday morning: -I-m sure if his diary allows he would want to go, but at this moment in time we don-t quite know whether he-s going to have time to do that.

Last week, Downing Street said Sunak would not attend the COP27 summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh because of -pressing domestic commitments-. US President Joe Biden and French leader Emmanuel Macron are among those who will attend. Downing Street-s acknowledgment on Sunday that Sunak might find time to go to the COP27 summit came after Tory MP Alok Sharma, who served as president for COP26 in Glasgow last year, was critical of the Prime Minister-s priorities. He told the Sunday Times: -I-m pretty disappointed that the Prime Minister is not going. -I understand that he-s got a huge in-tray of domestic issues that has to be dealt with. But I would say that going to COP27 would allow for engagement with other world leaders. -And I think it does send a signal - if the Prime Minister was to go - about our renewed commitment to the issue.- Former Cabinet minister Nadine Dorries said on Twitter that it would be -wrong- for the Prime Minister not to attend the summit.

Every fraction of a degree means an increase in human suffering and must therefore be fought for. How?

Behind closed doors at the summit, however, the fossil fuel states forced other countries to fight tooth and nail merely to preserve the inadequate status quo. On Friday, a Saudi Arabian delegate said:  We should not target sources of energy; we should focus on emissions. We should not mention fossil fuels. Despite the efforts of many other countries, the final decision text duly failed to mention phasing out fossil fuels. It is extraordinary that in 30 years of UN climate negotiations, eliminating the primary cause of global heating has never been mentioned in the decisions. Given that next year\' s UN climate summit will be hosted by a petrostate, the United Arab Emirates, it is hard to see how a crackdown on fossil fuels will happen there either. The world should be sprinting to rid itself of its fossil fuel addiction as if lives depend on it, because they do, but it is jogging on the spot. The 1.5C goal may not yet be physically impossible to achieve, but Cop27 has shown it is politically impossible. So, what now? It remains imperative to get off coal, oil and gas as rapidly as possible. Every tonne of CO 2 that remains in the ground means less harm to lives and livelihoods.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK256","-Massachusetts Institute of Technology : A breakthrough on 'loss and damage,' but also disappointment, at UN climate conference","November 30, 2022 Wednesday","M2 PressWIRE","November 30, 2022 Release date- 29112022 - Massachusetts Institute of Technology : Delegates from MIT attended COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where international climate negotiations went down to the wire. As the 2022 United Nations climate change conference , known as COP27 , stretched into its final hours on Saturday, Nov. 19, it was uncertain what kind of agreement might emerge from two weeks of intensive international negotiations. In the end, COP27 produced mixed results: on the one hand, a historic agreement for wealthy countries to compensate low-income countries for 'loss and damage,' but on the other, limited progress on new plans for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. 'We need to drastically reduce emissions now - and this is an issue this COP did not address,' said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement at the conclusion of COP27 . 'A fund for loss and damage is essential - but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map - or turns an entire African country to desert.' Throughout the two weeks of the conference, a delegation of MIT students, faculty, and staff was at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Center to observe the negotiations, conduct and share research, participate in panel discussions, and forge new connections with researchers, policymakers, and advocates from around the world. Loss and damage A key issue coming in to COP27 (COP stands for 'conference of the parties' to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, held for the 27th time) was loss and damage: a term used by the U.N. to refer to harms caused by climate change - either through acute catastrophes like extreme weather events or slower-moving impacts like sea level rise - to which communities and countries are unable to adapt. Ultimately, a deal on loss and damage proved to be COP27 's most prominent accomplishment. Negotiators reached an eleventh-hour agreement to 'establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.' 'Providing financial assistance to developing countries so they can better respond to climate-related loss and damage is not only a moral issue, but also a pragmatic one,' said Michael Mehling, deputy director of the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, who attended COP27 and participated in side events. 'Future emissions growth will be squarely centered in the developing world, and offering support through different channels is key to building the trust needed for more robust global cooperation on mitigation.' Youssef Shaker, a graduate student in the MIT Technology and Policy Program and a research assistant with the MIT Energy Initiative, attended the second week of the conference, where he followed the negotiations over loss and damage closely. 'While the creation of a fund is certainly an achievement,' Shaker said, 'significant questions remain to be answered, such as the size of the funding available as well as which countries receive access to it.' A loss-and-damage fund that is not adequately funded, Shaker noted, 'would not be an impactful outcome.' The agreement on loss and damage created a new committee, made up of 24 country representatives, to 'operationalize' the new funding arrangements, including identifying funding sources. The committee is tasked with delivering a set of recommendations at COP28, which will take place next year in Dubai. Advising the U.N. on net zero Though the decisions reached at COP27 did not include major new commitments on reducing emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, the transition to a clean global energy system was nevertheless a key topic of conversation throughout the conference. The Council of Engineers for the Energy Transition (CEET), an independent, international body of engineers and energy systems experts formed to provide advice to the U.N. on achieving net-zero emissions globally by 2050, convened for the first time at COP27 . Jessika Trancik, a professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society and a member of CEET, spoke on a U.N.-sponsored panel on solutions for the transition to clean energy. Trancik noted that the energy transition will look different in different regions of the world. 'As engineers, we need to understand those local contexts and design solutions around those local contexts - that's absolutely essential to support a rapid and equitable energy transition.' At the same time, Trancik noted that there is now a set of 'low-cost, ready-to-scale tools' available to every region - tools that resulted from a globally competitive process of innovation, stimulated by public policies in different countries, that dramatically drove down the costs of technologies like solar energy and lithium-ion batteries. The key, Trancik said, is for regional transition strategies to 'tap into global processes of innovation.' Reinventing climate adaptation Elfatih Eltahir, the H. M. King Bhumibol Professor of Hydrology and Climate, traveled to COP27 to present plans for the Jameel Observatory Climate Resilience Early Warning System (CREWSnet), one of the five projects selected in April 2022 as a flagship in MIT's Climate Grand Challenges initiative. CREWSnet focuses on climate adaptation, the term for adapting to climate impacts that are unavoidable. The aim of CREWSnet, Eltahir told the audience during a panel discussion, is 'nothing short of reinventing the process of climate change adaptation,' so that it is proactive rather than reactive; community-led; data-driven and evidence-based; and so that it integrates different climate risks, from heat waves to sea level rise, rather than treating them individually. 'However, it's easy to talk about these changes,' said Eltahir. 'The real challenge, which we are now just launching and engaging in, is to demonstrate that on the ground.' Eltahir said that early demonstrations will happen in a couple of key locations, including southwest Bangladesh, where multiple climate risks - rising sea levels, increasing soil salinity, and intensifying heat waves and cyclones - are combining to threaten the area's agricultural production. Building on COP26 Some members of MIT's delegation attended COP27 At an official U.N. side event co-organized by MIT on Nov. 11, Greg Sixt, the director of the Food and Climate Systems Transformation (FACT) Alliance led by the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab, provided an update on the alliance's work since its launch at COP26. Food systems are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions - and are increasingly vulnerable to climate impacts. The FACT Alliance works to better connect researchers to farmers, food businesses, policymakers, and other food systems stakeholders to make food systems (which include food production, consumption, and waste) more sustainable and resilient. Sixt told the audience that the FACT Alliance now counts over 20 research and stakeholder institutions around the world among its members, but also collaborates with other institutions in an 'open network model' to advance work in key areas - such as a new research project exploring how climate scenarios could affect global food supply chains. Marcela Angel, research program director for the Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI), helped convene a meeting at COP27 of the Afro-InterAmerican Forum on Climate Change, which also launched at COP26. The forum works with Afro-descendant leaders across the Americas to address significant environmental issues, including climate risks and biodiversity loss. At the event - convened with the Colombian government and the nonprofit Conservation International - ESI brought together leaders from six countries in the Americas and presented recent work that estimates that there are over 178 million individuals who identify as Afro-descendant living in the Americas, in lands of global environmental importance. 'There is a significant overlap between biodiversity hot spots, protected areas, and areas of high Afro-descendant presence,' said Angel. 'But the role and climate contributions of these communities is understudied, and often made invisible.' Limiting methane emissions Methane is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas: When released into the atmosphere, it immediately traps about 120 times more heat than carbon dioxide does. More than 150 countries have now signed the Global Methane Pledge, launched at COP26, which aims to reduce methane emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Sergey Paltsev, the deputy director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change and a senior research scientist at the MIT Energy Initiative, gave the keynote address at a Nov. 17 event on methane, where he noted the importance of methane reductions from the oil and gas sector to meeting the 2030 goal. 'The oil and gas sector is where methane emissions reductions could be achieved the fastest,' said Paltsev. 'We also need to employ an integrated approach to address methane emissions in all sectors and all regions of the world because methane emissions reductions provide a near-term pathway to avoiding dangerous tipping points in the global climate system.' ' 'COP will always have its haters. Is there greenwashing? Of course! Is everyone who should have a say in this process in the room? Not even close,' wrote Khotimsky. 'So what does it take for COP to matter? It takes everyone who attended to not only put 'climate' on front-page news for two weeks, but to return home and keep fighting relentlessly against climate change. I know that I will.'

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK257","Expectations low for Cop27 conference","November 4, 2022 Friday 10:54 AM GMT","FTAdviser.com","It is less than a year since Cop26 wrapped up in Glasgow. Given what has happened in the world since then, this seems like a lifetime ago. Readers will recall that the conference, which took place against a backdrop of continued Covid restrictions, eventually produced an agreement called the Glasgow Climate Pact, which was adopted by the 120 world leaders who attended. Those not attending (perhaps due to Covid restrictions) included Russia and Iran, while China\' s Xi Jinping did not travel but he did join via video link. The pact aims to turn the 2020s into a decade of climate action and support. Cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are still seen as far from where they need to be to preserve a liveable climate, and support for the most vulnerable countries affected by the effects of climate change is still falling far short. There was some disappointment at what was achieved in Glasgow and the level of ongoing commitment. Nevertheless, Cop 26 did produce new 'building blocks' to advance implementation of the Paris Agreement through actions that can get the world on a more sustainable, low-carbon pathway forward.The package of decisions agreed in Glasgow included greater efforts to build resilience to climate change, to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to provide the necessary finance for both. Nations reaffirmed their duty to fulfil the pledge of providing $100bn (\£389bn) annually from developed to developing countries.They also agreed to work to reduce the gap between existing emission reduction plans and what is required to reduce emissions, so that the rise in the global average temperature can be limited to 1.5 degrees.For the first time, nations are called upon to phase down unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.Not all rosesHowever, there was some disappointment at what was achieved in Glasgow and the level of ongoing commitment.  The approved texts are a compromise, said UN zecretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres at the time.  They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions, and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions. That 'collective political will' has been severely tested since the Cop26 text was approved. Against the backdrop of an existing energy crisis, economies around the world have stalled, with many nations still dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Our expectations for the conference are not high. The response of many Cop participants has been weak. Never one to waste a crisis, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February of this year, sparking a war that still rages.Partly in response to sanctions imposed by Western governments, Russia highlighted Europe\' s dependence on Russian gas by turning off the taps at its Nord Stream pipeline, leading to a gas crisis and concerns that gas prices might work against companies and governments delivering green policies in time for Cop27 . Cop27 , which kicks off this weekend in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, marks the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). It is seen by some as an 'African Cop', taking place on the continent most affected by climate change.Low expectationsSo, what progress can we hope for and what might we actually expect in Sharm El-Sheikh?Just getting world leaders around a table will be a positive step and we can hope for positive engagement with and between China, the US and India \- the world\' s largest carbon emitters.We will also look for progress on the themes summarised above, more specifically renewing commitments to meeting 2030 climate targets, and actually delivering greater financial support from rich countries to help those in the developing world, who have contributed least to global warming.In reality, after such a difficult year, our expectations for the conference are not high. The response of many Cop participants has been weak, with resource-rich Australia being the only country to increase its climate commitments in 2022.Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine and the international reaction to it have damaged institutions like the G20, of which Russia was formerly a member. China seems less globally co-operative than it was a year ago. It is essential for there to be continued political will to see through on promises made under the limelight. Under pressure from voters, some Western governments worry that the energy crisis has added costs to the green transition, with G7 nations accused of backsliding on climate goals over energy security fears. For example, Germany has said it will restart mothballed coal-fired power stations, in order to keep the lights on this winter. Since Cop26 ended, Britain has held the Presidency of Cop, until this weekend, when the baton passes to Egypt. Under this presidency, it has been the UK\' s responsibility to speed up action on climate and help deliver on four key goals. Given the gravity of the climate crisis and the need to see through our Cop26 commitments, we are pleased to learn that the prime minister will in fact attend Cop27 . This is significant. For initiatives such as Cop27 to bring about meaningful change, it is essential for there to be continued political will to see through on promises made under the limelight once the bunting has come down and conference stands have been dismantled.

Like many Egyptians, she is hoping that HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/cop27 the climate conference  COP is an opportunity when eyes will be on Egypt  an opportunity to speak up and get some breathing room, said Seif, surrounded by portraits of her incarcerated brother, Alaa Abdel Fattah.  It could save lives if the spotlight on the human rights conditions keeps escalating, and if governments put it in their engagement with Egyptian authorities. Abdel Fattah is one of the highest-profile political prisoners among thousands detained by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi\' s regime since the former army chief seized power in a 2013 coup. And the attention his case has garnered in the lead-up to COP27 underscores how concerns over human rights threaten to cast a shadow over the summit. Seif\' s protest, and Abdel Fattah\' s imprisonment, has already drawn the attention of climate activists  Greta Thunberg was among those to have visited her tented sit-in in a show of solidarity. \~ We are running out of time, so if the authorities do not want to end up with a\~death they should have  and could have  prevented, they must act now, said Agn\'e8s Callamard, Amnesty\' s secretary-general.  Twenty-four, 48 hours, 72 hours at the most  that\' s all they have to save a life. If they don\' t, that death will [hang over]\~ COP27 . It will be in every single discussion. Callamard added that despite the release of some 776 political prisoners this year, Cairo has arrested 1,500 more people since April.  We will not be fooled, she said.  The government cannot spin its way out of the situation. It must take concrete, visible, authentic actions. UK prime minister Rishi Sunak wrote to Seif on Saturday saying the British government was  totally committed to resolving Abdel Fattah\' s case and that he  remains a priority . The 40-year-old, who was an icon of the 2011 revolution that ousted veteran president Hosni Mubarak, was granted British citizenship last year. Dozens of British MPs have also raised his case in recent weeks, while 15 Nobel Prize winners in literature have lobbied for leaders to use the summit to address the issue of Egypt\' s political prisoners. COP27 has already caused the regime to at least signal that it is sensitive to outside criticism ahead of the summit. Hossam Bahgat, the head of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent Cairo-based advocacy group, said the government had released about 800 political prisoners this year and also pledged to establish a political dialogue with civil society and opposition parties. Those moves indicate a tentative shift for a government that is widely described as the country\' s most autocratic in decades. Bahgat said the number of those released from prison was more than in previous years, but added that it  still remains a small number relative to the overall population of political prisoners .  What\' s more concerning is that new arrests on political charges didn\' t stop going at the same pace, but it\' s still a positive signal, he said. The problem, he added, was that the positive moves were just  very nascent steps that don\' t constitute tangible or lasting change . For Abdel Fattah\' s family, the fear is that time is running out as he has pledged to stop drinking water on Sunday.  He was already looking very frail when I last saw him in August, so I don\' t know how his body can endure any more, Seif said. Her brother has spent eight of the past 10 years behind bars. The activist is serving five years in prison after being convicted in December of  spreading false news that undermines national security for a social media post. Seif, who plans to attend COP27 , was herself only released from prison in December after serving 18 months following charges of disseminating false news, inciting terrorist crimes and misuse of social media. She worried that Sisi would use COP27 to project to his domestic audience that he is strong and enjoys the backing of western powers; she urged governments to take a stronger line on rights abuses.  Whether the western politicians agree or not . . . this is how it\' s being presented to us Egyptians and how it\' s being used, she said.  If Sisi feels his PR might be a little bit ruined, he would release some more. Despite his government\' s human rights record, Sisi has enjoyed sound relations with western capitals that have traditionally viewed Egypt as an important Arab partner and vital to regional stability. Former US president Donald Trump once jokingly described Sisi as his  favourite dictator . The Biden administration has been more outspoken on human rights, but provided Egypt with $1.1bn in military aid last year, while withholding $225mn over rights concerns.  We have made very clear to the Egyptian government our concerns about human rights issues in Egypt, a State department official said.  In particular, politically motivated arrests are a major challenge in Egypt. Bahgat said his concern was that once COP27 ends, the regime will return to its old ways, saying the small steps taken  could be very easily reversed . . . once the eye of the world is no longer on Egypt . \"

"" COP27 must equip countries and communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis to prepare for extreme weather, to adapt, and minimize the impact of the climate emergency,"" said Grandi. ""We cannot leave millions of displaced people and their hosts to face the consequences of a changing climate alone."" Climate shocks are combining with conflict, acute food insecurity, rising prices, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to impact people across the globe, but those least responsible for the climate crisis and least able to adapt to its shocks are being hit hardest. This year's UN Climate Conference takes place against a backdrop of climate catastrophes from historic floods in Pakistan to the worst drought in decades across the Horn of Africa. Inside Somalia, nearly one million people have been displaced by drought and the threat of famine. Devastating cyclones in Mozambique have affected tens of thousands of people previously displaced by violence, while South Sudan and Sudan are battling record floods for a fourth consecutive year. More than 3.4 million displaced people and their hosts are facing the consequences of recent destructive flooding in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and the Central Sahel countries of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali -- a region already experiencing one of the world's worst displacement crises. In Cameroon's Far North, intercommunal violence has erupted between herders, fishers and farmers over dwindling water resources as Lake Chad and its tributaries have dried up from drought. Over 100 people were killed or injured late last year, and tens of thousands fled their homes. Meanwhile, drought in Central America's ""Dry Corridor"" has forced farmers to flee to nearby cities where they are vulnerable to violence from street gangs. And in other parts of the region such as Honduras, climate change is one more factor sparking displacement as hurricanes become ever more powerful and frequent. Over 70 per cent of the world's refugees and displaced people come from the most climate-vulnerable countries including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, and Yemen. They have an enormous stake in discussions about the climate crisis, but they are too often excluded. Only bold action and a massive boost in financing for climate mitigation and adaptation can alleviate the current and future humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis on displaced populations and host communities. Investments must be collaborative, inclusive and seek solutions for the most vulnerable. World leaders must look to transformational, lasting, and integrated action that involves local communities, governments, and partners already battling climate extremes. In some contexts, adaptation will not be enough and additional financing will be needed for inevitable ""loss and damage"", a stark example of which is being forced from home. The concerns and solutions for displaced people must be given a place not only in discussions like at COP 27 , but also must receive much more support in the climate ""hotspots"".

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK265","COP27 - Canada faces criticism for oil and gas stance","November 27, 2022","Global LNG Monitor Today","Though global delegates have left COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, the criticism of Canada's stance on fossil fuels is still sharp. Canada was lambasted by activists for refusing to sign a final agreement to phase out oil and gas, but it also challenged other countries to adopt carbon pricing as a key element of climate strategy. A broad coalition of more than 80 countries had backed the call, which ultimately was not included in the conference's final statement. Ottawa's Environment Minister, Steven Guilbeault, a former green activist, contended that provinces and territories would likely sue if there were an attempt to halt oil and gas production. Canada is the fourth largest producer of oil\~and\~the sixth largest producer of natural gas in the world, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). ""I would like to point out that there is no such text [to phase out fossil fuels],"" Guilbeault told reporters at the annual UN COP climate conference. ""But we support reducing our dependencies on fossil fuels. The very foundation of our climate change plan rests on that, which is why we've adopted a law to ban the use of coal-fired electricity in Canada by 2030, we're putting in place measures so that 100% of vehicles sold in Canada will be zero-emission vehicles by 2035, our electrical grid will be net-zero by 2035."" He continued: ""All of these measures, and many more, will lead to a significant reduction of our consumption of fossil fuels and therefore our dependencies on fossil fuels in Canada. And we obviously support that. That's what we're here for."" His remarks were reported by the Financial Post. He added, later in the conference: ""We have to be super careful in terms of what we do ... that what we do will hold in court,"" he said. ""Otherwise we're wasting time, and precious time, to fight climate change."" The final agreement at COP26 had called for nations to move faster to phase out coal. At this year's COP\~there was a move to add oil and gas to the statement. Canada resisted. US climate envoy John Kerry said his country would agree, but only if the language said ""unabated"" oil and gas. The EU said it supported the idea, as long as the language on coal was not weakened. COP27 , said Canada was focusing its efforts on regulating how much methane can be emitted by oil and gas producers, on reducing demand with efficiency and electric vehicles. Julia Levin, National Climate Programme manager for Environmental Defence, told Canadian Press: ""I'd say it's clear that the government of Canada is beholden to fossil fuel lobbyists and putting their interests ahead of public welfare."" CAPP's president and CEO, Lisa Baiton, retorted\~in a written statement: ""As global demand for natural gas and oil will remain strong for decades, Canada has a role to play in providing safe and lower emission resources to the world's energy mix."" However, Canada led an initiative at COP27 called the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge. It calls for a carbon price. At COP26 in Glasgow, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had challenged the world to triple the global coverage of carbon pricing by 2030. COP27 \"

They included cutting the most harmful air pollution exposure by a third, and raising species populations 10% by 2042. A consultation opened in March but Environment Secretary Therese Coffey told MPs: ""In light of the volume of material and the significant public response we will not be able to publish targets by 31 October, as required by the Environment Act.

Shadow Environment Secretary Jim McMahon blasted it was a ""huge embarrassment and deeply worrying for the UK's environment. ""Failing to meet the legal deadline to introduce targets to ensure we have clean air land and water amounts to a monumental dereliction of duty."" No10 insisted it had ""hit or exceeded every carbon budget"" faster than any other G7 country. Previously a royal source had stressed the King -an outspoken campaigner against climate change when he was Prince of Wales -""remains ever mindful"" of his ""constitutional role"". The royal source added at the time: ""Government advice was sought, advice was given and advice was appreciated."" Dr Coffey defended Rishi Sunak 's no-show at the COP27 climate talks -by claiming the gathering in Egypt was ""low key"" and the ""big political"" summits only happen every five years, like Glasgow 2021. She told Sky News: ""I am not aware of, say, President Biden or President Macron or any of those other people will be there.""

Deforestation rose to a 15-year high under his defeated election rival, President Bolsonaro. In his first big speech on the international stage since his victory, Lula said tackling global warming required countries to act together because  alone we are vulnerable to the climate tragedy . Brazil would like to host the 2025 UN climate conference somewhere within the Amazon, he said. The biggest city in the rainforest is Manaus, a former rubber boom town with an opera house.

Extreme weather events linked to climate change are increasingly threatening the security of food and water supply across the globe. Africa, already struggling with low agricultural production and heavily degraded soils, is disproportionally affected. To help support government and nonprofit organizations on the continent address these challenges, Esri, the global leader in location intelligence, has collaborated with Microsoft on a sustainable agriculture development initiative in Africa. Together, Esri and Microsoft will create and launch technology solutions enabling organizations in Africa to perform crop-type mapping at scale to improve agricultural management. 'Microsoft and Esri have a long history of working together, including a recent initiative to create global land-cover maps through the Planetary Computer Program, featuring a catalog of global environmental data from Esri's ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World,' said Richard Budden, Esri's deputy general manager for the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 'We are excited to now extend that collaboration to support sustainable agriculture development in Africa.' Across the African continent, there is an urgent need to improve agricultural productivity. Deeper understanding of the current agricultural landscape, close monitoring of crop conditions throughout the growing season, and mitigation of climate change impacts will all contribute to better production and food security. Crop patterns and health can be identified, extracted, and monitored seasonally by combining Esri's geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) capabilities, satellite imagery, as well as Microsoft's infrastructure and AI devices. Having data related to water, fertilizer, and seed use accessible at the right time will help enable more sustainable agricultural practices and improve crop yield forecasts. Key stakeholders can derive insights from the data through intuitive visualizations, applications, and dashboards to make better-informed business and policy decisions. To empower government agencies in Africa with geospatial tools in support of sustainable agriculture development, Esri recently launched the Geospatial Program for Agriculture in Africa. The company is participating in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. At the Microsoft booth, which was made from recycled materials, Esri will demonstrate how GIS is fundamental to achieving sustainable agricultural development in Africa.

He is currently based in Uganda, where he is studying the effects of extreme weather events which are increasing in frequency and intensity. ""Africa has contributed 4 per cent to the global CO2 emissions, but it has disproportionately suffered from the impacts,"" Dr Okello told the Cambridge Independent. ""These include occurrences of water-borne diseases such as dysentery, cholera, hepatitis E, vector-borne diseases, especially malaria, and malnutrition-related illnesses. The impacts are aggravated by various existing societal challenges such as poverty, rapid population growth, complex governance and institutional aspects occurring at various levels in the country."" The damage being caused to Uganda's land includes flash floods near Mount Elgon that ""cause hundreds of deaths every year and displace thousands of people"". Record heavy rains in 2020 raised the water level in Lake Victoria to its highest in 50 years and destroyed farmland, cattle, crops, property and infrastructure. Incidences of malaria and cholera subsequently rose alarmingly. Locust infestations are an increasing worry. ""Even a small swarm of the insects can consume enough food for 35,000 people in a day,"" says Gabriel. Shockingly, air pollution deaths in Africa are second only to malnutrition, and caused 1.1 million deaths in 2019 alone. The issue is centred on cities of course, where World Health Organization air quality guidelines are regularly breached. The solution, says Gabriel, ""requires adopting collaborative approach among the various societal actors in policy, business, community, and academia"". For instance, increasing the number of people with access to electricity. Adopting clearer household energy with ""LPG, biogas, briquettes, ethanol and solar"". But the first thing that Gabriel is looking for was a sense of urgency from leaders who attended COP27 ""Climate change is a huge worry to the people of Uganda given the effects being experienced,"" Gabriel says. ""However, addressing climate change has to be integrated with existing societal challenges including poverty, rapid population growth and governance aspects occurring at various levels of society. ""My hope is for all nations, especially the rich nations, to step up the urgency to address climate change through policy, funding research, innovations and strategies that are addressing climate change. ""Resources should be allocated to initiatives building resilience against the existing and inevitable future impacts of the climate crisis. ""Heavy penalties should be introduced to the high-emitting countries and sectors. High emitting countries should also provide clear plans for decarbonisation. Subsidies should be provided to entities providing technologies and initiatives that are decarbonising communities."" Gabriel is helping a collaborative approach to climate change issues and is also ""translating the academic evidence into policy recommendations and using my current knowledge to spark action at strategic and policy level"". He concludes: ""I am investing time in communication and stakeholder engagement increase awareness about air pollution and climate change."" The issue of providing financial assistance to poorer countries most affected by climate change proved one of the thorniest knots on the COP27 agenda. Several European leaders at COP27 -\~but not the US -\~announced funds to help such nations recover from the loss and damage which has largely been created by industrialisation. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK270","COP27 draws to close with very little progress made","November 19, 2022","i-Independent Print Ltd","The COP27 climate change summit looks set to end without any meaningful agreement after the deadline for negotiations passed. Delegates from around the world are expected to continue working on some kind of accord in Sharm el- Sheikh today, and into Sunday. There is little hope, though, that it will come close to what is needed to tackle the climate emergency, experts said. It leaves the target agreed at Glasgow last year - of keeping temperature within the 1.5\'b0C target - unachievable, given that the planet has already warmed by around 1.2\'b0C. Hopes of keeping it below 2\'b0C, as promised at the 2015 Paris COP, also look increasingly unlikely. Existing pledges, if met, would still see global warming of about 2.5\'b0C. Little to no progress has been made on the major sticking points of the summit, including whether richer nations should give reparations to poorer nations for ""loss and damage"" caused by climate change, or help them more to cut emissions and adapt to a changing climate. The UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said: ""There has been clearly, as in past times, a breakdown in trust between North and South, and between developed and emerging economies. This is no time for finger-pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction."" Even a late proposal by the EU to back a ""loss and damage"" fund - meaning richer nations giving reparations to poorer nations for causing climate change - was poorly received, with critics saying it attempted to set developing countries against one another by granting money to only the most vulnerable. ActionAid Kenya's executive director, Susan Otieno, told i: ""If rich countries don't agree to a loss and damage fund at COP27 then the knock-on effect of this disaster will mean our region will be condemned to even deeper debt and poverty for many more years to come."" There was also little progress on pledging greater emissions cuts in future. The latest version of the draft text for the COP cover letter agreement contained little to nothing substantial that was new, experts said. James Dyke, associate professor at Exeter University's Global Systems Institute, said: ""I certainly don't believe any politicians involved in COP27 have any intentions of implementing the transformative policies that 1.5 now demands."" \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK271","-MIT - A breakthrough on 'loss and damage,' but also disappointment, at UN climate conference","November 30, 2022 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","As the 2022 United Nations climate change conference , known as COP27 , stretched into its final hours on Saturday, Nov. 19, it was uncertain what kind of agreement might emerge from two weeks of intensive international negotiations. In the end, COP27 produced mixed results: on the one hand, a historic agreement for wealthy countries to compensate low-income countries for 'loss and damage,' but on the other, limited progress on new plans for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. 'We need to drastically reduce emissions now - and this is an issue this COP did not address,' said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement at the conclusion of COP27 . 'A fund for loss and damage is essential - but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map or turns an entire African country to desert.' Throughout the two weeks of the conference, a delegation of MIT students, faculty, and staff was at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Center to observe the negotiations, conduct and share research, participate in panel discussions, and forge new connections with researchers, policymakers, and advocates from around the world. Loss and damage A key issue coming in to COP27 (COP stands for 'conference of the parties' to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, held for the 27th time) was loss and damage: a term used by the U.N. to refer to harms caused by climate change - either through acute catastrophes like extreme weather events or slower-moving impacts like sea level rise - to which communities and countries are unable to adapt. Ultimately, a deal on loss and damage proved to be COP27 's most prominent accomplishment. Negotiators reached an eleventh-hour agreement to 'establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.' 'Providing financial assistance to developing countries so they can better respond to climate-related loss and damage is not only a moral issue, but also a pragmatic one,' said Michael Mehling, deputy director of the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, who attended COP27 and participated in side events. 'Future emissions growth will be squarely centered in the developing world, and offering support through different channels is key to building the trust needed for more robust global cooperation on mitigation.' Youssef Shaker, a graduate student in the MIT Technology and Policy Program and a research assistant with the MIT Energy Initiative, attended the second week of the conference, where he followed the negotiations over loss and damage closely. 'While the creation of a fund is certainly an achievement,' Shaker said, 'significant questions remain to be answered, such as the size of the funding available as well as which countries receive access to it.' A loss-and-damage fund that is not adequately funded, Shaker noted, 'would not be an impactful outcome.' The agreement on loss and damage created a new committee, made up of 24 country representatives, to 'operationalize' the new funding arrangements, including identifying funding sources. The committee is tasked with delivering a set of recommendations at COP28, which will take place next year in Dubai. Advising the U.N. on net zero Though the decisions reached at COP27 did not include major new commitments on reducing emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, the transition to a clean global energy system was nevertheless a key topic of conversation throughout the conference. The Council of Engineers for the Energy Transition (CEET), an independent, international body of engineers and energy systems experts formed to provide advice to the U.N. on achieving net-zero emissions globally by 2050, convened for the first time at COP27 . Jessika Trancik, a professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society and a member of CEET, spoke on a U.N.-sponsored panel on solutions for the transition to clean energy. Trancik noted that the energy transition will look different in different regions of the world. 'As engineers, we need to understand those local contexts and design solutions around those local contexts - that's absolutely essential to support a rapid and equitable energy transition.' At the same time, Trancik noted that there is now a set of 'low-cost, ready-to-scale tools' available to every region - tools that resulted from a globally competitive process of innovation, stimulated by public policies in different countries, that dramatically drove down the costs of technologies like solar energy and lithium-ion batteries. The key, Trancik said, is for regional transition strategies to 'tap into global processes of innovation.' Reinventing climate adaptation Elfatih Eltahir, the H. M. King Bhumibol Professor of Hydrology and Climate, traveled to COP27 to present plans for the Jameel Observatory Climate Resilience Early Warning System (CREWSnet), one of the five projects selected in April 2022 as a flagship in MIT's Climate Grand Challenges initiative. CREWSnet focuses on climate adaptation, the term for adapting to climate impacts that are unavoidable. The aim of CREWSnet, Eltahir told the audience during a panel discussion, is 'nothing short of reinventing the process of climate change adaptation,' so that it is proactive rather than reactive; community-led; data-driven and evidence-based and so that it integrates different climate risks, from heat waves to sea level rise, rather than treating them individually. 'However, it's easy to talk about these changes,' said Eltahir. 'The real challenge, which we are now just launching and engaging in, is to demonstrate that on the ground.' Eltahir said that early demonstrations will happen in a couple of key locations, including southwest Bangladesh, where multiple climate risks - rising sea levels, increasing soil salinity, and intensifying heat waves and cyclones - are combining to threaten the area's agricultural production. Building on COP26 Some members of MIT's delegation attended COP27 At an official U.N. side event co-organized by MIT on Nov. 11, Greg Sixt, the director of the Food and Climate Systems Transformation (FACT) Alliance led by the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab, provided an update on the alliance's work since its launch at COP26. Food systems are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions - and are increasingly vulnerable to climate impacts. The FACT Alliance works to better connect researchers to farmers, food businesses, policymakers, and other food systems stakeholders to make food systems (which include food production, consumption, and waste) more sustainable and resilient. Sixt told the audience that the FACT Alliance now counts over 20 research and stakeholder institutions around the world among its members, but also collaborates with other institutions in an 'open network model' to advance work in key areas - such as a new research project exploring how climate scenarios could affect global food supply chains. Marcela Angel, research program director for the Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI), helped convene a meeting at COP27 of the Afro-InterAmerican Forum on Climate Change, which also launched at COP26. The forum works with Afro-descendant leaders across the Americas to address significant environmental issues, including climate risks and biodiversity loss. At the event - convened with the Colombian government and the nonprofit Conservation International - ESI brought together leaders from six countries in the Americas and presented recent work that estimates that there are over 178 million individuals who identify as Afro-descendant living in the Americas, in lands of global environmental importance. 'There is a significant overlap between biodiversity hot spots, protected areas, and areas of high Afro-descendant presence,' said Angel. 'But the role and climate contributions of these communities is understudied, and often made invisible.' Limiting methane emissions Methane is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas: When released into the atmosphere, it immediately traps about 120 times more heat than carbon dioxide does. More than 150 countries have now signed the Global Methane Pledge, launched at COP26, which aims to reduce methane emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Sergey Paltsev, the deputy director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change and a senior research scientist at the MIT Energy Initiative, gave the keynote address at a Nov. 17 event on methane, where he noted the importance of methane reductions from the oil and gas sector to meeting the 2030 goal. 'The oil and gas sector is where methane emissions reductions could be achieved the fastest,' said Paltsev. 'We also need to employ an integrated approach to address methane emissions in all sectors and all regions of the world because methane emissions reductions provide a near-term pathway to avoiding dangerous tipping points in the global climate system.' 'Keep fighting relentlessly' Arina Khotimsky, a senior majoring in materials science and engineering and a co-president of the MIT Energy and Climate Club, attended the first week of COP27 . She reflected on the experience in a social media post after returning home. 'COP will always have its haters. Is there greenwashing Of course! Is everyone who should have a say in this process in the room Not even close,' wrote Khotimsky. 'So what does it take for COP to matter It takes everyone who attended to not only put 'climate' on front-page news for two weeks, but to return home and keep fighting relentlessly against climate change.

Extreme weather events linked to climate change are increasingly threatening the security of food and water supply across the globe. Africa, already struggling with low agricultural production and heavily degraded soils, is disproportionally affected. To help support government and nonprofit organizations on the continent address these challenges, Esri, the global leader in location intelligence, has collaborated with Microsoft on a sustainable agriculture development initiative in Africa. Together, Esri and Microsoft will create and launch technology solutions enabling organizations in Africa to perform crop-type mapping at scale to improve agricultural management. 'Microsoft and Esri have a long history of working together, including a recent initiative to create global land-cover maps through the Planetary Computer Program, featuring a catalog of global environmental data from Esri's ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World,' said Richard Budden, Esri's deputy general manager for the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 'We are excited to now extend that collaboration to support sustainable agriculture development in Africa.' Across the African continent, there is an urgent need to improve agricultural productivity. Deeper understanding of the current agricultural landscape, close monitoring of crop conditions throughout the growing season, and mitigation of climate change impacts will all contribute to better production and food security. Crop patterns and health can be identified, extracted, and monitored seasonally by combining Esri's geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) capabilities, satellite imagery, as well as Microsoft's infrastructure and AI devices. Having data related to water, fertilizer, and seed use accessible at the right time will help enable more sustainable agricultural practices and improve crop yield forecasts. Key stakeholders can derive insights from the data through intuitive visualizations, applications, and dashboards to make better-informed business and policy decisions. To empower government agencies in Africa with geospatial tools in support of sustainable agriculture development, Esri recently launched the Geospatial Program for Agriculture in Africa. The company is participating in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. At the Microsoft booth, which was made from recycled materials, Esri will demonstrate how GIS is fundamental to achieving sustainable agricultural development in Africa.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK275","Cultivated meat in the Middle East: Low consumer awareness, but huge interest once informed - GOOD Meat","November 16, 2022 Wednesday 6:34 AM GMT+1","FoodNavigator-Asia.com","Cultivated meat pioneers GOOD Meat says that consumer awareness of such products is still relatively low in the Middle East, but that there is significant interest to purchase once they have been exposed to the concept. A recent study conducted by PSB Insights and commissioned by GOOD Meat, the cultivated meat division of\~food technology company\~Eat Just, Inc., found that only 34% of respondents in six Middle East countries had heard of cultivated meat. The countries are namely Egypt, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study, which included more than 2,000 respondents, also revealed that consumer awareness of cultivated meat is highest in the UAE and lowest in Egypt. Although the respondents identified cultivated meat products as being beneficial to animals, healthy, safe, and good for food security, they could not differentiate between alternative proteins and their benefits. According to the findings, three in five respondents have ever purchased plant-based meat alternatives, indicating a potential market for these products. ""Young people, in particular, believe that\~technology-driven solutions are the answer to climate-change challenges. Furthermore, respondents said they would be willing to pay more if cultivated meat could show it's healthier and safer than traditional meat,"" Tetrick added. Eating out is common in the Middle Eastern region, with a quarter of respondents doing so at least four times a week. Chicken is the most frequently consumed protein in restaurants, followed by beef and fish.\~The study suggested a slightly higher likelihood of consumers purchasing cultivated chicken (87%) compared to cultivated beef (81%).\~ There is also a strong preference for domestically produced food, with more than half the respondents worried about long-term food security. Many believe cultivated meat production could help address both concerns. Following a partnership with Doha Venture Capital and Qatar Free Zones Authority (QFZA) last year, GOOD Meat aims to set foot in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region via Qatar. The collaboration sought to build a cultivated meat facility in the Umm Alhoul Free Zone, one of two free zones overseen and regulated by QFZA. QFZA and the Ministry of Public Health had also previously indicated their intention to grant regulatory approval for GOOD Meat's cultivated chicken in the near future. Plans to build facilities in other Middle East markets are in the pipeline. In response to findings stating that consumers are willing to make the switch if the meat is halal, GOOD meat said they are in discussions with the relevant parties to assess the required conditions more thoroughly, though halal accreditation is expected 'in due course'. Playing a part for food resilience GOOD Meat gained regulatory approval in Singapore to retail lab-grown meat in\~November 2020.

The prime minister last week insisted he must focus on the ""depressing domestic challenges"" rather than go to the COP27 conference in Egypt, drawing widespread criticism, including from within the Tory ranks. But after reports this might change, No 10 confirmed yesterday the position was ""under review"". The PM's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister is focused on pressing domestic issues, most significantly preparing for the autumn statement, so any attendance at COP would depend on progress on preparation for that fiscal event, and that work is ongoing. ""The prime minister fully recognises the importance of the COP summit and is fully committed to addressing climate change."" As ""substantial progress"" is being made on the November 17 budget, he said the position on COP27 is kept ""under review"". Parliament's cross-party environment group wrote to Mr Sunak yesterday calling on him to attend the summit in Sharm El- Sheik. The group, which includes backbench Tory MPs, added: ""We hope that, as prime minister, you will use your power to support environmental politics which improve the economy whilst enhancing the environment at home and abroad."" Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth said: ""The prime minister is right to reconsider his decision not to attend the climate summit. ""But showing up is not enough - Sunak's government must do far more to demonstrate its commitment to building a fossil fuel-free future."" The Green Party also called on Mr Sunak to show ""global leadership"" by making the trip to Egypt, warning this year's talks are ""more important than ever"". The government's climate tsar Alok Sharma had said he was ""disappointed"" by the decision not to attend the COP27 summit, while Tory former chancellor George Osborne asked why Mr Sunak would ""trash"" the party's record on the environment. US President Joe Biden is expected to attend, and reports suggest Mr Sunak's arch-rival Boris Johnson could also go. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: ""Last Friday his environment secretary said Rishi Sunak wasn't going because COP27 wasn't a big summit. Now... he might go if he can find the time. ""A dithering prime minister who cannot even decide whether he is going to a major environmental summit cannot provide the leadership our country needs."" \"

The Egyptian authorities thought Cop27 would be their moment in the sun, with the president taking photos with all the world leaders, said Hussein Baoumi of Amnesty International.  But then, because of the bravery of human rights defenders and Sanaa Seif, it wasn\' t about him or his vision of Egypt. It became about the reality that tens of thousands of people in Egypt live with, which is the human rights crisis. Since coming to power in a military coup in 2013, Sisi has worked to crush any space for dissent.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK280","COP27   Infarm seeks support to commercialise indoor-grown wheat","November 10, 2022 Thursday 11:21 AM GMT","just-food global news","Vertical-farming business Infarm has published the results of a wheat-growing trial to the COP27 summit in Egypt as the German firm seeks to drum up backing for commercialisation. The Berlin-based company, regarded as a vertical-farming pioneer in Europe, has trialled the production of wheat in its indoor R&D laboratory and projects superior yields to the field-farmed crop in a scaled-up scenario. Infarm, set up in 2013, said in a statement: The first trials demonstrated exceptional results, allowing a projection of 11.7 kg per m2 yield per year. Further projected at scale, this is the equivalent of 117 tonnes per hectare per year &#8211; 26 times that of open-field farming yields. It is a bold step in what is still a relatively nascent industry only just expanding beyond fresh leafy greens and herbs into berry-type fruits and basic vegetables like mushrooms. High input costs technology and energy also tend to make on-shelf prices more expensive than traditional produce, presenting a challenge for wheat grown in a system providing environmental benefits. The business, which is co-hosting the Food Systems Pavilion at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, claims to be the first vertical-farming company to tackle staple crop production in a controlled environment . Infarm plans to use the summit to emphasise the governmental and institutional financial support that many industry participants argue is needed for the alternative-farming technique to become more mainstream, cost competitive and profitable. Our first step is to make governments and financial institutions aware of the tremendous potential of indoor vertical farming to enhance climate resilience and food security, a spokesperson for Infarm tells Just Food. This will help pave the way for the sector to access government grants and subsidies, in addition to private investment. Scientific endeavour Proponents argue controlled environment farming offers some benefits over traditional agriculture such as eliminating the use of soil, less water usage and fewer land resources, zero pesticides and greater yields because of year-round cultivation assisted by artificial lighting. However, traditional wheat farmers might be opposed to the prospect of competition from a crop grown in a controlled indoor environment, a particular challenge in countries where cereal crop production is government subsidised. Scaling this project and commercialising indoor-farmed wheat is a significant scientific and engineering endeavour, the Infarm spokesperson said. Though the technology is feasible, further research and development is necessary to grow wheat commercially and we will continue to focus on that. In the wider context, Infarm s co-founder and CEO Erez Galonska told Just Food in May: Even when you look at COP27 and beyond, we are already speaking with policymakers, NGOs, with different kinds of organisations, to help us galvanise people to start and think about what we eat, what the supply chain is going to look like in the future, where food is going to be produced, the insecurity of food, what we can do and what we can t do the role of grants, subsidies, and regulatory issues. With COP27 Infarm added via the spokesperson: This trial was the first step and successfully demonstrated the potential of producing wheat in an indoor farm. This proof of concept can now be used to develop a path to commercialisation. Food security is a huge issue here at COP27 , following climate shocks and the supply issues of the Ukraine war, and governments are looking at ways to ensure a more food-secure future.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK281","Climate activists priced out of Cop27 summit in Egypt","November 5, 2022 Saturday","The Independent - Daily Edition","Next week, all eyes will be on the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh for the United Nations climate summit, where life-and-death decisions will be made for some of the world's most vulnerable people. The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or Cop27 Prior UN negotiations have been criticised for being exclusionary but it was hoped that ""Africa's Cop"" - taking place on the continent most vulnerable to climate change and least resilient in recovery - would place it front and centre. However, instead of providing easier access to voices from developing countries in the global South, activists have told The Independent that participating in Cop27 is even more challenging than previous summits, like Cop26 in Glasgow which saw massive participation from civil society and youth groups. Dozens of activists and organisations from Asia to Latin America, many of whom work with victims of climate catastrophes, say they are being forced to skip the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting despite the clamour for climate justice to be a central issue. ""I have been saving money for the last six months to be able to attend the conference,"" says Mali, a 22-year-old climate activist from southern India, who asked that her last name not be used. ""I was so happy when I found an accommodation in my budget in August and I quickly booked it. ""But in October I received a message from the owner that my booking has been cancelled. When I repeatedly called to ask for a reason, I was told they are listing it again at prices much higher than what I saw, and said if I still wanted it, I can book it at the new rate."" Activists say attending the UN climate talks remains a privilege for those that can secure enough funding and accreditation, with very little effort taking place to bridge the gap. A group of climate activists in South America carried out a survey among their peers to find out how many will actually be able to attend Cop27 despite having official UN accreditation. They found that 93 out of 145 respondents were experiencing problems with accommodation, either last-minute cancellations or being priced out. ""The hiking prices of hotels fuelled by unfair practices such as the cancellation of bookings ... worsen the already difficult conditions to access affordable and safe accommodation near the venue,"" Azul Schvartzman and Maria Aguilar, youth climate activists from Argentina and Colombia told The Independent. Similar accounts have been shared by activists on social media who received last-minute cancellations from hotels and rental properties, and then saw them relisted at much higher rates. Carbon Pulse, a news organisation, tweeted that it booked accommodation costing \£311,000 in November 2021. The reservations were cancelled in September and the rooms re-advertised at three times the price. Earlier this year, Climate Home News reported that the Egyptian tourism ministry had imposed a floor price for rooms in Sharm el-Sheikh at several times their usual cost, driving up prices ahead of the crucial conference. The Egyptian government denied the allegation and said that no government order was in place. Soon after, the government advertised 400 subsidised rooms for youth activists wanting to attend the conference. However many activists say their experiences have been different from what the Egyptian government says. Vikrant Srivastava, founder of the youth-led, climate-focused Nisarg Foundation told The Independent that he tried booking accommodation using the Egyptian government's subsidised room policy but didn't receive any confirmation for weeks. ""Even after paying, my accommodation has not been confirmed,"" he added. The Independent has contacted the Egyptian embassy and Cop27 organisers for comment. Many activists from Africa who couldn't attend Cop26 due to costs and pandemic-related restrictions were hopeful of making it to Egypt. Africa contributes less than 4 per cent of global greenhouse emissions but is most vulnerable to climate impacts. Christine Mbithi, Africa regional campaigner with climate group 350.org, told The Independent that a large number of people were unable to secure rooms because of exorbitant prices, and that hotels were looking at Cop27 as a profit-making opportunity. ""It's a shame that this is an African Cop and the communities worst impacted by climate change are not getting represented, they are not going to be able to speak for themselves, someone else will be speaking on their behalf."" Observers say Egypt's decision to hold Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, a small city of luxury resorts instead of the larger, more accessible capital Cairo, underlines how affordability was not considered a factor. According to the UN, over 30,000 people are registered to take part in Cop27 . Egyptian officials have said there will be space for protesters to gather at the summit but only in a purpose-built area near the highway away from the conference centre. ""No one is allowed here without registration,"" Major General Khaled Fouda, governor of the South Sinai region where Sharm el-Sheikh is located, said last month. Activists say the message to them is clear - there isn't much space for protest. The concerns were echoed by Greta Thunberg who announced she will not be attending this year's summit. ""I'm not going to Cop27 for many reasons but the space for civil society this year is extremely limited,"" she said during an interview at her book launch in London last week. Mr Srivastava says there's also a sense of fear among many activists, especially those from gender minorities, that they aren't welcome at this conference. ""I know people who really had something to contribute to this conference but eventually decided not to go because of the fear of the way [Egypt's] government treats protestors,"" he said. ""Most of those going to Cop are from big organisations and big cities like Delhi, where you have the embassy. Is anyone coming from the northeastern part of India, is anyone coming from Odisha? No! Because people from these regions can not travel to Delhi just to apply for a visa."" Similar views were expressed by activists from Pakistan, which has experienced catastrophic flooding that left 33 million people displaced. Pakistan's prime minister Shahbaz Sharif is expected to make a case for compensation from rich countries to poorer ones at Cop27 , an issue known as loss and damage. A large number of Pakistan's activists, who have worked on the front lines of the recent climate disaster, do not have any means to reach the conference. ""Millions of people in Pakistan will spend years recovering from the floods we faced this year. They are victims of climate change and deserve to be heard. But how many of them can reach Egypt to speak about their tragedies?"" asks Khalid Waqar, who runs a charity in the hilly areas of northern Pakistan. ""A conference that aims to talk about climate change should not be happening in a resort but in a place where you can see what is actually happening to people."" \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK282","Rishi Sunak must show he is a climate leader after COP27 U-turn","November 2, 2022 Wednesday 7:40 AM GMT","Belfast Telegraph Online","On the same day that the UN warned that countries are not on track to keep below 1.5\'b0C of warming, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that he would not be attending the UN climate change conference COP27 . Not great timing. However, after causing much disarray among environmentalists as well as members of his own party, including COP26 President Alok Sharma, Sunak has performed a dramatic U-turn: announcing that he will now attend COP27 . The Prime Minister\' s initial decision to stay in the UK faced backlash from the media, sparked outrage from international communities and even led to criticism from the UN Secretary General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres. It felt like this U-turn was somewhat inevitable. Crucially, the fact that Boris Johnson also confirmed that he will head to Egypt for the UN climate negotiations may have accelerated this U-turn. A Downing Street spokesperson had previously explained that Sunak\' s reasoning for not attending COP27 was \' due to other pressing domestic commitments including preparations for the autumn Budget\' . The suggestion being that he was \' too busy\' and that there are pressing things to deal with at home. However, this raises profound contradictions: is climate change not a pressing domestic issue? Yes \- climate change is a global crisis, but it also requires domestic efforts. Domestic climate policies in the UK, like energy efficiency programmes, help us to prepare for and mitigate climate change impacts. In addition, the climate crisis is at the epicentre of the other issues that we face in the UK, like energy costs and food insecurity. It\' s the primary driver behind these social, economic issues. Rishi Sunak\' s tweet this morning bore some recognition of this unquestionable fact: that climate change is related to every facet of our lives. He wrote: \' There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables. This appeared to drive his newly discovered motivation for attending COP27 next week, as well as using the conference as an opportunity \' to deliver on Glasgow\' s legacy\' . The question of legacy in an important one. The fact that the UK hosted COP26 in Glasgow last year \- and that they still hold the COP presidency until the beginning of negotiations in Egypt \- would have made Sunak\' s absence look even worse. At the end of COP26, it was clear that much of the work had not been tied up. Key issues, like climate finance and adaptation, were pushed back to COP27 , and nations, like the UK, promised that they would deal with these issues, and raise their levels of ambition, in Egypt. For instance, COP26 saw the creation of a two-year \' Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaption\' , recognising that additional work would be required at COP27 to provide finance for adaptation. Sunak, then, will join world leaders, like Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron on the global stage next week \- but it is important for the Prime Minister to remember that this is not a \' tick box\' or PR exercise. This event is about more than simply \' showing up\' or \' attending\' . This is not about world leaders meeting other world leaders, photo opportunities, or creating the conditions for claims of showing \' leadership\' . Rather, this is about demonstrating global solidarity, and taking responsibility. It\' s an inconvenient truth, but unfortunately, while COP21 in Paris and COP26 in Glasgow were held up a \' temple COPs\' , the UK government have framed COP27 as an \' in-between COP\' . This is, in part, why it took so long for Rishi Sunak to confirm his attendance. COP27 builds upon the legacy of COP27 , but the negotiations will be centred around issues that are different to the UK agenda. Importantly, this doesn\' t mean these issues are any less significant. As an African COP, COP27 will be centred around issues like climate finance, Loss and Damage reparations, and adaptation. It will be about wealthy nations, that have contributed disproportionately to the climate crisis, delivering funds for low-income countries who are feeling the worst effects of climate change. The fact of the matter is that rich nations, like the UK, are responsible for a greater volume of carbon emissions than countries in the African continent, for example. Wealthy nations (like the UK, the EU and the US) are home to just 14% global population, yet they are responsible for nearly 50% of historic emissions. By contrast, African countries emit 27 times less carbon than the global average. This is unjust, and the UK needs to help countries, worst impacted by the climate crisis, to come up with solutions to climate change and to create resilience. Floods in Pakistan and Nigeria. Drought in the Horn of Africa. Low-income countries are paying the price for a crisis they did cause. Yet the UK \- a self-proclaimed \' climate leader\' \- is abdicating leadership, abdicating responsibility, and writing itself out of the global narrative. Thankfully, the Prime Minister has been forced to re-evaluate his decision, but I would encourage him not just to \' attend\' COP27 . Instead, Rishi Sunak must use COP27 as an opportunity to deliver justice and show global solidarity. This is what it means to be a \' climate leader\' . \"

There was much excitement from JBS, Nestl\'e9, the world\' s largest food and drinks company, and the meat and dairy trade groups about the boom in methane-reducing feed additives made from ingredients such as seaweed, ozone, enzyme inhibitors, green tea and garlic. But the long-term risks and benefits of these emerging products remain unclear, and those currently on the market are only affordable to industrial cattle farmers and food companies that are invested in growing meat and dairy consumption, not reducing it.  At best, these technologies provide a cover for the large meat and dairy corporations to continue overproducing on polluting factory farms, said Amanda Starbuck, research director at Food and Water Watch.

Fertilizer companies know they will soon be under scrutiny and are trying to divert attention from production to more efficient use by the farmers.

But neither subsidies nor agroecology were on the agenda at Cop27 .  It was very disturbing to see a large contingent of corporate lobbyists influencing the process while small-scale farmers have been shut out and drowned out, said Million Belay, an Ipes-Food expert and general coordinator of the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa, a large grassroots movement.  Farmers demanded recognition for diverse, resilient farming, agroecology and climate finance, but they left with very little. \"

The release of the draft agreement -which is expected to change amid ongoing negotiations -is the defining moment of https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cop27 Cop27 so far, allowing the world a first look at their HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/countries countries \' collective vision for tackling the HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-emergency climate emergency . The current version has many  placeholders on the thorniest issues, notably on funding arrangements for https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/loss loss and HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/damage damage . The issue of how to compensate vulnerable countries for climate destruction has been a central issue at the two-week conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The draft states, with concern, the  growing gravity, scope and frequency of loss and damage in all regions, and underlines that an  adequate and effective response is of  great importance to the continued credibility and relevance of the United Nations\' climate process. Developed nations, grown rich by burning fossil fuels, have admitted that loss and damage needs to be addressed. But many, including the United States, have pushed back on the concept of a new fund. A breakdown in trust between the Global North and South has led to threats by some developing countries that they are ready to walk out of negotiations, according to reports. Other key takeaways from the Cop27 draft include: -Reaffirms resolution to pursue 1.5C global average temperature limit as enshrined in Glasgow Climate Pact -Limiting to 1.5C requires  rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions -No inclusion of India\' s demand for the  phase down of all fossil fuels rather than just coal -Contradictory language on  phasing down versus  phasing out coal -Calls for Multilateral Development Banks and other institutions to reform to address climate emergency without worsening the debt burdens of poor countries. Keeping 1.5C \' alive\' The Cop27 But the draft  notes with serious concern that countries\' emissions-reduction plans are not in line with keeping to 1.5C, or 2C. Limiting to 1.5C would require  rapid, deep and sustained cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the document states, and  strongly urges parties that have not yet submitted more ambitious plans to do so. Analysts point out that this language on reducing emissions is not new and does not represent progress from Glasgow. At Cop26, countries were requested to  revisit and strengthen their 2030 climate targets in 2022 but HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/g20-countries-un-deadline-cop27-egpyt-b2176224.html so far only a handful have done so While the Cop27  It\' s not responding to calls we heard in the room for strengthened language on 1.5C and on 2030 climate targets, Tom Evans, a policy adviser at the climate think tank E3G, explained on the draft. Some countries are pushing for the final Cop27 agreement to emphasize the need to peak emissions in 2025 -the HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/ deadline for keeping 1.5C The status quo, however, is preferable to a weakening of the commitment to 1.5C, as some officials had feared ahead of the first draft being published. A Western official told The Independent on Thursday that Brazil, China and Russia were among the countries backsliding on the Glasgow commitment to  keep 1.5C alive . The official said the countries were pushing for the Paris goal of  well below 2C , rather than the more ambitious 1.5C. The Independent has contacted country representatives for comment. Fossil fuels v coal alone The draft text has no mention of HYPERLINK India\' s demand to include a statement on the  phase down of all fossil fuels . The Glasgow Climate Pact called on countries to accelerate efforts towards the  phase down of unabated coal power. Cop27 , India -which is heavily dependent on coal -has pushed for the final agreement to make a statement on reducing all fossil fuel use. While that move was described by some negotiators as a  tactical decision , it nevertheless gained the support of a number of countries, and the European Union. Instead, the draft text includes two conflicting messages on coal. At one point, the pact  encourages the continued efforts to accelerate measures towards the phase down of unabated coal power... Analysts say the current draft does not make progress on Cop26\' s aim of consigning coal to history. The International Energy Agency HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/world/coal-cop27-india-china-fossil-fuel-b2225742.html?r=5881 warned this week that global coal use must be slashed by 90 per cent by 2050 to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C. The text also includes peculiar language on fossil fuel subsidies -government interventions that lower the costs of production for the fossil fuel industry. The Glasgow Climate Pact called on countries to  phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, making it the first-ever UN climate agreement to mention fossil fuels, which are largely responsible for the climate crisis. In Friday\' s draft, one sentence encouraged countries to phase out and  rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, which appeared to be a step backward from Glasgow. Money, money, money How climate finance works -and more importantly doesn\' t work for many countries -has been another major issue at Cop27 . Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, and other leaders of small island states and vulnerable countries, want an overhaul of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and other international financial institutions which lend money to help countries recover from devastating impacts like hurricanes and extreme flooding -but do so on vastly inequitable terms. The Cop27 It also  urges MDBs to align their operations with the Paris Agreement, and climate change emergency. Notably, the draft  expresses grave concern that rich countries have failed to meet their 2020 pledge of providing $100bn in climate finance per year to support poor countries, and  urges them to do so. It also states that a roadmap should be developed to deliver on another pledge -doubling of adaptation finance by 2025. This article has been updated \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK287","Climate paralysis at COP27 as no progress made on 1.5 degrees","November 21, 2022","Africa Power Monitor Today","COP finished two days late on November 20 without any new agreements on climate change targets or emissions reductions, although a deal was hammered out to set up an as yet uncosted loss and damage fund. The conference's final communique reaffirmed the UN and governments' desire to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree goals, but did not make any new agreements that are binding on governments on how to it. There was no progress on coal in the document, called a cover decision, with the COP26 phrasing of a ""phase down"" being maintained, while fossil fuels subsidies should be ""phased out,"" again repeating the words of COP26 in Glasgow. On the bright side, the UN stressed that there was an ""urgent need for deep, rapid emissions cuts for 1.5C"". The UN said in a statement: ""The package (of decisions) strengthened action by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as boosting the support of finance, technology and capacity building needed by developing countries."" However, there were no\~high-level targets, merely a long list of reaffirmations by governments of existing commitment made in Glasgow. But the goal of 1.5 degrees is still on the agenda, even though any deal on binding commitments will now have to wait until future COP conferences. On the final days of talks on November 19, there were broadly two camps: EU governments wanted a greater commitment to phasing out fossil fuels and promoting renewables energy, while Asian and Middle Eastern governments\~wanted more watered down language in the final agreements. ""The EU is united in our ambition to move forward and build on what we agreed in Glasgow,"" Timmermans said, ""Our message to partners is clear: We cannot accept that 1.5C dies here and today."" Meanwhile, UK lead negotiator and president of COP26 Alok Sharma was extremely critical of the lack of progress at COP27 , suggesting that a whole year had been wasted. ""The text right now does not go beyond Glasgow and it doesn't even take us to Glasgow,"" he said. The document said that a 43% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was needed by 2030, relative to 2019 levels, if the world was to meet 1.5 degrees. All this, apart from the loss and damage fund, is effectively a repeat of the final Glasgow decision, suggesting that COP27 failed to make any real progress and that powerful interests in Asia and the Middle East again managed to stymie any improved targets for coal or emissions. Put simply, the fight for 1.5 degrees has not yet been won and the battle must go on. Loss and damage The UN stressed in its final statement that the most significant achievement was on loss and damage. ""This outcome moves us forward,"" said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary. ""We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on funding for loss and damage - deliberating over how we address the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change."" A new Transitional Committee is to be set up to recommend how to implement\~both the new funding arrangements and the fund at COP28 next year. However, there was no mention of how much sash the fund would contain. Adaption The UN also said that governments have agreed to push Adaption up the agenda at COP28 in a bid to improve resilience amongst the most vulnerable countries. Adaption\~means investing in infrastructure to prevent disaster climate change that have yet to happen. New pledges, totalling more than $230mn, were made to the Adaptation Fund at COP27 as part of the grandly named Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda. These pledges will help many more vulnerable communities adapt to climate change through concrete adaptation solutions. There was also a commitment to double the annual spending on adaption from $20bn per year at present to $40bn. EU President Ursula von der Leyen was lukewarm in welcoming the final COP27 decision, saying: "" COP27 marks a small step towards climate justice but much more is needed for the planet. We have treated some of the symptoms but not cured the patient from its fever."" "" COP27 Climate finance failure Perhaps the biggest scandal of COP27 was the target of $100bn per year of climate finance flowing from the developed world to developing economies has still not been met, and there was no commitment to finally meet this target. The final document did say that $4 trillion per year was needed to invested in renewable energy by 2030 if the world is to have any chance of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, a global transformation to a low-carbon economy is expected to require investment of at least $4-6 trillion per year. Again, these are merely aspirational targets, and there was no detail of how to raise this money. Fossil fuels are still being treated softly, with only coal to be phased down. The final cover document refers to boosting ""low-emission energy systems,"" as well as\~""clean power generation and energy efficiency measures."" It does not single out oil or gas, allowing countries to continue to invest in fossil fuels as long as they use clean technology, which effectively means various bits of kit that can reduce emissions, such as better flue technology at power stations and more efficient petrol engines for cars. All in all, the language of the final COP27 deal was stronger and more forceful than at COP26, but the agreement was still as toothless as in Glasgow, with no progress on winding down consumption of coal or other fossil fuels. The world now moves forward to COP28 in Abu Dhabi, where a key event will be the First Global Stocktake, which will independently evaluate the progress made by then in implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement. COP27 will probably not receive the most glowing assessment. \"

First drafts of the pact to emerge from the United Nations Cop 27 meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt are expected to be issued tonight. But the promise that the Earth will not be allowed to warm by more than 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) could be dropped, with China pushing for the wording to be dropped. CO2 emissions from coal, gas and oil are on track to hit record levels in 2022 There has been no sign of decrease in global carbon dioxide emissions this year, according to a new report. We are currently releasing record levels of the greenhouse gas, which must be curbed urgently if we are to limit warming to 2.7\'b0F (1.5\'b0C). This limit was one of the goals of the Paris Agreement and, if our current emissions levels persist, there is a 50 per cent chance it will be exceeded in nine years. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par These stark warnings come in the annual Global Carbon Budget report, prepared by over 100 international scientists. It provides an in-depth summary of the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of human activities, and predicts the totals for the end of the year. 'This year we see yet another rise in global fossil CO2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline,' said Professor Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter, who led the study. Read more The Cop - short for Conference of the Parties - is an annual attempt to thrash out a global agreement to curb climate change, and is attended by some 45,000 delegates from 200 countries. China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter by volume, is urging behind the scenes that countries should aim for 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) as it would require less drastic restrictions on its industry. The 1.5c limit emerged at the Paris Climate talks in 2015, when it was agreed that countries should limit warming 'by well below 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F), preferably to 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F)'. On Friday, he laid the blame on countries 'whose 2030 goals are not yet aligned with the Paris temperature goal,' which has been interpreted as a dig at China. Former President of Ireland Mary Robinson told the Irish Times: 'I have been worried that there seems to some kind of attempt to say maybe 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) is not achievable any more. That is not acceptable.' Many scientists say that 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) is probably out of reach as the countries of the world have emitted too much greenhouse gas to make this feasible, with the United Nations Environment Programme predicting the world could be on course for warming nearer to 2.8\'b0C (5\'b0F). Alden Meyer, a long-time observer of UN climate meetings with the environmental think tank E3G, said if the G20 countries meeting in Balil reaffirm their commitment to the 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) goal, led by Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping that will strengthen the goal. But if it is not reasserted, that would make it more likely the pledge is dropped. 'What the two presidents decide in Bali will play directly into the endgame here in Sharm El-Sheikh,' Mr Meyer said. At the Glasgow climate talks last year, Alok Sharma, the Cop president said the talks had kept the chance of limiting global heating to 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F), saying the goal was still alive, but 'its pulse is weak.' 'Can I just remind all of us friends, that at Cop26 we did resolve collectively to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F),' he said. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Humanity is 'unequivocally facing a climate emergency', report warns With carbon dioxide levels at their highest on record and temperatures continuing to rise, Earth has officially reached 'Code Red', a new report has warned. In the 'World Scientists' Warning of a Climate Emergency 2022' report, researchers warn that humanity is 'unequivocally facing a climate emergency'. They analysed 35 planetary vital signs that are used to track climate change, including tree loss from fires and extreme heat events, and found that 16 of these signs are at record extreme. He added: 'We've got to stick to that commitment. We cannot allow any backsliding. 'Even at 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) we are still going to have devastating outcomes for many millions. As our friend from Bangladesh reminded us 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) needs to be a red line. And this cannot be the COP where we lose 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F). 'So, we've got to fight for this and every fraction of a degree absolutely makes a difference.' He added that the difference between 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) and higher levels of warming is the difference 'between a tolerable existence and an impossible future.' And that 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) would be a 'death sentence' for many nations around the world. A reality-check report released at COP27 last week showed CO2 emissions - which must decline nearly 50 per cent by 2030 to keep the 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) target in play - from coal, gas and oil are on track to hit record levels in 2022. The 46 least developed countries of the world, known at the UN as the LDC, have most to lose from global warming exceeding 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F), and have been vocal in its defence. COP27 must send a strong political signal and show that the world is united on fighting climate change,' said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, from Senegal, the chair of the LDC grouping. 'This means that at COP27 , the 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) goal must remain within reach by having strong commitments to halving emissions by 2030,' she told the BBC. Also at stake during the climate talks is a discussion to put in place a fund that will pay for loss and damage for countries hit by climate change. Developing countries could walk out of talks if the issue of loss and damage is not addressed in the draft text of the treaty, insiders said. \"

South Africa continues to rely on coal to produce most of its electricity and the coal sector remains significant to the country's national economy. However, Ramaphosa has recently announced the country's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan 2023-2027 to kick-start the decarbonisation of its coal-dependent economy. Last year, the founding partners of the JETP pledged to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5bn over the next three to five years to advance the partnership. ""One year ago, French President Macron pledged that France was ready to commit significant support for South Africa's ambitious decarbonisation project for a just energy transition. We are now putting those words into actions with this important loan,"" said Arnaud Roux, Charge d£ffaires of the French Embassy, as quoted by Mining Weekly. According to Audrey Rojkoff, AFD regional director for Southern Africa and country director for South Africa, this first public policy loan to South Africa aims at promoting policy dialogue between the countries. The AFD loan will be accompanied by grant financings from France to support further policy developments related to the JET. Rojkoff says that along with dialogue and knowledge-sharing with other countries, continued research will also be essential to fully understand potential climate risks and their impact on South Africa's financial system. ""We expressly welcome South Africa's commitment to reducing electricity generation from environmentally harmful coal,"" said Silke Stadtmann, KfW Development Bank's country director for South Africa. ""As a long-term partner of South Africa, we support these efforts not only with concessional loans for necessary investments and grants for a Just Energy Transition, but also with comprehensive studies on energy sector reform,"" she added. Ismail Momoniat, acting director-general of South Africa's National Treasury, said the government welcomes the funding from AFD and KfW, which forms part of support for South Africa's JET. These loans are concessional and contribute to government's efforts to mitigate rising government debt costs. While it is recognised that more investments are needed, given the scale of the required transition in the context of the current socio-economic challenges, the loans will provide much-needed catalytic funding for the implementation of the JET investment plan. South Africa estimates it lacks financing for $39bn (ZAR 700bn), or about 44% of its investment needs for the transition, and is working to mobilise more funding from other country partners, the private sector and non-profit organisations, bne Intellinews reports. \"

In Plachimada, a resident who named himself Thankavelu said that the villagers were angry because Coca Cola, which had polluted their water, is sponsoring COP27 , reported.  Criminal Cola polluted our water and the same company is now sponsoring COP27 . That\' s why we are extremely angry, he said. Thankavelu was one of the many protesters who burned Coca-Cola company\' s symbols in front of the defunct plant which is run by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Limited, an Indian subsidiary of the US-based company, the report added. The protesters\' whose Anti-Coca Cola Struggle Committee has been seeking compensation from the company for the last two decades for the environmental damage caused but to no avail. Twelve years ago, a high power committee mandated by the government of Kerala found evidence of over-extraction of groundwater and reckless disposal of sludge containing lead and cadmium, the Al Jazeera report added.  It is evident that the damages caused by the Coca-Cola factory at Plachimada have created a host of social, economic, health and ecological problems, the report said. The community in the village comprises mostly landless agricultural workers who relied on local water sources for basic needs, such as drinking, cooking, and washing. But with the quality of water going down and local authorities saying that it was not suitable for domestic use, the local people had to resort to more arduous task of carrying water containers from further areas. Even after the government started distributing water to the area and a pipeline was built, the residents had to shell out money for the installation of the pipeline and provision of water. KV Biju, the convener of the Anti-Coca Cola Struggle Committee, said many people contracted an inflammatory skin disease while there were others who abandoned the area and their homes. The group also wrote to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on November 4 requesting the company\' s removal from the COP27 sponsorship.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK293","Air of discontent at Egypt's COP27","November 14, 2022 Monday","Daily Mirror","I SHOULD have realised what kind of summit it was going to be two months ago. After firing off emails to Egyptian scientists, government organisations, and other experts, my inbox was strangely quiet. Several nudges later and still no response. COP27 has been taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, a city between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Rising sea levels, water scarcity and extreme weather are all concerns for this area. But you won't hear about those issues here. An investigation by Human Rights Watch found that sensitive topics, including industrial pollution - which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year in Cairo, one of the world's most polluted cities - are all off limits. Many working on these issues have been arrested, forced into exile or silenced. Brave activists calling for an end to fossil-fuel funding tried to protest outside the conference centre on Wednesday morning. An hour later they had disappeared. Egyptian authorities have banned protests here, just like they are banned across the country. The designated ""official"" protest area is somewhere out in the desert, miles away from the action. Tensions also began to boil, not in the debates but as food and drink ran out at the summit. Water fountains and drinks fridges with the logo of sponsor Coca-Cola were empty. After a long queue in the sun I was charged \£323 for a bag of crisps, an unappetising cheese sandwich and a bottle of pop. Many attendees have also reported being extorted by hotels and self-catering apartments for more money, with some demanding an extra \£31,500 a week. The Egyptian Hotel Association requested that fivestar hotels charge a minimum of $500 a night, and three-star hotels, like where I ended up, should charge $200. My room jumped from \£337 a night during the weeks before COP27 , to \£3227 during the summit. These exorbitant price increases are out of reach for many attending. Nigerian activist Olumide Idowu said that some delegates were forced to sleep in the bus station, while others had bookings cancelled. More sinisterly, some have also reported overt surveillance by plain-clothed conference staff. One eager volunteer, who I asked for directions, told me to download the official COP27 app for maps. Just the day before, cybersecurity experts warned the Egyptian authorities could be using it to access emails, photos and users' locations. He escalated his protest last Sunday by refusing water. His family say he has just undergone a medical intervention. It is no wonder that many groups within the summit feel afraid to talk freely. Egypt is not the first country to restrict environmental critics or civil protests at UN climate talks - and it won't be the last. Next year it will take place in the UAE, another country with an atrocious human rights record. On Wednesday, delegates leaving were confronted by a river of sewage, which formed a stinking puddle around the shuttle buses and taxis at the exit. Let's hope that next week's negotiations can save the summit from turning into a disgusting mess. ''Experts said authorities may be using official app to spy on emails \"

Dr Janet Liao, a senior lecturer in international politics, has warned that divisions brought to light by the ongoing conflict could affect efforts to achieve an agreement on climate change. The relationship between China and the United States has been strained as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as Washington's support for Taiwan, while Europe is wrestling with the prospect of a winter of fuel shortages and discontent. As political leaders prepare to gather in Egypt for the United Nations climate summit, Dr Liao said the fate of the planet depends upon differences being put to one side. She said: "" COP27 is expected to boost support for adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change, along with the necessary financial support, and to enhance national emissions-reduction targets to keep the 1.5C commitment within reach. However, these being agreed are far from certain, largely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""On the one side, the war has triggered severe threats to European energy security, prompting the EU - the world leader in the fight against climate change - to revisit its energy strategy and to raise the possibility of using coal to help with the winter. ""On the other, the Russian-Ukraine war has intensified the US-China confrontation. ""Being the largest CO2 emitters, if the two countries do not co- operate on climate governance, the world will be doomed, and so is COP27 ."" COP27 , there is hope that a focus on that single, fundamental goal, could be decisive if our politicians really are determined to protect our planet for generations to come."" \"

Vanessa Nakate, a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations\' children\' s fund, Unicef, said she welcomed the adoption of  loss and damage as an issue by almost 200 countries at the Cop27 climate talks. She criticised Boris Johnson after he said this week that the UK could not afford reparations now. He told delegates in Egypt that  the best way to fix this is not to look backwards . Nakate, 25, said:  We need a loss and damage fund agreed at Cop27 . The conference\' s deadline for a decision on the issue, 2024, was too late for communities facing drought, floods and fires, she said.  The people on the front lines of the climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. Rich nations frustrated poorer ones at Cop26 in Glasgow last year when they ruled out a fund for disasters such as the lethal floods in Pakistan, but promised more talks on the matter. Nakate said that Johnson, the former prime minister, should consider those bearing the brunt of extreme weather.  The people in the Horn of Africa, which I visited recently, they cannot afford the crisis that is happening right now. I think loss and damage finance is now unavoidable. There is no more time for delay  we need money to start flowing directly to communities to rebuild. Nakate is one of a new generation of climate campaigners who have come to prominence in the past four years, along with the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The self-described born-again Christian has amassed almost a quarter of a million followers on Twitter and 170,000 on Instagram. In 2020 the Associated Press provoked outrage when she was cropped out of a photograph of a small group of white climate activists, including Thunberg. Nakate said that even though Cop27 was an  African Cop , gas was being peddled as a false solution for the continent\' s energy poverty.  Gas is a dangerous distraction, she said.  We\' ve seen that decades of fossil fuel development have done little to help the millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa without basic access to electricity. She also accused European oil and gas companies of seeking to exploit reserves in Africa because the public was turning against them at home. Her comments chimed with a speech at Cop27 by the American former vice-president Al Gore, who warned wealthy countries against  fossil fuel colonialism . Nakate said she welcomed stronger language from some senior diplomats, such as Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, who has said the world is on a  highway to climate hell . Nakate said:  We must treat the climate crisis as a crisis. The language must show what is really happening. \"

Covering 43 of Africa's 54 countries, the study, 'Adapting to Natural Disasters in Africa: What's in it for the Private Sector?', assessed commercially viable investment opportunities that will strengthen the continent's climate resilience and support development and job creation. It found that many of the most promising opportunities lie in Africa's lower-income countries, including Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, and Mauritania. Specific opportunities include investing in weather-resistant crop varieties, crop insurance for farmers, irrigation systems to protect against drought, climate data and information systems, and building dikes to protect against coastal flooding. 'Extreme weather events are occurring with greater frequency and severity in Africa, with floods and droughts being particularly devastating. However, governments alone cannot finance the investments needed to respond. The private sector will play a key role in providing the investments that will contribute to the climate agenda,' said Sergio Pimenta, IFC Vice President for Africa. 'This study shows the abundance of opportunities out there for investors that will help Africa adapt to the new climate reality and that support economic development.' Despite being collectively responsible for less than four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, African countries are some of the most vulnerable to climate change, in part because of their heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture and a limited capacity to respond and adapt to shocks. Between 1990 and 2019, Africa suffered 1,107 floods and droughts, leading to nearly 44,000 deaths and at least $ 14 billion in damages, the study found, using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The study also found that since 1990, droughts and floods have lowered African countries' GDP by an average of 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. The study measured the upfront investments needed in each country to offset droughts and floods-induced losses, assuming unchanged severity and frequency of these events over the next 20 years. Since these disasters are likely to become more frequent and severe in the future, investment needs are likely to be even greater, according to the study. The study comes as the United Nations climate change conference , COP27 , highlights the central role the private sector can play in adapting to climate change, especially in Africa. In fiscal year 2022, IFC delivered $ 4.4 billion in climate finance globally and mobilized an additional $ 3.3 billion from other sources, with $ 2.1 billion supporting Africa's green transition.

COP27 because of her brother's imprisonment, said COP27 will be ""another opportunity to raise [Abdel Fattah's case]... with the Egyptian leadership"". ""I will continue to stress to President [Abdel Fattah] Sisi the importance that we attach to the swift resolution of Alaa's case, and an end to his unacceptable treatment,"" Sunak said in the letter shared by Seif on her Twitter account. Abdel Fattah started a dry fast on 7 November, after 219 days on hunger strike, in protest over his imprisonment, after describing his situation to his family as ""hopeless"". Hailing from a family of activists, Abdel Fattah has been repeatedly detained since the 2011 uprising. The most recent sentence was a five-year prison term issued in December 2021 on charges of ""joining a terrorist group"" and ""spreading false news that undermines national security"". In April, Abdel Fattah's family announced that he had received UK citizenship as part of their continuing efforts to find a way to secure his release from prison. Egypt is hosting COP27 in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh from 6-18 November. In the weeks leading up to the UN climate summit, calls for protests on 11 November have been circulating online and security protocols have reportedly increased around the capital Cairo.

At Cop26 in Glasgow last year, countries agreed to  at least double adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025 (from 2019 levels). But the Cop27 Secondly, the leaked draft also addresses the $100bn annual  Green Climate Fund that rich countries promised to provide to poorer nations by 2020. Two years after the promised delivery date, this HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/world/climate-finance-2022-cop27-b2167235.html?r=60135 fund stands at $83bn This funding gap was supposed to have been closed and the $100bn goal met  no later than 2023 , HYPERLINK https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/52730/g20-leaders-declaration-final.pdf according to the statement released after the Group of 20 (G20) meeting in Rome last year. HYPERLINK https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/canada-international-action/climate-finance/delivery-plan/progress-report-2022.html A pre- Cop27 progress report from developed countries contributing to the fund echoed the 2023 delivery date. However, in the draft text, the 2023 date has been dropped. Friederike Roder, vice-president of advocacy at Global Citizen, said that while it\' s early days on a final Cop27 agreement, the first signs are far from promising.  When will countries actually take responsibility? she asked.  The $100bn promise is left unmet for the second year in a row but instead of pledging new money, the reference to striving to finally hit the target in 2023 is now completely gone from the text.  What\' s more, it is extremely worrying and unacceptable that the language considered on adaptation now refers to \' considering doubling\' when the Glasgow Climate Pact clearly agreed to \' at least double\' climate finance for adaptation by 2025. \"

The conference in Sharm El-Sheikh came to an end at the weekend, after talks which stretched into the early hours of Sunday morning before an agreement was reached.

But there was praise or the work done on loss and damage, with a fund being set up that would draw on contributions from the world's wealthiest nation to support developing countries struggling with the impact of climate change. Speaking to the PA news agency on Monday, Nicola Sturgeon said: ``I think Cop27 in Egypt was an opportunity to build on the commitment made in Glasgow a year ago, not just to keep the ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C alive, but actually see action that would make the world much more confident about achieving that goal. ``I think it was a missed opportunity in Egypt that that didn't happen.'' The First Minister added: ``Similarly we didn't see the progress that many would have liked to see around an acceleration of of the transition away from fossil fuels, we didn't see the increase in funding for adaptation. ``I think lots is needing done in the aftermath of Cop27 .'' The First Minister praised the movement on loss and damage, with the Scottish Government having pledged an extra \£35 million in funding for developing countries earlier this month during her visit to the summit. ``So there is much, much work yet to do.'' end \"

Sunak, who became prime minister late last month, had initially said he would be too busy coming up with a plan to fix Britain\' s economy to attend the COP27 summit, drawing criticism from political opponents and campaigners. Now, he will join more than 100 other leaders speaking at the event. He is expected to call on governments to deliver on the promises made at COP26 in the Scottish city of Glasgow a year ago when host nation Britain helped to broker a wide-ranging climate pact \- much of which has yet to be implemented.  The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? he will say, according to extracts released by his office in advance. The chances look slim. A United Nations report at the end of October said government pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for an average 2.8 Celsius temperature rise this century after  woefully inadequate progress. Sunak will also meet his French and Italian counterparts on the sidelines of the U.N. conference.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK308","COP27: KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE","November 7, 2022 Monday 2:45 AM BST","Press Association Mediapoint","As Cop27 gets under way in Egypt, here are answers to some of the key questions about the climate conference. - What is Cop27 It is the latest set of UN climate negotiations which take place every year, and this year is taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, following last year's conference, Cop26, which the UK hosted in Glasgow. - What will be discussed? One of the central issues is that action is needed to cut fossil fuels and the greenhouse gases driving climate change, as we are currently on course for 2.4-2.6C of warming - which the UN warns would be catastrophic. And a key issue up for debate is addressing loss and damage - the now unavoidable consequences of climate change such as the destruction of crops, homes and infrastructure, which are being felt worst by vulnerable countries who did least to contribute to the crisis. - These issues feel familiar. Haven't we made any progress since Glasgow? There has been some progress, with countries including Australia bringing in new climate plans, as all countries pledged to at Cop26. But the latest assessments from the UN show climate action plans fall far short of what is needed to limit dangerous climate change, bringing down emissions by only 5-10% by 2030, compared to the 45% cut needed to keep temperatures rises to the 1.5C threshold countries have signed up to. Greenhouse gases continue to rise, and there is no credible pathway in place to meeting the 1.5C goal, the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) warns. Levels of finance for adapting to climate change are also falling far short of what is needed, UN analysis shows, and loss and damage must be addressed. - What can be done to tackle loss and damage? A ``polluter pays'' principle would require developed countries - most responsible for the pollution driving climate change - to pay into the fund. Developed countries have historically been reluctant to agree to such a mechanism, but as the impacts of extreme weather worsen around the world - most vividly with the devastating floods in Pakistan this year - the pressure is rising to deliver finance for loss and damage. - What about the UK? Once Alok Sharma, who presided over the Cop26 talks last year in a neutral chairing role, hands over the gavel to the Egyptian Cop27 presidency, it will be the first time the UK has negotiated at climate talks on its own, rather than as part of the EU. While the UK aims for a global leadership role on climate and is urging action at Cop27 to cut emissions and address loss and damage, the Government is facing criticism for pushing ahead with new offshore oil and gas licences, late payment to climate funds and gaps in policies to tackle the crisis. The decision the King, a long time campaigner for the environment, should not attend the climate summit, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's initial decision to skip the talks before a last-minute U-turn have also prompted criticism. - How can we negotiate on climate when the world is facing an energy crisis fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine? Russia's invasion of Ukraine - while leading to a short term increase in the use of coal - has prompted an acceleration in countries taking up clean tech, with the International Energy Agency suggesting it could prove to be a historic turning point for the world. But when it comes to the international negotiations on climate, where decisions are made by consensus, it seems inevitable the international dispute provoked by the war will cast a shadow. That will prove another challenge for making progress on the climate crisis, just as the increasingly severe floods, droughts, storms, melting ice and rising seas make it clear that there is no time to lose. \"

With rising CO2 prices going forward, the difference will be even smaller. We have actually taken steps in this direction in the past, such as when we built a new dam in Swedish Lilla Edet hydro power plant, where we used a new technology so that we could reduce the proportion of concrete and thereby reduce CO2 emissions.'

I would take these climate jamborees more seriously if they were held via Zoom, or if the attendees walked, sailed, or drove there in a horse and cart. Surely, by the time the world leaders and their entourages have jetted in, been accommodated in air-conditioned hotels and given delicious foods and wines, it negates any carbon saving that could or would have been made.

Caroline Cornell Winslow, Buckinghamshire sir - I was surprised to hear on Radio 4 on Friday morning that Rishi Sunak's decision not to attend Cop27 was being widely criticised. Everyone I had spoken to held the view that he has plenty to get on with at home and that Alok Sharma was more than capable of representing Britain in Egypt. It made me wonder whether the BBC represents a balanced view of the nation. Then we learnt that Sir Keir Starmer had criticised the decision - which explained everything.

The alliance was launched in September with the aim of boosting global offshore wind capacity by more than sixfold by the end of the decade from around 60GW today to 380GW in 2030 - an annual increase of 35GW. It has also set a longer-term target of reaching 2,000GW offshore wind capacity by 2050, requiring annual installations of 70GW per year from 2030 onwards. A number of other countries have also announced their entry to alliance at COP27 , including the US, Germany, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland. The alliance was established by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Global Wind Energy Council and the Danish government to bring together politicians, the private sector and international organisations. As well as encouraging governments to increase their offshore wind ambitions, the organisation will also seek to support the development of effective policy frameworks and efficient supply chains, for example, through the sharing of best practice and capacity building. RenewableUK chief executive Dan McGrail said: ""Today's announcement represents a major vote of confidence in our world-class offshore wind industry by the UK government. Offshore wind is cutting bills for British consumers and reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels, so the challenge for the UK, and countries around the world, is scaling up this technology as quickly as we can in the face of global energy and climate crises. ""While offshore wind is central to the UK's plans for net zero, to meet the goals set at COP26 to tackle dangerous climate change we're going to need a wide range of clean power sources. So it's crucial that the government works with industry to maximise the benefits of key technologies like onshore wind and solar. And the UK can be a world leader in the next generation of renewables, from floating wind to tidal power and green hydrogen. ""UK leadership in offshore wind is already setting a path for others to follow, and faster action at home will mean more growth in new industries, investment and jobs"". The UK currently has almost 14GW of operational offshore wind capacity and a target of increasing this to 50GW by 2030.

While the UK aims for a global leadership role on climate and is urging action at Cop27 to cut emissions and address loss and damage, the https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/government Government is facing criticism for pushing ahead with new offshore oil and gas licences, late payment to climate funds and gaps in policies to tackle the crisis. The decision the King, a long time campaigner for the environment, should not attend the climate summit, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\' s initial decision to skip the talks before a last-minute U-turn have also prompted criticism. \- How can we negotiate on climate when the world is facing an energy crisis fuelled by Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine? Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine \- while leading to a short term increase in the use of coal \- has prompted an acceleration in countries taking up clean tech, with the International Energy Agency suggesting it could prove to be a historic turning point for the world. But when it comes to the international negotiations on climate, where decisions are made by consensus, it seems inevitable the international dispute provoked by the war will cast a shadow. That will prove another challenge for making progress on the climate crisis, just as the increasingly severe floods, droughts, storms, melting ice and rising seas make it clear that there is no time to lose. \"

English-language daily The Express Tribune, launched in 2010, is owned by The Lakson Group, which also runs Urdu paper Daily Express and Express News TV channel. The paper says its mission is ""to defend liberal values and egalitarian traditions"". It has a partnership with The International New York Times - the global edition of The New York Times. The 9 November editorial noted that the COP27 conference has come right after the severe floods that ravaged one-third of Pakistan, damaged infrastructure and agricultural lands, affected 33 million people and caused losses worth $30 billion. Pakistan urgently needs compensation in the form of funds and debt relief from the global community and the rehabilitation has already been hampered due to escalating public debt and ""millions of people living in deplorable conditions are at grave risk"" ahead of the winter season. ""This is where COP27 will be prove vital, in amplifying the voices in Pakistan and reaffirming the very real threat that climate change poses on the developing world"", the paper said. Expressing hope over the reparation agenda, the paper said that it should be discussed sincerely under the newly accepted theme of 'loss and damage', adding that although ""it is yet to be seen if rich countries will follow through or resist such calls since the issue has been stalled for years"". Voicing concern over the output of the previous conferences, the paper noted that they have been ""unsuccessful at finding common ground and wealthy nations have failed at their promise of delivering $100 billion in climate finance annually"". ""Proposals have been made for what a possible funding strategy should look like as rich countries will try to dictate it on their own terms. But Pakistan must seek the backing of other vulnerable countries and try to drive their agenda forward aggressively"", the paper said.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK321","Deadlock sends Cop27 into extra time","November 19, 2022 Saturday","The Times (London)","Fraught UN climate change negotiations in Egypt will run into extra time today, as the EU tries to unblock an impasse over richer nations compensating the world's poorest countries for the impact of global warming. Talks at the Cop27 Late on Thursday, the EU mounted a last-minute effort to achieve a breakthrough by backing a fund. The bloc said support was conditional on countries doing more to cut emissions and the money coming from a broad base, including China and the private sector. ""We've made a proposal now. We've done it as an honest attempt to build bridges,"" said Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission. He said the proposition was the EU's ""final offer"", the strongest its 27 states could agree on. All eyes are now on whether the fund will be given the blessing of the world's two biggest emitters, the US and China. The countries' two top climate envoys, John Kerry and Xie Zhenua, reportedly met for almost three hours on Thursday night, but neither country has yet to signal its intent. Seve Paeniu, minister of finance for the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, called the EU's loss and damage fund proposal a major concession and breakthrough. Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate campaigner, said that China and the US must now give the fund their backing. ""We still need to push some countries,"" she said. Announcing a delay to the conference's finish of 3pm GMT today, Egypt's foreign minister and Cop27 president, Sameh Shoukry, urged countries to reach a compromise. ""Today we need to shift gears again. Time is not on our side,"" he said. However, there is anger among some developing nations over the absence in the draft deal of an India-backed commitment to phasing down all fossil fuels. ""We need stronger language on a ban on new fossil fuel extraction and production,"" Paeniu said. The UK is supportive of such a move, provided a final outcome makes clear that coal's carbon-intensive nature means its end should be prioritised. Alok Sharma, the president of last year's Cop26 talks and a former cabinet minister, urged government officials to commit to stronger emissions reductions. He said last year's landmark deal must be the floor ""of our ambition and most certainly not the ceiling"". Negotiators have made inroads on adapting to rising temperatures, including increasing finance and establishing a new goal on climate change adaptation. But the number of issues with outstanding divisions has led organisers at the talks to reassure delegates that buses and food will continue throughout the weekend. On the sidelines of the conference yesterday, the Pacific island state of Vanuatu and 17 other countries said they would ask the International Court of Justice in coming weeks for an opinion on whether governments were meeting their legal obligations to protect citizens from climate change impacts. ""What we've seen this week is that negotiations are not working for the most vulnerable, largely because it is not clear what our obligations are to each other,"" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of climate change for Vanuatu. A fortnight on, how talks have progressed Adam Vaughan After almost a fortnight of talks beset by Egyptian spying, food and water shortages, chaotic late night meetings and even a river of sewage flowing along a main path, what progress have countries made on climate change? loss and damage Debates over the economic losses and damages caused by climate change, such as Pakistan's estimated $30 billion bill for recent flooding, have dominated the Cop27 conference. Poorer countries have argued that richer countries, responsible for most historical carbon emissions, should compensate them for the ravages of global warming. Yesterday, the EU tried to unlock the stalled negotiations by backing a fund. The offer came with two strings attached: countries making deeper emissions cuts, and the fund's donors coming from a broad base including China, and potentially airlines and oil companies. Exactly how the fund would work and which countries would be eligible is not clear yet. The latest draft of a final deal implies that the money would be directed to the world's 46 least developed countries, including many African states and small island states such as Tuvalu. Progress: 4/5 keeping 1.5c alive The mantra for Cop26 last year was ""keep 1.5C alive"". So far, countries in Sharm el-Sheikh have failed to increase their ambition beyond what they promised in Glasgow. The EU promised an emissions cut two percentage points deeper than previously. Turkey, one of the G20 countries responsible for about three quarters of global emissions, belatedly issued a plan, but it will mean emissions rising for several years. Arguably the best news came midway through Cop27 , when the G20 in Bali reaffirmed its commitment to 1.5C. Progress: 2/5 ending fossil fuels India surprised some delegates when it proposed that the conference throw its weight behind a plan to ""phase down"" all fossil fuels. The idea gained momentum, with the EU and other countries giving their support to the idea of ending oil and gas too. But the proposal has failed to make its way into any of the draft documents that will form the basis of the Cop27 agreement. Nonetheless, one governmental delegate said that a pledge to phase out fossil fuels was still in the gift of the Egyptian diplomats running the talks, given the broad backing for the proposal. Progress: 2/5 nature Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva was greeted like a rock star when he arrived at the conference, where he met the head of the UN and the Chinese and US climate envoys. The Brazilian president-elect promised to do ""whatever it takes"" to end deforestation in the Amazon and make climate change a high priority for his government. Rishi Sunak made a lower-key intervention at the start of the conference, offering \£390 million to protecting forests in the Congo basin. However, there has been disappointment that the final outcome in Egypt looks unlikely to even mention Cop15, a UN biodiversity conference in Canada next month. ""We must ensure that the two Cops are linked and countries jointly address the interconnected climate and nature crises,"" said Cassie Flynn, head of climate policy at the UN development programme. Progress: 1/5 adapting to a warming world In February, climate scientists warned that climate change had caused widespread, irreversible effects that were already outpacing humanity's ability to adapt. In Sharm el-Sheikh, negotiators have provisionally made a commitment to doubling financing to adapt to a warming world by 2025, through better flood defences, more drought-resistant crops and other measures. They also made progress on moving towards a global goal on adaptation, similar to the ones that exist on curbing emissions. Exactly what that will look like is a decision for future climate conferences. ""I think we have made significant progress,"" said Nisha Krishnan of the World Resources Institute, a US think tank. Progress: 3/5 \"

That from Pakistan\' s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, was among the most powerful.  The catastrophic floods impacted 33 million people, more than half our women and children, [covering] the size of three European countries. Despite seven times the average of extreme rain in the south, we struggled on as raging torrents ripped out over 8,000km of metal roads, damaged more than 3,000km of railway track and washed away standing crops on 4m acres and ravaged all of the four corners of Pakistan, he told a hall shocked into silence.  We became a victim of something with which we had nothing to do, and of course it was a manmade disaster, he said.  Imagine on one hand we have to cater for food security for the common man by spending billions of dollars and on the other we have to spend billions of dollars to protect flood-affected people from further miseries and difficulties. How on earth can one expect from us that we will undertake this gigantic task on our own? Protest has been muted at Cop27 , where activists have sought to put Egypt\' s dismal record on human rights under the spotlight.

That has not stopped all protest at the Cop, however \- and the demands from those protesting centre on one issue:  HYPERLINK loss and damage  . The term refers to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, the most severe extreme weather that countries cannot adapt to, or protect themselves against. Pakistan\' s record floods are one example; the severe drought that has left 150 million people in Africa threatened by extreme hunger is another. Poor countries argue that the rich, source of most greenhouse gas emissions, must provide assistance to the poor that are most afflicted.  Loss and damage is not charity \- it\' s climate justice, Nabeel Munir, Pakistan\' s climate envoy, said. The amount of cash needed for climate finance, including loss and damage, can seem daunting. In a report jointly commissioned by the UK, host of last year\' s Cop26 summit, and the Egyptian hosts of Cop27 , published on Tuesday, the climate economist Lord Stern calculated that HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/08/developing-countries-climate-crisis-funding-2030-report-nicholas-stern about $2tn a year would be needed by 2030 for the entire developing world, except China. HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/cop7-china-us-climate-talks-taiwan little cash forthcoming at this conference so far. The UK said it would allow some debt payment deferrals for countries hit by climate disasters, while Austria and New Zealand put forward funding for loss and damage, and John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, unveiled a plan to use carbon offsetting to raise cash. Even as young people protested, and those facing the most severe impacts of the climate crisis bore witness, the halls of Cop27 were host to a shady group with quite different intentions. Oil and gas companies are enjoying an unprecedented bonanza amid record fossil fuel prices, sent soaring by Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine. They have sent lobbyists to Cop27 in force \- there are more than 600 of them enjoying access to the talks, according to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/10/big-rise-in-number-of-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-at-cop27-climate-summit analysis by Global Witness published on Thursday . That is more than the delegations of many of the most vulnerable countries combined. Africa is particularly in their sights. This is the first African Cop in six years, and some African leaders have come with a specific purpose: to gain backing to exploit their gas reserves. Macky Sall, the president of Senegal, asked in an interview:  Why not? Why should Africa not do this? Climate campaigners are distraught at the prospect, warning of a  neocolonial gas grab that would benefit only the gas multinationals and the country elites, while poor people would suffer even worse consequences from global heating. But western countries are wary of appearing hypocritical in urging African countries not to exploit their gas, and besides, many European countries especially want to import African gas to ease their own cost of living crisis. Negotiations at Cop27 will carry on for the next week, and countries are hoping for substantial progress on loss and damage, and climate finance more generally. But there will be no final settlement of loss and damage here. The most that can be hoped for is to set out a framework and parameters for how a loss and damage funding facility could be achieved, with a deadline on when it should be in operation. At Cops, sometimes the most telling outcome is one that is not even on the agenda. That could well be the case for Cop27 , in the form of a drastic overhaul of the world\' s public financial institutions. The World Bank and other multilateral development banks, along with the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, were created at the Bretton Woods conference, in the final days of the second world war. They were intended to foster international economic cooperation, dispense aid to countries that need it, and oil the wheels of public finances. But the world has changed since 1944, as Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, pointed out.  Institutions crafted in the mid-20th century cannot be effective in the third decade of the 21st century, she said.  They do not describe 21st-century issues. Climate justice was not an issue then [when the bank was set up]. The World Bank has come under increasing fire at Cop27 from countries that believe it is HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/03/world-bank-criticised-over-climate-crisis-spending failing on climate finance Spokespeople for the World Bank point out it provided $31.7bn of project financing for the climate in 2022. The World Bank is a separate institution to the UN, and there is no mandate for the UN framework convention on climate change \- the treaty under which the conference of the parties (Cop) takes place \- to make changes to it. So no formal intervention to overhaul the bank can be made at this summit. But it has become increasingly clear at Cop27 that the current setup of the World Bank is a severe brake to progress on climate finance. If reform does eventually happen, which is looking increasingly likely, it might be the biggest achievement from Sharm el-Sheikh. \"

In the end we delivered. We listened to the calls of anguish and despair. Sir Molwyn Joseph, minister of health, wellbeing and the environment of Antigua and Barbuda, and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said:  Today, the international community has restored global faith in this critical process that is dedicated to ensuring no one is left behind.  The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world. We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve. Despite the agreement, European Union climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said delegates had not done enough in terms of limits to rising global temperatures. ""This is the make or break decade, but what we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet,"" Mr Timmermans told the summit. ""It does not bring enough added efforts for major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts."" Some countries also criticised the commitment to limiting global temperatures to a rise of 1.5C, a goal which also agreed in Glasgow last year. A proposal from India to phase out all fossil fuels was also rejected and reduced to just coal.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK327","What India and China\u8217 s absence means for Cop27","November 10, 2022 Thursday 11:29 AM GMT","The Independent (United Kingdom)","The first few days of https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/united-nations the United Nations \~ HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cop27 Cop27 were filled with big speeches and announcements from global leaders from around the world. However, the voices of the heads of state of two of the world\' s biggest polluters are missing, taking the shine out of this year\' s climate summit. HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/narendra-modi Narendra Modi , the prime minister of HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/india India , which is the third biggest polluter after HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/china China and the US, decided to skip the summit in favour of campaigning for elections in his home state Gujarat despite the country suffering some of the worst impacts of recent weather events. Chinese president Xi Jinping also decided to skip this year\' s summit. Russia, the fourth biggest polluter, is already an international pariah after the Ukraine war and Vladimir Putin was a no-show in Egypt\' s HYPERLINK Sharm el-Sheikh . US president Joe Biden didn\' t make the leader segment because of an agenda clash with the US mid-term elections on 8 November. But he is expected to travel next week. All these countries are represented by their environment ministers. But experts say the absence of big names from the developing world at a summit, which is discussing some of the biggest questions on bringing the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions down and providing crucial help to disaster victims is dampening the shine of Cop27 . Last year India, for the first time, announced its net-zero target for 2070, two decades later than most countries, but denoting a major change in its position. Before this year\' s summit, the country formalised its renewable and emission reduction targets as its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The absence becomes even more striking as negotiators are set to lock horns on energy transition early next week at Sharm el-Sheikh. India and China are one of the biggest producers and consumers of coal, the most destructive of all fossils despite impressive strides in the field of renewables in the last few years. However, India\' s environment minister has already left the venue on Tuesday with negotiators taking the lead. Sources within the Indian government say the minister might come back to the summit next week. According to Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network (CAN) International, New Delhi should have been present to show its progress  especially when India is trying to do a lot in terms of moving towards renewable energy, the kind of ambitious targets it has set . The country has also been largely silent on the historic development of Loss and Damage finance being added to the agenda at Cop27 , something India backs as part of the G77 group.  Given the way loss of damage has been prioritised at the political level, it would have been good for India to also lend its support and more publicly, Mr Singh says.  This is the biggest issue at this Cop and for India to stand in solidarity with vulnerable countries to demand a loss and damage facility is absolutely critical, he adds. However, calls are also growing for making richer developing nations like India and China to pay for the new finance facility. China and India have always demanded historical emissions to be taken into account, of which developed western nations have the majority of share. But small island nations are demanding all polluters be made liable to pay for climate compensations. The issue is set to become bigger in the coming days as negotiations heat up. China has held out an olive branch, agreeing that it\' s willing to make a contribution. But India is yet to address the issue officially.  It (paying for loss and damage) is not the obligation of China but we are willing to make our contribution and make our effort, China\' s climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said, according to a Reuters report.  Modi might not have been in Egypt but he will not be able to duck the climate agenda at next week\' s G20 leaders summit, not least because India will assume the presidency next year, Mr Evans says.  In Bali next week Modi will be under pressure from the likes of the US and EU to support ambitious climate outcomes, moving further than when climate ministers met in September, who were unable to agree a communiqu\'e9. Mr Evans adds that a strong position from India at Cop27 could have been a  demonstration of real leadership before hosting the G20 next year .

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK331","Civil society groups report surveillance and intimidation at Cop27","November 10, 2022 Thursday 10:49 AM GMT","The Guardian (London)","Members of civil society attending Cop27 have described how surveillance and intimidation by the Egyptian authorities is threatening their participation in the climate conference. Problems reported by attenders include overt surveillance, control of their meetings by conference staff and problems with accommodation. International civil society participants, all of whom requested anonymity for their protection, told the Guardian how uniformed or plainclothes conference staff supposedly on hand to provide security, technical, or cleaning assistance to delegates, seemed preoccupied with surveilling them and controlling their activities rather than providing support.  Just talking about the word activism means you are very quickly surrounded by people eavesdropping on you, said one. Conference staff, he said, repeatedly surrounded civil society delegates to create an atmosphere of discomfort if they mentioned the word activism in conversation, or tried to discuss it with colleagues.  Mentioning activism in conversation means you get \' cleaners\' and technical staff coming over to you. Even on foreign government stands, the \' cleaners\' will come up and listen, he said. The problems described by visiting attenders mirror many of the everyday problems that Egyptian civil society activists describe facing over the past decade, as the Egyptian authorities and in particular the country\' s sprawling security forces institute a broad crackdown on independent organisations of all kinds. Surveillance and intimidation of activists as well as the looming threat of arrest are common, while independent groups, from anti-torture organisations to unions, face raids and arrest by the security forces, now equally brazen about targeting activists abroad or HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/RamyYaacoub/status/1589999020071845888?s=20&t=ZkekQ3gB9iN6NWcvcob_bw disrupting their activities. Veteran Egyptian activists welcomed the opportunity for the world to understand more about how they are regularly treated.  Once Egypt was selected as hosts, some people wanted to campaign against it or choose a different location, we said no don\' t do that. Then some voices from outside Egypt wanted to call on activists to boycott the Cop in Egypt because of the human rights situation, we pleaded with them not to do that. Because we needed this \- we needed the attention, we needed the solidarity, we needed the camaraderie, HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/yasminoviech/status/1590050279206293505?s=20&t=vhwAnY6gw83ohS_An8icXw said Hossam Bahgat, the head of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Bahgat has been HYPERLINK https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/egypt-end-harrassment-hossam-bahgat/ harassed by the Egypt state for a decade for his human rights work through arrests and trials, and is banned from leaving Egypt. For those who attended the conference, especially high-profile Egyptian activists, the surveillance was overt. One delegate provided a photo of a suspected plainclothes member of the Egyptian security services openly filming Sanaa Seif, the sister of the jailed British-Egyptian hunger strike Alaa Abd el-Fattah, with his phone when she held a press conference at Cop27 . The pro-government MP Amr Darwish attempted to HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/FreedomForAlaa/status/1590075112975261696 disrupt Seif\' s press conference . A member of civil society from Egypt said the surveillance and intimidation was  signalling to everyone that we have to behave, or else. It\' s really very hard, he said.  Unlike other Cops, everyone seems to feel afraid due to this surveillance. There\' s less activity, you don\' t feel the spirit of the event, a push for climate activism and against the big polluters. He added that he was concerned about the number of Egyptian security officials present inside the Cop27 Another visitor described how pressure from security guards at Cop27 had affected their ability to move freely during the conference.  One of our group described their suspicion today that security guards were standing close by and seemingly recording people talking. For a short period, these guards followed them wherever they went, they said.  We also held a meeting in a room that we had been assigned to, but we attempted to move to a more public open part of the venue to converse instead because the guards were so attentively sitting right behind us. They told us we had to stay in the room and keep talking there. It felt very invasive. Some attenders have reported problems even before getting to Egypt. A climate activist from Europe said that when he tried to check into his Egyptair flight he was told there was a problem and that he needed to face further questions. At the airport, the activist said, he was questioned by a manager for Egyptair, a state-owned company, about petitions he had previously signed calling for improved human rights in the country.  He said that I was dealing with matters of national interest to Egypt and that he wanted to know what I will be doing in Egypt, what I will be doing there, and if I will be meeting troublemakers, the activist said. The manager eventually allowed the man to board the flight but warned him that if he did anything to  intervene in Egypt he would be banned from the country.  It was disturbing and quite unpleasant, said the activist. Attenders of Cop27 Cop27 , despite already having paid the previously agreed the $1,000 asking price. Unable to pay this extra charge, the man has opted to stay in his hotel as a tourist, rather than attend the conference. A document circulated by the Egyptian Hotel Association, seen by the Guardian, requests that five-star hotels in Sharm el-Sheikh charge a minimum of $500 a night for delegates. Three-star hotels should charge $200 a night, the document states. A Nigerian civil society activist HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/olumideidowu/status/1589488324708028418?s=46&t=hlkP9Bi5f5a5ezqXnDslw tweeted that some Cop27 delegates were forced to sleep in the bus station because they were unable to afford unexpected price increases, while others complained that their hotels had been cancelled. One youth delegate, who was invited by the Egyptian sports ministry to attend Cop27 with her organisation, told the Guardian that she had burst into tears after five hours of waiting for a hotel room in the lobby with other attenders shortly after arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh, and that many of those she waited with slept on sofas in the hotel lobby or on the floor. She described the problems with accommodation as  a massive roadblock to being able to participate in the conference.  It\' s super demotivating, she said.  It feels like we\' re literally worthless and it doesn\' t matter if we sleep on the streets. It demonstrates that this is all just for show. \"

Running Out of Time is the longest non-stop relay ever attempted and will bring together thousands of runners, cyclists, and sailors as they pass the baton hand-to-hand from Glasgow to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Hetty Key, head of logistics for Running Out of Time, told The Glasgow Times: ""We're incredibly passionate about what we're doing. ""The main purpose is to take a message from young people to the climate leaders at COP27 , and that starts here, in Sunnyside Primary School."" The message was read out by P7s Nikkole Bruce, Arran Muir and Alfie Crichton before being sealed inside the baton for its 7767km journey. Hetty said: ""I think when we look at climate change as a whole it can be incredibly intimidating - in terms of how do we personally make a difference? ""If you look at the nature of a relay, and we've been doing relays like this for years, and actually the power when people come together, is something incredibly special. ""This route, Glasgow to Egypt, no one person could run that, no one person could day and night just do it by themselves, and in the same way no one person can just solve climate change. ""But what we believe is by breaking it down into these smaller bits where everyone is chipping in and doing their bit, suddenly, this insurmountable task becomes possible. And everyone can get involved."" Lauren Brown, the school's coordinator for Running Out of Time, added: ""I think the biggest thing with this is the positivity of it. ""It's approaching climate action and climate education in a positive way, and it's trying to empower from a very young age and through all ages."" Meanwhile, Sunnyside Primary's headteacher Aileen McCaffer said the pupils and staff were delighted to be offered the chance to be a part of the launch. She added: ""Miss Perrie, conservation lead and principal teacher, has ensured Sunnyside has been at the forefront of all things conservation, and the school was heavily involved in COP26. ""Children from the school read a message to be put into the baton as it makes its way from Scotland to Egypt. ""The excitement and pride is plain to see."" The baton will travel through a slew of different landscapes from glaciers to deserts and water crossings in the lead-up to COP27 , hoping to raise awareness of a holistic and community-centred approach to tackling climate change. The baton is expected to take 38 days to reach Sharm El-Sheikh and the journey will be completed in 732 stages at around 10km each. Councillor Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council, said: ""COP26 shone a light on just how dire the situation facing our planet is and that collective and \£daccelerated action is the only \£doption to save humanity from a global \£dcatastrophe. ""While nation-states make pledges, it is cities, like Glasgow, that are delivering on a low carbon and climate resilient future and must remain central to future policy \£ddecisions and action. ""Now we must keep up the \£dpressure on world leaders and \£dgovernments to make sure that commitments of the Glasgow \£dClimate Pact are delivered. ""The message contained within the relay baton will, I'm sure, continue to convey that strength of feeling that we saw here in \£dGlasgow last year.

The prime minister had been under growing pressure to U-turn after his predecessor HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/boris-johnson Boris Johnson confirmed he would be going to the event at Sharm el Sheikh. In apparent dig at the new PM, Mr Johnson said it had  become unfashionable to talk about the sucesses of the previous Cop26 meeting held in Glasgow. On Wednesday Mr Sunak tweeted:  There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables. He added:  That is why I will attend Cop27 next week: to deliver on Glasgow\' s legacy of building a secure and sustainable future. No 10 previously said Mr Sunak was not expected to attend  due to other pressing domestic commitments , despite the UK handing over presidency to Egypt for the 6 to 18 November summit. But by Monday a No 10 spokesperson said the position was  under review , before Mr Sunak announced the change on Wednesday. Labour leader Angela Rayner said the PM had been  dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing after he committed to attend the Cop27 climate summit.  Embarrassing, she added. Liberal Democrats\' climate change spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said Mr Sunak was  only going after being embarrassed by Boris Johnson\' s attendance and said the UK needs  action from the prime minister. Green MP Caroline Lucas \- who had said she hoped Mr Johnson would  embarrass Mr Sunak into going \- said she was  glad to see Sunak\' s screeching U-turn on Cop27  . She added:  But what an embarrassing mis-step on the world stage. Let this be a lesson to him \- climate leadership matters. Now he urgently needs to increase UK ambition on emission reduction targets and pay what we owe to global climate funds. Mr Sunak\' s initial decision to avoid the summit raised eyebrows. His predecessor Liz Truss was set to go and Scotland\' s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is also attending, along with US president Joe Biden, France\' s Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders. Mr Johnson, ousted in the summer after Mr Sunak and other ministers resigned, told Sky News that he would be going, and desribed the summit hosted in the UK as a  fantastic global success which did  a huge amount of good for the planet . Cop26 president Alok Sharma said he was  delighted at the new prime minister\' s U-turn over Cop2, after saying he was  disappointed over his planned failure to attend. The outgoing climate minister also said the Sunak government should think again about plans to open Britain\' s first new HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/coal coal mine in a generation in Cumbria. Mr Sunak said  a significant proportion of this coal that\' s generated would be exported , telling Politico:  My personal opinion on this is that I think if this is about creating jobs, then  you can create a lot more jobs doing this in green sectors. Lord Deben, the government\' s top adviser as chair of the Climate Change Committee, told The Independent at the weekend that Britain\' s year of global climate leadership fell short on multiple fronts. HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/greta-thunberg Greta Thunberg said she would not be going to Cop27 because of the country\' s record on human rights record. She also dismissed the annual UN conference as an opportunity for leaders to indulge in  greenwashing, lying and cheating . \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK334","'Loss and damage' is a COP27 success but 1.5 target 'on life support'","November 23, 2022","Cambridge Independent","Cambridge delegates attending the COP27 climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, have reported low-key progress on how to reduce emissions, with the historic 'loss and damage' support for vulnerable nations the main bright spot. The conference ran from November 6-18, with eight delegates from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) and three from the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge attending. Dr Seega said: "" COP27 has reiterated yet again that global leaders know what needs to be done to reduce emissions and secure the right trajectory on climate mitigation, but we are still not doing it. ""While there are mitigation options across all sectors with the potential to at least halve global greenhouse gas emissions relative to the 2019 level by 2030, the actual impact of current NDCs (nationally determined contributions) is estimated to be 0.3 per cent below 2019 levels - rather than the 43 per cent below 2019 levels that's needed. ""Billed as an implementation COP, COP27 has succeeded in putting early warning systems, technology transfer, capacity building and just transition on the agenda with the hope of achieving decoupling of GDP and emissions in developing economies. We cannot solve the climate crisis without nature and, while we have seen some progress made here, the absence of reference to COP15 [Paris] is a major disappointment."" She added: ""The breakthrough on loss and damage, however, is absolutely key to building resilience to a quickly-warming world."" Eliot Whittington, policy director, CISL, added: ""The small gains made to address climate change in Sharm El-Sheikh are inadequate in the face of a growing climate threat that is likely to worsen the multiple crises facing the world. ""Governments, businesses, investors and civil society now need to reflect on how we can urgently raise ambition and accelerate action further because every time we fall short, we open the door to increased unnecessary economic costs, human suffering and environmental destruction."" Meanwhile, Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, the director of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge, was at the convention with deputy director Prof Hugh Hunt, and Dr Antoinette Nestor, who is engagement manager for both Cambridge Zero and the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge. After her return to Cambridge, Dr Nestor said: ""What I will remember from it is not the chaos of trying to find the location of the pavilions or the lack of a stable internet connection but the text messages arriving constantly after midnight indicating that a loss and damage fund had been agreed at the last minute. ""I will also keep in my memories the conversations I had with the locals working in the resorts - where most of those taking part in COP27 were staying - and their lack of knowledge as to what all this ' COP27 business' was all about. Many have heard of climate change, but many had not either. ""To me, COP27 highlighted the disconnection between what we ought to be doing and how we should be integrating the community at the local level, and the realities of a system that operates at the international level. If not even the local population understands what all the fuss is about, then should we really be hopeful that we can reach net zero in the foreseeable future? I believe much more education and understanding is needed if we are to accomplish this. ""Protests were allowed but under certain terms. 'This is what democracy looks like' was the chant I heard over and over when looking at the protest inside the COP27 compound. ""This year was the first year there was also a children and youth pavilion, which filled the pavilion with excitement. The green zone also displayed very imaginative displays about the work Egyptian universities were doing in relation to net zero. There was a sense of cohesion and optimism from their part, and the need to establish further links with others."" Alok Sharma, the UK government representative at the conference and the outgoing COP26 president, said in the closing session: ""Friends, I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. ""Unfortunately, it remains on life support."" \"

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK336","Under environmental, financial pressure, world leaders gather for COP27 climate talks in Egypt","November 7, 2022","India Weekly","World leaders gathered Monday (7) for climate talks in Egypt facing pressure to deepen cuts in emissions and financially back developing countries already devastated by the effects of rising temperatures. The UN\' s COP27 climate summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh comes as nations worldwide are facing increasingly intense natural disasters that have taken thousands of lives this year alone and cost billions of dollars. COP27 officials urged governments to keep up efforts to combat climate change despite soaring inflation, the energy crunch linked to Russia\' s war on Ukraine and the persistent Covid-19 pandemic.  The fear is other priorities take precedence, top United Nations climate change official Simon Stiell told a news conference. The  fear is that we lose another day, another week, another month, another year  because we can\' t , he said. The world must slash greenhouse emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above late-19th-century levels. But current trends would see carbon pollution increase 10 percent by the end of the decade and Earth\' s surface heat up 2.8C, according to findings unveiled in recent days. Only 29 of 194 countries have presented improved climate plans, as called for at the UN talks in Glasgow last year, Stiell noted. Nearly 100 heads of state and government began to arrive for two days of talks, with the notable absence of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose country is the world\' s top emitter of greenhouse gases. US President Joe Biden, whose country ranks second on the top-polluters list, will join COP27 later this week after midterm elections on Tuesday that could put Republicans hostile to international action on climate change in charge of Congress. French President Emmanuel Macron urged the United States, China and other non-European rich nations to  step up their efforts to cut emissions and provide financial aid to other countries.  Europeans are paying, Macron told French and African climate campaigners on the sidelines of COP27 .  We are the only ones paying. \- \' Loss and damage\' \- Another new leader, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, reversed a decision not to attend the talks and is due to urge countries to move  further and faster in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Pakistan, which chairs the powerful G77+China negotiating bloc of more than 130 developing nations, has made the issue a priority.  We definitely regard this as a success for the parties, said Egypt\' s Sameh Shoukry, who chairs the COP27 . The United States and the European Union have dragged their feet on the issue for years, fearing it would create an open-ended reparations framework. But European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans welcomed the inclusion of loss and damage, tweeting that the  climate crisis has impacts beyond what vulnerable countries can shoulder alone . Rich nations will also be expected to set a timetable for the delivery of $100 billion per year to help developing countries green their economies and build resilience against future climate change. The promise is already two years past due and remains $17 billion short, according to the OECD. COP27 Security is tight at the meeting, with Human Rights Watch saying authorities have arrested dozens of people for calling for protests and restricted the right to demonstrate in the days leading up to COP27 .

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK337","Egypt using Cop27 to showcase the charms of Sharm el-Sheikh","October 31, 2022 Monday 12:00 PM GMT","The Guardian (London)","Across Sharm el-Sheikh, a slim strip of manicured resorts, asphalt and concrete near the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula, teams of workers are putting the finishing touches to preparations for the UN\' s Cop27 climate conference. Sparkling new buses are ready to drive down the enlarged highways that cut across desert landscape, flanked by smooth shiny new walkways adorned with angular sculptural arches. A field of glittering solar panels run by a company with ties to the Egyptian military will be online in time for the conference, as well as a new shopping mall. New surveillance technologies are also in place, so much so that Maj Gen Khaled Fouda, governor of South Sinai, recently boasted to a local cable channel that any visitors entering overland will be extensively searched at a gate encircling the city. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/ganobi/status/1584141885815545859?s=20&t=y1FbJHVdZdur1sklSYMVKA He added that 500 white taxis commissioned to transport attenders during the conference will be equipped with interior cameras, all connected to a local  security observatory , to monitor the footage. There will be space for protesters to gather at Cop27 , but only in a purpose-built area out near a highway and away from the conference centre or any other signs of life. Images of the designated protest area show a row of white painted cabins between a row of palm trees and a car park. It was unclear whether protesters will be permitted to spread out among the vast open landscape, or be forced to crowd next to the cabins to find relief from the desert sun.  It\' s very chic, very clean. There are cafes and restaurants on site, said Fouda, and:  No one is allowed here without registration. He added that Egyptian authorities constructed the protest area in response to a spate of calls from western diplomats worried that demonstrations would be prevented at Cop27 in line with a ban on public protest that has existed for almost a decade.  This could be the most highly surveilled Cop in the history of the conference, said Hussein Baoumi, of Amnesty International. He scoffed at the Egyptian government\' s vision of a designated protest area.  It\' s theatrics, he said.  They don\' t want to allow the right to protest or freedom of assembly, but they want to seem as though they are. It\' s [president] Sisi\' s vision of a protest \- you go to a place and register and protest for an hour where no one can see you, and then they have you on camera where the authorities can see if you say something they don\' t like. It\' s the act of a state that doesn\' t want to allow freedom of assembly, but doesn\' t want to be called out for not permitting it. For many observers, Egypt\' s choice to hold Cop27 in a resort town far from the country\' s bustling capital with its population of 22 million is by design. Sharm el-Sheikh has long been used by Egypt\' s leadership as a satellite location, a way to escape their own citizens and ensure that visiting dignitaries and officials are kept far from the country\' s major cities when they attend state events. The purpose-built town draped between the sea and a backdrop of mountain ranges that resembles a lunar landscape features no central square or places where people could gather in large groups even if the law permitted. Instead, long, flat highways connect a web of luxurious high-end resorts, intended for visiting tourists or the Egyptian elite to gaze out on to the Red Sea, the ideal staging ground for intensive surveillance of anyone attending Cop27 . Surveillance of Cop27 attenders will also extend to their virtual world, via an app created by the Egyptian government to act as a guide to the conference facilities.  You can download the official Cop27 mobile app, but you must give your full name, email address, mobile number, nationality and passport number. Also you must enable location tracking, HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hossambahgat/status/1584516055354859521 tweeted Hossam Baghat, of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Baoumi added that technology specialists working for Amnesty International reviewed the app and flagged concerns about surveillance, due to its ability to access the user\' s camera, microphone, location data and Bluetooth. The complex of hotels and mansions in Sharm el-Sheikh have symbolised elite seclusion for decades. When Egypt\' s former president Hosni Mubarak fled popular uprisings across mainland Egypt in 2011 it was for his mansion in Sharm el-Sheikh. Bakr bin Laden, former head of the family\' s construction firm and half-brother of Osama, was one of Mubarak\' s notable neighbours, HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-binladin-fall-beginnings-idUSKCN1M715I known for doing business The convention centre adjoining the Jolie Ville resort, with its lush gardens and a golf course built by a former Mubarak ally, also frequently hosts diplomatic events, a way for Egypt to welcome allies from Saudi Arabia or Israel in a remote location. But since coming to power in a military coup in 2013, Egypt\' s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has also been fond of using Sharm el-Sheikh as the venue for national conferences where the authorities can make sweeping decisions for the Egyptian citizenry far from any public input or scrutiny. This, notably, includes the state\' s economic development conference in 2015, where he announced that Egypt would build a new capital in the desert outside Cairo, and received $12.5bn in donations from Egypt\' s Gulf backers, as well as HYPERLINK https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/162/125193/Business/EEDC-/BP-and-Egypt-seal-bn-deal.aspx $12bn in deals with BP. There is a marked contrast between who is welcomed into the gated community of Sharm el-Sheikh and the treatment of those elsewhere in the Sinai peninsula, not least because Fouda oversaw the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/sharm-el-sheikh-locals-lament-wall-going-up-around-resort construction of a wall HYPERLINK https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/17/egypt-massive-sinai-demolitions-likely-war-crimes Human Rights Watch labelled Observers say hosting Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh is a way for the Egyptian authorities to control which citizens interact with conference attendees, and to ensure that anyone permitted to enter is under heavy surveillance.  They don\' t want Egyptians to interact with the world, or the world to interact with Egyptians, said Baomi.  One of the major reasons for them hosting the Cop is greenwashing, to conceal the crimes that are happening inside the country and to prevent state delegations and officials from meeting with Egyptians A participant who attended a briefing with Egyptian officials at the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/06/energy-prices-ukraine-war-climate-summit-bonn Bonn climate change conference Cop27 .

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK338","Climate target still on 'life support' despite Cop27 deal","November 21, 2022 Monday","The Independent - Daily Edition","A historic Cop27 deal to address the devastating effects of the climate crisis is an important step forward but the failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions means ""our planet is still in the emergency room"", the UN secretary general has warned. A deal was reached in the early hours of yesterday morning in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to establish a fund to compensate vulnerable countries for the irreparable climate damage they have suffered, in a major breakthrough for nations that are experiencing the most serious effects of the climate emergency. But on the crucial issue of limiting global heating in an effort to avoid the most catastrophic consequences that could result, many feel that the ""Sharm"" pact is fundamentally lacking. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said that the conference had made progess, ""but let's be clear: our planet is still in the emergency room. We need to drastically reduce emissions now - and this is an issue this Cop did not address. A fund for loss and damage is essential - but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map, or turns an entire African country to desert. The world still needs a giant leap on climate ambition."" His comments were echoed by prime minister Rishi Sunak, who said ""more must be done"" to tackle the climate crisis, while Cop26 president Alok Sharma described the target to limit global heating to 1.5C by the end of the century as being on ""life support"". And while he marvelled at the way in which loss and damage funding had come to the fore at the end of this year's summit, Sir David King, the UK's former special envoy on climate change, said the destruction will simply increase ""unless we can give up on our dependence on fossil fuels"". Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband also expressed ""deep concern"" that the world was ""not going fast enough"" to keep the 1.5C target alive. The final Cop27 Cop27 agreement, and for the language instead to be broadened to include all fossil fuels. Instead, the text repeats the language of the Glasgow Climate Pact, calling on countries to accelerate efforts towards the ""phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"", thus failing to build on its ambition. There is also no reference to the need for emissions to peak in 2025 if the world wants to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century, as per the latest science. There is ""no sense of urgency, no sense of crisis management"", Sir David said of the reference in the text to cutting emissions. He described the step forward on loss and damage, in the absence of progress on emissions reduction, as ""contradictory"". He pointed to studies that have found that current climate policies put the world on track for a temperature increase of close to 3C by the end of the century. ""That is not a liveable planet,"" he added. ""We're bowing down to the fossil fuel lobby."" In a short statement, Mr Sunak said he welcomed the progress made at Cop27 , but added that ""there can be no time for complacency"". ""Keeping the 1.5C commitment alive is vital to the future of our planet. More must be done,"" he said. Cop27 being billed the ""implementation"" summit. ""The Egyptian presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petrostates and the fossil fuel industries,"" said Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015. The Independent has contacted the Cop27 presidency for comment. US climate envoy John Kerry was optimistic that the Sharm el-Sheikh summit had ""kept the hope of 1.5C alive"", but he said that all major economies must align their 2030 targets with 1.5C and fulfil those targets by halting the construction of new coal-powered facilities, deploying clean energy, and slashing methane emissions. For those suffering the brunt of the extreme weather and rising sea levels caused by a heating planet, the significance of the breakthrough on the contentious issue of loss and damage should not be underestimated. Vulnerable nations and communities have been calling for compensation for decades, and this year was the first time the issue had made it onto the official Cop agenda. Mohamed Adow, the executive director of Power Shift Africa, a group that mobilises climate action on the African continent, echoed the ""Three Lions"" England football song in his jubilation. ""After 30 years of hurt, climate action is finally coming home on African soil here in Egypt,"" he said in a statement. ""We are making history."" Pakistan's foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari described the progress on loss and damage as a ""monumental achievement for climate justice"". There were some other bright spots in the text, too. Among them were calls to reform multilateral development banks and other financial institutions, which lend money to help countries recover from climate-fuelled natural disasters but currently do so on inequitable terms for developing nations. ""This Cop caused deep frustrations but it wasn't for nothing,"" Ms Tubiana said. \"

As the summit heads into its final week, nearly 200 countries have a limited opportunity to strike a deal to avoid the worst impacts of environmental breakdown, while failure to agree on  loss and damage funding has resulted in a lack of momentum and could sour the rest of the conference, analysts have warned. Kate Norgrove from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said the charity was  deeply concerned by the slow progress on changes to harmful agriculture practices and empty promises being made in relation to loss and damage. During his opening speech at the summit in Egypt, UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said getting concrete results on loss and damage was a  litmus test of the commitment of governments to the success of Cop27 . As a result of the stalemate, the outlook for the remainder of the summit is bleak. Few countries have made headline commitments to cut emissions further or faster, and the world is not on track to meet the targets set out under the Paris Agreement. A major criticism of existing approaches to emissions-cutting has been the lack of focus on the enormous environmental impact on the planet by existing agricultural systems, with countries keen to talk up success in cutting emissions from the energy sector but with less enthusiasm in recognising the emissions associated with farming. Livestock farming accounts for between HYPERLINK https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6276/htm 16.5 per cent and 28 per cent With just a few days left in Egypt, negotiators representing governments around the world have a huge list of potential deals to make if the conference isn\' t to be considered a historic failure. Ms Norgrove, the WWF\' s executive director of advocacy and campaigns, said:  So far in Sharm el-Sheikh, sadly all we have seen is woeful inaction on net zero and protecting the planet.  With the second week of Cop27 looming, the UK and global governments must shift from empty promises to meaningful action and bring new resolve to the table to keep global warming to 1.5C, including securing a finance mechanism for loss and damage and making progress on implementation and closing the emissions gap. She added:  This requires commitments across all sectors, and we are deeply concerned by slow progress at the summit in agreeing the future of work on agriculture. Our food system contributes around one-third of HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/greenhouse-gas-emissions greenhouse gas emissions  Success at Cop27 is vital for creating momentum ahead of the crucial global biodiversity summit Cop15 in December.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK342","What is Cop27 and what does the Egypt summit aim to achieve?","November 10, 2022 Thursday 6:59 AM GMT","telegraph.co.uk","Thousands have descended on the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh for the Cop27 climate summit, bringing together governments from around the world. But what does the summit actually achieve? What is the Cop27 summit? The summit is taking place from November 6 to 18 in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Cop stands for Conference of the Parties to the UN\' s climate change framework-and includes all the UN member states, plus the State of Palestine and the Holy See, UN non-member states Niue and the Cook Islands, and the European Union, which negotiates as a bloc. The event occurs annually (apart from in 2020, when it was interrupted by Covid-19), and this will be its 27th year. The host of the summit is chosen by the UN and cycles through the different regions. Last year, the UK hosted the Cop summit in Glasgow and at the beginning of the two weeks officially handed over the presidency to Egypt. What is the goal of the Cop27 summit? The real work of the summit is to hash out the details of international climate agreements, particularly the Paris Agreement, which commits countries to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. The main battle of the summit will be over funding, in particular for the developing countries that bear the brunt of the impact of climate change such as drought and flooding. This funding has been a controversial and unresolved issue for many years, and came to a head in Glasgow. Countries will also be expected to bring new commitments on cutting their emissions, known as their Nationally Determined Contributions. So far only 29 countries have set new targets, meaning there is  no credible pathway to keep warming to 1.5C. Who is attending the Cop27 summit? Global leaders from around the world will make an appearance at the summit in Egypt. HYPERLINK Rishi Sunak will be at a world leaders event on Monday , following a U-turn over his attendance. Mr Sunak had originally said he would be too focused on domestic events ahead of the autumn budget to attend the summit. Mr Sunak will hold bilateral meetings with Emmanuel Macron, French president, and Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, on Monday. Joe Biden , the US president, will fly into the summit on Friday November 11 on his way to the G20 summit in Bali. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2022/10/30/john-kerry-attend-kings-cop27-reception-saying-would-powerful/ His climate envoy, John Kerry, will also attend . In total, 90 heads of state are expected to attend. Alok Sharma, who held the Cop presidency for the UK, will also be in attendance, as well as Th\'e9r\'e8se Coffey, the Environment Secretary; James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary and Grant Shapps, the Business Secretary. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister who has said he takes a personal interest in the climate crisis, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/11/01/boris-johnson-confirms-will-attend-cop27/ will also be in attendance Meanwhile, climate negotiators from each country will conduct the difficult discussions behind the scenes, often working night and day to reach an agreement by the end of the two weeks. The summit also attracts activists, businesses and charities from around the world. Protest is a key part of the summit, but Egypt has been criticised this year for keeping climate demonstrators separated from the main event. What is on the Cop27 agenda? As well as the behind-the-scenes climate negotiations, the Cop27 summit will have days dedicated to specific themes, including finance and agriculture. There will be announcements on multilateral initiatives throughout the two weeks. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK343","Egypt top diplomat says international conflicts should not spill over to COP27","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political ","By BBC Monitoring Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has urged that international conflicts and crises should not spill over to the upcoming COP27 climate summit, set to be held in November in the country's resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh. ""This conference is held amid complex geopolitical conditions, tension and polarisation which we hope would not be part of negotiations related to climate change,"" the top diplomat told the Emirati official news agency WAM in an exclusive interview published on 23 October. ""The parties participating in the climate summit should realise that the goal of this conference is to address the climate change challenges and that it is not a forum to address any other issues,"" he said. Shoukry stressed that any failure or regression in dealing with the challenges of climate change will shift the crisis into ""the point of no return"", a message that he said his country has been reiterating in meetings with foreign counterparts. The foreign minister also told WAM that the main elements of the COP27 summit will centre around reducing carbon emissions, adapting to the negative impacts of climate change and the issue of financing action against climate change. COP27 , a United Nations event, will be held from 6 to 18 November. The Egyptian authorities say they hope to use their presidency of the event to urge the international community to act on pledges of support for developing countries to cope with the devastating impacts of climate change.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK344","At COP27, negotiators still far apart on strong climate deal","November 16, 2022","India Weekly","Countries were far from agreeing the contours of a climate deal at the COP27 summit in Egypt on Wednesday (16), with the host country urging negotiators to resolve their differences ahead of a weekend deadline. The outcome of the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh is a test of world resolve to tackle global warming as other crises, ranging from Russia\' s war in Ukraine to consumer inflation, distract international attention. And delegates at COP27 got a lift from a speech by Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who vowed to re-engage the rainforest nation with international efforts to fight climate change. But inside the negotiating rooms in Egypt, deep divisions remained, according to Egypt\' s COP27  I think we have a larger than normal number of lingering issues, he said.  We would have hoped under the current circumstances to see more willingness to cooperate and accommodate than we are seeing. An official close to the talks said divisions remained over issues including whether rich nations should set up a fund to cover irreparable damage being wrought by climate change, language addressing fossil fuels use and whether 1.5C should remain the explicit targeted limit for planetary warming.  There is concern about how we\' re to get to the end, and there is concern because we\' re talking about the biggest problem facing humanity, the official said, asking not to be named. U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry had said on Saturday that a few countries were resisting mention of the 1.5C goal in the official text of the COP27 summit, but did not name them. Scientists say keeping average global temperature rise to 1.5C is needed to avert the worst effects of climate change. Temperatures have already increased by 1.1C. A European Union official said the G20 support for 1.5C could increase the chances that negotiators in Egypt would also lock in the target. But the official warned  it\' s only safe when 1.5 is anchored in the cover decision, referring to what will form the core political deal from the summit. Lula, speaking at an event alongside governors of Brazilian Amazon states, said:  I am here to say to all of you here that Brazil is back in the world. He also offered to host future U.N. climate talks. And a coalition of countries also announced at G20 it would mobilise $20 billion of public and private finance to help Indonesia shut coal power plants, following a similar deal last year for South Africa. The G20 declaration recognised the need to phase down use of unabated coal and phase out  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It also said industrialised countries should make progress on climate finance \- essentially restating goals made at previous summits. \' MISSED OPPORTUNITY\' India, the world\' s second-biggest buyer of coal, has said during the COP27 talks that it wants countries to agree to phase down all fossil fuels, rather than the narrower deal to phase down coal that was agreed at COP26 last year. That proposal would benefit India, which has relatively small oil and gas reserves, by reducing the focus on its coal use, but has also drawn support from the European Union, which views the idea as a step up in ambition. But it is a sore point for African and Middle Eastern countries keen to develop their oil and natural gas resources. Saudi Arabia has said it wants to avoid a deal that would  demonize oil and gas.  Unfunded ambition gets us nowhere fast, Persaud said, adding he wanted G20 countries to unlock more lending from multilateral development banks they control to help climate-vulnerable countries.  They have missed the opportunity to deliver on that today, and we are running out of time.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK345","Sunak 'will not secure diplomatic victories' at COP27","November 4, 2022","i-Independent Print Ltd","Rishi Sunak will head to the COP27 climate summit in Eqypt this weekend knowing that the UK will not secure the same diplomatic victories as it did in Glasgow last year. Members of Britain's delegation to the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh have acknowledged that they must take a back seat now that the UK is not the official host of the event. The new Prime Minister had such low expectations of this year's COP that he was originally not even planning to attend - and has sacked the outgoing COP president, Alok Sharma, from his Cabinet. The purpose of last year's summit was to ""keep 1.5 alive"" - to ensure that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C above the pre-modern norm remained within reach. Insiders describe this year's as ""an implementation COP"", where governments will be expected to give updates on what concrete progress they have made towards their existing commitments. But diplomats also acknowledge privately that COP27 has been overshadowed by fears of energy shortages caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine - not to mention questions over serious human rights violations by the hosts, Egypt. During a meeting of G20 climate ministers this year, some attendees started rowing back on environmental pledges they had already made. Representatives of the UK Government interpreted the move as a sign that, with international agreements unlikely to be struck this year as a result of global divisions over Russia, other countries feel more able to signal to domestic audiences without having to reach a common position in the end. Mr Sunak, Mr Sharma and the Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, are all expected to fly to Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday - though the Prime Minister will return to Britain the same day. The Environment Secretary, Th\'e9r\'e8se Coffey, and Grant Shapps, the Business Secretary, will also attend the summit along with Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Sharma has attacked government policy in recent days, but allies insist he is only being honest about his views. \"

The UK Government representative at the conference and the outgoing Cop26 president criticised elements of the deal, in his speech at the closing plenary session of the UN climate summit. While he said that progress on loss and damage has been  historic , he warned that it was not a moment for  unqualified celebration . Officials and negotiators agreed a deal in the early hours of Sunday that will create a fund for compensating poor nations that are victims of extreme weather worsened by rich countries\' carbon pollution. But Mr Sharma indicated that the deal did not go far enough, as he told the closing session:  Many of us came here to safeguard the outcomes that we secured in HYPERLINK Glasgow , and to go further still.

Mr Sharma\' s speech, delivered after what appeared to be fraught and last-minute efforts to broker a consensus, pointed out the gaps in the agreement. We joined with many Parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to this. Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text.A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text, weakened, in the final minutes. He continued:  Friends, I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. Unfortunately, it remains on life support.

The target comes from the HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/paris-agreement Paris Agreement , the global treaty on climate change negotiated in 2015, where there was a strong and ultimately successful push by nations such as low-lying islands to include the 1.5C target in the deal because they felt letting temperatures go any higher would threaten their survival. On Sunday, Cabinet minister Steve Barclay said the Government would need to look at the detail of the agreement reached at Cop27 . The Health Secretary told the BBC\' s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg:  The UK, through its overseas aid budget, has always supported action in terms of climate change and I\' m sure we will continue to do so. HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/governments Governments and experts will now closely consider what the deal means in the fight against climate change. Labour\' s Ed Miliband accused countries of  kicking the can down the road in Egypt as he criticised the  complete absence of leadership from Rishi Sunak at the summit. The shadow climate change secretary said:  Yet again we hear the unmistakable sound of the can being kicked down the road on the necessary actions to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees \- and as a result it is now at grave risk.  Too many countries were clearly resistant to what is required, including on fossil fuels. On Sunday morning, many campaigners praised the breakthrough on the loss and damage fund, which according to the agreement will initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources such as international financial institutions. But it came alongside warnings that time was running out to curb global warming. Friends of the Earth\' s international climate campaigner Rachel Kennerley said:  Wealthy countries must now support the setting up of this fund \- and crucially its financing \- to ensure it reaches the frontline communities hardest hit by the climate crisis.  HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/countries Countries like the UK must now provide the necessary cash, and ensure the scheme isn\' t undermined by nations trying to avoid their obligations, she said. But she accused rich countries of also using the talks to  avoid ending their addiction to coal, oil and gas \- instead favouring dangerous and ineffective distractions, like offsetting, over cutting emissions . Yeb Sano, who headed up the Greenpeace delegation at Cop, said that the agreement of the fund marks a  new dawn for climate justice , adding that it proves  if we have a long enough lever, we can move the world . Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said:  While a deal on loss and damage finance is a positive step, it risks becoming a down payment on disaster unless emissions are urgently cut in line with the 1.5C goal. Catherine Pettengell, director of Climate Action Network UK, echoed these warnings. While she said it was a  historic moment , she stressed that the  outcomes are not perfect .  There is much work to be done to ensure we get a fund that is fit for purpose. \"

Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken will jet off to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in November. The council agreed on Wednesday to fund her five-day trip to the follow-up to Cop26 in Glasgow, which includes \£31,500 for flights and \£31,800 for hotel accommodation. Miss Aitken's SNP-run administration announced this week that beloved public buildings such as Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and Glasgow City Chambers will be sold to fill council coffers. The sale is expected to raise around \£3200million of the \£3270million required to settle the latest round of equal-pay compensation and costs. But despite this, at least \£33,300 will be spent on sending Miss Aitken to Cop27 in November. While in North Africa, she is expected to lead a mayoral discussion with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on climate finance. Miss Aitken is also expected to sign a charter on sustainability and take up a role as ambassador for ICLEI, a non-governmental body that promotes sustainable development. Speaking at the city administration committee, business manager Greg Hepburn said: 'Given the need to address global climate issues, our own commitments which must extend beyond our role as Cop26 hosts, it is only appropriate that Glasgow is represented at this event.' John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers are tired of footing the bill for expensive foreign jollies.' Opposition councillors have also raised concerns about Miss Aitken's visit to the Egyptian city due to the country's poor human rights record. The Scottish Green Party forwarded an amendment calling on the Langside councillor to engage in talks regarding civil liberties. Scottish Green leader Jon Molyneux said: 'As a council we played a part in facilitating protests, but in Egypt my understanding is that protests will only be permitted in a designated area that is held well away from the talks themselves. 'The current Egyptian Government has a record of not allowing dissent and there are several political prisoners including human rights activists and journalists who are detained unlawfully.' Miss Aitken responded: 'The venue of Egypt was the UN's choice. It was designated to be an African Cop this year and that does present some challenges around the freedom to protest and mobilise as activists or a civil society in the way you described. 'It is entirely appropriate that those of us who value that make those representations.' A spokesman for Glasgow City Council told the Scottish Daily Mail that Miss Aitken will be handed \£325 in daily expenses.

In a reversal on the stance of Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss, Downing Street made clear to the palace this week that the new government would not stand in the way of the King attending the conference, which begins on Sunday. However, after discussions between officials and the Palace it was decided that there was too little time to arrange the logistics of the visit so the formal advice that the King should not attend was not changed. Instead, he is due to hold a reception at Buckingham Palace tomorrow for international leaders, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and climate experts on their way to Sharm El-Sheikh. A palace source said the King was not disappointed about missing the event and accepted that it was impossible to arrange it at such short notice. The King was advised not to travel after discussions with the Truss government. In private, ministers said the decision was taken because they wanted his first trip overseas as monarch to align with the government's diplomatic priorities. They also feared that, as head of state, his presence as a participant would ""not have been appropriate"". But The Times understands that having initially decided to stick to the Truss government policy, Sunak reviewed the situation. It was eventually decided that it was too late in the day to change the policy because of the practical and security implications of trying to arrange the visit at the last minute. One government source said: ""It was certainly a possibility right up until yesterday. There was a desire to see if it could be made to work."" Another government source added: ""If the prime minister had been in post earlier the advice might have been different."" A Palace spokesman added: ""As has been made clear, in unanimous agreement with the government, His Majesty will not be attending Cop27 . ""His focus is on the pre-Cop reception at Buckingham Palace this Friday, where senior business leaders, experts and NGOs can discuss the important work of the summit and explore ways in which public-private partnership can help tackle climate change.""

Over the past year, as a member of the Finance Sector Deforestation Action group, we have made significant progress \- set investor expectations and initiated targeted corporate engagements to drive action. \~ The LEAF coalition, which seeks to protect forests by promoting only use of high-quality carbon credits and offsets, announced that it had passed US$1.5 billion in corporate spending now committed to the project, a 100% increase in corporate support. Auto manufacturer Volkswagen Group and fashion retailer H&M Group have become the latest global companies to join the LEAF Coalition. The firms join more than 25 global corporations including Amazon, Salesforce, Bayer, PwC, Unilever, Blackrock, E.ON, McKinsey and Company and GSK in signing up to LEAF. \~ Ecuador has become the first country to sign a memorandum of agreement with Emergent, the coordinator of The LEAF Coalition, with the Republic Korea joining the governments of the UK, US and Norway in backing LEAF, becoming the first Asian government to provide the coalition with financial support. \~ Brazil at  tipping point \~ While the election of President Lula has been seen as paving the way for a much-needed change in policy direction, it also comes at a  tipping point for managing deforestation-related risks in Brazil. A recent HYPERLINK https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brazil-AirCon.pdf report by financial think tank Planet Tracker found that regional climate change driven by deforestation puts more than 39% of Brazil\' s exports at risk, causing  significant harm to the Brazilian economy and its soft commodity supply chains.\~\~ These exports include soy beans, with the majority of soy used in Europe being HYPERLINK https://www.esginvestor.net/europes-soy-habit-unwittingly-fuelling-deforestation imported from South America. According to Planet Tracker\' s data, soy beans could experience yield declines of up 66% in a  moderate climate warming scenario . \~ Planet Tracker\' s Peter Elwin said:  This is a global issue. Stopping deforestation in Brazil and elsewhere is essential if we are to have any chance of meeting our climate goals, which is why we\' re calling on investors to help drive us away from the tipping point of no return. \~ In the run-up to the election, Lula HYPERLINK https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Lula+pledged+to+establish+representation+for+local+Indigenous+groups+in+government%2C+strengthen+Brazil%E2%80%99s+environmental+protection+agency%2C+and+crack+down+on+illegal+deforestation.&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 pledged to establish representation for local Indigenous groups in government, strengthen Brazil\' s environmental protection agency, and crack down on illegal deforestation. Analysis by Carbon Brief also HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-bolsonaro-election-loss-could-cut-brazilian-amazon-deforestation-by-89 found that the new President could cut deforesting of the Amazon by 89%, avoiding 75,960km2 of rainforest loss by 2030 \- an area roughly the size of Panama.\~ Elwin noted that investors have a key role to play in supporting efforts to curb deforestation rates by ensuring investee companies are not exposed to or complicit in deforestation and pushing policymakers and food suppliers to increase transparency and improve due diligence practices.\~ Investors should expect changes to Brazilian deforestation policy under Lula, according to Elwin. Brazil\' s nationally determined contribution (NDC) has already committed the country to halting deforestation by 2030, but with Lula now in power  there is the potential to bring this deadline forward , said Elwin. Planet Tracker has recommended that Brazil should bring its NDC deadline forward to 2025. \~ Brazilian organisations have been working to limit the impact of deforestation. BVRio Institute and Imaflora make government timber traceability information available to international buyers through online platforms, assisting buyers in assessing the legal origin of the timber they purchase.  This is valuable for basic investment analysis, as well as assessing risks such as deforestation, he said, adding that it is an area the Brazilian government under Lula will have to address. \~  Actions are more important than words, Elwin added.  The new Brazilian government needs to rapidly step-up investment in enforcement mechanisms to ensure illegal deforestation is prevented, and to invest in better land registration processes to clarify Indigenous Peoples rights to land and prevent land theft. Action to address this will reduce these investment risks, improving potential returns for investors and attracting inward investment into Brazil. \~ The post HYPERLINK https://www.esginvestor.net/cop27-initiatives-boost-deforestation-efforts COP27 Initiatives Boost Deforestation Efforts appeared first on HYPERLINK https://www.esginvestor.net ESG Investor . \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK352","COP27","November 11, 2022 Friday 3:46 PM GMT","MailOnline","President Joe Biden addressed the COP27 climate summit on Friday He said the US was back in a leadership role tackling climate change His speech was briefly interrupted by protesters who stood up and howled One of their banners read: 'People vs. fossil fuels' Asked how he would persuade Republicans to fund his plans, he said: 'Reality'   Egypt was his first stop on a week-long around-the-world trip In Sharm el-Sheikh he met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Biden was under pressure to raise human rights with the Egyptian leader Instead he praised el-Sisi for speaking up on Russia's invasion of Ukraine He is later due to address the COP 27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh President Joe Biden apologized for the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement on Friday as he addressed a major climate summit and outlined how transitioning away from fossil fuels can help the world avoid 'climate hell.' 'The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security, and the very life of the planet,' Biden said at the COP 27 meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It was a chance to trumpet billions of dollars in spending and demonstrate that the U.S. was back in a leadership role in the fight against climate change. That wasn't enough for some in the audience. A group of protesters momentarily silenced Biden as they stood and howled, lifting a banner that read: 'People vs fossil fuels,' before it was snatched away by security guards. Biden pressed on with his speech, announcing more than $150 million to help African nations prepare for emergencies. He called on other nations to raise their ambitions like the U.S. had and insisted that tackling the crisis made good economic sense. But one of the biggest rounds of applause came when he described how his administration had rejoined the Paris Agreement, after President Donald Trump withdrew. 'We immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement,' said Biden. 'We convened major climate summits and re-established ... I apologise we ever pulled out of the agreement.' Biden has been intent on showing partners that American is back, after the isolationism and unilateralism of the Trump years. Friday's speech was part of an effort to put his money where his mouth was, following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the biggest single spending package directed at climate change. 'We're not ignoring harbingers that are right here. It's true. So many disasters,' he said. 'Climate crisis is hitting hardest those countries and communities that have the fewest resources to respond and to recover.' Earlier this week, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, told delegates the world was on a 'highway to climate hell.' For that reason, Biden said, it was vital to fund efforts to help poorer countries prepare for climate emergencies. 'Today, as a down payment, we're announcing more than $150 million in initiatives that' specifically support preparedness, adaptation efforts throughout Africa, including adaptation in Africa, efforts that Egypt and the United States launched together in June. 'This includes support for expanding early warning systems to help cover Africa, broadening access to climate finance, providing disaster risk protection, strengthening food security, mobilising the private sector and supporting a new training centre in Egypt. Leaders Biden will meet one-on-one this week during trio of summits Egyptian President Fattah El-Sisi Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen Chinese President Xi Jinping Indonesian President Joko Widodo Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol After his speech, he was asked how he would persuade Republicans to fund the spending plans. 'Reality,' he answered. He arrived there on Friday afternoon, the first leg of an around-the-world trip that will take him on to a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders in Cambodia and a Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali. Biden was only due to spend a few hours in Egypt after Air Force One touched down in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. He first met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, praising his support for Ukraine. Biden is under pressure to raise the issue of human rights with the Egyptian leader, but instead described how el-Sisi had been an important ally after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reporters were then ushered from the room so private discussions could begin. At the start of his week of high-level diplomacy Biden proclaimed that the US was back as a leader on climate change. And he announced a rule cracking down on methane - a potent green house gas - emitted from all drilling sites, broadening a narrower regulation unveiled last year. Biden faces calls for the U.S. to do more to help countries suffering the consequences of carbon emissions. Increasing financial aid to poor countries has emerged as one of the key themes of the 13-day COP 27 climate conference. They have the support of several European nations who have promised money - but pressure is growing on the U.S., historically the biggest producer of greenhouse gases, and China, which is now the leading emitter of carbon. The U.S. and China must step up, said French President Emmanuel Macron earlier in the week. 'Pressure must be put on rich non-European countries, telling them, ""You have to pay your fair share,""' he said. The U.S. has in the past been resistant to discussing the idea of 'loss and damage' as the issue is termed. But John Kerry, Biden's climate envoy, has raised the issue in speeches even though Congress has signaled its reluctance to embrace the idea of any kind of climate aid. Biden was also expected to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict and regional security issues with el-Sisi. Before their meeting, the Egyptian leader said: 'First of all I'd like to emphasize that the strength of the strategic relationship with the United States has not changed in over 40 years. 'There has always been understanding regarding all the issues.' He added that his country had launched a national strategy for human rights. Biden responded: 'I could listen to you much longer. No I'm serious.' And he thanked him for hosting the COP27 summit A day earlier, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden would raise human rights with el-Sisi, whose government has repeatedly been accused of abuses. 'He feels you're not the American president - you're not really doing your job as American president - if you're not raising issues of human rights,' he told reporters at the White House. The White House later said that he had raised human rights but offered no further details. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK353","COP27: Nicola Sturgeon to attend climate conference in Egypt","October 28, 2022 Friday","Scotsman","Mr Sunak told journalists during his first official visit since entering Number 10 that he would instead be focusing on  the depressing domestic challenges facing the UK. A spokesman for the Scottish Government said the First Minister would head to Sharm El-Sheikh next month for the climate conference. Ms Sturgeon was a fixture of COP26 in Glasgow last year, meeting with world leaders and climate activists. The spokesman said:  Given the vital importance of governments working together to tackle climate change, it is the First Minister\' s intention to attend COP27 .  Details of the ministerial programme are currently being finalised. Speaking to journalists during a visit to a south London hospital on Friday, Mr Sunak said:  The leadership that we have shown on the climate is unmatched  it\' s important to me that, as Prime Minister, we leave behind an environment that is better for our children and grandchildren. I\' m very passionate about that. I\' m very personally committed to it.  I just think, at the moment, it\' s right that I\' m also focusing on the depressing domestic challenges we have with the economy.  I think that\' s what people watching would reasonably expect me to be doing as well. The confirmation comes after the King, who has been an outspoken advocate of action to tackle climate change, has also said he will not go to COP27 , with Downing Street arguing it was not the  right occasion for the trip. Conservative former culture secretary Nadine Dorries said Mr Sunak was  wrong not to attend the Sharm El-Sheikh summit, saying global heating was the  biggest crisis facing our planet . Environment secretary Therese Coffey sought to defend Mr Sunak by arguing he would show  global leadership rather than attending  just a gathering of people in Egypt . Ms Coffey suggested the conference was not one of the  big political summits despite US president Joe Biden being expected to attend. She insisted the  big political iterations of the summits only take place every five years, with next month\' s being more  low key . The UK hosted last year\' s COP26 summit in Glasgow, with then-PM Boris Johnson stressing the need to act by warning it was a  one minute to midnight moment . The Washington Post has reported the US president will travel to COP27 , in a boost for the gathering and its chances of securing action over the climate crisis. But Ms Coffey, who was demoted from deputy prime minister to the environment brief this week, told Sky News:  The big push happened last year in Glasgow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer joined environmental campaigners in criticising Mr Sunak\' s decision to miss the conference, saying:  If I was Prime Minister, I would be going. I would be convening and pulling people together and sorting out the issues that are confronting people. Talking to people this morning who can\' t pay their energy bills, they expect their Prime Minister to be on the world stage sorting these problems out. It\' s an absolute failure of leadership. \"

""We need to move forward, not backwards and all ministers ... are prepared to walk away if we do not have a result that does justice to what the world is waiting for -namely that we do something about this climate crisis,"" he said, referring to European officials. Cop27 was due to close at 6pm local time (4 pm GMT) on Friday, but has overrun with no signs of an imminent agreement early Saturday. Mr Timmermans called on other parties to reciprocate efforts to reach a deal, particularly on the issue of https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/marshall-islands-sinking-cop27-mars-b2220582.html funding for vulnerable nations ""We believe that a positive result today is still within reach. But we are worried about some of the things we have seen and heard over the last, let\' s say, 12 hours,"" he said. ""We\' d rather have no decision than a bad decision."" The issue of compensating countries for the irreparable damage or loss they have suffered due to the climate crisis has dominated this conference from day one. Developed nations, grown rich by burning fossil fuels, have admitted that HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/marshall-islands-sinking-cop27-mars-b2220582.html loss and damage reparations need to be addressed. But many, including the United States, have pushed back on the concept of a new fund. Chief among their concerns is a fear of being held financially liable for their emissions. Losses are incalculable but by 2030 they are estimated to cost developing countries between $290bn and $580bn annually, rising to $132\- 741bn by 2050. The European Union proposed its own solution to the question of loss and damage on Thursday. It said it would accept a fund being established at Cop27 on the condition that it was targeted at the most vulnerable countries, and it has  a broad funder base . This means taking into account the economic situation of countries in 2022 and not in 1992, Mr Timmermans said. The conditions appear to suggest that the European Union is not willing for only historically rich countries to foot the bill but wants to see emerging economies that have grown and developed fast over the past three decades pay too. The other proposals reportedly on the table for loss and damage include setting up a process to establish whether a fund is needed, and for a fund to be established at Cop27 and a transitional committee set up to make sure it was operational in the next two years. Cop27 President Sameh Shoukry telling reporters on Saturday morning that the text -which is still being negotiated -does do just that.  Keeping 1.5C alive was the tagline of Cop26 in Glasgow and means limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The world has already warmed by at least 1.1C, with many scientists saying that figure is out of date. France\' s minister for the energy transition said on Saturday that at this point there was still no satisfactory agreement capable of rising to the challenge of the climate emergency.  We can\' t let the 1.5C global heating objective die in Sharm el-Sheikh, Agnes Pannier-Runacher posted on Twitter. A Western official told The Independent this week that Brazil, China and Russia were among the countries backsliding on commitments to  keep 1.5C alive . The official said the countries were pushing to stick to the Paris temperature goal of  well below 2C rather than the more ambitious 1.5C -a goal that all countries  reaffirmed last year at Cop26 in Glasgow. India has also been pushing for a return to the Paris Agreement language that said countries should reach net zero by the second half of the century, rather than around 2050 as specified in the Glasgow Climate Pact, the official said. The Independent has contacted the countries for comment. \"

The revelation, as more than 25,000 heads of state, diplomats, negotiators, journalists and activists from around the world gather at the climate summit that starts in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, has raised concerns that Egypt\' s authoritarian regime will be able to use an official platform for a United Nations event to track and harass attendees and critical domestic voices. The official Cop27 This data could be used by Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\' s regime to further crack down on dissent in a country that already https://humanrightsfirst.org/library/prison-atlas-details-egyptian-cases-prisoners-and-judges/ holds about 65,000 political prisoners.

This is a cartoon super-villain of an app, said Gennie Gebhart, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\' s advocacy director.  The biggest red flag is the number of permissions required, which is unnecessary for the operation of the app and suggests they are trying to surveil attendees.  No reasonable person will want to consent to being surveilled by a nation state, or having their emails read by them, but often people click these permissions without thinking much. She added:  I can\' t think of a single good reason why they need these permissions. It\' s an open question how this information will be used \- it raises a lot of scary possibilities. It may well have a silencing effect in that people self-censor when they realize they are being watched in this way. It can have a chilling effect. Hussein Baoumi of Amnesty International told the Guardian that tech operatives working for the rights organisation had examined the app and flagged a number of concerns prior to Cop27 . The app was able to access users\' camera, microphone, Bluetooth and location data as well as pair two different apps.  It can be used for surveillance, he said. Baoumi added:  The issues they found were primarily the permissions it asks for. If granted, it allows the app to be used for surveillance against you. It collects data and sends them to two servers, including one in Egypt.

David Burslem, director for environment and biodiversity at the university, is among four delegates the institution is sending to Egypt to attend this year's climate change conference, which is running until November 18 in Sharm El-Sheik. Along with two students and another member of university staff, David is intending to use the United Nations Conference of Parties (COP) event to put the research Aberdeen University is doing in the fields of renewables, climate change and carbon emissions in the global spotlight. David said that although so much has happened across the world since COP26 which was held in Glasgow last year - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine - the dangers presented to the human race by climate change must still be addressed. By attending the Egypt conference, David hopes to help to inform debate about some of the most important issues of our time. He will also be highlighting a lot of the university's research on climate change-related topics. This includes examining the environmental impact of peatland wind farms on carbon emissions, and looking at the role of soil carbon in mitigating greenhouse gases - work which was this year awarded a Queen's Anniversary Prize. David said: ""We want to showcase some of the work we do here, broadly speaking, in the climate change arena. ""We can talk about the work we do here, and the outcomes from what we do to help inform debate. ""And then there's the work in the other direction, which is informing our community in Scotland both at the university and more broadly about the nature of the debate, and the progress that's being made.""

The UK continues deliver on our key funding commitments, spending \£311.6 billion on international climate finance. Recognising the existential threat climate change is already posing around the world - from catastrophic floods in Pakistan to drought in Somalia - the Government will commit to triple funding for climate adaptation as part of that budget, from \£3500m in 2019 to \£31.5bn in 2025. The Prime Minister will also host an event later today to launch the Forests and Climate Leaders' Partnership. The new group, initially comprising 20 countries, will meet twice yearly to track commitments on the landmark Forests and Land Use declaration at COP26, which aims to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030. To support the forest agenda, the UK is committing \£390m today for conservation in the Congo Basin, a vital tropical rainforest which is home to some 10,000 species of tropical plants and several endangered species, including forest elephants, chimpanzees and mountain gorillas. The PM will also confirm \£365 million in funding for the Nature, People and Climate Investment Fund, which supports indigenous and local forest communities, and new financing for Treevive, which is working to conserve and restore two million hectares of tropical forest. As we hand over the Presidency of COP, the Government is focused in particular on partnering with the private sector to facilitate green innovation and energy transition, at home and around the world. As well as helping the drive for net zero, reducing the global demand for oil and gas cuts off the funds for Russia's brutal war machine. In support of this, the Prime Minister will announce a further \£365.5 million for the Clean Energy Innovation Facility today, which provides grants to researchers and scientists in developing countries to accelerate the development of clean technology. Since the BEIS-led fund was launched in 2019 it has supported the creation of biomass-powered refrigeration in India, prototype lithium-ion batteries in Nigeria and clean hydrogen-based fuels for steel production in Morocco, among other innovations. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to tell COP27 later today: The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That's a legacy we could be proud of. As well as supporting innovation, the UK is working with G7 allies to provide countries with reliable, transparent sources of sustainable infrastructure financing. Ahead of an expected meeting later today between the Prime Minister and President Ruto, the UK and Kenya have reaffirmed their commitment to the UK-Kenya Strategic Partnership and agreed to progress a number of flagship green investment projects. The projects include new and expanded solar and geothermal power plants in Kenya backed by British International Investment, UK export financing for Nairobi's ground-breaking Railway City and a major Public-private Partnership on the $ 3 billion Grand High Falls Dam hydropower project led by UK firm GBM Engineering. The UK will also confirm new financial support for Egypt's flagship COP27 initiative, the 'Nexus on Food, Water and Energy'. The funding will develop projects including solar parks and energy storage innovations, and is expected to mobilise billions in private sector finance. The Prime Minister is also expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings at COP27 today, including with French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni.

Independent media and research B Corp company, Corporate Knights and its Global 100 Council, which features the global 100 most sustainable corporations, started the Action Declaration by submitting a roundtable proposal on 20 October, 2022 and gained support from a number of global sustainable organisations. H&M Group was joined by 56 other signatories from a host of other industries, including BT Group from the telecoms industry and climate campaign Race to Zero, to show their commitment towards climate policy engagement help address climate change, not stall it. The letter suggests closing the gap on emissions and decarbonising economies by: Supporting climate action aligned with the Paris Agreement when engaging with policymakersWorking with their major industry/trade associations to advance alignment with the Paris AgreementMonitoring and disclosing climate policy alignment for their companies and their major industry/trade associations.

In this letter for world leaders at COP27 , H&M Group was joined by Zara&#8217;s parent company Inditex as well as a number of other global organisations to state that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius &#8220;requires significant collaboration and shared responsibility between the private and public sector.&#8221; The signatories who are described as the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders said: &#8220;We are ready to work side-by-side with governments to deliver bold climate action. We encourage all business leaders to set science-based targets to halve global emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 at the latest. &#8220;We believe that business commitments to climate action backed by private sector actions and investments can reinforce the mandate for governments to raise their own ambitions and enable faster progress. Government targets, supporting policies and transition plans can provide clarity, predictability and the competitive landscape to encourage more businesses to take action and to make transition-aligned investments.&#8221; In this context and with leaders meeting at COP27 and the G20, the Alliance called on governments to: Supporting climate action aligned with the Paris Agreement when engaging with policymakersWorking with their major industry/trade associations to advance alignment with the Paris AgreementMonitoring and disclosing climate policy alignment for their companies and their major industry/trade associations.

Meanwhile, Sunak's speech at the COP27 climate summit on Monday suggested a renewed commitment to climate finance, as he reiterated the UK's \£311.6bn contribution, a promise that such a gas deal would seemingly contradict. Sunak outlined that ""investing in renewables is precisely the way to insure ourselves against the risks of energy dependency"". By directing public and private finance towards the protection of the planet, new jobs and clean growth could be created, he added. Following a HYPERLINK https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/997302/shift-to-liquefied-natural-gas-could-have-massive-environmental-impact-study-shows-997302.html Rystad report that found LNG to cause ten times the amount of carbon emissions of piped gas due to an energy-intensive process where it is cooled to -160C, it is likely that Sunak will face some scrutiny over the deal.

Charles is said to be disappointed not to go, but understands his attendance would need the blessing of the government and will not force the issue with No10, The Times reported. A source told the newspaper: 'He will be champing at the bit but knows it would need government blessing. The PM has reversed the fracking decision so this could be another smart environmentally focused move.' The King also hopes to find a way to show his support, potentially through a message or convening discussions via video-link or telephone, The Telegraph reported. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The news comes as Downing Street yesterday admitted for the first time that the King was advised not to attend the summit under Truss's administration.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said Government advice was sought, as is 'standard practice', and it was agreed it was not the 'right occasion' for Charles to visit in person. She added that she is 'not aware' that the advice has changed. 'As is standard practice, Government advice was sought and provided under a previous PM, and it was unanimously agreed that it would not be the right occasion for the King to visit in person,' she said. 'I'm not aware that that advice has changed but obviously any confirmation of the King's travel would be for the Palace.' Asked if there are any plans for the conversation between the Palace and the Government to reopen, she said again that she is not aware the advice has changed. The summit's Egyptian organisers have claimed about 90 heads of state had so far confirmed their attendance, with President Biden and President Macron expected to go. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The Red Sea gathering will come 12 months after the UK hosted the Cop-26 summit in Glasgow, which was attended by a string of Cabinet ministers - including Mr Sunak himself as Chancellor.

'The UK will be fully represented by other senior ministers as well as the Cop President Alok Sharma.' Downing Street insisted the PM remained £bsolutely committed' to supporting the climate conference and denied his decision to skip the summit signalled a downgrading of climate issues as a Government priority. The No10 spokeswoman added: 'We remain committed to net zero and to leading international and domestic action to tackle climate change. 'The UK is forging ahead of many other countries on net zero. 'We will obviously continue to work closely with Egypt as the hosts of Cop-27 and to make sure that all countries are making progress on the historic commitments they made at the Glasgow climate pact.' Labour's shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband branded Mr Sunak's non-attendance at Cop-27 £ massive failure of leadership'. 'We were the Cop-26 hosts and now the UK Prime Minister isn't even bothering to turn up to Cop-27 ,' he added. 'What Rishi Sunak obviously fails to understand is that tackling the climate crisis isn't just about our reputation and standing abroad, but the opportunities for lower bills, jobs, and energy security it can deliver at home.' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'Rishi Sunak does not speak for the British people by refusing to take climate change seriously. 'He has failed to rule out a new ban on onshore wind, failed to help households make their homes warmer and is now failing to attend the Cop summit. 'It flies in the face of the UK's proud tradition of leading the world in our response to the climate change.' Green MP Caroline Lucas posted on Twitter: 'Shame on him.' Darren Jones, the Labour chair of the House of Commons' Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, also criticised Mr Sunak over his downgrading of Government climate roles. 'COP26 President and climate change minister now deemed to be a junior ministerial issue. 'Not a surprise from the former Chancellor who couldn't bring himself to say ""benefits of net zero"".' Environment Secretary Therese Coffey defended Sunak's decision not to attend by saying the 'big political' summits take place every five years. She insisted the climate issue is 'very much a priority' for the new Government despite climate minister Graham Stuart and Cop26 President Alok Sharma being stripped of their Cabinet seats. 'I am not aware of, say, President Biden or President Macron or any of those other people will be there. It is quite standard practice that every five years is the big political gathering.'

The pledge came as he addressed the second Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) meeting at the Cop27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Within Saudi, the Kingdom has already committed \£3165 billion as part of the Saudi Green Inititiative. The first days of Cop 27 have been dominated by wrangles over the extent to which wealthy countries support poorer ones to deal with the impact of climate change. The Crown Prince said the Saudi investment will support  concerted regional efforts to  reduce emissions and remove more than 670 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent . Those emissions account for 10 percent of the global total. A new MGI directorate will be based in Riyadh. He said the Kingdom will build of one of the largest Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) hubs in the world. This will capture 44 million tons of CO, equivalent to 15% of the Kingdom\' s current NDC, by 2035. The NDC, or Nationally Defined Contribution, is a UN-agreed target agreed by individual countries. The summit reaffirmed its commitment to plant 50 billion trees across the region to combat desertification and land degradation across west, central and south Asia, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. It was also announced that Saudi\' s powerful sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) aims to reach net zero by 2050, claiming to be the first sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East and one of the first globally to do so. The PIF will use the \£3492 billion generated from the kingdom\' s oil wealth to support green and circular carbon economy efforts and technology.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK365","PM's decision to give Cop27 the cold shoulder; Letters to the Editor","November 1, 2022 Tuesday","The Times (London)","Sir, Rishi Sunak has said that his two young daughters are his environmental watchdogs. They ask him ""what you are doing about the environment and climate, Dad?"" The young Sunaks are not outliers. In September last year a survey of 10,000 those aged between 16 and 25 in ten countries, reported in Nature, found that nearly two thirds of them were ""very worried"" or ""extremely worried"" about climate change. Climate change is the biggest existential threat to the future of both the Sunak clan and the rest of us, far more important than the short-term economic crisis facing the country. Sunak should show his commitment to tackling climate change by going to Cop27 . It is not simply an ephemeral controversy, as implied by your leading article (""Sunak's Squalls"", Oct 31). I hope Sunak has a good answer when his daughters ask him: ""Dad, why didn't you help to save our future by going to Egypt?"" Professor Lord Krebs, FRS Chairman of the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change 2009-17 Sir, It would appear that the pursuit of net-zero ideology now trumps the reality that people are relying on food banks, unable to heat their homes and facing the possibility of electricity blackouts (""PM's change of heart on Cop27 after Johnson says he is going"", Oct 31). Many would even argue that the possibility of nuclear weapons being used in Ukraine is a far more pressing threat to the climate. Yet policymakers are being forced to turn their backs on resolving these issues to pander to this futile exercise in geopolitical virtue signalling, Cop27 . Persistent yielding to the demands of eco-protest groups has already caused more than enough political and economic instability; it is time to stay the course on this one. Edward Livingston Lochgilphead, Argyll Sir, I am disappointed that the PM has followed the bewildering decision of his predecessor to bar the King from attending the Cop27 conference. The King is, and has been for years, one of the best informed and dedicated advocates on this issue. He would undoubtedly enhance the conference and those attending would be very pleased to have such a distinguished and influential supporter on their side. It could also be a shot in the arm for our dismal present reputation abroad. Melvyn Bragg London NW3 Sir, Rishi Sunak is right to prohibit the King from attending Cop27 , not because the King's views on climate change are wrong, which I do not believe they are, but because it is central to our constitutional monarchy that the monarch never publicly expresses views contrary to those of the government. The King's views are well known and were he to attend it would be almost impossible for him to avoid expressing disagreement. David Terry Droitwich, Worcs Sir, Rishi Sunak is accused by some of a failure of leadership for missing Cop27 in Egypt. He would doubtless have faced the same accusation were he to be seen hobnobbing with Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron under the Pyramids rather than preparing the November 17 fiscal statement. Christopher Arnander Firle, E Sussex Sir, Surely the PM could attend to domestic affairs and carve out an hour or two to attend virtually? That would allow him to confirm his commitment to net zero on the world stage. Perhaps he should talk to President Zelensky about the use of Zoom. Dr Samar Mukherjee Arncroach, Fife \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK366","Creative climate finance in Africa","Oxford Business Group: Economic News"," ","- African leaders look to build financing momentum at COP27 in Egypt - Climate projects remain underfunded as extreme weather events become more frequent - Debt-climate swaps and other new financing instruments under consideration - The Great Blue Wall seeks to protect vulnerable regions in the Indian Ocean While uncertainty abounds in global energy markets amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, African leaders are increasingly looking to the private sector to finance investment in clean energy ahead of the COP27 UN Conference on Climate Change , to be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in November 2022. The COP27 agenda will consider more than 140 projects in Africa, 19 of which are considered ready for implementation and investment, including four in Egypt that carry an estimated cost of $17.4bn but need additional private sector funding. The 51 African countries that submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) during the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris and have reported climate data will need roughly $2.8trn by 2030 to meet those commitments, according to the ""Climate Finance Needs of African Countries"" report published in June 2022 by the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI). The UN forecasts that Africa will be one of the regions most severely affected by climate change. In recent years, the continent has experienced more extreme weather events, as heatwaves, droughts, flash floods, and Category 4 or 5 cyclones have prompted loss of human and animal life and agricultural crops. Public financing shortfall Despite Africa's sizeable funding gap, financing to date has fallen short. In 2020 some $30bn was available, about 12% of the amount required per year. While African governments have committed $264bn thus far, the continent is looking to source the remaining $2.5trn from the private sector or international bodies. Mitigation projects to reduce carbons emissions account for 66% of Africa's climate financing needs, and the transportation sector accounts for 58% of mitigation projects, according to the CPI report. The other sectors requiring funds for mitigation include energy, with 24%; agriculture, forestry and other land use, with 9%; and industry, with 7%. Meanwhile, adaptation accounts for 24% of required financing, but the total amount needed is likely underestimated due to a lack of data and expertise. Amid this trajectory, there are signs that HYPERLINK http://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/news/could-wealthy-nations-fund-energy-transition-emerging-markets Western countries are beginning to commit to providing more resources and delivering on promises of financial support for climate investment . This week Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), announced during the first-ever Africa Adaptation Summit in Rotterdam that the EIB would triple its climate-adaptation finance by 2025, warning that ""climate change could wipe out 15% of Africa's gross domestic product by 2030, which would mean an additional 100m people in extreme poverty by the end of the decade"". Last week at the G20 Energy Transitions Ministerial Meeting in Bali, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, also called on G20 countries to mobilise more financing to support the clean energy transition in developing countries. However, public sector funding remains complicated. As part of COP26, the EU, the US, the UK, Germany and France pledged $8.5bn to help South Africa transition away from coal, which accounts for 80% of its electricity generation, to cleaner energy sources. However, roughly 80% of these funds would come in the form of loans, and some may be difficult to access due to national rules that protect domestic jobs. South Africa experienced devastating floods in April that killed 450 people and rendered thousands homeless. The storm followed three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms that hit south-east Africa in early 2022. To meet the continent's financing shortfalls, creative solutions could help African nations address the twin challenges of climate and debt. The IMF, the Green Climate Fund and the African Development Bank are in the tentative stages of backing the use of debt-for-climate swaps through which debtor countries could use local currency to invest the money that would have gone towards the repayment of loans in climate projects. The IMF published a working paper in August 2022 that found that these arrangements could make sense in some cases, while the Green Climate Fund, established as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to assist developing countries in mitigating and adapting to climate change, said that it could act as an intermediary. Cabo Verde, Eswatini and Kenya are particularly keen to take part, but it remains unclear what form these financial instruments would take. This week Amina Mohammed, deputy secretary-general of the UN, highlighted the potential role of debt-climate swaps in remarks to the Africa Adaptation Finance Forum that were intended to set the agenda for COP27 . The most innovative forms of finance to help Africa meet its climate commitments come in the form of HYPERLINK http://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/news/blue-carbon-credits-future-sustainability-focused-financing green and blue bonds, which allow countries to finance climate projects through bonds issued by international organisations such as the World Bank and generate returns for private investors . The Seychelles pioneered the use of blue bonds globally in 2018, raising $15m to support the sustainable development of ocean resources. Southern and East African nations are now seeking to use blue bonds to build the so-called Great Blue Wall, an idea that emerged from COP26. It aims to protect coastal and marine areas running from Somalia to South Africa in the Indian Ocean, sequester 100m tonnes of CO2 and create 1m blue jobs by 2030. Fishing in the West Indian Ocean is critical to African and global food security, accounting for 4.8% of global fishing. The Great Blue Wall initiative targets the regions most in need of financing. Southern African nations require $1.1bn of funding, while East African nations need roughly $700m - a combined 72% of what Africa needs to meet its NDCs. Less attention has been given to Africa's Atlantic coast  where many people are losing their livelihoods due to climate change  although the World Bank's West Africa Coastal Areas Management Programmes has helped 17 African nations that are vulnerable to erosion, flooding and pollution by building dams and coastal fortifications, restoring wetlands and filling in beaches. In 2007 Africa also launched the Great Green Wall project, which seeks to plant trees, grasslands, plants and vegetation to stem the advance of erosion from the Sahara Desert. The project aims to restore 100 ha of degraded land, sequester 250m tonnes of CO2 and create 10m green jobs by 2030. The adoption of green bonds has been slower in Africa than in other regions, despite vast potential for solar and wind energy, but some analysts see significant growth potential for these financial instruments given both their attractiveness and the continent's needs. \"

Posts and reports included various estimates for the number of such planes bringing delegates to the gathering in the beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Climate Action Against Disinformation, a group that analyses trends in false information on social media, said in a report on Thursday that narratives of supposed 'hypocrisy and elitism' were one of the main focuses of climate-sceptic messages during COP27 . Egyptian sources corroborated widespread claims that some 400 private jets landed during COP27 . Some media cited lower estimates by flight-trackers, though there may have been private flights that were not logged by monitoring services. One misleading post in Spanish claimed there were as many as 1,500 private jets. It was accompanied by an old photograph of planes from an aviation forum in Las Vegas. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par 'More than 400 private jets landed in the past few days in Egypt,' a source close to the Egyptian aviation authorities, who asked not to be named, told AFP on Thursday. 'There was a meeting ahead of COP27 , and officials were expecting those jets and made some arrangements in Sharm el-Sheikh airport to welcome those planes.' On November 6, Ahmed Moussa, a talk-show host close to the Egyptian leadership, boasted on air that 'Sharm el-Sheikh's airport welcomed more than 300 private jets. The airport was renovated with more corridors in order to welcome the guests of COP27 .' Criticisms of private jets also surged during the last UN climate summit, COP26, in Glasgow in November 2021. Estimates cited in media for the number of jets used at that event varied from less than 200 to around 400. AFP fact-checked posts from that period in various languages that showed a photograph of planes parked on a runway, claiming they were used by leaders at COP26. Reverse-image searches revealed the image was actually taken years before and showed planes at an airport in New Orleans. However, it was not just peddlers of false information criticising the COP27 delegates. On November 5, hundreds of climate activists, some on bicycles, occupied an apron for private jets at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, calling for such planes to be banned. The protest was organised by environmental groups Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion. Passengers on private jets produce far more planet-warming emissions per capita than those on commercial flights. According to the European clean transport campaign group Transport and Environment, a private jet can emit two tonnes of carbon dioxide in an hour and is five to 14 times more polluting per passenger than a commercial plane. An online emissions calculator provided by the International Civil Aviation Organization indicates that a passenger on a commercial flight in premium class would produce around half a tonne of CO2 overall during a flight from London to Sharm el-Sheikh. There are more than 33,000 participants registered at the COP27 , where delegates are holding high-level talks on scaling up finance for developing countries to green their economies and prepare for global warming impacts. Scientists say climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is worsening devastating disasters including floods, heatwaves and droughts, likely to intensify in the decades to come if emissions are not cut.

Charles brought together more than 200 international business leaders, decisionon makers and environmentalists - and Mr Sunak was among a small group of guests who met him in a separate room before the main reception in the ballroom. As Charles chatted to him about Cop27 , which begins tomorrow in Sharm El-Sheikh, the Prime Minister could be heard saying to him: 'I think we're in good shape.' In a speech, Mr Sunak hailed Charles's 'farsighted leadership' on climate change, adding: 'His Majesty has been working to help find practical solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss for more than 50 years, long before Cop1, let alone Cop27 .' Other guests included US special envoy for climate John Kerry, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey, other international dignitaries and representatives of environmental organisations such as the WWF and European Forest Institute. Meanwhile, campaigners in Egypt have built a huge pyramid of plastic waste taken from the Nile. In total, 18 tons of waste was used to create a structure taller than a three-storey building. Many of the bottles bear the logo of Coca-Cola - which is sponsoring Cop27 . \"

The UK continues deliver on our key funding commitments, spending \£311.6 billion on international climate finance. Recognising the existential threat climate change is already posing around the world - from catastrophic floods in Pakistan to drought in Somalia - the Government will commit to triple funding for climate adaptation as part of that budget, from \£3500m in 2019 to \£31.5bn in 2025. The Prime Minister will also host an event later today to launch the Forests and Climate Leaders' Partnership. The new group, initially comprising 20 countries, will meet twice yearly to track commitments on the landmark Forests and Land Use declaration at COP26, which aims to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030. To support the forest agenda, the UK is committing \£390m today for conservation in the Congo Basin, a vital tropical rainforest which is home to some 10,000 species of tropical plants and several endangered species, including forest elephants, chimpanzees and mountain gorillas. The PM will also confirm \£365 million in funding for the Nature, People and Climate Investment Fund, which supports indigenous and local forest communities, and new financing for Treevive, which is working to conserve and restore two million hectares of tropical forest. As we hand over the Presidency of COP, the Government is focused in particular on partnering with the private sector to facilitate green innovation and energy transition, at home and around the world. As well as helping the drive for net zero, reducing the global demand for oil and gas cuts off the funds for Russia's brutal war machine. In support of this, the Prime Minister will announce a further \£365.5 million for the Clean Energy Innovation Facility today, which provides grants to researchers and scientists in developing countries to accelerate the development of clean technology. Since the BEIS-led fund was launched in 2019 it has supported the creation of biomass-powered refrigeration in India, prototype lithium-ion batteries in Nigeria and clean hydrogen-based fuels for steel production in Morocco, among other innovations. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to tell COP27 later today: The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That's a legacy we could be proud of. As well as supporting innovation, the UK is working with G7 allies to provide countries with reliable, transparent sources of sustainable infrastructure financing. Ahead of an expected meeting later today between the Prime Minister and President Ruto, the UK and Kenya have reaffirmed their commitment to the UK-Kenya Strategic Partnership and agreed to progress a number of flagship green investment projects. The projects include new and expanded solar and geothermal power plants in Kenya backed by British International Investment, UK export financing for Nairobi's ground-breaking Railway City and a major Public-private Partnership on the $ 3 billion Grand High Falls Dam hydropower project led by UK firm GBM Engineering. The UK will also confirm new financial support for Egypt's flagship COP27 initiative, the 'Nexus on Food, Water and Energy'. The funding will develop projects including solar parks and energy storage innovations, and is expected to mobilise billions in private sector finance. The Prime Minister is also expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings at COP27 today, including with French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. He will also attend a roundtable discussion focused on energy transition partnerships, and will deliver a national plenary statement later in the day setting out the UK's climate commitments.

Officials who land a spot at the conference's exclusive VIP restaurant will be able to dine out on an array of pricey meat and fish dishes served up during the 12-day climate conference in Sharm el-Sheik this week. Those with a taste for the luxurious can snap up an angus beef medallion with saut\'e9ed potatoes for a pricey $100 (\£390) or a creamy salmon for $40 (\£335), after scoffing back a $50 (\£343) seafood platter for starter. Delegates looking for an after-dinner tipple can bag a $50 (\£343) one-hour unlimited drinks package - including beer and red and white wines. And those with a sweeter-tooth can pay as much as $125 (\£3110) for 90 minutes of bottomless cocktails - including fruit and rum punch, a classic margarita and a pina colada. It comes as climate change activists continue to call for the world to cut down on meat and fish to save the planet, while at last year's COP26 in Glasgow, the UK's Chief Scientist Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, called on people to adjust their meat eating and flying habits. One group, Animal Rebellion, which campaigns for animal and climate justice, described the menu as a 'slap in the face' - particularly in regards to the ongoing cost of living crisis. 'These world leaders need to look like they believe them. This just looks like do what I say and not what I do.' Mr McGovern also took aim at the inclusion of foods such as salmon, which are found in the Atlantic thousands of miles from Egypt. He said: 'North Africa has some brilliant plant-based foods, like falafel and couscous, why do they need to ship in Salmon from the Atlantic?' A spokesperson for The Vegan Society added: 'It's really disappointing that such a significant climate change event as COP27 is serving up high environmental impact meat and fish sourced from another continent. The luxurious menu is part of the VIP restaurant package in the area's Blue Zone - where official negotiations take place. In the restaurant, COP27 attendees can enjoy an a la carte menu featuring soup, starters, a main dish, desert and an additional hot and cold drinks package. In total, across the Blue Zone there are four main coffee stations, a number of grab-and-go areas where delegates can pick up sandwiches and salads and food courts offering buffet style lunches and breakfasts. Breakfast menus include an 'Egg Station' serving eggs 'in any style' as well as a savoury area with grilled sausages. Lunch menus include mini hamburgers, as well as vegetarian alternatives, crusted fish fillet, as well as more local dishes including tabbouleh. There are also pricey drinks packages, including \£3125 cocktail bar deals which allow delegates to enjoy unlimited cocktails for up to 90 minutes, with a variety of snacks. Delegates can also knock back unlimited beer and wine in the bars for one hour for \£345, while a special Boudin-style tent has been set up to serve local teas and sweet treats. The menus are all posted by Cop Gourmet, the provider of Cop27 's official catering provider, on the climate conference's website. But the menu choices have come under fire online, including by one Twitter user, who shared a picture of the VIP package. They wrote: ' Cop27 'Here's the VIP food menu for today. Very erm... meaty with a dash of dairy obvs!' Cop27 for a comment. It is not the first time the Cop menu has come under fire. Last year, animal rights groups compared offering meat and dairy at the climate summit to 'serving cigarettes at a lung cancer conference'. The Government promised the food served to delegates would be almost 60 percent meat and dairy based and sourced from Scottish farms. But critics have pointed out that some of the dishes, including the burger and mozarella pizza, had a carbon footprint of 2.1 to 3.9kg Co2. The menu's lowest carbon options were meat free - including a kale and vegetable pasta dish which created just 0.3kg of carbon per serving. At last year's Glasgow Conference, the UK's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, called for a push towards people eating less meat. He said: 'There will be a move away from the extent of meat eating we've seen in the past, and I think we will all need to think about our flying habits. 'But of course, coupled to that, there's also technological advances, so as options for green transport become real that will change again. 'One of the climate challenge is it's a series of small things from all of us that turn into a big change. 'Those little things that appear like they're not very much are important when they are aggregated across many many millions of people.' Sunak joins COP27 summit with Sturgeon demanding 'reparations' to climate-change hit states and ministers refusing to rule out payments... but Boris warns UK can't afford it COP27 summit today urging a 'global mission for clean growth' - but is facing a growing row about 'reparations' to states hit by climate change. The PM is in Egypt for the gathering - his first test on the foreign stage since entering No10 - having U-turned on his original decision not to attend. But the event is promising to be tricky as developing countries demand payouts for extreme weather events caused by climate change - at the same time as the UK imposes swingeing austerity and tax rises at home. Nicola Sturgeon - who has also jetted in for the summit - upped the pressure this morning, saying there is an 'obligation' on countries that industrialised first to help 'deal with the impacts'. Business Secretary Grant Shapps pointedly refused to rule out the idea, saying the UK is 'supportive of discussions' taking place at Sharm El-Sheikh. However, former PM Boris Johnson told a fringe event that Britain 'simply doesn't have the financial resources' to pay reparations and 'no country does'. While admitting that the UK had contributed vast carbon emissions, he argued that the focus should be on finding private investment and technological solutions. 'Let's look to the future,' he added. Mr Sunak could have an awkward encounter with his predecessor later, although the premier insisted there is 'no hatchet to be buried'. Downing Street said Mr Sunak is looking to set the seal on last year's Cop26 summit in Glasgow with more than \£3200million in UK funding to protect forests and invest in 'green' technologies. Mr Sunak's attendance at the gathering in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh alongside leaders such as US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron marks his first outing on the international stage since becoming PM last month. In interviews yesterday, shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband stressed it would also be in Britain's 'self-interest' to boost aid to developing countries. But, while he highlighted both Pakistan and the Maldives as possible recipients of 'loss and damage' payments, he denied it would also see China handed cash. Mr Miliband also shied away from describing payments to developing countries as 'reparations' for climate change damage, adding that 'lots of people are allergic to the term 'reparations''. Cop-27 summit, with developing countries having already made demands ahead of the Egypt gathering. The G77+ China group of nations are also set to repeat their call for a dedicated financing facility for loss and damage. Ms Sturgeon said there was an 'obligation' on richer countries that have largely caused climate change to help those suffering the impact of it. She told the BBC: 'I think this Cop is an opportunity for the global north and the global south to come together and have a proper, grown-up conversation about how we make progress. 'We've got to mitigate climate change, we've got to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, but as we've seen over the past year, not least in Pakistan, there are many parts of the world that are suffering loss and damage now that is irreversible and can't be mitigated against. 'There is an obligation in the spirit of solidarity for the richer countries that have largely caused climate change to now make a big effort to help those dealing with the impacts address that.' However, the PM's official spokesman said there was no question of 'reparations'. 'We are already helping countries across the world deal with the impacts of climate change and recognise the existential threat it poses to countries around the world from flooding to drought,' the spokesman said. 'That's why we've made a commitment to these countries to support them on that front. 'As we said over the weekend, we're tripling funding for climate adaptation. 'That's from \£3500million to \£31.5billion in 2025. And the Prime Minister is confirming \£365million in funding for the Nature, People and Climate Investment Fund - that supports indigenous and local forest communities. 'My understanding is that neither reparations or liabilities is what's being discussed at Cop-27 . 'It's about working together to support climate vulnerable countries as I set out.' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK372","Vicky Allan: How can the COP27 agreement not mention phasing out fossil fuels?","November 22, 2022 Tuesday","Herald Scotland","IT-S a general rule that if you don-t name a problem, you can-t tackle it. You can-t fix road accidents if you don-t mention cars. You can-t prevent lung cancer without saying tobacco. Such is the case with oil and gas and COP agreements. How can you sort a problem like the climate, without saying the words fossil fuels? Yet, after 30 years of COP climate conferences, there is still, even now, following COP27 at Sharm El-Sheikh, no mention in the final global agreement text of phasing out, or even phasing down of fossil fuels. Indeed, there is barely, in fact, any mention of the term fossil fuel in this plan to prevent the kind of global heating that could leave our children and grandchildren in a devastated world. There-s something very Kafkaesque about a key document about a problem that barely names its root cause, that keeps it just out of view, behind the cloud of emissions talk. And emissions, of course, are the problem - but we have to recognise their source. We have to say the words, and our global agreements need to incorporate them, or those emissions will only keep on pumping out. Report after report has stated that fossil fuels are the chief sources of the carbon dioxide emissions responsible for anthropogenic climate change. The United Nations, for instance, observes, -fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions.- But in the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan, the term remains almost absent. Take that in. That said, there are achievements to celebrate coming out of COP: one of these being the inclusion, finally, of Loss and Damage clauses in the agreement text, the promise of finance from developed nations of finance to those devastated by climate-change-linked extreme weather. This was a breakthrough. But, as many have pointed out, the lack of progress on fossil fuel phase-out or phase-down means that the likely result is that there will simply be more damage. Loss and damage finance in a world without fossil fuel phase-down could be astronomical. On Twitter, Professor Nick Cowern described that the result will be that loss and damage inevitably will -come to exceed the ability of ANY group of countries to pay them-. Fossil fuels are, in fact, mentioned once in the text - they are there in the phrase -efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies-. But that-s it - and one of the big hopes of this COP27 was that this could be changed and -phase-down- or even -phase-out- of fossil fuels inserted. A key country pushing this idea, interestingly, was India, which only last year pushed for the watering-down of language around coal phase-down in the COP26 agreement. At COP27 they were, now calling for an expansion of the commitment to all fossil fuel. Around 80 countries backed this idea, including the UK. So, what has stopped the world from agreeing to stop doing the thing that we know has caused this problem - the burning of fossil fuels? This COP27 has seen the finger of blame pointed at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - historically the blockers of agreement at COP. One recent New York Times article reported that Saudi representatives at COP27 pushed to -block a call for the world to burn less oil, according to two people present at the meeting, saying that the summit-s final statement -should not mention fossil fuels-.- But clearly Saudia Arabia was not alone. Several other oil-producing countries also objected. It-s also worth noting that, according to Global Witness, there were 636 oil industry delegates at COP27 . The Kingdom of Fossil Fuel had so many voices present that some described it as a -fossil fuel fair-. We have to remember that we too, in UK and Scotland, still have a long way to go on oil and gas - and that we don-t need a global agreement to phase-out. We are also, unlike developing countries, not struggling to build an infrastructure and raise living standards, having already built our world, effectively, out of emissions. READ MORE: Cop27 Last week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Tweeted, -Fossil fuel addiction is hijacking humanity-. That hijacking has to stop - and that starts with insisting on the right words. Fossil fuels. Never avoid saying it. Never let the world miss that chance again. \"

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has arrived in Egypt for the climate summit and the Scottish First Minister has also attended, accompanied by the leader of Glasgow City Council Susan Aitken. During an appearance on Sky News, Kay Burley questioned Ms Sturgeon over whether Scotland\' s involvement in the COP summit could have been conducted remotely given Westminster\' s leader was already present. Related articles Speaking of the First Minister\' s decision to attend COP27 , the Sky News host asked:  Isn\' t that what Rishi Sunak is doing already? Could you not have done what you needed to do remotely? Ms Sturgeon responded:  No, this is the fifth COP that I have participated in and it\' s really important to be here, to be having the discussion, to be playing our part in finding the solutions.  Rishi Sunak is here - I welcome that, I think it is right that he is here.  If you look in a UK context at many of the decisions that will determine whether the UK as a whole meets its own climate obligations, many of them, for Scotland, are responsibilities of the Scottish Government - renewable energy, for example, energy efficiency, changing how we travel - so it is really important that everybody with a part to play does that to the full. The First Minister said that she had travelled to Egypt to form the  vital connections with global leaders needed to address the climate crisis. She added:  If you speak to many campaigners, many governments particularly from the global south, they warmly welcome Scotland\' s contribution here generally on this issue, but particularly on the issue of loss and damage.  Without the intervention last year of the Scottish Government, it is unlikely that we would be seeing that issue with the prominence it has now in Egypt. Loss and damage is the idea that the world\' s wealthier countries who are often the biggest contributors to pollution and carbon emissions should pay compensation to more vulnerable states impacted by climate change. The idea was championed at the COP26 summit held in Glasgow last year.

She may also fail to attend Cop27 , a significant snub to the Egyptian hosts who are holding a leaders\' summit for heads of state and government as part of the conference. The Egyptian government praised King Charles \- who spoke at the start of the Paris climate summit in 2015, and was an important presence at Cop26 \- as a HYPERLINK champion of the environment A Cop27 spokesperson said:  The Cop president designate is disappointed by these reports [of Charles\' s non-attendance at Cop27 ]. The Egyptian presidency of the climate conference acknowledges the longstanding and strong commitment of His Majesty to the climate cause, and believes that his presence would have been of great added value to the visibility of climate action at this critical moment. We hope that this doesn\' t indicate that the UK is backtracking from the global climate agenda after presiding over Cop26. He added:  His Majesty King Charles was invited as a very special guest to Cop27 . The invitation was extended to His Royal Highness as Prince of Wales, and renewed to His Majesty as King, and he will be most welcomed in Sharm el-Sheikh if he honours us with his presence. The spokesperson also noted Truss was still invited in her capacity as head of the UK government.  All leaders of the state parties to the UNFCCC [United Nations framework convention on climate change] and the Paris agreement are invited to this UN summit. The host country will announce the number of heads of states and governments taking part as we get closer to the Sharm el-Sheikh climate implementation summit, he said.  So far Egypt has received a very encouraging number of confirmations from heads of states and governments, from every region. The Guardian understands some Commonwealth countries are also privately concerned that Truss has prevented the King from attending Cop27 , as he acts as their head of state. Many Commonwealth countries are among the world\' s most vulnerable to the climate crisis. A Downing Street spokesperson said Truss\' s travel plans would not be settled until nearer the date of Cop27 and refused to comment on private conversations between the prime minister and the King. The prospect of British leaders, including King Charles, descending on Sharm el-Sheikh also raised questions about the optics of such a visit while the British activist Alaa Abd El Fattah remains on hunger strike inside an Egyptian prison. Abd El Fattah, a figurehead of Egypt\' s 2011 uprising, has been on hunger strike for 185 days and HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/british-egyptian-hunger-striker-alaa-abd-el-fattah-says-he-may-die-in-prison recently told his family Cop27 .

Truss told parliament when she was foreign secretary last June that  we\' re working very hard to secure his release , but since then has made no further statements on the matter. The case threatens to undermine Egypt\' s efforts to use Cop27 to present a favourable image of the country amid claims it has limited access for civil society and may restrict protests. At a pre- Cop27 Cop27 , called on developed countries to assist poorer countries in tackling the climate crisis. Rich states have a longstanding pledge to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/25/climate-finance-poor-countries-hit-100bn-target-by-2023-says-report provide $100bn (\£389bn) a year to developing countries , to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impact of extreme weather, which has not yet been fulfilled. Shoukry said:  We have not yet delivered on the $100bn pledge, which in itself is more a symbol of trust and reassurance than a remedy to actual climate needs. He added that much of the finance being provided was in the form of loans, which can drive poor countries deeper into debt. He said:  Instruments of finance are still mostly non-concessional loans rather than concessional loans and grants which account for only 6% of climate finance. We must find a way to address this challenge. Without appropriate and fair finance serving as a catalyst, we will all continue to struggle in delivering impactful climate action. The UN secretary general, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, also warned more help was needed for poor countries suffering catastrophic effects from extreme weather. Known as loss and damage, a phrase that refers to impacts too serious for countries to be able to adapt to, the issue is likely to be one of the biggest areas of disagreement at Cop27 .

He could have had three. Liz Truss would no doubt have been free to visit as well. How -great- would that be for the UK? Three prime ministers at once. Why stop there? They could have invited Theresa May. It-s only been three years since she quit No 10 after all. Either way, why wouldn-t it be -great- that Johnson is in attendance in Egypt? We all know he likes a sunny break - he took enough of them. It's also proved a chance to remind the entire world why even the Tories finally saw fit to give the braggart the boot.

It is the latest set of UN climate negotiations which take place every year, and this year is taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, following last year\' s conference, HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cop26 Cop26 , which the UK hosted in HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/glasgow Glasgow . \- What will be discussed? HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/one One of the central issues is that action is needed to cut fossil fuels and the greenhouse gases driving climate change, as we are currently on course for 2.4-2.6C of warming \- which the UN warns would be catastrophic. Developed countries are also under pressure to deliver the levels of finance promised \- and needed \- to help poorer nations adapt to climate change and to invest in clean technology. And a key issue up for debate is addressing loss and damage \- the now unavoidable consequences of climate change such as the destruction of crops, homes and infrastructure, which are being felt worst by vulnerable countries who did least to contribute to the crisis. \- These issues feel familiar. Haven\' t we made any progress since Glasgow? There has been some progress, with countries including Australia bringing in new climate plans, as all countries pledged to at Cop26. But the latest assessments from the UN show climate action plans fall far short of what is needed to limit dangerous climate change, bringing down emissions by only 5-10% by 2030, compared to the 45% cut needed to keep temperatures rises to the 1.5C threshold countries have signed up to. Greenhouse gases continue to rise, and there is no credible pathway in place to meeting the 1.5C goal, the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) warns. Levels of finance for adapting to climate change are also falling far short of what is needed, UN analysis shows, and loss and damage must be addressed. Progress on climate adaptation so far has been too little, too slow. UNEP\' s 2022 https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdaptationGap?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw #AdaptationGap Report highlights the urgency to develop national adaptation plans to help the most vulnerable communities cope with the accelerating impacts of HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateChange?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw #ClimateChange .

Many vulnerable countries and campaigners want an international loss and damage finance facility to help developing countries with the loss and damage they suffer. A  polluter pays principle would require developed countries \- most responsible for the pollution driving climate change \- to pay into the fund. Developed countries have historically been reluctant to agree to such a mechanism, but as the impacts of extreme weather worsen around the world \- most vividly with the devastating floods in Pakistan this year \- the pressure is rising to deliver finance for loss and damage. \- What about the UK? Once Alok Sharma, who presided over the Cop26 talks last year in a neutral chairing role, hands over the gavel to the Egyptian Cop27 presidency, it will be the first time the UK has negotiated at climate talks on its own, rather than as part of the EU. While the UK aims for a global leadership role on climate and is urging action at Cop27 to cut emissions and address loss and damage, the https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/government Government is facing criticism for pushing ahead with new offshore oil and gas licences, late payment to climate funds and gaps in policies to tackle the crisis. The decision the King, a long time campaigner for the environment, should not attend the climate summit, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\' s initial decision to skip the talks before a last-minute U-turn have also prompted criticism. \- How can we negotiate on climate when the world is facing an energy crisis fuelled by Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine? Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine \- while leading to a short term increase in the use of coal \- has prompted an acceleration in countries taking up clean tech, with the International Energy Agency suggesting it could prove to be a historic turning point for the world. But when it comes to the international negotiations on climate, where decisions are made by consensus, it seems inevitable the international dispute provoked by the war will cast a shadow. That will prove another challenge for making progress on the climate crisis, just as the increasingly severe floods, droughts, storms, melting ice and rising seas make it clear that there is no time to lose. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK378","Travel costs mount as COP 27 delegation criticised for 'damaging credibility' of climate change cause; Bill for Ireland's 55-strong team to top (EURO)100,000 wh....","November 27, 2022 Sunday","Mail on Sunday (London)","THE size of the Irish Government's 55-strong delegation to COP27 climate summit in Egypt was criticised as excessive as provisional travel costs of more than (EURO)100,000 began to emerge. Last night - after four weeks of inquiries from the Irish Mail on Sunday - a spokesperson for Environment Minister Eamon Ryan confirmed eight members of his department attended the summit. These included Minister Ryan, his department principal officer Niall McLoughlin, assistant secretary Brian Timothy Carroll, legal advisor Martin Timothy Collins, press advisor Edel Hackett as well as officials Tara Donohoe, Emer Griffin and Stacy Wrenn. Mr Ryan's special advisor, Paul Kenny, was initially on the department's preliminary delegate list, but a spokesperson for the minister said his chief of staff travelled instead. The spokesperson also confirmed flights for Mr Ryan's departmental delegation cost (EURO)12,900. They were unable to provide details of the cost of the group's stay at the five-star Rehana Royal Beach Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, but said these would be made £vailable in due course'. Four weeks ago, a spokesperson for Mr Ryan said they could not provide costings for his flight to the Egyptian resort because his travel arrangements were not finalised. When asked this week if the flights and accommodation arrangements for the minister's delegation were booked well in advance 'to ensure value for money', the department said: 'Arrangements for accommodation for the entire Irish delegation were managed by the Embassy of Ireland in Egypt, which liaised with Global Conference Management. Global Conference Management was appointed by Egypt to manage COP27 logistical issues, including central- ised hotel reservations for foreign delegations. Ireland's original booking enquiry was submitted to Global Conference Management last April and the booking was confirmed for the delegation in July.' However, figures now emerging from departments and State agencies indicate each travelling member of the Irish delegation is likely to have incurred travel and accommodation costs of between (EURO)1,500 and (EURO)3,000 each. Initial figures, which do not include subsistence and other allowances, were released in a Parliamentary Question (PQ) to Independent TD Carol Nolan this week. The Laois-Offaly TD said the scale of the State delegation to the COP27 summit has 'damaged the credibility' of the climate change case. And she said the event 'has turned into the climate version of the Eurovision, with fixed voting and predetermined outcomes'. The figures provided to Deputy Nolan confirm no fewer than seven Government departments sent delegates to Egypt. These included 11 from the Department of Environment, two from the Department of Finance, 10 from the Department of Foreign Affairs, two from the Department of Housing, one from the Department of Agriculture and two from the Department of Health. Six delegates from the Department of the Taoiseach also travelled, including Taoiseach, Miche\'e1l Martin and the Government Press Secretary, Paul Clarkson. The Taoiseach's two-day visit cost (EURO)4,441 in flight and vaccinations for those travelling, but hotel costs have not yet been calculated. However, the only department to have finalised its full travel costs so far is the Department of Agriculture, which sent one person - an agricultural inspector - to Sharm el- Sheik. Flights and accommodation for this individual cost (EURO)2,800. Nine of the 55-strong Irish delegation were already present as embassy staff in Cairo, meaning 46 officials, Government ministers and advisors ultimately travelled from Ireland. Provisionally, this will have cost between (EURO)70,000 and (EURO)126,000 in flights and accommodation, based on the figures now emerging. Despite repeated questions from the MoS in recent weeks, the Department of Environment has not released any information about costs, airlines and hotels used -- or whether or not flights and accommodation were booked well in advance to ensure value for money. In contrast, the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) - which is funded by the Department of the Environment - was able to provide a full breakdown of hotels, flights and booking arrangements. The CCAC was one of five Statefunded bodies that also formed part of the Irish delegation. Other such bodies included the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Youth Council and Met \'c9ireann. In response to queries from the MoS, the CCAC confirmed four of its officials travelled to Sharm el- Sheik. These are Marie Donnelly, Cara Augustenborg, George Hussey and Claire Camilleri. A fifth, Professor Morgan Bazilian, had to pull out, incurring a cancellation fee for accommodation of (EURO)200. These flights and hotel accommodation - at the five-star Rehana Royal Beach Resort in Sharm el-Sheik and during stopovers at Gatwick - cost (EURO)6,142. According to a breakdown of these costs, flights from Gatwick to Egypt cost between (EURO)618 and (EURO)714 each, with hotel stays in Sharm el-Sheik costing (EURO)784 to (EURO)941 each. The EPA - which is also funded by the Department of the Environment - sent four officials - Katherine Dooley, Frank McGovern, Conor Quinlan and Mary Francis Rochford - spending (EURO)3,298 on flights. 'As Chief Climate Scientist, the EPA's Frank McGovern spent the two weeks at COP27 ,' a spokesperson confirmed. 'Frank was involved in meetings and negotiations in areas of Climate Science on behalf of Ireland and the EU delegation, focusing in particular on the topics of the Global Stock Take and Periodic Review. Frank McGovern was supported in this work by his team member Katherine Dooley, Climate Scientist.' The EPA team also stayed at the Rehana Royal Beach Resort and it is expecting costs of approximately (EURO)150 a night per person. 'To achieve best value, accommothese dation was arranged as part of the Irish delegation group booking made through the Department of Foreign Affairs via Department of Environment Climate Change and Communications with costs to be recouped from the EPA,' a spokesperson added. In response to Ms Nolan's queries, Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien confirmed two Met \'c9ireann staff from his department attended COP27 . 'The costs incurred from this travel to date, is approximately (EURO)4,320 in respect of flights, hotels, transfers,' he said. 'Given that the conference has finished just recently, it is expected costs will increase slightly when the officials input their respective travel and subsistence claims.' Minister of State Colm Brophy confirmed 10 officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs travelled from Ireland at different times over the two weeks of the conference, while nine members of the staff of the Embassy in Cairo, including the Ambassador, attended all or part of the summit. 'While the total costs relating to official participation in COP27 have not been fully compiled, I can confirm that the costs for travel from Ireland by Ministers and officials representing the Department of Foreign Affairs amounted to (EURO)10,343,' he said. Neither the Department of Finance nor the Department of Health have yet compiled their final costs. A Finance spokesperson said: 'All travel undertaken by DF officials is undertaken in accordance with the prevailing guidelines and this travel is funded by the Department which is the normal practice for international travel.'

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK380","Gas producers using Cop27 to rebrand gas as transitional fuel, experts warn","November 11, 2022 Friday 7:00 AM GMT","The Guardian (London)","Gas producers and their financial backers see Cop27 as an opportunity for discussions about rebranding natural gas as a transition fuel rather than a fossil fuel, experts have said. The push is coming from the host Egypt and its gas-producing allies amid a global energy crisis compounded by Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine.  The opportunity for this Cop is to have the discussion openly that natural gas, and in particular when combined with carbon capture, is a scalable energy solution allowing us to meet the needs of 8 billion people while still meeting our climate goals, said Craig Golinowsky, of Carbon Infrastructure Partners, a Canadian private equity fund backing projects related to fossil fuels as well as carbon capture. Environmental experts caution that burning gas, a fossil fuel, risks increasing warming far beyond the target restriction of 1.5C required to prevent major environmental disruption. Gas is less polluting to the climate than coal, but its production involves harmful methane, and leaks from infrastructure can cause large-scale pollution. In addition, experts such as the Washington DC-based Environmental Working Group HYPERLINK https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/confronting-myth-carbon-free-fossil-fuels-why-carbon-capture-not-climate warn that carbon capture risks delaying the essential transition away from fossil fuels, calling it a licence for the fossil fuel industry to keep polluting.  Natural gas is really the only proven way to lower emissions at scale. If we don\' t have enough energy, we get more emissions, Golinowsky said, suggesting a theory that a shortage of natural gas automatically involves increasing usage of coal rather than renewable energy sources, as many advocate.  I think the binary framing of oil and gas as bad, wind and solar as good is really a disaster, he added. Golinowsky is not planning to attend Cop27 but will be keeping a close eye on the discussions. In particular, he said he would rely on members of the German natural gas industry and their lobbyists to advocate  for a larger global gas market , as Germany represents the centre of a European energy crisis sparked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February. In the year since Cop26 in Glasgow, which included the launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, intended to  deliver a managed and just transition away from oil and gas production , Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow\' s decision to halt natural gas supplies to Europe have prompted a marked shift in global attitudes towards natural gas, laying the ground for discussions at Cop27 between world leaders and gas producers about whether gas should be viewed as a transition fuel and not a fossil fuel.  I think what we see right now, because of Russia, is that we are still going to need gas for some or whole part of this transition \- no one\' s naive enough to think you can turn off all gas usage tomorrow and we\' re going to be fine, said Nazmeera Moola, the chief sustainability officer at the South African investment firm Ninety One.  Then you add in the high price of gas at the moment, and it certainly starts to look attractive. Moola said the hunt to replace Russia\' s vast gas supply to Europe was likely to influence discussions about exploring new gas reserves across Africa, despite calls to resist this in favour of meeting emissions targets, calling this shift  a new view on exploiting African gas reserves. Asked whether this would influence discussions between the major gas producers, policymakers and diplomats gathered at Cop27 , she said:  Will that conversation happen inside meetings? Sure. Vikram Singh, of the sustainable energy nonprofit the Rocky Mountain Institute, said:  It\' s all due to the Ukraine crisis, I think we can thank Putin for that. This is Putin\' s energy\' s crisis, but the global north had a real chance to respond by using the opportunity to promote renewables as they adapt their own economies \- but what we see is easy answers like Germany firing up coal plants and searching for new gas on the African continent.  We know there is pressure being applied, not only by big oil and gas companies, but certain high-level delegations from the Middle East present at this year\' s Cop. Singh said oil and gas producers were guilty of what he called  doublespeak, on the issue of the energy transition, with public statements rarely matching their private actions.  We were very hopeful at Cop26 to see oil and gas companies there participating. To give them credit, during recent panels we\' ve participated in, oil and gas companies are saying the right things about [the energy] transition, he said.  But behind closed doors, they\' re still pushing a very dangerous product, one that in the short term is too rich for them to give up, so we find a double game at play here, and as many climate negotiations take place behind closed doors, we\' re trying to shine a light on countries taking positions on issues like gas. Egypt\' s goal to become a major natural gas exporter could also prove a boon to natural gas lobbyists and advocates attending the conference. At Cop26, fossil fuel lobbyists HYPERLINK https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/hundreds-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-flooding-cop26-climate-talks/ numbered 503 representatives Cop27 . Egypt hosted a meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum shortly before Cop27 began, including representatives from the Cop28 host, the United Arab Emirates. Ministers declared after the meeting that  Cop27 and Cop28 present a great opportunity to make a case for gas in the energy transition , while the Cop27 president, Sameh Shoukry, recently HYPERLINK https://apnews.com/article/climate-politics-africa-sameh-shoukry-ef68f280f3fadcbb337f673ee55a2762?utm_campaign=Daily%20Briefing&utm_content=20220524&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter called natural gas  a transitional source of energy .

In an email from March this year, provided to the Guardian via a freedom of information request made by the group Culture Unstained, the British ambassador to Cairo, Gareth Bailey, discussed BP\' s plans around renewable energy sources versus natural gas with a colleague from the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office in London.  BP Egypt  was friendly but low-key about BP plans in green energy. They said they had their hands full with gas, so were unlikely to be doing much, he said. Representatives from countries most vulnerable to climate change were horrified by the potential push to promote natural gas at Cop27 .  Anyone who\' s read an IPCC or IEA report, or even their own energy bill for this winter, should know that investing in gas is the wrong choice. It\' s the epitome of short-term gains for long-term losses. Renewables are already the frontrunner \- that is the smart, clean, cheap investment today, said John Silk, of the Marshall Islands, whose territory risks being partially submerged by rising oceans as soon as 2035. \"

The conference made headlines last month when PM Rishi Sunak announced that he would not attend, and would stay in the UK to focus on national issues. The decision was heavily criticised by environmental groups and members of his own party, eventually causing Mr Sunak to u-turn on his announcement, and he has joined other world leaders in Egypt. His attendance at the gathering in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh alongside leaders such as US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron marks his first outing on the international stage since becoming Prime Minister last month. This will also be the first time the UK will negotiate at climate talks on its own, rather than as part of the EU. READ MORE: 'Super fit' man, 20, died 'out of the blue' 4,000 miles from home Here's everything you need to know: What is Cop27 It's a climate conference that takes place every year, organised by the UN. This year it's taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, following last year's conference, Cop26, which the UK hosted in Glasgow. Cop stands for Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. What will be discussed The central issue at the conference is that action is needed to cut fossil fuels and the greenhouse gases driving climate change, as we are currently on course for 2.4-2.6C of warming - which the UN warns would be catastrophic. The UK and other developed nations are also expected to deliver money and support to help poorer nations adapt and invest in clean energy resources. Another key issue up for debate is addressing loss and damage - the now unavoidable consequences of climate change such as the destruction of crops, homes and infrastructure, which are being felt worst by vulnerable countries who did least to contribute to the crisis. What is the UK expected to promise The UK aims for a global leadership role on the climate crisis, and is urging action at Cop27 to cut emissions and address loss and damage. However, the Government is facing criticism for pushing ahead with new offshore oil and gas licences, late payment to climate funds and gaps in policies to tackle the crisis. Downing Street said the Prime Minister will be looking to set the seal on last year's Cop26 summit in Glasgow with more than \£3200 million in UK funding to protect forests and invest in ""green"" technologies. Sunak will announce a further \£365.5 million for the clean energy innovation facility which provides grants to researchers and scientists in developing countries working on clean technologies - from biomass-powered refrigeration in India to lithium-ion batteries in Nigeria. Has anything changed since last year At Cop26 all nations pledged to bring in new climate plans, and some, including Australia, have stuck to that pledge. But the latest assessments from the UN show climate action plans fall far short of what is needed to limit dangerous climate change. Scientists have shown that emissions need to be cut by 45% in order to keep temperatures rises to the 1.5C threshold, but the latest assessments show the plans only cut emissions by around 5-10%. Greenhouse gases continue to rise, and there is no credible pathway in place to meeting the 1.5C goal, the UN Environmental Programme UNEP warns. What can be done to help those who are suffering the most Campaigners want an international loss and damage fund to be established to help developing countries with the loss and damage they suffer. This would involve the developed nations that are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions, usually disproportionate to their size, to pay into the fund. Developed countries have historically been reluctant to agree to this set-up, but as the impacts of extreme weather worsen around the world - most vividly with the devastating floods in Pakistan this year - the pressure is rising to deliver finance for loss and damage. How can we negotiate on climate when the world is facing an energy crisis fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine The war in Ukraine did lead to a short-term increase in the use of coal around the world, as sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion meant many nations who usually relied on Russia for gas and oil could not use it. However, in the long-term this has prompted an acceleration in countries taking up clean tech, with the International Energy Agency suggesting it could prove to be a historic turning point for the world. The invasion will prove another challenge for making progress on the climate crisis, because decisions at Cop27 are made by consensus so an international dispute will impact that, just as the increasingly severe floods, droughts, storms, melting ice and rising seas make it clear that there is no time to lose.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK382","Estonian media: Border security, COP27, Ukraine","Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring","BBC Monitoring Europe - Political ","By BBC Monitoring The importance of border security, Estonia's expectations from the COP27 climate change conference and a plan on Ukraine's Nato integration were among the main topics discussed by Estonian media on 1-7 November. Defence Estonia's border is its first line of defence and now more than ever in the 31 years since the restoration of independence requires close attention, President Alar Karis said at a ceremony to mark the centennial of the founding of the Estonian border guard. The president praised the modern-day border guard for their professionalism and efficiency. ""Estonia remaining open to those who come here legally, and closed to those who do not have the right to do so, or who are a threat to our security,"" Karis said. ""We already know that Russia is ready to use migration pressure against the EU and Nato states, similar to the hybrid attack initiated by Belarus against Poland, Lithuania and Latvia,"" he went on. The Estonian state has already strengthened its border control in response to the heightened threat which followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the president noted, while strengthening situational awareness at the border, the rapid construction of border infrastructure and cooperation and information exchange with neighbouring countries remain crucial. (Postimees, in Estonian, 1 Nov 22) Estonia has no alternative but to invest more in those people who uphold the law and order in the country, namely police officers and border guards. Speaking at an event marking the anniversary of the foundation of the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA), President Karis said: ""If we want Estonia to be a peaceful place, where a sense of security is not at the top of the list of people's concerns, then we cannot purchase all of that on the cheap."" That PPA officers are often in the frontline of internal security is often overlooked or taken for granted, something which must not happen so as to avoid burnout and other undesirable outcomes, especially given the crises which have followed one after another. Estonian society will remain healthy in the current cluster of crises only if citizens and residents maintain trust not only in each other, but also in the state and its institutions, a role which the PPA is indispensable in, the president said. (Postimees, in Estonian, 5 Nov 22) Vessels from the Standing Nato Mine Countermeasures Group One (SNMCMG1) put into port in Tallinn on 5 November. The group is currently commanded by an Estonian Navy officer, commander Ott Laanemets. ""Since Estonia's period of command lasts a whole year, but we ourselves no longer have a vessel of the dimensions of a staff ship, we asked for help from our friends in Latvia, and in the second half of the year, from Germany. It has been quite common within Nato in recent years for all cooperation to be increasingly international,"" Laanemets said in an interview to the ETV news show. Part of the naval component of Nato's rapid reaction forces was mobilised following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, though the SNMCMG1 is not tasked with responding to Russian naval manoeuvres, this is carried out by friendly powers' navies from nearby states, Nato frigates and destroyers. (ERR, in Estonian, 5 Nov 22) Climate conference Estonia goes into the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with the message that decisions to increase use of fossil fuels in response to the energy crisis must only be temporary, according to Minister of the Environment Madis Kallas (SDE). Estonia's main expectations at the COP27 climate change conference are linked to the European Union's approach that, against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe, climate targets should still not be forgotten, Kallas told ERR. According to Kallas, there is a fear amongst some sections of society that climate targets could be abandoned, however there is no reason for this to be the case. "" COP27 should reaffirm and maintain the focus of COP26,"" Kallas said, adding that it was important for Europe to find willing partners among developing countries. (ERR, in Estonian, 1 Nov 22) At the end of the week, world leaders will meet in Egypt to determine how to adapt to a changing climate and mitigate climate change. Estonia should decide to invest in climate competence, develop climate adaptation plan and ""climate services,"" Piia Post, associate professor of meteorology and climatology at the University of Tartu, told the ERR public broadcaster's morning radio show. At the end of October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations released a new report. Despite countries' efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the analyses showed that this will not be enough to restrict global temperature rise to the desired extent. Post said that climate change is already here, which means we have to adapt to it. ""Climate models allow us to look not only at the current climate, but also to the future, based on scientific knowledge,"" she said. In Estonia, however, climate adaptation is rarely discussed, and there is no climate adaptation plan. ""There is a general plan, but there is no answer when asked what the priorities are."" Post said that it is also essential to increase general climate competence. This entails the knowledge, attitudes and abilities of individuals to address complex challenges such as climate change, war and pandemics. ""It is evident that Estonian population is unprepared. We expect others, who deal with these problems, to have an understanding of them,"" she explained, ""The topics like that cannot be fully delegated."" (ERR, in Estonian, 2 Nov 22) Estonia wants recent targets upheld and the switch to renewable energy stepped up at the COP27 climate change conference. EU member states have decided to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. It was agreed at the previous climate conference in Glasgow that other countries will also review their long-term climate plans and adopt more ambitious goals. But this has not strictly happened, Kaja Tael, Estonia's special envoy for climate and energy policy, said. ""The European Union has adopted very ambitious goals for 2030. They are not easy on Estonia either, while our story can serve as a ray of hope. We have been greatly dependent on fossil fuels, while we have been gradually weaning ourselves off them and our long-term goals have not changed,"" Tael said. This year is made more complicated by Russia's war and soaring energy prices that could force climate goals to take a back seat. The important thing is to stick to what we have achieved, which is Estonia's main goal for the talks, Minister of the Environment Madis Kallas (SDE) said. ""Our aim is to avoid going back on recent climate ambitions. Secondly, for Europe and other states to support a faster switch to renewables both in words and action, whether it is solar or wind power. That is our priority at the climate summit,"" Estonia's environment minister said. (ERR, in Estonian, 7 Nov 22) Ukraine Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu presented Estonia's action plan for closer Nato-Ukraine relations to the government. The document brings together principles and proposals for continuing to provide comprehensive support to Ukraine and contributing to closer Nato-Ukraine relations. Reinsalu said Ukraine needs long-term support in fighting Russia's war of aggression and integrating into Euro-Atlantic structures. ""Ukraine is fighting for Europe's security and the values we cherish. The support we, the Allies, and the entire Alliance provide to Ukraine helps counter the threat Russia poses,"" the foreign minister stressed. For Estonia, it is equally important to integrate Ukraine gradually into potential Nato cooperation formats through practical cooperation, the ministry said in a statement.

When it comes to the UK\' s reputation on climate action, it seems the country ousted Liz Truss just in time. Its shortest-serving prime minister made no secret of her distaste for the green agenda, promising to ramp up oil and gas production, kick-start fracking and restrict solar development  and, of course, banning King Charles III from attending COP27 . Rishi Sunak did his climate credentials no favours by saying initially that he\' d sit the summit out  a move that would have been very damaging to the green national brand the UK nurtured around last year\' s COP26 in Glasgow. After a domestic outcry, Sunak reversed course  and, as I write below, delivered a speech that served as an implicit rebuke to the Trussite, fossil fuel-boosting wing of his party. That was part of a day of national leaders\' speeches that has set the tone for everything else happening here over the next 10 days. We\' ll have to wait until later in the week for the appearance of Joe Biden, who has been detained in the US by the small matter of today\' s midterm congressional elections. The outcome of these will have powerful implications for the energy transition in the US and beyond  you\' ll find our take on the early results tomorrow.

Greta Thunberg said she\' s ready  HYPERLINK to hand over the megaphone COP27 , also voiced disgust at  things world leaders and heads of state have said when the microphone is off .\~ The key takeaways from yesterday\' s speeches In the run-up to COP27 , I found myself anticipating  and quietly hoping for  a markedly more assertive approach from the developing nations that have borne the brunt of climate change amid repeated broken promises of assistance from rich countries. Judging by yesterday\' s statements, a good number of Global South leaders have run out of patience  and are no longer making much effort to be polite about it. The focus yesterday at COP27 was a series of speeches by national leaders, setting out the positions from which their delegates will negotiate in the coming days. At this African COP, some of the most powerful interventions were made by leaders from that continent against a backdrop of devastating drought in its east and deadly floods in the west and centre.  Africans should not pay for crimes they have not committed, said Faustin-Archange Touad\'e9ra, president of the Central African Republic  which, like other countries in its region, has suffered severe flooding this year.  We should say clearly the rich countries  the top polluters  are the ones who are most to blame for endangering humanity. Another strongly worded address came from Kenyan president William Ruto, who attacked the  cruel and unjust . . . stalling, delaying tactics and procrastination undertaken by rich countries at previous COPs. He went on to condemn their  egregious and unexplained default on promises of climate assistance  deploying the language of delinquent debt that has been used so often in relation to struggling African economies. The most glaring example of the failure he described is the promise made by developed countries, at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, to mobilise $100bn of annual climate assistance for developing nations by 2020. Two years on, they remain well short of meeting that promise. Macky Sall, president of Senegal and chair of the African Union, said it was time for the rich nations that bear disproportionate blame for the climate crisis not just to meet that pledge, but to double it to $200bn. At the same time, however, Sall stressed that African nations would not tolerate  decisions that jeopardise our development . This reflected concerns that the global push to phase out fossil fuels could slow Africa\' s energy expansion, as HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/1e8c12fe-4823-41a1-8069-b6150876427d expertly covered by our colleague David Pilling. Fears about energy security have gone global this year amid the turmoil sparked by Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine. Some politicians have seized the moment to call for a slow-pedalling on the energy transition, or (see above) an expansion of domestic fossil fuel production. This may have emboldened Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, to make a rather defiant-sounding contribution to proceedings, pledging that the UAE would continue pumping out oil and gas  for as long as the world is in need . But it was striking to see the leaders of Europe\' s biggest economies, in a move that may or may not have been co-ordinated, dismiss the idea that the absent Russian president Vladimir Putin will slow down the energy transition.  We will not sacrifice our commitments to the climate due to the Russian threat, France\' s Emmanuel Macron vowed. Germany\' s Olaf Scholz urged:  There must not be a worldwide renaissance of fossil fuels . . . And for Germany I can say: there will not be one. The UK\' s Rishi Sunak, in marked contrast with his shortlived predecessor, said that Putin\' s war and consequent rising energy prices  are not a reason to go slow on climate change. They are a reason to act faster . Bold words all round then. But the real action  including, almost certainly, some fiery disagreements  will happen in the coming days, after the government leaders have left the stage. (Simon Mundy) Quote of the day\~  How do companies make $200bn in profits in the last three months and not expect to contribute at least 10 cents in every dollar of profit to a loss and damage fund. This is what our people expect. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, urged oil and gas companies to use part of their soaring profits to assist countries hit by climate disasters. Beyond COP27 : \~Japan scraps new carbon tax, focuses on green bonds Surging energy costs this year have torpedoed another climate initiative  this time in Japan. Prime minister Fumio Kishida\' s government has scrapped a carbon emissions surcharge that was expected to be in the fiscal 2023 tax reform package, HYPERLINK https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Environment/Climate-Change/Japan-shelves-carbon-tax-as-energy-prices-soar our colleagues at Nikkei have reported . The government feared another tax on businesses and consumers would be too painful in this economic environment.  Raising taxes that will immediately increase the burden will not be an option, a source from the ruling coalition told Nikkei. Instead, Japan is planning to issue $136bn of green bonds financed with funds from a carbon-pricing programme. Japan HYPERLINK https://www.env.go.jp/content/900453366.pdf already has a tax for climate change mitigation, started in 2012. Also, Kishida has announced a plan to deploy \£5150tn ($1.1tn) over the next decade to hit Japan\' s net zero emissions 2050 target with an interim goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 46 per cent by 2030. By scrapping the emissions surcharge, Kishida is putting a lot of hope for cutting carbon on Japan\' s green bonds.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK384","Russia-Ukraine conflict brings African gas into focus at COP27","November 11, 2022","Africa Oil & Gas Monitor Today","Europe's urgent need for fuel has made African gas a key topic of discussion, even as some observers push African countries to ignore gas completely in favour of renewables WHAT: Africa's gas reserves have drawn much more attention at COP27 than at the last international climate summit. WHAT NEXT: The discussions at COP27 are not likely to settle the gas vs. renewables debate. The geopolitical scene has changed dramatically over the last year, largely due to the disruptions and realignments that have resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One of the attendees at the COP27 international climate conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, marked the shift earlier this week by noting that even the premises of the ongoing discussions about the coming energy transition had changed. The talks are now taking demand for natural gas and other fossil fuels into account rather than focusing narrowly on renewable energy, he was quoted as saying by Devex. ""Last year [at COP26], no one dared to [talk] about fossil fuel or natural gas. The position has changed. Because there is a war in Europe, the [mood] has changed,"" said Papa Samba Ba, a technical advisor with Senegal's Ministry of Petroleum and Energies. He went on to say that global energy policies should take the African continent's needs into consideration rather than focusing solely on the requirements of Western countries. It is perhaps no accident that the person who made this point is an African - and, for that matter, the citizen of an African country that is slated to become a supplier of LNG to Europe once it commences gas production. The country's first commercial gas project, Greater Tortue/Ahmeyim (GTA), is slated to come on stream next year and will deliver most of its production to European buyers in the form of LNG. European eyes on African gas Senegal is hardly the only African country that has been courted by European countries eager to find new suppliers to replace the Russian oil and gas they have stopped receiving since the outbreak of war in late February. Since that time, the EU has said it intends to work toward a complete ban on Russian crude oil and petroleum product imports, with some limited exceptions. It has not imposed limits of this type on gas imports, but Russia can no longer be relied upon to deliver gas in the expected quantities at the expected times. Instead, unexpected interruptions and pipeline stoppages have become commonplace. It is no wonder, then, that European gas buyers have turned to other suppliers - including African suppliers. Italy's Eni, for example, has sought to ramp up the volume of gas it imports from its existing sources in Algeria, Egypt and Angola. It has also fast-tracked plans to launch an LNG export programme offshore the Republic of Congo and is working to keep its Coral South LNG project on schedule offshore Mozambique. Germany's government, meanwhile, has pursued closer bilateral ties with future gas-producing states such as Senegal and South Africa in the hope of securing fuel supplies and diversifying its own energy mix. Benefits for Africa Europe's urgent need to diversify its gas supply ahead of the rapidly approaching winter has had some benefits for Africa. It has attracted more investment to the African gas sector and led international oil companies (IOCs) to push forward with a number of upstream and LNG projects that might otherwise have languished. So far, however, the benefits have accrued mostly in relation to Africa's position as a supplier of raw materials and commodities to other regions of the world and not so much in relation to Africa's ability to meet its own demand for fuel. This has irked local stakeholders such as the African Energy Chamber (AEC), a trade association that has repeatedly urged the continent to use its own hydrocarbon resources as a means of alleviating energy poverty. It has also spurred debates between COP27 attendees and other observers over whether African countries should maximise their use of gas, which has the lowest emissions intensity of any fossil fuel, as a bridge fuel on the path toward transition, or shun gas in favour of solar, wind or other renewables. Former US Vice President Al Gore, for instance, urged Africa to reject offers to invest in its gas reserves, saying that this approach would have ruinous long-term consequences. ""We must see the so-called dash for gas for what it really is: a dash down a bridge to nowhere, leaving the countries of the world facing climate chaos and billions in stranded assets, especially here in Africa,"" he said during his opening speech at COP27 . She also pointed out that Western critics of African gas projects had not offered adequate concrete support for alternative solutions. ""If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation. But I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,"" she remarked. No definitive conclusions Given that this is a subject of an ongoing debate, it seems unlikely that any definitive conclusion will be reached before COP27 draws to a close on November 18. Instead, African governments and IOCs will continue to announce, as they have been doing since the start of November, the roll-out of new green hydrogen projects, while some African officials and African observers will continue to make a case for hydrocarbons, as they have been doing all along. Meanwhile, European gas buyers and European oil companies will also continue discussing investments in African gas projects - again, as they have been doing at least since the outbreak of war in Ukraine.

I would like the prime minister to go to HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/red-box-is-truss-bailing-on-cop27-another-sign-of-climate-policy-shift-0cj50qx7z Cop27 . It would cement the leadership position that the UK has on this incredibly important world issue, he said. Speaking from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he added:  This is absolutely an issue that transcends politics. I mean, this is ultimately about ensuring that we protect our planet for future generations. Moreover, Sharma said that he hoped there would be a rethink on the King\' s presence at the environmental meeting.  I would certainly welcome the king\' s attendance at Cop27 . I know that many people around the world see him as a leader in this area, he said. HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cop26-could-lose-all-credibility-if-nations-dont-do-better-for-the-planet-x3gsbjlmr Patricia Espinosa , who was the UN\' s climate chief for six years until she stepped down in July.  It is really a moment when we should be seeing unity of purpose, the former Mexican diplomat said. She added that she was concerned the Cop27 summit would suffer from a lack of heads of state attending. Espinosa said that countries were failing to deliver on the promises they made in Glasgow last November. She said that progress is  very clearly, not good , particularly when it came to a commitment of greater ambition to curb emissions. Cop26 was attended by world leaders from HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/joe-biden?page=1 President Biden to India\' s prime minister, HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/narendra-modi?page=1 Narendra Modi . Nearly 200 countries committed to upgrading their emissions plan in 2022, to put the world back on track for the 1.5C climate goal it set under the Paris Agreement. However, international climate negotiations have since suffered from political attention being diverted by the invasion of Ukraine. Espinosa said that she did not expect to see a big change in the 2.4C trajectory that the world is currently headed towards, a level that scientists say would have catastrophic impacts from floods to fires. She said that the small number of upgraded emissions plans this year was unfortunate, and noted that key G20 members such as Mexico were still yet to submit one. HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/alok-sharma-in-the-running-for-un-global-climate-chief-role-tzx827bbx Sharma said that more needed to be done.  The report card since HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/cop26?page=1 Cop26 is that we made some progress, but not enough. We need to go further and faster, he said. Despite concerns over Cop27 \' s lower profile, Espinosa said that it was  difficult to ignore an existential threat . She said that extreme weather this summer had seen  unprecedented and biblical disasters, such as the Pakistan floods, which were linked by scientists to climate change. Next month\' s summit in Egypt should feature a serious discussion about compensation from rich countries to poorer ones, an idea known as  loss and damage , she added. Asked about fears that the UK would water down its legal commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, Espinosa said:  I would say to everybody, we need to get to net zero by 2050. Otherwise, we are going to be responsible for a terrible disaster. A spokesperson for the prime minister said:  We have a proud record when it comes to Cop and we are forging ahead with our plans for net zero. \"

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK392","Here's my number, so call me, maybe: Moment Rishi Sunak is handed handwritten note by Swedish counterpart as PM makes his debut on the world stage at Cop27 - in....","November 7, 2022 Monday 11:55 AM GMT","MailOnline","Rishi Sunak was given a personal welcome by his Swedish counterpart today as he made his international debut as Prime Minister. Ulf Kristersson went old school and wrote down his contact details for Mr Sunak as they met at the Cop27 In an awkward image from Sharm El Sheikh the Scandinavian leader bent down in front of Mr Sunak to scribble on a piece of paper. The PM is attending the gathering of world leaders by the Red Sea after reversing a decision to stay away to focus on domestic economic problems. But as well as meetings with Mr Kristersson and EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen he also took part on a perhaps more controversial bilaterial meeting. He held a face-to-face discussion with Italy's new far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The pair chatted about house building and planning while journalists were in the room at the start of the bilateral meeting. Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy party leads the country's first far-right-led government since the Second World War. He faces further tough meetings today, including with Emmanuel Macron. The Prime Minister and French President are due to meet this afternoon at the Cop-27 climate summit in Egypt after the PM vowed to 'get a grip' on the Channel migrant crisis. As well as tackling climate change, the Ukraine war and energy crisis are also likely to feature in the two leaders' talks. The pair smiled and thanked the media at the start of the meeting. The Cop27 As the meeting kicked off in Sharm El-Sheikh there was yet another warning from UN experts that efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C and avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change was 'barely within reach'. The past eight years are on track to be the hottest on record, with sea level rise accelerating, the melting of Europe's Alpine glaciers shattering records, and devastating floods, drought and heatwaves hitting in 2022. Cop27 Sir Keir Starmer has hit out at Rishi Sunak over his initial decision not to attend Cop27 in Egypt, promising that a Labour prime minister would work to 'pull leaders together' on climate change. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Imperial College London, the Labour leader said: 'The first difference a Labour government would make is that you would have a prime minister who wanted to go to Cop because we realise just how important it is, because we realise that is not just about climate, it is also about the cost of living, it is about energy, it is about the next generation of jobs. 'You would have a prime minister, a Labour prime minister, on the world stage, pulling leaders together. I think Rishi Sunak made a big mistake in saying initially he wouldn't go, because it gave the impression that the UK no longer wants to be leading on the global stage. 'I think that is a mistake for our country, it is a mistake globally and I think it is a mistake for the climate crisis, which we have got to handle.' Rishi Sunak joined the COP27 summit today urging a 'global mission for clean growth' - but is facing a growing row about 'reparations' to states hit by climate change. The PM is in Egypt for the gathering - his first test on the foreign stage since entering No10 - having U-turned on his original decision not to attend. But the event is promising to be tricky as developing countries demand payouts for extreme weather events caused by climate change - at the same time as the UK imposes swingeing austerity and tax rises at home. Nicola Sturgeon - who has also jetted in for the summit - upped the pressure this morning, saying there is an 'obligation' on countries that industrialised first to help 'deal with the impacts'. However, former PM Boris Johnson told a fringe event that Britain 'simply doesn't have the financial resources' to pay reparations and 'no country does'. While admitting that the UK had contributed vast carbon emissions, he argued that the focus should be on finding private investment and technological solutions. 'Let's look to the future,' he added. Mr Sunak could have an awkward encounter with his predecessor later, although the premier insisted there is 'no hatchet to be buried'. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK393","Africa Leads on Energy Reform, Sparking Green Power Surge Ahead of COP27","July 27, 2022 Wednesday","M2 PressWIRE","July 27, 2022 DAKAR, Senegal -- This September, the African continent's key power stakeholders will convene at the world-renowned CICAD venue in Dakar for the MSGBC Oil, Gas Power Conference 2022. Yet despite titular appearances, programming for pivotal event remains strongly rooted in Africa's energy transition, complemented by elements of local content, economic diversification and universal access to power. A mere three months later, the continent's heads of state will converge in Egypt for COP27 , knowing their respective nations will be in the spotlight and that commitments from last year's COP26 still only limit warming to 2.4 degrees, providing a 5% loss per annum to these African nations' GDPs. Thus, as we approach the business end of this pivotal year, here is what you need to know about Africa's keystone position and leadership in the global energy transition and the transformational effect this shift is having on the continent. First, we look to investment- the ultimate differentiator in climate action and Africa's historical stumbling block in development, yet now a well of fresh innovation. To date, the continent continues to attract a mere 3% of global private sector climate finance and yet the African Development Bank estimates that African countries' nationally determined contributions towards mitigating climate change demand over $ 3 trillion investment by 2030. How is this to be achieved? Through local incentivization coupled with globalization. In 2020, Senegal dropped all VAT on solar panels and associated technologies. The following year its solar adoption peaked, seeing it pass a 1/3 renewables share in its power grid. Last year, Mauritania signed two MoU's with global transitional power megafirms Chariot and CWP. In doing so it unlocked some $ 43.5 billion in foreign direct investment creating 40GW of renewable energy. And with Senegalese President H.E. Macky Sall holding the title of President of the African Union this year, foreign heads of state are flocking to West Africa. In attracting global financiers from across Africa, Europe, Asia, America, Australia and the Middle East, MSGBC 2022 has the power to turbocharge the MSGBC basin and African continent's green energy financing for adoption ahead of COP27 . Next, we look to energy access- an area wherein a robust green recovery and transition has allowed every one of the MSGBC basin's nations to commit to 2025 or 2030 universal electrification goals, raising billions of dollars of public capital to the cause. Herein diversification is the key: gas supporting a power backbone while complemented by a more variable yet ever-increasing solar and wind power share. Next year, Senegal expects $ 9 billion in gas developments to come online, generating up to 840MW power generation potential. Solar and wind potential each stand in the hundreds of gigawatts. MSGBC 2022 will feature several highly anticipated sessions tracking the region's key energy transition innovators and megaprojects to this end, providing not only financing opportunities but strategic insight into the field with speakers from the basin's ministries and heads of state prominently featured. Last but by no means least, along with world-class natural resource reserves and savvy investment strategies, Africa's energy transition advantage derives from simple political will. Glasgow's COP26 agreed on a $ 100 billion global annual climate finance target, $ 20 billion higher than that currently being achieved. Yet African negotiators called for a target of $ 700 billion, recognizing the need for urgent action. For perspective, the humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic saw some $ 25 billion raised globally in aid of control and curve-flattening. Renewables already are the main source of electricity for almost half of Africa, and as a result, the continent which holds 17% of the world population creates only 4% of global emissions. The fact is, renewables generate better returns for communities and economies and the African continent recognizes this uniquely, striving for ambitious adoption targets ahead of the SDGs and springboarding green development with a glocal model. According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa, investment in green sectors, chiefly energy but also climate-smart agriculture and eco-tourism, produces 420% better returns in gross value addition and 250% better returns in job creation than investment in fossil fuels. The numbers speak for themselves, and as H.E. Macky Sall, who will provide MSGBC 2022's opening address, frequently remarks: ""Africa is a field which cannot be the feast of others.""

Envoys from around the globe gathered yesterday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort for talks on tackling climate change amid a multitude of competing crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch. The Taoiseach is due to deliver Ireland's National Statement tomorrow afternoon, which will set out Ireland's climate ambition and the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable countries bearing the brunt of climate change. He will also have bilateral meetings with fellow leaders. Speaking ahead of the summit, the Taoiseach said: 'Climate change is the single greatest challenge the world faces. Its effects are already being felt in more extreme weather events and its consequences are fuelling conflict, global instability, competition for resources and abject human misery in some of the world's poorest countries. 'Political leaders meeting at COP27 have a special responsibility to urgently drive the transformation needed to secure the sustainable future of our planet and its people. 'It is very clear some of the countries that contributed least to climate change are bearing the worst brunt of its impacts. Many of these vulnerable countries lack the resources they need to deal with the challenges they face. 'I expect climate finance will be a prominent issue in our discussions and I hope developed countries will step up, ensuring commitments entered into at previous meetings are delivered.' Delegates at the summit agreed after late-night talks on Saturday to put the delicate issue of whether rich nations should compensate poor countries most vulnerable to climate change on the formal agenda for the first time. For more than a decade, wealthy nations have rejected official discussions on funds to help poor countries cope with the consequences of global warming. The issue could generate even more tension than at previous conferences. 'I hope developed countries will step up' \"

Nicola Sturgeon's jaunt to the climate conference in Egypt comes amidst stinging criticism of her failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis back home. And the controversy TURN TO PAGE 5 FROM PAGE ONE only grew after the Scottish Government refused to reveal the exact cost to the taxpayer of the trip. Ms Sturgeon is being accompanied to the beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh by junior environment minister Mairi McAllan and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken, as well as several officials. But questions have been raised about the need for the First Minister's presence. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is officially representing the UK at COP27 . Ms Sturgeon's visit comes just days after stand-in Finance Secretary John Swinney announced \£31billion-plus cuts to the 2022/23 Scottish budget. Yet despite the continuing devastating plight of the country's economy, the First Minister will today reveal plans to fund losses and damage sustained by vulnerable countries from climate change. It follows a Scottish Government pledge of \£32million to fund a similar scheme made at COP26 last year. Speaking to Sky News yesterday, Ms Sturgeon said: ""We will be announcing a further financial commitment  in particular, at non-economic loss and damage that many countries are suffering."" This is believed to relate to matters such as loss of culture and tradition. Last night critics poured scorn on Ms Sturgeon's trip. The Scottish Conservatives' Net Zero spokesman Liam Kerr said: ""Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world and Scotland under the SNP-Green Government has failed to hit a number of environmental targets. Using the strength of the United Kingdom, it is important that we support those countries who may not be in a position to do so themselves. ""However, many people across Scotland will be questioning the need for Nicola Sturgeon to be grandstanding at this summit at a time when her government has just confirmed \£31.2bn-worth of devastating cuts to our public services and net zero initiatives. ""They will suspect that Nicola Sturgeon prefers to make this kind of announcement, instead of focusing on the tough challenges facing people and communities back in Scotland."" Scottish Labour joined in the criticism, describing Ms Sturgeon's decision to travel to Egypt at such a time as ""shameful"". The party's net zero and energy spokesman Craig Smyth urged the Scottish Government to reverse the cuts amid the cost-of-living crisis. He said: ""A year ago, Nicola Sturgeon promised to make Scotland a world leader in the green revolution but these empty promises are in tatters. rs. ""The cost-of-living crisis and the climate emergency are two of the urgent challenges our country faces, but the SNPGreen he ntry SNPing government are gutting support schemes. Making these damaging cuts as COP27 gets under way lays bare the rank hypocrisy hiding behind this government's environmental rhetoric, as their failure to use the powers they have to help with the cost-of-living crisis."" COP2 th beh ment's env ric, as well pow t crtic said imp In response to the crticism, Ms Sturgeon said: ""It's really important to be here to be having the discussions to be playing our part in finding the solution. di pl fi Rishi Sunak is here, I welcome that. I think it is right that he is here."" She added: ""It is really important that everyone who has a part to play does that to the full. ""If you speak to many campaigners, many governments particularly from the global south, they warmly welcome Scotland's contribution here. ""Every single one of us has an obligation to play our part in tackling it."" The First Minister was also questioned about the attendance of Glasgow City Council leader Ms Aitken at the summit. Her trip is expected to cost more than \£37,000 along with two officials at a time when the SNP-led local authority is trying to plug a \£3120million black hole in its budget. Ms Sturgeon replied: ""Glasgow was the host of COP last year. ""Susan is here to hand on the COP responsibility to Egypt, to Sharm el-Sheikh."" Yesterday, Ms Sturgeon posted a photo of herself with the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley. Last year, during COP26 in Glasgow, the First Minister became the butt of numerous jokes after repeatedly posting selfies with various world leaders.

The Prime Minister has come under sustained fire from senior Tories after he said he would be skipping the UN climate summit next month due to pressing domestic issues. King Charles, who is reportedly ""champing at the bit to go"", has also been prevented from attending by the Government, in a decision made by Liz Truss, Mr Sunak's predecessor, and since backed by Mr Sunak. But senior government sources have said Mr Sunak's situation may change if ""good progress"" is made on the forthcoming fiscal statement. ""The reason he is unable to go is down to domestic pressures, particularly with the fiscal statement due on 17 November,"" a source said. ""It's not that he doesn't want to go, it's just that his priority must be on domestic issues."" Whether the Prime Minister has any chance of attending the summit, which starts on Sunday in Sharmel-Sheikh, will depend on how much headway Mr Sunak and his Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, make on the fiscal statement by Wednesday. His decision to steer clear of the event has been heavily criticised by Conservatives, with the former chancellor George Osborne branding it a ""misstep"" last night. ""I think it has all been mishandled,"" Mr Osborne said on The Andrew Neil Show. ""'Vote blue, go green' was something David Cameron did to win over the environmental issue to the Conservative Party. Why trash that because you don't want to get on a plane to Egypt?"" he added. His comments came after the COP26 president, Alok Sharma, who was recently demoted from the Cabinet by Mr Sunak, expressed his ""disappointment"" at the COP27 snub. Speaking to The Sunday Times, Mr Sharma said that, while he understood Mr Sunak had a ""huge in-tray"" of issues to deal with at home, ""I would say that going to COP27 would allow for engagement with other world leaders. And I think it does send a signal about our renewed commitment on this issue."" Mr Sunak's stance has come under further scrutiny after the US President Joe Biden confirmed that he would be attending the conference, as well as the French President Emmanuel Macron. Foreign allies are perplexed by the Prime Minister's decision not to attend, given the advances the UK secured against the odds in Glasgow last year, and particularly as the UK still holds the presidency. The King is expected to hold a climate reception on Friday at Buckingham Palace that will be attended by the US climate envoy John Kerry, where Mr Sunak will ""say a few words"".

HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/scores Scores of presidents, along with thousands of diplomats, climate negotiators, business leaders, activists and journalists descended on the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh to take part in discussions and negotiations slated to go through Nov. 18.  Climate change will never stop without our intervention,"" said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, opening the day's session. ""Our time here is limited and we must use every second that we have.\' \' Former U.S. Vice-President HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/al-gore Al Gore , one of the first leaders to raise the alarm about climate change, framed the question of whether to decarbonize as a ""life over death choice by leaders. Nigeria\' s Environment Minister Mohammed Abdullahi, along with many others, argued that the action needed to go beyond just cutting emissions in the future. Rich nations, most responsible for climate change, must help poor nations hit hard by impacts of climate change.  The blame game should stop, he said, adding that the country would be  aggressive during negotiations about financing and reparations for vulnerable countries. Here is a look some of the largest storylines on the first day of COP27 : In the world of climate negotiations, loss and damage refers to reparations. That would be rich nations, the most responsible for the emissions that have led to climate change, making reparations to developing countries that are often most impacted. While the idea has long been around, traditionally it's been more on the fringes of climate discussions than in the forefront. On Monday, it dominated many of the talks. For the first time, developing nations got on to the summit agenda the issue of loss and damage, and numerous leaders brought it up and urged action. The setting of this year's summit, Egypt, a developing nation in Africa, seemed to give the initiative a symbolic push.  The damage is obvious, Ghana\' s President Nana Akufo-Addo told The Associated Press.  Those who are responsible should be very, very much aware of the need to compensate others. Throughout the speeches, leaders urged their counterparts and negotiators not to get distracted amid so many things competing for attention. There are the U.S. Midterm elections on Tuesday. Now in its eighth month, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed some countries to speed up plans to transition to green energies while others have come under criticism for turning back to dirty fuels like coal to make up the energy shortfall. And COP27 will still be happening when leaders of the world's richest nations meet in Bali in Indonesia for the G20 summit next week.  Today\' s urgent crises cannot be an excuse for backsliding or greenwashing, said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary general. On the sidelines, there was also talk about who wasn't attending the summit, and what that might say about their commitments. Leaders of two of the biggest emitting countries, China and India, thus far appear to be skipping the talks, though they are sending underlings to negotiations. The leader of the historically top polluting country, U.S. President HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joe-biden Joe Biden , is coming days later than most of the other presidents and prime ministers on his way to Bali. EGYPTIAN ACTIVIST STRIKE To coincide with the summit start, jailed opposition activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah escalated a hunger strike, refusing also water, according to his family. On Monday, Agnes Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, warned that failure by the Egyptian government to release him would lead to his death. Abdel-Fattah, 40, has spent most of the past decade behind bars. For many Egyptians, his detention is a symbol of the country's return to autocratic rule. For more than six months, Abdel-Fattah has been on a partial hunger strike, consuming only 100 calories a day. Hoping to push the issue, Abdel-Fattah\' s younger sister, Sanaa Seif, came to Sharm el-Sheikh early Monday. She arrived on a flight from London through the Turkish city of Istanbul.  I\' m here to do my best to try and and shed light on my brother\' s case and to save him, Seif said upon arrival. Since 2013, el-Sissi has overseen a massive crackdown, jailing thousands of Islamists, but also secular activists involved in the country\' s 2011 uprising. Many other activists, journalists and academics have fled the country. SAUDI ARABIA INITIATIVE As expected, Saudi Arabia had a large presence, both inside the COP27 venues and outside. On the sidelines of an event, on Monday Saudi Arabia\' s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pledged $2.5 billion to fund regional efforts to combat climate change. The crown prince said the money would support initial projects and the budget for the Middle East Green Initiative, which Saudi Arabia launched a year ago. Saudi Arabia had a large pavilion outside the venue dedicated to its green initiatives. Salman also said the kingdom\' s Public Investment Fund would target net zero carbon emissions by 2050, through a circular carbon economy approach. Many climate change activists say the strategy and investments are simply a way for Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest oil producers, to continue with business as usual. They say the circular carbon strategy focuses on unreliable carbon capture and storage technologies rather than phasing out fossil fuels. ______ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

We found the ice to be at its second thinnest ever, only beaten by a year when the weather had caused it to be worse. Photos from that day went viral, being published in 200 news outlets around the world. For me, while I stood there for four hours, it was a profoundly emotional experience. What the photographs do not show is what I could hear, the sound of the sea gushing below the ice, just below me. Despite my call to various UN world leaders from the ship, nothing changed then and still nothing has changed since. Look at all the weather disasters just in this year alone: especially the floods in Bangladesh - where my Nanabhai and Nanu's family are from - and in Pakistan where one-third of the country was submerged under water, and the record-breaking heatwaves across the UK, Europe and the world. I believe that the world is beyond the tipping point in terms of climate change, a point from which there is no going back. Last year, I attended Cop26, which was hosted by the UK government in Glasgow. I spoke on various panels, but the lack of action or leadership from our government was disastrous. The final straw was the proposal agreed by President Bolsonaro of Brazil to end illegal deforestation by 2030, basically allowing him to continue his mass deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon. I travelled there in 2019, witnessing the Amazon rainforest being chopped down by unrelenting Bolsonaro supporters, and at one point we flew over the Amazon at night, seeing hundreds of forests burning below. When I left Glasgow to go back to University in Cambridge, I felt totally demoralised and disheartened. Cop26 had failed me and every young person around the world, whether they knew it or not. Cop26 did agree to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but the countries in the global north are nowhere near hitting this target. The fact that Cop27 is being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt is totally unacceptable. The Sinai is totally enclosed and those without entry to Cop27 will be restricted. There is no right to protest, and so it is unsafe for protesters and women in particular. For this reason, I am not attending and do not recommend attending to any young people, especially women. However, there is plenty of spin from the Egyptian leadership. President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said: ""I deeply believe that Cop27 is an opportunity to showcase unity against an existential threat that we can only overcome through concerted action and effective implementation. ""As the incoming presidency, Egypt will spare no effort to ensure that Cop27 becomes the moment when the world moved from negotiation to implementation and where words were translated to actions, and where we collectively embarked on a path towards sustainability, a just transition and eventually a greener future for coming generations."" There are so many issues that need to be tackled, as a matter of urgency. I do not have much hope, but think that it is important to focus on some of the world's most pressing problems. We must stop all new fossil fuel projects and end all existing projects. We must put a stop to all deforestation, whether for logging, palm oil or cattle. We need urgent research into improving renewable energy and new technologies. What we need from Cop27 is this: to bridge the mitigation gap to help limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, to deliver high-quality and scaled-up finance flows, especially to the most vulnerable, to enhance efforts to implement adaptation measures, to secure finance for loss and damage, and to implement the Paris Rulebook to hold countries and non-state actors accountable.

It is not going to happen when we treat the fight against the slow poisoning of our planet as something separate to the pursuit of human rights. They are inextricably linked. In the coming years, desertification, food shortages, rising sea levels and soaring temperatures will not only create fresh humanitarian crises, but aggravate existing inequalities and human rights abuses committed against the world\' s most vulnerable groups.

Since 2017, the Egyptian authorities have locked access to approximately 700 websites belonging to news outlets and human rights groups. Rights organisations say there is also the  systematic arrest and persecution of journalists. Environmental activists and human rights groups, many of whom struggle to operate in the country, have repeatedly raised the concern that it isn\' t actually possible for climate rallies to take place ahead of and during Cop27 . They have said that Egyptian civil society members and journalists are under heavy surveillance and cannot meaningfully participate without fear of serious reprisals. Sanaa Seif, Alaa\' s sister, herself a rights defender who has spent long stints behind bars in Egypt, said therefore governments that participate in Cop27 and do not acknowledge that reality and work to change it  goes beyond greenwashing . Alaa, who has spent most of the last 10 years behind bars, told his family last month he would likely die in jail on hunger strike demanding the simple right to a consular visit from the British Embassy. Mitigating climate change and fighting for human rights are interlinked struggles, they shouldn't be separated.

Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch has documented how President Sisi\' s government has severely curtailed the ability of environmental groups to carry out independent work. They have warned that anyone participating in rallies to encourage world leaders to make change are at great risk of ending up behind bars. It goes beyond Egypt hosting Cop27 \- if we truly want to save our planet, and the future of our species, we can no longer lock climate action away in its own box, divorced from the reality of the wider world.

In the background are other priorities clamouring for our attention - fuel and food poverty are real concerns. However, the issues discussed at the COP27 are more important than ever. Ultimately, if we don't learn to live in a better relationship with the natural resources around us, the impact will only make these other concerns worse. We want to live in a world where harvests are not disrupted by extreme weather, where no one goes hungry, where homes are insulated so that everyone stays warm, where power is generated without destruction, where people enjoy one another's company and the beauty of the natural world. Christians are increasingly prioritising responding well to the climate and nature crises. The Bible is full of reference to the threefold relationship between God, people and the land - intersecting relationships between our spirituality, our human community and our connection with nature. For a long time, we didn't notice or give due attention to this aspect of scripture. However, the environmental crises have opened our eyes. We now know that living well as Christians includes living gently, in healthy relationship with the natural world. As Christians, we are people of hope. We do not give up, even when the news is discouraging. We believe in a God of hope who can bring newness to even the most hopeless-looking situations. The reality is that these conferences produce mixed results. It is never enough, too slow, too late. As people of hope, this is not where we give up. I pray that we may see signs of hope from COP27 in the shape of significant moves forward. Whether or not this is what the news brings us, we do not give up. We have our part to play. We wonder at what could be possible and we explore together what we could do, where we live, with the people around us in order to move this forwards. Politicians can only do so much, but people of hope who work with their neighbours can change the world. Cate Williams Environmental Engagement Officer, Diocese of Gloucester \"

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK407","Africa Leads on Energy Reform, Sparking Green Power Surge Ahead of COP27","July 27, 2022 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","DAKAR, Senegal -- This September, the African continent's key power stakeholders will convene at the world-renowned CICAD venue in Dakar for the MSGBC Oil, Gas Power Conference 2022. Yet despite titular appearances, programming for pivotal event remains strongly rooted in Africa's energy transition, complemented by elements of local content, economic diversification and universal access to power. A mere three months later, the continent's heads of state will converge in Egypt for COP27 , knowing their respective nations will be in the spotlight and that commitments from last year's COP26 still only limit warming to 2.4 degrees, providing a 5% loss per annum to these African nations' GDPs. Thus, as we approach the business end of this pivotal year, here is what you need to know about Africa's keystone position and leadership in the global energy transition and the transformational effect this shift is having on the continent. First, we look to investment- the ultimate differentiator in climate action and Africa's historical stumbling block in development, yet now a well of fresh innovation. To date, the continent continues to attract a mere 3% of global private sector climate finance and yet the African Development Bank estimates that African countries' nationally determined contributions towards mitigating climate change demand over $ 3 trillion investment by 2030. How is this to be achieved? Through local incentivization coupled with globalization. In 2020, Senegal dropped all VAT on solar panels and associated technologies. The following year its solar adoption peaked, seeing it pass a 1/3 renewables share in its power grid. Last year, Mauritania signed two MoU's with global transitional power megafirms Chariot and CWP. In doing so it unlocked some $ 43.5 billion in foreign direct investment creating 40GW of renewable energy. And with Senegalese President H.E. Macky Sall holding the title of President of the African Union this year, foreign heads of state are flocking to West Africa. In attracting global financiers from across Africa, Europe, Asia, America, Australia and the Middle East, MSGBC 2022 has the power to turbocharge the MSGBC basin and African continent's green energy financing for adoption ahead of COP27 . Next, we look to energy access- an area wherein a robust green recovery and transition has allowed every one of the MSGBC basin's nations to commit to 2025 or 2030 universal electrification goals, raising billions of dollars of public capital to the cause. Herein diversification is the key: gas supporting a power backbone while complemented by a more variable yet ever-increasing solar and wind power share. Next year, Senegal expects $ 9 billion in gas developments to come online, generating up to 840MW power generation potential. Solar and wind potential each stand in the hundreds of gigawatts. MSGBC 2022 will feature several highly anticipated sessions tracking the region's key energy transition innovators and megaprojects to this end, providing not only financing opportunities but strategic insight into the field with speakers from the basin's ministries and heads of state prominently featured. Last but by no means least, along with world-class natural resource reserves and savvy investment strategies, Africa's energy transition advantage derives from simple political will. Glasgow's COP26 agreed on a $ 100 billion global annual climate finance target, $ 20 billion higher than that currently being achieved. Yet African negotiators called for a target of $ 700 billion, recognizing the need for urgent action. For perspective, the humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic saw some $ 25 billion raised globally in aid of control and curve-flattening. Renewables already are the main source of electricity for almost half of Africa, and as a result, the continent which holds 17% of the world population creates only 4% of global emissions. The fact is, renewables generate better returns for communities and economies and the African continent recognizes this uniquely, striving for ambitious adoption targets ahead of the SDGs and springboarding green development with a glocal model. According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa, investment in green sectors, chiefly energy but also climate-smart agriculture and eco-tourism, produces 420% better returns in gross value addition and 250% better returns in job creation than investment in fossil fuels. The numbers speak for themselves, and as H.E. Macky Sall, who will provide MSGBC 2022's opening address, frequently remarks: ""Africa is a field which cannot be the feast of others.""

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK408","Plight of Egyptian dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah overshadows COP27","FT.com"," ","The Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which is hosting this month\' s COP27 climate summit, is a favourite venue for international gatherings. Wedged between the mountains and sea near the southern tip of Sinai with a tiny local population, it is easy to seal off and secure  a place where the country\' s harsh realities can be kept at bay. But as world leaders descended on the enclave for the climate gathering this week, Egypt\' s human rights record  and in particular the plight of political dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah  has https://www.ft.com/content/773679fd-6674-4a3b-9348-771b10919382 become the focus of intense attention, at times overshadowing the official business of the conference. UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Volker Turk, UN high commissioner for human rights, have all urged Egypt\' s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to release Abdel Fattah, who is serving a five-year jail sentence over a social media post. But COP27 This was underlined at a COP meeting on Tuesday, when Egyptian MP Amr Darwish criticised Sanaa Seif, Abdel Fattah\' s sister who has been conducting a campaign in the UK on his behalf and who was addressing the audience. After he accused her of  summoning foreign powers to pressure Egypt , he was ushered out by UN security officers  with the incident captured by dozens of journalists.  A moment that should have been a showcase for Egyptian diplomacy has been overshadowed by all the focus on human rights, said Michael Hanna, analyst at the International Crisis Group. Sisi, a former general, overthrew his elected Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi, in a popularly backed coup in 2013. Since then he has presided over one of the harshest crackdowns on dissent in modern Egyptian history. Tens of thousands of Islamists have been detained, with arrests extended to the regime\' s secular critics. Protests are banned and rights groups, who are often accused of being paid agents of foreign governments, face severe restrictions. Abdel Fattah, 40, came to public attention during the 2011 revolution that ended the authoritarian rule of veteran president Hosni Mubarak. He has been on a partial hunger strike since April and had warned he would stop taking water on Sunday, the day COP27 began. His family say he is convinced that the Egyptian authorities have no intention of ever freeing him and that his actions are driven by despair. The dissident, who was granted British citizenship last year, has spent eight of the past 10 years in Egyptian jails. His family has had no news of him for days and fear he will die.  In a day or two, or three at the most, what Alaa\' s going through will be over, said his mother Laila Soueif.  If he is released, he will be free. If he dies, he will be free. \~ The government has refused to acknowledge Abdel Fattah\' s hunger strike or to allow a British consular visit. But Macron said this week that Sisi was committed to ensuring the activist\' s health was  preserved  comments that alarmed his family.  Are they force feeding my brother right now? Is he handcuffed on a bed and put on [intravenous drips] against his will? , asked Seif.  If that\' s the case, then he\' s been plunged into an even worse nightmare than he was already in. Khaled Ali, Abdel Fattah\' s lawyer, was told that he could visit his client on Thursday, but said that when he arrived at the prison, he had been refused entry. Egyptian human rights groups have welcomed the publicity from COP27 . Hossam Bahgat, director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said that when Egypt was selected as the summit\' s host,  some people wanted to campaign against that, to choose a different location. We said \' no, don\' t do that\' .  We needed the attention, we needed the solidarity [and] we needed the comradeship, he told a COP panel discussion on the country\' s human rights situation. Speakers at the panel warned that climate justice and human rights were interlinked. Bahgat said communities in Egypt threatened with environmental damage were too scared to talk to human rights groups or resist projects that threatened to have a negative impact on their lives. It is also unclear how Cairo will react once COP27 has ended.  The risk of reprisals is very much there and that\' s the decision that we had to make, Bahgat said.  This is a huge opportunity: Egypt has been forgotten for the past few years because there is a degree of normalisation of repression and because it appears to be a stable country in the middle of a very unstable region. Meanwhile Abdel Fattah\' s condition remains unknown. The attention at the summit has raised his profile but it is not certain it will lead to his release.  The regime doesn\' t want to be seen as succumbing to pressure, said Hanna.  To the extent that there will be a course correction, it won\' t be under the intense glare at COP. But if he dies, it will be a black eye for Egypt. \"
"COP27","UK","COP27_UK409","\u8216 Loss and damage\u8217  debate set to dominate at COP27","FT.com"," ","World leaders attending this month\' s UN climate summit are gearing up for a renewed battle over whether rich countries should provide financial support to developing nations, to help them cope with the consequences of rising global temperatures. The question of so-called  loss and damage funding for developing nations has been contentious for years, with rich countries reluctant to accept financial responsibility for climate change caused by industrial activity and offer compensation to poorer countries. But many developing countries, such as the low-lying Pacific island states vulnerable to sea level rise, are stepping up their demands. They want to see the creation of an international loss and damage finance facility  a type of fund  at November\' s COP27 UN summit, hosted by Egypt.  Wealthier countries bear a moral responsibility to help poorer nations recover, adapt and build resilience to disasters, said Ant\'f3nio Guterres, UN secretary-general in October.  Let\' s not forget that 80 per cent of emissions driving this type of climate destruction are from the G20. Alex Scott, an analyst at environmental think-tank E3G, says the UN summit will be a test of how willing governments are to grasp what\' s needed to address growing climate impacts  particularly after the recent devastating floods in Pakistan. Without some movement on the subject of paying for loss and damage,  the legitimacy of [the UN process] will be challenged, argues Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation.  The number one priority is implementation, says Wael Aboulmagd, Egypt\' s COP27 ambassador.  Everyone has to be part of the conversation. However, only a handful of countries had updated their emissions reduction plans by the end of October, despite pledging in the HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/2b628c39-557f-4e9e-960a-77ca0489b95c COP26 agreement to  revisit and strengthen them by the end of 2022. Current pledges by nations that have signed the agreement put the world on track for a temperature rise of between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100, the UN Environment Programme said in October, which is above the Paris Agreement\' s redline target of 2C. Ideally, warming would be limited to 1.5C, though temperatures have already risen by at least 1.1C since pre-industrial times. Aboulmagd said in a recent briefing that the Egyptian team had been  working the telephones to encourage countries to upgrade their pledges. Rich nations had promised to mobilise $100bn a year in support of poorer countries by 2020. But research shows they fell short, at $83.3bn. Most recent estimates by US climate envoy John Kerry suggest the figure may have since reached $90bn. But, in addition to subscribing to the full amount, signatories need to agree on a new target for climate-related financial aid to be delivered from 2025. Meanwhile, China and the so-called Group of 77  a coalition of developing nations at the UN  will propose that loss and damage financing be included as an important topic for discussion on the official COP27 agenda, which is due to be finalised at the start of the summit. In Glasgow last year, rich nations rejected a proposal for a loss and damage finance facility, although countries agreed to start a  dialogue on the issue. While the calls for the creation of such a facility have grown increasingly loud in the run-up to the talks in Egypt, anything included in the final COP27 agreement will require the unanimous approval of more than 190 parties to the Paris Agreement. Nevertheless, the Egyptian hosts say they are committed to making progress on the issue, and have appointed ministers from Chile and Germany  including Jennifer Morgan, the former executive director of Greenpeace who is now Germany\' s climate envoy  to co-ordinate discussions on the subject at COP27 . Conrod Hunte, deputy chair and lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, says it is important that any agreement on loss and damage includes a financing element.  We\' re reaching our breaking point, our limit, both literally and figuratively, he says. However, during New York climate week, in September, Kerry pushed back on the need for financing specifically for loss and damage, arguing the focus should instead be on so-called mitigation projects. He has since said the US is prepared to discuss loss and damage financing at COP27 . The EU is expected to resist the idea of creating a fund. Reaching a unanimous agreement  let alone one that includes a decision on compensation  is always a challenge at the COP, but it is likely to be particularly difficult this year given the geopolitical context. Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine has HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/6f352052-f2bc-401a-beed-b89d9e98a23d fuelled energy, food price and wider inflation crises, while US-China relations are fractured. Poorer populous nations, such as India, have stressed the need for financial support if they are to transform their energy systems and economies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, while richer nations are now also scrambling to provide support to their own citizens amid a worsening cost of living crisis, with their budgets already depleted by pandemic support measures. Yet scientists and international bodies such as the IMF have outlined the grave cost to all countries of backsliding on decarbonisation and climate change commitments, and said rich nations must provide support for the most vulnerable. Climate justice is expected to be an especially prominent topic at an African-hosted COP, as a result. Speaking at the Africa Adaptation summit in September, Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, said there was  a strong imbalance between Africa\' s responsibility [for climate change] and the volume of resources it receives for mitigating and adapting to the crisis.  This is where one of the most shocking injustices towards our continent resides. E3G\' s Scott says the world is at  a multi-crisis moment  but COP27 must demonstrate progress and co-operation among leaders on climate finance, reducing emissions and transforming the real economy.  It\' s possible that it will be very disappointing and then the story out of COP27 is one of failure and lack of coming to grips with the scale of the challenge, she warns. That would only pile the pressure on to next year, when it is likely that geopolitical events and energy crises  still won\' t have let up .

The former Prime Minister is understood to be intending to attend the meeting of world leaders to show solidarity with the fight against the climate crisis. It comes as his Mr Sunak is facing accusations of a 'massive failure of leadership' and claims he will now be 'missing in action' on climate issues following his decision not to attend in order to focus on 'other pressing domestic commitments'. At the same time, Downing Street also confirmed that Mr Sunak had downgraded the status of climate minister Graham Stuart, who will no longer be attending Cabinet. Alok Sharma , the Cop-26 President, also lost his right to attend Cabinet meetings in the PM's reshuffle this week. Mr Sharma today said the PM risks undermining the UK's position as a world leader on climate issues by not attending Cop27 . He told The Times: 'I'm pretty disappointed that the prime minister is not going. I understand that he's got a huge in tray of domestic issues that he has to deal with. 'But I would say that going to Cop27 would allow for engagement with other world leaders. 'And I think it does send a signal, if the Prime Minister was to go, about our renewed commitment on this issue.' Mr Sharma added: 'If you ;ook at what happened in the Australian elections in the past few months, one of the reasons that the conservatives didn't win through is because people didn't feel they took this issue seriously enough.' Meanwhile, Mr Johnson's decision to attend may be seen both as a criticism of Mr Sunak and an attempt to remain in the forefront of Tory minds following his decision to drop out of the leadership race despite earning more than 100 supporters. There are said to be high level rows in government over Mr Johnson's intentions and efforts to convince him not to attend, The Guardian reports. Donors with links to fossil fuels helped Rishi Sunak's leadership bid More than a quarter of the \£3530,000 donated to Rishi Sunak's Tory leadership bid is understood to have come from supporters with links to fossil fuels. It has added further pressure to Mr Sunak's decision not to attend next week's climate summit. Shadow Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband told The Mirror: 'Rishi Sunak is on the side of big oil and gas companies, not the British people. 'We've seen it time and again, including him refusing a proper windfall tax on the rocketing profits of these energy giants. 'A PM choosing to protect profits of big oil and gas firms will never tackle the energy bills and climate crises we face, and will never deliver the energy independence we need.' A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said it could not answer if the former PM plans to travel to Egypt. A statement said: 'The government is absolutely committed to supporting Cop27 and leading international action to tackle climate change and protect nature. 'The UK will be fully represented by senior ministers, including the foreign, business and environment secretaries, as well as Cop president Alok Sharma. 'They will be working to ensure that countries continue to make progress on the groundbreaking commitments made at Cop26 in Glasgow.' Senior government officials are understood to have been aware that Mr Johnson has been planning to attend for some time. It comes as Mr Sunak is also standing by predecessor Liz Truss's decision to stop King Charles from attending the climate summit, despite him 'champing at the bit' to go. The new PM is facing pressure over his decision not to attend, despite Ms Truss having planned to travel to represent the UK there. Critics say it calls the new PM's climate stance into question. Mr Sunak is reportedly under pressure to let the King attend and allies have suggested he should let Charles go to demonstrate the UK's commitment to combating climate change in the Prime Minister's absence. Charles is said to be disappointed not to go, but understands his attendance would need the blessing of the government and will not force the issue with No10, The Times reported. Mr Sunak, Mr Sharma, and members of the Cabinet are all expected to attend alongside international guests. A source told the newspaper: 'He will be champing at the bit but knows it would need government blessing. The PM has reversed the fracking decision so this could be another smart environmentally focused move.' King Charles, who holds climate issues close to his heart, also hopes to find a way to show his support, potentially through a message or convening discussions via video-link or telephone, The Telegraph reported. US President Joe Biden is also reportedly planning to attend. The summit's Egyptian organisers have claimed about 90 heads of state had so far confirmed their attendance.

"COP27","UK","COP27_UK412","Egypt: Arrests, Curbs on Protests As COP27 Nears","November 7, 2022 Monday","FinancialWire","BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Egyptian authorities have arrested dozens of people for calling for protests and restricted the right to protest in the days leading up to the COP27 climate summit, threatening its success, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities have added security measures in Sharm El-Sheikh, the resort town where the conference will be held, including mandating the installation of cameras in all taxis, allowing security agency surveillance of drivers and passengers. The authorities also imposed an unduly complicated process for registration for the so-called Green Zone outside the COP venue, which at previous summits was open to the wider public to engage on climate issues and allow interaction with summit participants. ""As participants are arriving for COP27 , it is becoming clear that Egypt's government has no intention of easing its abusive security measures and allowing for free speech and assembly,"" said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""Egyptian authorities should not be extending its human rights crackdown into the summit space."" On November 1, 2022, Egyptian media reported that since the beginning of October, Egyptian authorities had arrested dozens of people for calling for anti-government protests on November 11, during the conference. Some of those arrested reportedly face charges of ""misusing social media"" and ""joining a terrorist group."" The number of those arrested is rising every day, local media reported. On October 31, Egyptian authorities detained an Indian climate activist, Ajit Rajagopal, as he set off on an eight-day walk from Cairo to Sharm El-Sheikh to call attention to the climate crisis. The authorities released him the next day after international outcry. According to local media, in recent days the authorities stepped up police checkpoints in downtown Cairo and around vital streets in the city, arbitrarily stopping people and forcing them to give up their phones for unconstitutional checks into their social media content. The authorities have repeatedly set up such checkpoints around major events in recent years, resulting in dozens of arbitrary arrests. The authorities also announced substantial limitations on public protests and marches. On October 22, during a TV interview, South Sinai Governor Khaled Fouda said that public protests around COP would be allowed only in the designated area set aside for protests, confirming what Egypt's foreign minister announced in March. In the recorded video interview with the governor, the local Sada al-Balad channel broadcast footage of what appeared to be the protest area inside the Green Zone. ""No one will be allowed except those registered,"" the governor said. Prior to the start of the conference, the COP27 website published guidelines on protests and demonstrations that require organizers to provide notification 36 hours in advance and disclose the purpose of the protest or demonstration, its date, the organizing entity, and a designated focal point with a copy of the conference badge. The protest or march can only take place between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the site's operating hours. For marches anywhere else, in Sharm El-Sheikh, organizers must provide notification 48 hours in advance along with other details. The authorities also announced sweeping surveillance plans. During the same TV interview, the governor said that the authorities are installing surveillance cameras in all 800 taxis in Sharm el Sheikh, claiming this measure was needed to ""monitor the driver's behavior"" with tourists and visitors, and ""not to surveil people."" He said that by early November, 500 taxis would already be monitored by the cameras which keep audio-video recordings of what happens inside the taxi and are connected to a ""security observatory"" run by Egypt's notorious Interior Ministry. He did not indicate how long these recordings could be kept and what laws regulate such massive surveillance, which would appear to violate the international human right to privacy. On October 24, the Egyptian government released a smartphone application for COP27 attendees that requires users to provide personal information, including their passport numbers. Based on an initial analysis by two local rights groups, the application requires access to the phone's camera, microphone, location, and Bluetooth connection. All information gathered by the application can be shared with third parties. The wide-ranging information raises further surveillance and privacy concerns. The authorities have also announced plans that would in effect restrict access for the general public to climate discussions in Sharm El-Sheikh. On October 24, the Egyptian government announced an online registration process for the ""Green Zone."" The registration process requires an applicant to provide personal information including passport numbers and cite an affiliation to a participating group, effectively closing it off from interested people who are not affiliated with media or any participating group. Human Rights Watch and a dozen other organizations have warned that the years-long restrictions on assembly, association, and independent work by the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would effectively hinder meaningful participation by nongovernmental groups and journalists during COP, preventing a successful and ambitious outcome of the climate summit. About 1,400 groups from various regions and public figures from 80 countries have signed a petition drafted by 12 Egyptian organizations to lift the restrictions. On October 7, five United Nations special rapporteurs said in a statement that Egypt ""must ensure the safety and full participation of all parts of civil society"" at COP27 after ""a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists."" International law guarantees everyone the right to free, active, and meaningful participation in public affairs at international, national, regional, and local levels. The right to participate is inseparably linked to other human rights such as the right to peaceful assembly and association, and freedom of expression. ""Arresting Egyptians merely for calling for protests a few days before COP is not just a violation to freedom of expression and assembly, but it is also a direct message to COP participants to stay in line,"" Coogle said.

United Nations secretary-general HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/antonio-guterres Antonio Guterres told the HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/cop27 COP27 gathering in the Red Sea resort of HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/sharm-el-sheikh Sharm El-Sheikh that the world was in the  fight of our lives and we are losing . Seeking to spark far more urgent action from many nations in the battle against HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/climate-change climate change , he stressed:  Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.  We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator. Mr Guterres called for a pact between the world\' s richest and poorest countries to speed up the transition from fossil fuels and the delivery of the funding needed to ensure poorer countries can reduce emissions and cope with the unavoidable impacts of warming that had already occurred.  The two largest economies  the United States and China  have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality, he added. Scientists have warned for years of the approaching climate change nightmare for millions of people. But Simon Stiell, of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, stated that the crisis was now hitting with devastating floods, warmer temperatures, destroyed crops and homes and more violent weather patterns. The past eight years are on track to be the hottest on record, with the sea level rise accelerating, the melting of Europe\' s alpine glaciers shattering records and devastating floods, including in Pakistan, drought and heatwaves and unusually warm autumn weather including in Britain. At the start of the COP27 climate summit, Mr Stiell emphasised that the world was  off track to halve carbon emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050.  The latest scientific reports show slight improvement, the emission curve is bending very, very slightly, which is a positive sign, he told BBC Radio 4\' s Today programme.  So, some of what we are doing is having an impact but it\' s nowhere enough or fast enough.  It\' s not at the scale that is needed to avert the crisis that we  not are facing  it\' s a crisis we are in and it\' s a crisis that is going to just get worse and worse as the years pass. Amid growing anger at world leaders for failing to act swiftly enough, environmental protesters this morning disrupted sections of the M25 despite a major Metropolitan Police operation to foil their plans. The Just Stop Oil demonstrators caused major delays for thousands trying to get to work. Mr Stiell stated that just 29 out of 194 countries had delivered tougher plans to fight climate change, that they promised at the COP26 summit in Glasgow last autumn where the aim was to  keep alive the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Leading scientists say there is now no  credible pathway to achieving this and that under current policies the world is now at risk of an apocalyptic temperature rise of 2.8C this century. More than 100 world leaders are attending the summit including US president Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak  who decided only in recent days to go  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French president Emmanuel Macron. But notable  no shows included the leaders of big polluting countries such as China, Australia, India, as well as major oil producers Russia and Canada. Stressing the need for a  collective effort , Mr Stiell added:  Wars will end, pandemics end, economic crises there is recovery, climate change simply marches on irrespective of geography, boundaries, of global leaders. With the summit already hit by a row over who should pay for the damage caused by global warming, Mr Stiell added that many of the countries being hardest hit now by climate change had contributed the least to the problem. Wealthy nations needed to  come to the table with finance to alleviate some of this climate change destruction and allow less developed countries to leap-frog the use of fossil fuels to develop their economies and instead use cleaner technologies. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said the Government was  supportive of discussions going on at COP27 about these loss and damage payments. Asked if the Government is accepting the principle of loss and damage payments to poorer countries disproportionally affected by climate change, he said:  We\' re accepting the principle there\' s a discussion to be had about this, and actually, in a sense, that\' s been accepted all along. Today for example, the Prime Minister\' s announcing over \£365 million of assistance to developing countries to be able to produce energy in a sustainable way, there\' s been a tacit acceptance. We industrialised first and we appreciate the rest of the world needs to be able to bring themselves along as well. Ahead of a speech to the summit, Mr Sunak called for the world to  deliver on the legacy of COP26, for the sake of people\' s  children and grandchildren . He added:  The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. He was also holding a series of bilateral meetings including with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen amid tensions with the bloc over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, as well as with Mr Macron to discuss fresh moves to stop the cross-Channel migration crisis, and Italy\' s new far-Right PM Giorgia Meloni. \"

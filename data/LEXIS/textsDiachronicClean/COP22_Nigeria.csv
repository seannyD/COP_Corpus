Speaking at the official inauguration of a 10-man preparatory planning committee, the minister said: ""This is the COP that will massively project our view and insist that we must be heard and not only to be heard but that something should be done after that."" Jibril said that the committee, which would be chaired by the permenent secretary of the ministry, Bukar Hassan, was meant to ensure Nigeria's effective preparation for participation at the Marrakech conference. COP 22 , he said, would focus on vital issues including elaboration of technical framework under Article 10 of the Paris Agreement, which Nigeria signed, and issues of vulnerability and adoption of climate change, land use, land use change and forestry, amongst others. ""This is very strategic particularly that Nigeria is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts and has large percentage of its population solely dependent on proceeds from the sales of crude oil (a major source of greenhouse gas emission),"" he said. He stressed the need to effectively participate at the COP22 to safeguard the interest of the country. The committee was expected to, aside coordinating preparation for COP 22 , develop and implement a work plan with timelines for activities to be undertaken and articulate and developing the country's negotiating position. The committee would also assemble and train technical team of negotiators for the country, develop stakeholders' inclusive programme and ensure participation of corporate Nigeria and secure delegation office, exhibition stand and plan. While urging members of the committee to see the task as clarion call to the service of the nation, the minister said: ""Your preparation and activities that you are going to do will be key determinants of success of our attendance. Nigeria is always a high flier, whenever there is a delegation from Nigeria in any international event, you will discover that attention is focused on Nigeria. ""We cannot afford to go there without any proper preparation and I believe you have what it takes to do that preparation for us and to ensure that this outing is the best."" \"

The second best time is now."" \- Chinese Proverb In December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal at the Paris climate conference (COP21). The agreement laid out a global plan on actions the world would adopt to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0;C. Nigeria officially signed the agreement in September 2016 during the 71st United Nations General Assembly. On Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari's gave a speech during the United Nations Framework on Climate Change ( COP-22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. In his speech, he presented the plans of the government towards tackling climate change in Nigeria. The fight towards tackling desert encroachment was what led to former President Olusegun Obasanjo's proposal to the African Union to build a wall of trees. The Lake Chad Basin has experienced immense depletion over the years to less than 10 percent of its original size. The lake, which used to cover over 25, 000 square kilometres in 1925, has shrunk to 2, 500 square kilometres. This massive depletion has led to the displacement of over 5 million people living in that region. The effect of the displacement has been a major factor for the high level of migration to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. President Buhari has said that it would require $14 billion to revive the lake. Nigeria has also experienced changes in weather conditions, such as increased rainfall and excessive heat. Flooding has risen extremely, and it is said to be at its highest rate in the past 50 years. ""In Nigeria for example, the impact is being felt by more than 2.1 million people displaced by devastating floods that the country has continued to suffer since 2012. If not addressed by 2050, the human and financial cost would be colossal"", said President Buhari during his speech at COP22 . Issues such as this reflect the intensive urgency towards redirecting Nigeria on a path of sustainability. President Buhari in his COP22 speech disclosed some initiatives of Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). One of the initiatives includes issuing green bonds in order to raise climate funds. Other initiatives in the Presidency's strategic plan include: Substantially increasing the use of climate smart agriculture Diversification of our energy mix through renewable and efficient gas power Creating a more efficient, cleaner and lower-carbon oil and gas sector especially through a gas to energy programme Initiated the implementation of the cleanup of the Ogoni-Land in the Niger-Delta region The President pledged that Nigeria would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2030, with the intention of raising the target to 45 percent, with the support of the international community. The implementation of these goals would rather seem improbable at the moment, as the Nigerian government has not physically shown their commitment to the implementation of the agreement. Nigeria is a huge consumer of fossil fuels, which is a major cause of greenhouse emissions. The country's love for fossil fuels exhibits the lack of political will to reduce carbon emissions. Just immediately after signing the Paris Agreement in September, Nigeria's Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun stated her disappointment in western countries and multilateral institutions for blocking coal to power projects in Nigeria. In a world where the global economy has agreed to drop the use of fossil fuels, how would it support Nigeria? Her statement indicated a hypocritical move by the government as Nigeria had just agreed to reduce carbon emissions. The government has consistently stated that it would utilise its fossil fuel reserves rather than adopt renewable energy. The argument being that renewable energy is more expensive than using fossil fuels. The cost of adopting renewable energy been proven to be reducing and several countries have started joining the renewable train. The apparent drop in solar prices reflects this: the price of photovoltaic (PV) cells has fallen by 99 percent over the past twenty-five years. With the advancement in technology and manufacturing scale, the trend shows that the prices would keep falling. In comparison with fossil fuels, renewable energy has lower marginal costs. Nigerian companies are also increasing their use of fossil fuels rather than dropping them. Lafarge Cement WAPCO Plc. and Dangote Cement Plc. have embraced the use of coal to power their plants. The lack of government policies to regulate the use has just shown a neglect of climate changes but rather a support of its effects. The effect that fossil fuels have on the environment in terms of contamination cannot be overstated. An example is the Okobo community in Kogi State, where after the commencement of coal mining, there has been an increase in infant mortality rates and new respiratory diseases. The Ogoni Land oil spillage is another testament to the crippling effect of the Nigeria's fossil fuel obsession. The government announced that it has commenced the cleanup of Ogoni Land in the Niger Delta. The cleanup, which was finally signed by President Buhari this year, was as a result of the United Nations Environmental Report (UNEP) submitted since 2011. The President who has indicated his support for the cleanup has said it would take about 30 years for the project to be completed. However, with the political climate of the country, the feasibility of the project is questionable. It is not enough for the government to create a plan and present it to the world. We need to see physical steps being taking towards solving the climate change issues in Nigeria. The Nigerian needs to act fast towards tackling these issues. The first step to be taken is changing the mindset of Nigerians that we are not affected by climate change, that fossil fuels and other causes of greenhouse emissions are okay to use. The Nigerian Government also need to a viable investment climate for the adoption of renewable energy. The Government should also support research towards reducing the cost of renewable energy, thereby increasing its usability. The President himself said in his COP22 speech, ""If (the climate change problem is) not addressed by 2050, the human and financial cost would be colossal.""

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria5","COP 22: FAO, World Bank, AfDB pledge support for ocean economies","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, the World Bank and the African Development Bank has announced the African Package for Climate-Resilient Ocean Economies. The announcement was made at a special Oceans Action Event at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ), which brought together over 400 high-level participants from around the world to advance oceans and climate change issues and to pledge concrete actions in support of the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 14, which is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. The global ocean is fundamental to sustaining life on earth. It is a major carbon sink; it absorbs heat, and produces half the oxygen we breathe. It sustains the lives and livelihoods of the coastal and island communities who call it home, and who rely on its bounty to meet their nutritional needs. The important role our oceans play was recognised at the 43rd Session of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Nairobi, Kenya earlier this year, which decided to prepare a special, scientific report on climate change and the oceans. But while oceans are key to mitigating climate change, a warming planet also places them, and the services they provide, at great risk. Climate variability and change, habitat degradation and ocean acidification all pose additional risks to the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans, and to the well-being of dependent coastal and island communities. This ambitious package of technical and financial assistance by these organisations, will support ocean economies in Africa, and build greater resilience of coastal areas to climate change, tailoring approaches based on the countries' specific priorities and objectives. The initiative will mobilise $500-900 million and implement programmes linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation over the period 2017-2020. According to Maria Helena Semedo, FAO's Deputy Director-General for Natural Resources, 'These ambitious programmes aimed at strengthening the resilience of African coastal communities are critical to meeting the challenges and opportunities of climate change, especially for vulnerable Small Island Development States.' World Bank Group Vice President for Sustainable Development, Laura Tuck, said 'The package could make a significant contribution to meeting the adaptation needs of African countries as they develop their ocean economies. We plan to ramp up our own concessional financing in this area and look forward to working with our partners to increase the effectiveness of overall development assistance.' \"

Although the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) will issue consolidated figures on 2016 global temperatures in early 2017, November data however, confirms WMO's assessment issued in November that 2016 will very likely be the hottest year since records began in the mid 1880s. The WMO provisional statement on the climate in 2016, released for the United Nations Climate Change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, cited preliminary data (to the end of September) that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2\'b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. All the hottest years on record apart from 1998 (during which there was a strong El Nino) have been this century. 'The climate has broken records in 2016. In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide levels were above the symbolic level of 400 parts per million. In the oceans, record warmth contributed to widespread coral reef bleaching. 'Scientific studies are increasingly proving the link between extreme weather, especially heat and human-induced climate change from greenhouse gases,' WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas said. He added that 'This increases the need for investment in better impact-based weather forecasts and early warning systems to save lives and support climate change adaptation both now and in the coming decades ahead.' The BAMS Special Supplement on Explaining Extreme Events from a Climate Perspective is now in its fifth year. During that time, more than 100 peer-reviewed papers have examined extreme events spanning half a decade. Approximately 65% of these papers have shown that human-caused climate change 'influenced an event's frequency and/or intensity in a substantial and measurable manner.' WMO will issue final details about the 2016 state of the climate in early 2017. It will take the pre-industrial era as a baseline, and use three datasets from NOAA, NASA and the Hadley Centre of the UK's Met Office and Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. WMO also draws on reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, which has used all available observational data and an assimilation system to produce a global climatology. With only one month left in the year, the 2016 year-to-date global temperature (January-November) was the highest on record for this period, at 0.94\'b0C (1.69\'b0F) above the 20th century average of 14.0\'b0C (57.2\'b0F), according to NOAA. Record warmth for the year-to-date was present across Alaska, much of western Canada, parts of the northern and eastern United States, much of Central America and northern South America, various regions across Africa, parts of northern and southern Asia, much of southeast Asia island nations, according to NOAA. The average global sea surface temperature for the year-to-date was the highest in the 137-year record. Record high average sea surface temperatures for the January-November period were present across the northern Pacific waters near Alaska, the Bering Sea, parts of the southern and western Pacific, a long swath of the western Atlantic stretching to the Gulf of Mexico, parts of the southern and eastern Indian Ocean extending across the waters of the southeastern Asia island nations and Oceania. The only ocean area with record cold temperatures was east of the Drake Passage near the Antarctic Peninsula, according to NOAA. Copernicus Climate Change Service (ECMWF) said November 2016 'extended the spell of exceptional global warmth that has now lasted more than a year.' A separate analysis, from the WMO Regional Climate Center - Network for Europe (WMO Regional Association VI), said that Europe would likely have its fourth warmest year on record. \"

Developing countries confront a confounding paradox; the yet unrealized $100 billion will not suffice for addressing the ambitious Paris Agreement; yet the adaptation fund and streamlining the process from which developing nations can benefit, remains a challenge. The continued refusal of some developed countries to accept responsibility for their contributions to the climate crises is stalling progress on the Green Climate Fund. Global North countries are non-committal, preferring to contribute symbolic, if not derisory sums. Explicably, Developed Countries -the heavy polluters- confront the ire of Developing Countries -the lesser polluters- that consider verbalized commitments as platitudinous. The latter insist that the $100 billion Green Climate Fund is grossly insufficient for fulfilling global adaptation needs; thus compelling a few developed countries to point to the lack of enough bankable projects from the developing countries. \~Core funding issues aside, the challenge of benchmarking requisite deadlines for most of the Paris Agreement targets subsists. Invariably, most countries worry that absence of delivery deadlines for most of the agreement targets; will translate to laxity, if not non-compliance. COP22 ended with nations hopeful of the delivery of the Paris Agreement. For the Global South nations, the present juncture is propitious for drawing on the now operational $3.1 billion South-South Cooperation Climate Fund launched by China in 2015 in Paris. China, remains constructively engaged, and underlined its commitment by hosting a South-South Cooperation Forum on margins of the COP22 . \~Possible concerns about accessing the GCF were removed with Liberia and Nepal receiving $2.2 million and $2.9 million dollars respectively from the fund. \~Twenty other countries are in line to have their proposals approved with each getting up to $3 million.\~ For its part, the GCF will approve projects worth some $2.5 billion soon. Donald Trump's rhetoric on climate change, prior to becoming the President-elect of the U.S. still elicits concerns. Fiji delegation's emotional remarks at the closing plenary of COP22 encapsulated prevailing and shared fears of most countries over the fate of the Paris Agreement during the Trump presidency.\~ Such concerns were doused slightly by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who reassured the global community that the U.S. will not pull out of the Paris Agreement, and that Trump as President, will find it difficult to do so. Thankfully, Mr. Trump has admitted possible connectivity between human actions and climate change. Impact of climate on Nigeria is still being grossly underreported and underestimated; with Nigeria's overall climate change response still marginal. Yet Nigeria had a fair outing at Marrakech. Minister for Environment, Mrs Amina Mohammed, brought along at least three members of the National Assembly and two colleagues, Minister of Mines and Power, Mr. Babatunde Fashola and Minister of Agriculture Chief Audu Ogbeh. Such composition of the country's delegation and collaborative approach adds to policy synergy and complementarity. It guarantees that Nigerian policymakers will not just understand the issues, but augurs well for fast-tracking the domestication of agreed climate change policies in Nigeria. As the power and agricultural sectors are hugely affected by climate change, Nigeria's multidisciplinary approach is commendable. Whereas Nigeria hosted two side events in Marrakech and the Akwa-Ibom State Government hosted another, there were some inexplicable missed opportunities. Nigeria should have led the African intervention, but for most part of the closing plenary, Nigeria's four seats were vacant, leaving Mali to spearhead African intervention. Given her needs, Nigeria should have proactively sought international support for the funds for recharging of Lake Chad - estimated at $16 billion. That didn't happen.\~ Nigeria appeared not too keen on taking advantage of the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, especially via funds made available by China. Finally, Nigeria missed out of being part of the V40 Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), a group of 40 countries considered to be most vulnerable to climate change. \~That grouping, which at the close of COP21 in Paris, had just 20 countries have expanded to a 40-nation group, without Nigeria. Nigeria not to pursue remedial measures at its disposal in tackling climate change, will amount to gross oversight.\~ There is need to adopt climate smart policies and engage much more assertively within the framework of the South-South Cooperation Forum. \~Such approach should be a signature modality of the Buhari government, if it desires to attract international support for its work on climate change.\~ Nigeria's power generation policy must shift towards promoting investments in renewable energy and reducing use of fossil energy. The FGN must continue to incentivize key players in this sector and spearhead investments in alternative energy. \~Finally, Nigeria should organize a post-COP national conference on modalities and structures for domesticating international agreements immediately and communicate same to the 36 states to ensure broad compliance. Work should also start immediately to ensure that Nigeria is able to access the GCF within the next one year as she stands to receive close to $3 million. Nigeria must shift from her business-as-usual approach and show the urgency required in climate actions. - Obaze is MD/CEO, Selonnes Consult Ltd.; Udeh is a Research Associate at Selonnes Consult Ltd. \"

The minister said this while addressing newsmen in Abuja on Nigeria's participation at the ongoing 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the UNFCCC in Marrakech, Morocco. She also noted that Nigeria is striving toward climate compatible sustainable development. 'There is the need to align policies, resources, institutions and legislation in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the global commitment on climate change,'' she said. She added that President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to officially announce the ratification of the Paris agreement on climate change at the ongoing COP22 , which the president had earlier signed on September 22 in New York. The minister said the agreement committed Nigeria along with other countries to put forward their efforts through the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and to strengthen the efforts in the years ahead. 'Nigeria together with other parties to the UNFCCC reached a historic agreement to combat climate change, to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future.'

The foundation joins the rest of the world to celebrate the coming into force of the Agreement which marks a significant achievement in just one year of the Agreement, making it three years earlier than planned. Among the 195 parties that negotiated and adopted the Paris Agreement, 97 nations (representing more than the required 55 percent, needed for the landmark Agreement to become legally binding) have ratified and submitted their instruments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), giving a clear indication of the support this agreement has received within the global community, particularly from governments, research institutions, investors, civil society organizations, bi/multilateral entities etc. NCF says it is happy that this legally binding agreement translates to a global effort working towards a secured environment and particularly a safe ecosystem for nature and biodiversity. 'We will always commend the efforts of the Nigerian government in catalysing climate action through the recent endorsement of the World Bank 'Ending Gas Flaring Target by 2030' while subsequently fast-tracking our country's target of ending gas flaring in 2020 instead of 2030', the foundation said. Continuing, it said, 'this is equally a demonstration of the nation's commitment to increasing its ambition in order to reduce carbon emission by 20 percent unconditionally and 45 percent conditionally as indicated in the Nationally Determined Contribution. However, we also enjoin the Federal Government to take bolder steps in joining other leading African countries not to stop at signing the Paris Climate Change Agreement but also ratifying and approving the treaty'. The world has witnessed an unprecedented cross-over of the carbon emission threshold of 400 ppm in 2016 which may not be reversible but must continue to work on climate actions that will prevent further carbon emission. Not forgetting that COP 22 in Marrakech is a key strategic global meeting which is meant to set the roadmap that will drive the implementation and realization of all nations' climate action, NCF is working with its international partners - BirdLife International (BI) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) - to contribute to the global discourse that will shape the demands from the African regional bloc. Furthermore, cross-cutting issues such as the required green technology and climate financing arrangement ($100 billion/year till 2020 promised by the developed world for developing countries) that is necessary to drive the implementation will be perfected and well negotiated towards its realization. \"

Speaking at a panel of African Ministers of Tourism, who met on the sidelines of the UN Conference on Climate Change in Marrakech, Morocco, on Thursday, the Minister said, however, that for tourism to be sustainable, it must first be put on a sound footing. 'We have a rich diversity in our culture and tourism sector. We have so much that the world wants to see. We have stories that the world wants to hear. 'But the challenge for us is to leverage our huge diversity to make tourism the next oil in Nigeria,'' he said. Alhaji Mohammed said that as a mark of its political will, the present administration is reviving the Presidential Council on Tourism (PCT) to drive the development of tourism in the country. Already, he said, the Steering Committee of the PCT has met to prepare the agenda for the PCT, which is expected to meet very soon and be presided over by the President. The Minister also said that since tourism cannot thrive without security, transparency and good infrastructure, the government is investing in massive infrastructural development (roads, rail, power, etc, adding: 'Security has improved drastically, especially in the North-east where Boko Haram has been decimated. 'The government also puts a lot of premium on transparency, which is required for boosting investor confidence and encouraging tourism. The fight against corruption has been ratcheted up, and no one is deemed to be a sacred cow as far as the fight against corruption is concerned. 'With all modesty, the present administration in my country has been working hard to move tourism from the margins to the mainstream, especially because tourism has been identified as one of the sectors upon which the government's economic diversification is anchored.

Themed 'Water for Sustainable Growth,' the Water Week 2016, had in attendance 3,100 participants from over 120 countries, with the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including the goal on water, as one of the key issues discussed by high-level policy makers, development and water professionals, researchers, civil society and private sector representatives. 'Water, the lifeline of our planet will be needed to achieve nearly every Sustainable Development Goal, and to face the challenges that climate change presents,' Director of World Water Week at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), Karin Lexen said. Throughout the week, there was a focus on implementation and action, particularly on local and city level, marking a transition from the global discussions and negotiations that led to the adoption of the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. 'In order to achieve the SDGs, cities and local leaderships are crucial; that is where we will find the drive. It is also important that civil society, businesses and social entrepreneurs are engaged, to learn from each other to create smart, viable and sustainable partnerships. Water is too important to keep inside the water community. Water is a central part of the entire society,' SIWI's Executive Director, Torgny Holmgren said. This was underlined by Sweden's Environment Minister, Karolina Skog, who said 'Water is a shared resource and a shared responsibility. The private sector has an important part to play. It has the competence, the technology and the ability to invest. Responsible water usage is an economical advantage and will pay off both for sustainable business models and for new innovations.' According to a press release, this year, World Water Week offered an opportunity for key actors to meet and take stock of progress towards the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement, from a water perspective. The week also welcomed representatives of the High Level Panel on Water, which was established earlier this year by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank President Jim Kim, with the aim of furthering the water-related SDGs. The Panel representatives used the week to get input from the wider water and development community. 'We must continue to focus on water as a carrier to achieve the 2030 Agenda, and to push for better integration of water into the global climate agenda,' said Lexen. Abdeladim Lhafi, High Commissioner for the upcoming the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention ( COP22 ) and High Commissioner for Water, Forestry and Fight Against Desertification in Morocco, told the closing session that COP21 in Paris was £ historical turning point, a diplomatic success, it was a COP of decisions. COP22 will be the conference of implementation.' 'Climate change is the challenge of our generation. There is a great need to identify risks and vulnerabilities. Preventive measures are much more cost-efficient than re-active ones. Smart water proofed climate investments will give payback in several ways,' Skog said. During the Week, climate was also discussed in relation to alleviating hunger in sub-Saharan Africa. Professor Malin Falkenmark, SIWI, called Africa's climate its 'Achille's Heel', and said that rainwater harvesting and other green water management methods are necessary to alleviate hunger in sub-Saharan Africa and meeting the SDGs. Together with other water and climate experts, she called for a Green Water Initiative in Africa. \"

'Environmental risk, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures and ultraviolet radiation, global environmental and social changes, including climate change, exacerbate many of these risks,'' WHO added. 'Only about three per cent of health resources are invested in prevention, with approximately 97 per cent that are spent on treatment and increasing healthcare costs. 'Health gains represent major social and economic benefits of environmental protection, and therefore should be put forward as key motivating forces for public support and political action,'' it said. Morocco, the WHO and the United Nations Environment Programme will host later in the day a ministerial meeting on health, environment and climate change. It added that the meeting would bring together health and environment ministers to promote healthier environments for healthier people.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria23","Natural disasters force 26 million into poverty, cost $520bn -World Bank","November 14, 2016 Monday","Nigerian Tribune","The impact of extreme natural disasters is equivalent to a global $520 billion loss in annual consumption, and forces some 26 million people into poverty each year, a new report from the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) reveals. 'Severe climate shocks threaten to roll back decades of progress against poverty,' said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. 'Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative.' The report, Unbreakable: Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters, warns that the combined human and economic impacts of extreme weather on poverty are far more devastating than previously understood. In all of the 117 countries studied, the effect on well-being, measured in terms of lost consumption, is found to be larger than asset losses. Because disaster losses disproportionately affect poor people, who have a limited ability to cope with them, the report estimates that impact on well-being in these countries is equivalent to consumption losses of about $520 billion a year. This outstrips all other estimates by as much as 60 per cent. With the climate summit, COP22 , underway, the report's findings underscore the urgency for climate-smart policies that better protect the most vulnerable. Poor people are typically more exposed to natural hazards, losing more as a share of their wealth and are often unable to draw on support from family, friends, financial systems, or governments. \"

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria25","Nigeria's faux anti-tobacco campaign","November 30, 2016 Wednesday","Nigerian Tribune","The hysteria that accompanies tobacco issues in Nigeria is particularly difficult to understand when viewed against the backdrop of developmental challenges that beset the country and its people on an ongoing basis. Take the case of Nigeria's participation in the just-concluded Conference of Parties (COP7) and ( COP22 ). While the former was on regulating tobacco use, the latter was on climate change. COP7 held in India; Nigeria was represented by officials of the Ministry of Health, Standards Organisation of Nigeria and members of the anti-tobacco campaign groups. President Muhammadu Buhari led Nigeria's delegation to COP22 , which was held in Morroco. You can be forgiven if you imagine that Nigerians will all be dying from tobacco use in the not-too-distant future, while the impact of climate change is at best a diversionary issue that should not be accorded any importance, with the sound and fury that is the anti-tobacco campaign. The impact of climate change in the country is profound. The milder impacts are seen in more regular and severe floods in areas that used not to experience flooding; prolonged drought and in the case of Nigeria, the disappearance of Lake Chad, with very damaging impact on habitat and livelihood of tens of millions of people living around the Lake Chad Basin. One of the consequences of climate change on Lake Chad is the strife over water and the consequent rise in terrorism among a people who were once considered agrarian and lovers of peace. While tobacco use is reported to be responsible for six million deaths annually across the globe, and preventing these avoidable deaths is important, how do you stop the accelerating impact of climate change with its potentially dire consequences such as drought, famine, displacement and deaths of tens of millions of Nigerians? When the theme of the recently-concluded COP7 was announced, there was optimism that the grave impact of illicit trade on youth access to tobacco and the underground trade in cigarettes fueling crime and terrorism, will receive much-needed attention. It turned out that the organisers could not hold themselves to the same standard that they prescribe for others. Deliberations and how conclusions were reached were made in the closet; invited journalists were literarily thrown out of the conference. Their participation in COP7 was limited to press conferences. If the organisers had nothing to hide, invited journalists ought to have been observers of the process and how decisions were reached. Organisers accused journalists of colluding with tobacco companies to undermine their efforts. This allegation is in reaction to many journalists challenging the World Health Organisation and the anti-tobacco lobby on the several untested, unverified and sometimes false 'facts' with which the WHO and tobacco lobby use to browbeat governments into toeing their line. COP7 fell well short of globally accepted standards of openness, accountability and clarity. This was made worse by the Nigerian anti-tobacco groups, that were billed as supporting cast, but turned out to be accuser-in-chief of the Nigerian delegation to COP7. While the conference was going on, these groups were busy churning out press releases besmirching the reputation of officials of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria and other government officials. Rather than argue the case against preventing journalists from attending the conference as the Nigerian delegation did, the anti-tobacco groups issued press statements widely published in the Nigerian press about Nigerian officials being on the payroll of tobacco companies. It is admirable that the Nigerian government officials stood for press freedom and public access to deliberations at COP7. It is, however, regrettable that the so-called champion of public good and accountability will support the repression of the media and embark on actions capable of eroding trust in public institutions and their officials. The anti-tobacco group's action at COP7 was all too familiar; rather than support Nigeria's official delegation to the conference, they positioned themselves as the only group championing Nigeria's interest. Controlling information and haranguing anybody or organisation that does not agree with its views are the two main tactics the local anti-tobacco groups with their foreign sponsors deploy to control the agenda. Nigeria is currently ranked 145 out of about 190 countries in smoking rates, with Egypt, South Africa and many other African countries way ahead of Nigeria. Tobacco use in Nigeria is not as pervasive as you will find in the home countries of the foreign sponsors of the local anti-tobacco lobby. Yet there is a pressing and urgent need to make tobacco the number one issue in Nigeria, ahead of impact of climate change, lack of infrastructure and inadequate social services as well as corruption in public service delivery. The dollar-denominated fund available to drive the anti-tobacco campaign is huge, attracting all sorts. That is why the anti-tobacco groups will not countenance a discussion on safer alternatives such as e-cigarette, or allow the media to see how, in their deliberations, they shut out any view that hints at challenging their orthodoxies. \"

Mr Bougonou Djeri-Alassani, the Head of Division, Environmental Policies and Regulations of the commission, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Wednesday. Djeri-Alassani, explained that many citizens depended on tree cutting to earn a living, hence the need for the consultation to tackle the challenges in the country. He suggested that adequate financial support be given to dependents on those natural assets to encourage and enable them find alternatives to their illegal businesses. Djeri-Alassani said the damages which were currently done in forests at the sub-region were dangerous for the future generation. According to him, ECOWAS has adopted a convergence plan for the sustainable management and utilisation of forest ecosystems and a Sub-Regional Action Programme to combat desertification in West Africa ""Tackling issues of illegal logging and sale of ivory products are not easy to handle without adequate consultation of experts in the field. ""If some supports can be given to the dependents of these forests, it will help to reduce illegal logging and sale of ivory produce,'' he said.

Addressing newsmen shortly on arrival from Morocco, the state governor, Professor Ben Ayade, who was also arriving from the just concluded United Nations conference of parties COP 22 in Marrakech, Morocco, noted that the pageant is a new addition to the state's vast tourism offerings. According to the governor, ""The pageant is a warm embrace to Africa and more importantly, to create a platform to discuss the fate of Africans. "" Ayade further maintained that ""the Miss Africa Beauty Pageant is a platform for the expression of intellectuality, capacity, unity, strength, vitality and the energy Africa represents.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria34","FAO Advocates Adaptable Irrigation Methods to Ensure Food Security","November 10, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that in order to adapt agriculture to a changing climate, new approaches to irrigation will need to be developed and implemented worldwide. These new approaches are being discussed as part of the 2nd World Irrigation Forum which opened Monday in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and brings together stakeholders from around the world to rethink water management in the context of continued population and economic growth as well as the growing threats of climate change. During the Forum, which wraps up on November 12, experts are expected to also discuss ways to improve water management in order to achieve global sustainable food security. FAO emphasised in a news release that in order to achieve food security, especially in developing countries, regular access to water must be made possible through irrigation. The agency cited irrigation as ""a key factor to help transform rural societies and economies,"" as it plays a critical role in ending poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, as well as sustaining natural resources and responding to climate change. The theme of this year's Forum is 'Water Management in a Changing World: the Role of Irrigation in Sustainable Food Production.' In her remarks, Assistant Director-General and FAO Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific, Kundhavi Kadiresan, announced that solutions to agriculture necessitated addressing water issues and that the challenges of today's water problems likewise depend on addressing food production. ""Future irrigation practices should also move beyond conventional approaches of productivity gains, and also focus on rural prosperity, facilitating inclusive, equitable and greener growth,"" she urged. The FAO expects the world population to rise to nine billion people by 2050, which will exacerbate the demand for food and water and require a scaling up of agricultural productivity to ensure that everyone is fed. The world must transition to more productive, resilient, and sustainable forms of agriculture in order to ensure its continuation at both local and industrial levels. This especially includes adapting water management systems to meet evolving challenges. The forum is expected to also adopt a Ministerial Declaration on delivering the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through agriculture water management. Ms. Kadiresan introduced the declaration through the FAO's new global initiative, ""Coping with Water Scarcity in Agriculture: a Global Framework for Action in a changing climate."" The objective's main initiative is to build on the FAO and partners' technical capacity in order to support worldwide development and policy implementation for sustainable water use in agriculture. The official launch of the Global Framework for Action will take place during the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP22 , in Marrakech, Morocco, which opened Monday. \"

The initiative brings together leading climate advocacy organizations around a set of six Principles for Dialogue on Climate Action, which will guide discussions at the global, local and country level as governments and their private sector partners implement plans and identify solutions to help deal with this major global crisis. ""When governments establish inclusive dialogue with the private sector as well as international organizations, civil society, and communities, they can produce better integrated and more comprehensive strategies capable of addressing a crisis whose impacts extend from remote villages and islands to the planet as a whole,"" the Principles read. Announcing the Principles, at the start of the Dialogue for Climate Action conference in Vienna, Austria, Anabel Gonzalez, Senior Director of the World Bank Group's Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice said, ""This represents a significant milestone in global climate action and is an important step forward in bringing together governments, businesses, and civil society to collectively take action to fight climate change. The principles help scale opportunities for industry action in climate change and investments in climate technologies and will help reinforce the global commitment made in Paris."" Climate change is a fundamental threat to economic development and has the potential to push 100 million people into poverty by 2030. The amount of work that needs to be done is considerable. Developing countries will need about $100 billion of new investments by 2020 to bolster their economic resilience against the effects of climate change. Cooperation between governments and the private sector can accelerate those investments in emerging economies, but dialogue between the two will be essential. ""Private sector must be a part of an effective solution to climate challenge,"" said Abdelouahed Fikrat, General Secretary, Moroccan Ministry of Environment.""These principles capture the essence and the starting point of how to design effective action oriented climate dialogues that allow public and private sector to collaborate. Morocco's experience and approach confirms that. A centre of competences for climate change (4C Morocco) established as a capacity building and dialogue platform for private and public actors as well as academia and civil society, is set up. The principles of the declaration and the event holds potential to contribute significantly to COP22 agenda and offer a real tool to policy makers to engage with private sector."" The private sector, with its significant financial resources and dedication to innovation, has a leading role to play in the urgent global effort to reduce the negative effects of climate change and create the healthy, thriving zero-carbon economy of the future. CEOs from industries ranging from textiles to technology companies have pledged to scale-up efforts and investment in climate action. Private sector involvement can take many forms, from development of new technologies and financial instruments to participation in policy development. For the private sector, effective dialogues, as outlined in the Principles for Dialogue on Climate Action, can increase the quality and predictability of the business environment in a green economy. In emerging markets, they can provide a path to growth for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and a means of moving people out of poverty. Signatories to the Principles include Ar\'e7elik A.S.; Business Initiative Leading Development (BUILD); Carbon Trust; CLASP; Dalberg Global Development Advisors; Danish Industry; SITRA; University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership; We Mean Business; and the World Bank Group.

The financial commitments were made by the nations concerned during the last COP held in Paris, France. The organisation also asked government at all levels in Nigeria to invest between 15 to 20 per cent of their budget into agriculture in 2017 to achieve 'sustainable diversification' of the economy from oil. At the 2016 Female Food Hero, 'Ogbonge' Award organised by Oxfam as part of the events to mark the World Food Day held in Markudi, Benue State, Oxfam Head of Programmes, Mr Constant Tchona, said that in Nigeria and many other developing countries, climate change is already hitting hard and is affecting the most vulnerable, such as women and children. According to him, climate change is increasingly making it more difficult for women to access their usual means of production such as land, and that they (women) are fast becoming more vulnerable to violent conflicts that often ensue as a result of stiff competition over scarce resources. 'In the north eastern, north western and the south western part of Nigeria, climate change has forced people to migrate from their communities. It has destroyed crops and infrastructure such as schools and roads. 'In February 2016 alone, over 300 people lost their lives over herdsmen and farmers' conflict right here in Benue State. This is a conflict over scarce over green pasture. Unfortunately, the reality is that these pockets of conflict will continue to rise if adequate attention is not given to climate change,' Tchona said. Wife of the Benue State Governor, Mrs Eunice Ortom, in her remark, said that food security is a top priority to every nation. 'We believe that agriculture is one of the key activities that Nigerians, particularly, women should adopt for their social and economic good.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria42","COP 21: WHERE LIES AFRICA'S PRIORITIES?","September 20, 2016 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","OVER 195 countries were represented at the just concluded United Nations climate change conference (COP21) in Paris, which was aimed at reaching a new universal climate agreement to limit the rise of global temperature. DOYIN ADEOYE, who followed the two-week event, brings the report, especially from Africa's perspective, as well as experts 'opinions on what lies ahead for Africa after COP 21. Climate change poses complex challenges for Africa, and as such, addressing climate change issues has become central to the continent's development agenda. The realisation of a need for an international political response to climate change started more than a decade ago with the 'Rio Earth Summit' in 1992, where the adoption of the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was birthed. And over the years, the Conferences of Parties (COPs) of the UNFCCC have become an important platform for improving global response to climate change. With major impacts on Africa as well as its growing economies, the COP 21 could not have been timelier, as it was an opportunity to put Africa as a strategic player in the negotiations, thereby ensuring that commitments under the new agreement are favourable to the continent's realities and solutions. Speaking with participants at the conference, United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, stressed that 'Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as much of its economy depends on a climate-sensitive natural resource base, including rain-fed subsistence agriculture. Disruptions in food or water supplies pose serious risks not only for African economies, but also for political stability, particularly in fragile states.' Ahead of the convergence of stakeholders for COP21, more than 180 countries submitted voluntary climate action plans to the UNFCCC, through the development of the Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDCs), and this supposedly formed the basis of the agreement reached at the end of the conference. Through the INDCs, countries stated their national contributions to the conference, within the context of their national priorities and capabilities. Although the African continent contributes only 3.8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, African countries are no doubt, among the most vulnerable. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon meets with Meeting with African Leaders John Dramani Mahama, President of Ghana, Alpha Cond , President of Guinea, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of Mali --H.E. Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of Niger . Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon meets with Meeting with African Leaders John Dramani Mahama, President of Ghana, Alpha Cond , President of Guinea, . Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria - Nigeria, like many other countries, has not been spared by climate change and we continue to incur considerable costs in addressing challenges of both environmental and economic nature. As stated in its INDCs, climate change poses a significant threat to the achievement of development goals of the country, especially those related to eliminating poverty and hunger and promoting environmental sustainability. 'Agriculture is one of the sectors most sensitive to climate change. Under a business-as-usual scenario, agricultural productivity could decline between 10 to 25 per cent by 2080. Also, a considerable proportion of the population is at risk of water stress, with less than 40 per cent having direct access to potable water. 'Climate change would result in increased variability in rainfall, predictably resulting in floods in many parts of the country, particularly the humid areas, with devastating consequences. Single extreme climate events have the potential to wipe out years of development. For example, the total value of destroyed physical and durable assets caused by the 2012 floods has been estimated to be N1.48 trillion (US$9.5 billion) or about 2 per cent of the rebased GDP of US$510 billion,' it stated. These, among many other issues were highlighted, while also noting that the Federal Government's economic growth plan, Nigeria Vision 20:2020, Economic Transformation Blueprint (2009), recognises the changing climate as a threat to sustainable growth in the next decade. 'It sees climate change as a critical challenge globally and, in Nigeria, as a potential driver of damaging and irrecoverable effects on infrastructure, food production and water supplies, in addition to precipitating natural resource conflicts. This recognition is an important first step towards a climate change adaptation strategy and action plan.' With emissions projected to grow at 114 per cent by 2030 to around 900 million tonnes, this is around 3.4 tonnes for every Nigerian. Under a high growth scenario, with economic growth at 7 per cent, this climbs to over one billion tonnes. At least 54 African nations adopted a unified position, calling for an agreement to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. Speaking at the leaders' event, where over 150 heads of states and governments gathered on Monday, 30 November, President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, said that 'the Post-2020 climate change agreement should enhance the implementation of the convention, including the long-term global goal of holding the rise in temperature to 1.5 degree Celsius. 'It should also reaffirm the obligations of developed country Parties to provide additional, predictable and sustainable support in terms of finance, technology and capacity building to meet the adaptation and mitigation needs of the developing-country parties,' he said. President Jacob Zuma of South Africa also noted that for his country, its INDC includes a commitment to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, through a set of national adaptation goals, while also noting that 'the Paris Agreement should address the interests of all countries and empower everyone to contribute their best efforts, based on equity and differentiation.' The Agreement Eventually agreed upon on Saturday, 12 December, a day after the Convention was scheduled to end, the historic Paris Agreement sets an ambitious goal of keeping a global temperature rise at no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and to strive for a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, who also served as the President of COP 21, described the agreement as fair and legally binding. 'The Paris Agreement allows each delegation and group of countries to go back home with their heads held high. Our collective effort is worth more than the sum of our individual effort. Our responsibility to history is immense,' he said. pic-18-president-buhari-attends-u-n-climate-change-conference-in-parisFrench President, Francois Hollande described it as £n ambitious agreement, a binding agreement and a universal agreement.' The Paris Agreement covers all the crucial areas identified as essential for a landmark conclusion, which are Mitigation: reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; A transparency system and global stock-take: accounting for climate action; Adaptation: strengthening ability of countries to deal with climate impacts; Loss and damage: strengthening ability to recover from climate impacts; and Support: including finance for nations to build clean and resilient futures. So why is COP 21 so important, especially for Africa? The committed involvement of the United States and China has helped to step up the scale of negotiations compared to other COPs. Although, there really is not much out there to comment on Africa's position, what is key is Africa has to increase on her capability to address adaptation to climate change in better ways. Also our perusal of Nigeria's INDC appears acceptable. However, Nigeria has to also aggressively tackle the issue of desertification in the 11 front-line states which has been recognised as a major cause of climate change in our territory. The adverse socio-economic effects of the consequences of desertification include poverty, exacerbating conflicts and security concerns, among others. So, the development of the Great Green Wall should therefore still remain on the top burner of national discuss. -Dr Newton Jibunoh Founder, Fight Against Desert Encroachment (FADE) Africa The experience for me was awesome, and the events we attended were all well managed despite the tragic events in Paris a few weeks before the Convention. Honestly, I think Africa was led by Nigeria, and the appointment of Amina Mohammed as the Environment Minister proved inspirational. All of Africa has to prepare for climate change; it is coming, COP21 can only minimise the impact of it. However, I believe that the transfer of capital to the developing nations to cope with and slow down the impact of climate change is critical. It is also very important that all African counties stick to the agreed reductions in emissions and even try to push further.-Lolade OresanwoChief Operating Officer, WestAfricaENRG To achieve the projected average global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century, there should be a legally binding agreement to that effect, and not one which the big emitters, United States typically, would wriggle out or disregard. We have learnt after the COP at Copenhagen from United States making financial commitments and almost a decade after, providing nothing. Africa will be in for a surprise after COP21 because personally, I feel that many developed countries especially in Europe, are already significantly decoupling development from Carbon emissions. Examples are Germany, Sweden and United Kingdom. Whilst Africa expects capacity building in terms of technologies and financing, some of the countries in Europe will find it difficult to make these financial contributions, at least to the extent African countries expect. So for a country like Nigeria, I insist that the solution is at home.-Professor Chinedum NwajiubaExecutive Director, Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) Developing countries in Africa have a lot of work to do to turn aspirations of reducing carbon emissions into reality. In the current global economic climate, a focus on more efficient use of resources can help drive the actions and behaviours that lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. The timeline for the deal on carbon emissions targets that is agreed at the end of COP21 is by 2020, so, the work towards genuine emissions reductions needs to have started. -Ayodeji Ogunyemi Director, Advisory Services, Ernst and Young, Nigeria Being a part of the historic event was a good experience, and I think African countries put their cases across very well. However, from the draft agreement, it was largely written in the absence of the negotiation process. With the articles published, it is obvious that much of it is exactly as projected long before the COP21. So therefore the contributions from African countries and other developing nations have, in my view, been ignored in the substance of the agreement and just included in the non-legally binding preamble.In terms of outcomes, I do not think this is a sustainable solution for developing countries. For me, it is hard to see exactly what will be measured and the reward or penalty for not achieving the reduction in emissions. I believe African countries articulated their concerns regarding climate change very well, but they did not lobby in the lead up events enough to get those concerns into the substance of the document.Climate change is affecting Africa more than any other continent and I am a little worried post COP21 for African countries, particularly in the concept of 'Technology Development and Transfer.' Looking at Articles 6 and 9 of the Agreement, one can imagine that the transfer of much needed capital will be based on conditions, and we know from experience that any financial conditions will always favour those providing the capital, i.e. developed economies. \"

However, some other countries are harvesting another natural resource to meet energy demands\- Wind. Yes, Ethiopia, a nation in East Africa is making a big to become the largest producer of wind-generated energy. Well, Ethiopia's plan to lead the African continent is one that seems to be following a track of improvement, before the Adama II project came online, in 2013, the Ashedoga plant with its 84 turbines and a capacity of 120 megawatts to power 100,000 homes was the largest wind farm in Africa. The country has two smaller wind farms near Adama, southeast of Addis Ababa, with a capacity of 51 megawatts each. Currently, energy output in Ethiopia is over 4,000 megawatts, which is mainly sourced from hydroelectric power, however, that is set to change with the government's plan to increase output to about 17,000 megawatts with wind power playing a major role. Erratic power supply is still rampant; according to the World Bank, less than 30 percent of Ethiopia is connected to the electricity grid and the country needs the energy to drive economic growth that has averaged more than 10 percent in the past decade. Wind power is also expected to offer benefits for surrounding communities by providing jobs and the opportunity to export energy. Already Ethiopia exports energy to neighbouring countries Kenya and Sudan. The target is to become a leading force in the use of wind power capital is no easy feat. The government plans to build at least five more wind farms, and potentially more, aiming to deliver up to 5,200 megawatts sourced from wind power in the next four years. Credit: CNN [sourced from Ethiopia Electric Power Corporation] As ambitious as the plan sounds, the use of alternative, cleaner energy sources fall within the country's plan to have a ""climate resilient"" economy by 2030, just as it made a commitment to cut its carbon emissions by 64 percent at the Paris conference.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria44","Nuclear key to a clean energy future: IEA World Energy Outlook","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","SweetCrude Reports","The cooling towers of the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 16 November 2016, Sweetcrude, Lagos  Nuclear energy is an important pillar of a future energy system aimed at meeting the world's growing energy needs and avoiding the worst effects of climate change, according to a new report published today by the International Energy Agency. The World Energy Outlook 2016 450 scenario, aimed at limiting an increase in global temperatures due to climate change to less than 2 degrees C, shows global nuclear generation output increasing by almost two and a half times by 2040, compared to the present day, from 2535 TWh to 6101 TWh. In this scenario low carbon energy sources dominate the generation mix. Hydro generates 20%, nuclear 18%, wind 18% and solar PV 9%. Fossil fuel generation declines sharply, with gas supplying 16%, coal 9% and oil 1%. The remaining 9% is supplied by a range of other low carbon sources. World Nuclear Association Director General, Agneta Rising said, ""We must meet the world's growing energy needs and protect the planet. We will need all low carbon energy options to work together to achieve this, and nuclear will make a major contribution, because it is scalable, reliable and competitive."" The high efficiency and stable supplies produced by nuclear plants mean they are able to generate more electricity from the same capacity of the plant, in comparison to intermittent renewables. For example, under the 450 scenario nuclear and wind generates virtually the same amount of electricity, but nuclear does so with just 820 GW of installed capacity, while wind requires 2,321 GW. Nuclear generation is a cost-competitive low-carbon generation option according to the IEA report. The cost per unit of electricity produced from wind or solar PV being 22-40% higher than that from nuclear generation, even without counting the additional costs of adapting the grid and providing the back-up generation required to compensate for their intermittent supply. The IEA's report states that even further decarbonisation will be needed to meet the goal of the UNFCCC's Paris Agreement, which aims to hold the global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C and to pursue a target of 1.5 degrees C. The nuclear industry's Harmony goal aims for nuclear generation capacity to triple, with 1000 GW of new nuclear build by 2050. Agneta Rising will address the contribution of nuclear energy to mitigate against climate change in a press conference at the COP 22 climate change meeting in Marrakech on Thursday 17th November at 15:00.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria45","U.S. to Assist Nigeria On Climate Change","September 08, 2016","Leadership (Abuja)","The United States government has pledged to assist Nigeria in resolving challenges bordering on climate change in line with its bilateral relationship with Nigeria. The US Special Envoy on Climate Change, Mr Jonathan Pershing, who disclosed this in Abuja yesterday when he led a 5-man delegation to the Ministry of Environment, said that climate change has dire consequences on every aspect of life. ""Climate change is one of those issues that no sector will avoid because it narrows to livelihood in agriculture communities, fisheries communities, water and preservation of conflict and there is nothing that escapes the consequences of climate change. He said the essence of visiting Nigeria is to converse with the federal government on what the US government could do bilaterally as part of their global efforts towards solving the problems of climate change. Pershing emphasized that Nigeria being a major player in the continent has to reinvigorate a clear leadership role stressing that with commitment from the US government that there would be strong partnership between the two countries. On the financial commitment, he said, ""Quite a lot of resources have been provided by the United States including in the health which connects back to climate, food security which connects back to climate, technical assistance in the energy sector which connects back to climate and part of our multilateral process between climate funds which is exclusively geared for countries around the world. On her part, the Minister of Environment, Mrs Amina Mohammed expressed satisfaction that President Muhammadu Buhari would attend the UN General Assembly (UNGA 71) by September even as she hoped that Nigeria would sign the financing agreement. According to her, ""We have done things with water resources and agriculture to ensure that we are a concrete part of the diversification, so you will see that the value chain we are talking about in agriculture includes crops that will be climate resistance but we can approach different technologies to make that work. She said though the ministry doesn't have adequate funding to execute some of its project that they would ensure that other sectors involved in greening the economy are investing in cleaner technology, renewable energy and climate change. Mohammed pointed out that Green Climate Fund (GCF) is one of the financing mechanisms which the ministry hoped to utilize in funding climate change and other projects but regretted that it's been difficult accessing the funds. ""Secondly, we will look at the green bonds to see how we can attract private sectors into pipeline projects that are informed by our Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) and through that, we can bring good revenue flows. She was enthusiastic that Nigeria would improve on the COP 22 agreement adding that the ministry is working on the existing expertise to provide solutions to climate change. \"

APC govs angry with Buhari","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","The Sun (Nigeria)","Over ambassadorial nominees, board appointments From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye and \~Fred Itua, Abuja Vice Over ambassadorial nominees, board appointments From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye and \~Fred Itua, Abuja Osinbajo represented President Muhammadu Buhari who is currently attending the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also known as COP-22 , in Marrakech, Morocco. The governors at the meeting were Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun), Rochas Okorocha (Imo), Abdulaziz Yari (Zamfara), Abubakar Sani Bello (Niger) and Jubrilla Bindow (Adamawa). At the parley which took place at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, the governors expressed displeasure with Buhari's\~refusal to consult them. They were angry over non-reconstitution of federal boards as well as the controversial ambassadorial nominees' list, which has seen two nominees rejecting the offers. Before Buhari left the country, Saraki had met with him thrice over his request for approval to get $29.9 billion loan. The Senate had recently rejected Buhari's request for the facility. The MTEF is yet to be approved by the Senate. Saraki, when approached by State House Correspondents to speak on what transpired at the meeting, said: "" I am sure the VP will issue a statement. But nothing of great alarm. It's all for good governance, inclusion and collaboration with all arms. The states are here, National Assembly executives just came up with ideas on how to make things work even better, that's all."" No official statement on the meeting was issued at Press time. But a source at the meeting said\~Osinbajo, who tried to calm the governors, assured those in attendance that critical stakeholders in the party will be carried along in any future major appointments. According to the source, the meeting\~was part of President Buhari's ongoing peace moves to reconcile aggrieved members of the ruling party. He told Daily Sun what transpired: ""There was a meeting at the Villa today (yesterday), chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The Senate President, Bukola Saraki was there. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara was there. The Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Babachir David Lawal was also there. ""There were six All Progressives Congress (APC) governors from the six geopolitical zones.

""The two main things discussed were appointment of federal board members and the ambassadorial nominees recently sent to the Senate. The President is beginning to adopt a more collaborative approach. ""The President has now decided to reach out to stakeholders in the party on major issues. Going forward, he wants to ensure that everyone is carried along. Almost everyone was represented at the meeting. ""The governors complained about recent appointments made by Buhari and questioned why they were not carried along. The governors, Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives have been assured that they will be carried along. ""The issue of loan request did not come up.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria47","Crowding the private sector into Africa's climate action","December 13, 2016 Tuesday","Ventures Africa","The global community for climate action was spooked by the November 8 election of Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. The US President-elect had earned the sobriquet of  climate denier for his claim that climate change is a hoax. However, there is cautious optimism that his presidency will not overturn the global agenda on climate change. Hopefully, his views on climate change will change and align with reality when he settles into the Oval Office. Policymakers also believe that global climate agreements cannot be reversed easily. In the meantime, stakeholders are pressing on with formulating strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations\' agency on climate change held on November 7 \- 18 in Marrakech, Morocco. At the climate talks, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, Pakistan and seven other countries ratified the December 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A total of 111 countries, including the United States, China and member countries of the European Union ratified the agreement by the time COP 22 concluded. Since the Paris accord entered into force on November 4th, quite earlier than anticipated, global action against climate change has effectively shifted to strategic programming. Therefore, in Marrakech, Canada, Germany, Mexico and the United States published their plans to significantly decarbonise their economies by 2050. A group of 47 developing nations also committed to running entirely on renewable energy sources  as rapidly as possible. Some of the plans are already gaining traction. Investments in renewable energy totalled $286 billion in 2015. This surpassed by 3 percent the previous high of renewable energy investment achieved in 2011. Data gleaned from Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2016, a joint publication by United Nations Environment Programme and Bloomberg, further revealed that last year coal and gas-fired electricity generation drew less than half the record investment made in solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. The trend in renewable energy investment is a mixed bag, even in developing countries. China alone accounted for 55 percent of total investment last year; Africa\' s share was less than 5 percent. As climate change mitigation is being driven by investment in green energy, Africa is already taking the familiar position at the back seat on the \' green energy train\' . This was not unanticipated by climate policymakers. Although China is the clear leader in investment in renewables, other developing countries, in particular the low-income countries, are not expected to be able to keep pace without international assistance. But the advanced countries appear to be reneging on their pledges to help finance both mitigation and adaptation frameworks in the developing world, including Africa. This generated some rumblings in Marrakech, with regard to the commitment by the developed countries to raise $100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate actions in developing countries. Disappointing as this is, the prospects of improvement in international assistance at the required scale are not assuring. One, virtually all the advanced countries have been bedevilled by over half a decade of weak economic growth. This has put investment in infrastructure below ideal levels, suggesting near-term pressure on the fiscal regimes to close the infrastructure gap, create domestic jobs, and boost economic growth. Two, the economic malaise is also driving populist nationalistic sentiments in Europe and the United States. The backlashes for the emerging isolationist regimes are expected to include decline in international trade, further political uncertainties, shrinking and closed borders, and volatility in financial markets \- acting together to further put downward pressure on economic growth and constrict foreign aid. Three, the developing world has ceased to be monolithic. A handful of the countries have recently made significant economic and financial advances. These countries, including the BRICS economies, and the countries of the Gulf States that have amassed huge reserve savings, are expected to underline their climate strategies by investment. The less fortunate countries will continue to rely on overseas development assistance, although the gap between pledges and delivery will continue to widen. Without a united front, commitment to pledges for climate change mitigation and adaptation will continue to slack, with consequences for vulnerable populations. Africa that is left behind in the transition to the green economy will be worse off than it is today. As the drive towards decarbonisation gathers pace, Africa\' s oil economies will face more intense fiscal challenges. Given the strong link between government balance sheets and private sector balance sheets, this will result in serious constraint for business growth and profit. Therefore, it is in the enlightened self-interest of African private sector to begin to mobilise investment capital for Africa\' s climate action. For starters, the private sector is best suited to take the lead role in innovating climate solutions and green development. In Africa, the frontiers for the innovations are in power and agriculture. These are sectors that have been far less developed, compared to services sectors. Happily, countries including Nigeria have recently enacted reforms in both their power and agriculture sectors. These reforms are geared towards mobilising private sector resources, having relaxed statist control and incentivised investment. Accordingly, the private sector can leverage reforms that have relaxed the centralisation of the power grid to innovate and finance off-grid electricity solutions. Opportunities for Public Private Partnerships are also opening up as subnational governments are seeking to accelerate improvement in the power sector. These are happening in the region that is well endowed with solar energy and wind resources. Similarly, various reforms in the agriculture sector have factored the need for climate resilience in national food security policies. But there is significant knowledge gap in Africa\' s agriculture which cannot be left to the smallholder farmers and governments to fill. Private investments across the agriculture value-chain are needed to help close the knowledge gap and support adaptation mechanisms in rural farming communities. Token actions towards building the green economy cannot remain an option for Africa\' s private sector. The risks are dangerously stacked. Without adequate climate action, African farmers could lose between 40 percent and 80 percent of their croplands for growing grains. Also, the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are dire for even urban populations. But the question remains: how will private sector resources be mobilised? No doubt, significant capacity lies with the African financial institutions, including the development finance banks and to a lesser extent the export credit agencies. But there has been risk aversion and shortage of risk-sharing market instruments. In the Nigerian banking industry, for example, aversion towards risk in agribusiness has hampered funding by financial institutions. And funding pooled at the instance of Central Bank of Nigeria for on-lending to agro-SMEs has historically under-performed. A further drag is the macroeconomic conditions, which are driving interest rates more and more beyond the affordability of agro-entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers. To unlock private sector funding, therefore, the blockades at both demand and supply sides of the credit market have to be addressed by smarter policies and more faithfulness with implementation. But this will not be enough. There has to be a framework for sharing expertise on the continent. The good news is that such frameworks that pool resources, help to mitigate risk, and share knowledge in mobilising climate actions already exist. At the supranational level, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) was founded in 2012 as an agency of the African Union with the mandate to finance climate resilience and crisis response. The ARC has since 2014, operated a specialist hybrid mutual insurance company, the ARC Limited, as a financial affiliate to manage natural disaster risks for participating governments through the issuance of insurance policies. In furtherance of its mandate, the ARC is set to roll out an Extreme Climate Facility (XCF), which will issue multi-peril, climate change catastrophe bonds. The securitization instruments will bring scale and knowhow to Africa\' s climate risk management and climate change adaptation efforts, with tremendous benefits to the agriculture sector. XCF\' s catastrophe bonds are expected to attract not only investment from the private sector, especially indigenous African banks, but also from international financial institutions. One hopes that the XCF will soon be deployed, and the rigorous risk modelling it plans to have in place will serve other market initiatives. Necessary as it is for Africa to take responsibility for its resilience to climate change and to develop its adaptation mechanisms, the continent should not be denied \' climate justice.\' The heavily-industrialised countries account for overwhelming proportions of the emissions that are heating the planet and are intensifying climate risks for vulnerable populations in less-industrialised developing countries. This makes the delivery of aid towards adaptation in developing countries quite mandatory. Foreign aid is also required to catalyse market frameworks in developing countries, and secure part of the moral planks on which the much-celebrated Paris accord rest. \"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria48","Urbanisation in Africa: a blessing or a curse?","September 22, 2016 Thursday","Ventures Africa","Leapfrogging has been Africa\' s prominent strategy towards dominating the global territory. Africa\' s burgeoning global image as a top destination for investment is fostering a massive inflow of Foreign Direct Investment into the continent. Countries\' progressive strides in implementing growth strategies  such as Rwanda in executing its 2020 vision  have proven that focus and positive determination by government and business leaders can achieve tremendous growth within Africa. Tanzania\' s economy is estimated to grow by 7.2 percent in 2016, compared to 7 percent from last year. With the success of sectors such as financial technology, Africa proves that it could join developed economies in creating endogenous growth. Africa\' s prospect for growth is very positive despite current economic trends. A recently released Mckinsey Global Institute Report (Lions on the move II: Realizing the Potentials of African Economies) reveals that Africa\' s real GDP growth dropped to 3.3 percent a year between 2010 and 2015, compared to 5.4 percent between 2000 and 2010. Looking critically at the cause of the decline, the political turmoil in Northern Africa and drop in oil prices led to the growth decline in the continent. Oil-exporting economies in Africa contribute 40 percent of Africa\' s GDP. These oil exporting countries in Africa had a decline in GDP growth from 7.3 percent yearly between 2000 and 2010 to 4.0 percent between 2010 and 2015. Arab Spring countries such as Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia accounting for 18 percent had no growth between 2010 and 2015, compared to 4.8 percent GDP growth between 2000 and 2010. Despite this decline, research reveals that the prospects for growth within African economies are still high. By 2025, Africa is expected to double its manufacturing output; $2.1 trillion would be spent on household consumption and $3.5 trillion on Business to Business (B2B) in Africa. Taking a cue in the development of Africa, it\' s important to critically analyse the factors that led to the current level of the continent\' s economic growth. It\' s also significant to determine whether these catalysts can adequately lead Africa to achieve its projected potentials. Realizing Africa\' s Potential Research has shown that Africa\' s move towards industrialization and infrastructural development has led to mass migration from rural areas to urban centres. Citizens and their search for better education, higher incomes, healthcare facilities, good roads, and water have led millions to leave villages and small towns for cities. Foreign migration into these cities has also being a reason for rapid urbanization growth. Cities like Cairo, Lagos, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg have experienced a rapid increase in the population over the years. Lagos, whose population was about 1.4 million in 1970, is currently estimated at 21 million in 2016. The city\' s population is expected to double by 2050. Africa is the world\' s fastest urbanizing region. Over the next decade, the meteoric rise in economic growth is estimated to increase the number of citizens in African cities by 187 million. It is also estimated that between 2015 and 2045, an average of 24 million additional people is projected to live in cities each year, compared with 11 million in India and nine million in China. In several parts of the world, urbanization has been accompanied by industrialization and economic development, as increases in productivity in manufacturing and services benefited from proximity and concentration of activities and inputs. Is Africa\' s urbanization target achievable? Revenue base of African countries African countries still have low mediums of generating revenue. Statistics reveal that tax collection is relatively low in Africa as compared to other regions. In Nigeria, analysts reveal that 70 percent of the country\' s GDP does not generate revenue. This is also evident in other African economies; Angola, Kenya, and Ghana\' s tax revenues are lower than 12 percent of their GDPs. Life insurance and pension funds remain underutilized in Africa. In 2013, life insurance premiums amounted to two percent of GDP, compared with an average of 4.3 percent in OECD countries. Out of this two percent, South Africa accounts for 90 percent of the continent\' s life insurance business by volume. Pension funds amounted to 28 percent of GDP in 2014. In Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, the percentage of GDP was less than 15 percent. Increasing the utilization of these investment vehicles could boost domestic investment by approximately $55 billion yearly by 2025, which is 65 percent higher than 2014 levels. African countries need to diversify. The slump in commodity prices globally proved the instability of top exporting countries within the continent. Diversification aids the increase in revenue channels for the government to boost growth and development. Africa\' s infrastructural state Outside South Africa and North Africa, Africa spends only 1.3 percent of GDP on infrastructure. The saddening figure reveals that minimal efforts are being made to facilitate the improvement of infrastructure on the continent. Infrastructural deficits are a major cause of the high costs of production in most areas within Africa. Africa needs to double its infrastructural investments from $80 billion in 2015 to $150 billion in 2025 to reduce this deficit and to meet our industrialisation growth target. Roads in Africa are still poorly connected. Africa has the worst road network of all regions globally. High transport costs add to the high fragmentation of the continent. Transportation costs from West Africa to the United States are twice those of other regions. It takes more than 40 days for goods to pass the border in Africa; less than half that time in Latin America. For landlocked countries, the constraints are even bigger. Africa\' s housing deficit is a big cause for concern. Africa\' s most populous country, Nigeria, currently faces a housing deficit of over 19 million houses. The estimated number is set to increase due to the inflow of new urbanites within the next decade. Housing facilities would be needed for an estimated 190 million expected to migrate to urban cities by 2025. Regulatory standards and legal frameworks in Africa John G. Rice, Global Vice Chairman of General Electric (GE), in a panel of the World Economic Forum on Africa held in May 2016 said,  We are working on an Emergency Power Project in Ghana that is taking us 16 months to get to the purchase price agreement approval by parliament. That\' s an  emergency power project . I don\' t know how long it will take if it wasn\' t an emergency project. In Nigeria, the Treasury Single Account (TSA) was introduced in 2012 by the Federal Government. The financial policy was however not implemented till 2015 by President Muhammadu Buhari\' s administration. Even after implementation, SystemSpecs, the company that created and manages the TSA through their payment platform \- Remita \- are still in a feud with the federal government over their payment agreement. John Tani-Obaro, the Managing Director of SystemSpecs, complained about the situation. He said in August 2016 that  it has been 17 months of working without getting paid. Political interests and short-term expediencies have stalled the development of projects within the continent. This reflects in the low Public Private Partnerships in Africa which is estimated at 4.5 percent in the region. Regulatory standards also have to be improved upon to ensure the quality of processes and products are in line with the authorized criteria. Last Thursday, the BBC reported that  dirty fuel is been sold by Swiss commodity companies to African countries. These unethical practices are seen around Africa and they stifle the efforts of indigenous companies in competition with global companies. The textile industry in Nigeria was a victim of poor regulations. Cheap and poor quality materials brought into the country affected the indigenous companies whose prices could not compete with those foreign products. Regulatory standards require more thoroughness to help grow companies within the continent. African economies need to improve on bureaucratic processes in order to eliminate inefficiencies and speed up the rate of development within the region. A blessing or a curse? Africa\' s rapid growth in development raises the argument whether Africa is adequately prepared or not. The non-preparation for this growth poses a big threat to the sustainability and livelihoods of Africans living within these communities. Africa\' s leap towards urbanization growth would pose great challenges. In an interview with Ventures Africa, Chidiogo Akunyili, Senior Manager, Global Shapers Community, Africa & Global Leadership Fellow at the World Economic Forum said that  attention should be on concrete measures to mitigate against the potential challenges of rapid urbanisation and support the many benefits of, not least of all, its contribution to growth . These potential challenges need to be addressed as growth increases, some which are highlighted below: Traffic and internal congestion The traffic problem in African cities is a big problem for the continent. Traffic congestion affects the health of citizens. Traffic congestion reduces the productivity of citizens within cities and this leads to a loss of potential revenue that cities could generate. In Kenya, World Health Organisation estimates that 13, 000 Kenyan citizens lose their lives to road traffic accidents yearly. It is estimated that Kenya loses about 50 million shillings daily due to unproductivity caused by traffic congestions. On Mondays in Ikeja, Lagos, the traffic is usually at a standstill for hours. Transports cost are usually doubled, and sometimes, scores of Lagosians are forced to trek to their destinations. Some African cities have seen reduced traffic congestions. However, these cities are still slow in creating and maintaining transport systems to cater for their fast growth. Traffic congestion in Capetown Climate change, flooding and drought Flooding has been a major crisis that Africa has battled with over the years. The continent has experienced excessive flooding throughout 2016; being estimated as the highest rate in 50 years. South Sudan has experienced 98 deaths and over 200,000 people have been affected by flooding in only 2016. On Tuesday it was reported that in Jigawa state, Nigeria, 18 people have died and 6,637 houses have been destroyed as a result of flooding during this rainy season. Poor drainage systems, poor sewage disposal habits, and poor structural plans (illegal structures) have led to the increase in flooding in cities. In July, it was reported that a flooding incident that occurred in Cape Town and Durban led to a death toll of 9 people. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people were affected by the flood. A major cause of this extreme flooding situation is climate change. Climate change has been a major discussion among policy circles. Forums such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference have increased the commitments of African leaders towards reducing the effect of climate change on the continent. However, more efforts need to be placed by political leaders and organisations towards climate change in Africa. Drought, desertification, flooding and other extreme weather changes are areas that need proper planning. Beijing\' s climate dilemma is a situation for Africa to learn from. The blanketing effect of smog within the city has affected the affect the productivity and health of the citizens. China\' s slow action towards solving the issue should be a warning on effective planning towards the threats of climate change in Africa. Flooding in Lagos Technology Technology has greatly helped in boosting the economic growth in Africa. The success of mobile money, smartphones, and Internet penetration has pushed the growth of the African economy and also boosted social inclusion. Technology has also improved production processes by providing more efficient operations systems resulting in increased profitability and reduction in unemployment. Arguments have been made in favour and against the effect of technology on enhancing sustainable development globally. The emergence of technological breakthroughs in the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing have changed the mode of living globally. Fears have arisen that the rapid pace of technological innovations could reduce the availability of employment opportunities. In Africa, the worries are greater because of the high illiteracy rate and slow pace of educational growth. Analysts predict that the future would be taken over by fully automated processes reducing the number of jobs within the continent. The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) globally reflects the rising pace of technology improvements in production processes and development. Focusing on economies with large populations such as China, massive retrenchments have been undertaken based on the growth of AI. Foxconn, Apple\' s production partner in China in 2016, reduced their workforce from 1.1 million to 500,000 staff by replacing them with robots. In India, Wipro threatened it could sack 3000 engineers due to the company\' s business automation process. Companies looking towards improving profitability are replacing human labour machines to boost productivity efficiency. The need for companies to improve productivity efficiency and profitability is beneficial to business growth. However, when this growth favours only a few within the economy and discourages financial inclusiveness, then there this is cause for concern. Africa is faced with the dilemma of embracing the fourth industrial revolution and providing employment opportunities to its over 1.2 billion population. The sporadic rate of technological innovations calls for the determination of whether Africa would embrace absolute adoption of technological waves or governments will focus on how technology can be adopted sustainably within the continent to enable the disruptive blessing of urbanisation to not be a curse. The need for urgency Africa\' s rapid growth stresses the urgent need for broad strategic sustainability plans by all stakeholders to accommodate the fast development of the continent. As Chidiogo said,  As long as infrastructural development and access to basic housing, water, electricity, roads, schools, hospitals, government services, markets and so on do not keep up with population growth, the cities in question will literally crumble under their overflowing load to a shell of their full potential.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria49","AfDB President calls for insurance of African","November 17, 2016 Thursday","Business Day","Africa needs urgent global assistance to meet up with insurance premiums which will insure countries against climate change induced catastrophic events which is on the rise. The insurance which will reduce climate induced displacement across the African continent and help curb the diversion of public funds which could have been used for the development of infrastructure in the countries is said to be the solution to climate change adaptation. President of the African Development Bank, Akinwunmi Adesina on Wednesday made the call at the Africa Action Day summit on the sidelines of the ongoing Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakech. 'What is needed now is support to assist African countries in meeting the insurance premium cost. here is the solution. We will like to call on the global finance facilities, the green climate fund and the global environment facility to pay for the insurance premium for African countries to the African Risk Capacity Agency. 'This action whole will insure Africa, it will reduce climate induced displacement of public expenditures in Africa' he said adding that 'words of comfort are not enough to pay Africa's rising bills for adapting to climate change. I urge your excellencies our Presidents to support this call for action'. According to Adesina, Africa cannot develop in the dark. Africa is simply tired of being in the dark, he said. He further explained that for this reason the African Development Bank is going to be investing $12billion in energy in the next five years. The bank, he said has also set up the Independent delivery unit for the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative as demanded by the Presidents. 'These are tough times in Africa, the decline in commodity prices is taking a toll on several countries, constricting their fiscal space. Therefore Africa has very limited space to adjust to and to cope with more exogenous trusts. That is why we must pay close attention to the recent event of climate change that are further worsening the fiscal environment for African countries. 'Climate change is causing major displacement and bordering expenditures across Africa. Monies that should be used to boost investment in growth enhancing infrastructure and energy or job creation for the youth are being diverted to cope with effect of climate change' he said. A World Bank report says Sub saharan Africa will need between $14 to $17 billion per year for the adaptation of climate change between 2010 through 20150. The African Risk Capacity was formed in 2012 by African Union member countries alongside a mutual insurer capitalised at $200million which amounted to 131million pounds by the United Kingdom and German Governments with interest free loans. The $350m in insurance premiums paid by African member countries by 2020 will provide members with rapid funds in the event of a natural disaster. Also speaking at the event which was hosted by the King of Morocco and attended by African leaders as well as the French President Francois Hollande, United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki-moon Urged African countries that have not ratified the Paris agreement to do so as its continent is the most hit by the effect of climate change. Out of the 50 countries hardest by climate change 36 is in the African sub region, the UN scribe said. He commended the entrepreneurial spirit across African especially amongst youth noting that they need investment and deserve empowerment. 'With the right opportunities African youth can forge solutions we may not be able to imagine the Paris agreement can open important business and investment opportunities for Nigeria'. Africa which accounts for only 4% of the global greenhouse gas emission is worse hit by the effects of the changing climate as it suffers from rising temptations. \"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria50","Agriculture: UN calls for adoption of climate-smart practices for poverty reduction","October 25, 2016 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","THE rapid transformation of farming and food systems to cope with a warmer world, such as adopting climate-smart practices, particularly to curb greenhouse gas emissions, is critical for hunger and poverty reduction, the United Nations agriculture agency said today in a new report. 'There is no doubt climate change affects food security,' said the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, as he presented The State of Food and Agriculture 2016 report at the agency's headquarters in Rome. 'What climate change does is to bring back uncertainties from the time we were all hunter gatherers. We cannot assure any more that we will have the harvest we have planted', he added. That uncertainty also translates into volatile food prices, he noted. 'Everybody is paying for that, not only those suffering from droughts,' raziano da Silva said. FAO warns that a 'business as usual' approach could put millions more people at risk of hunger, than in a future without climate change. Most affected would be populations in poor areas in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia, especially those who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Future food security in many countries will worsen if no action is taken today. 'The benefits of adaptation outweigh the costs of inaction by very wide margins,' emphasized Mr. Graziano da Silva. However, it is agriculture, including forestry, fisheries and livestock production, which is contributing to a warmer world by generating around a fifth of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, agriculture must both contribute more to combating climate change while bracing to overcome its impacts, the report says. Time for action Without action, agriculture will continue to be a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. But by adopting climate-smart practices and increasing the capacity of soils and forests to sequester carbon, emissions can be reduced while stepping up food production to feed the world's growing population, the report says. The report provides evidence that adoption of climate-smart practices, such as the use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop varieties, zero-tillage and integrated soil fertility management would boost productivity and farmers' incomes. Widespread adoption of nitrogen-efficient practices alone would reduce the number of people at risk of undernourishment by more than 100 million, the report estimates. It also identifies avenues to lower emission intensity from agriculture. Water-conserving alternatives to the flooding of rice paddies can slash methane emissions by 45 per cent, while emissions from the livestock sector can be reduced by up to 41 per cent through the adoption of more efficient practices. '2016 should be about putting commitments into action,' urged Mr. Graziano da Silva, noting the international community last year agreed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change, which is expect to come into force early next month. Agriculture will be high on the agenda at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known by the shorthand COP 22 , in Morocco starting on 7 November. Helping small farmers adapt to climate change risks is critical Developing countries are home to around half a billion small farm families who produce food and other agricultural products in greatly varying agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions. Solutions have to be tailored to those conditions; there is no one-size-fits-all fix. Helping smallholders adapt to climate change risks is critical for global poverty reduction and food security. Close attention should be paid to removing obstacles they may face and fostering an enabling environment for individual, joint and collective action, according to the report. FAO urges policy makers to identify and remove such barriers. These obstacles can include input subsidies that promote unsustainable farming practices, poorly aligned incentives and inadequate access to markets, credit, extension services and social protection programmes, and often disadvantage women, who make up to 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force. The report stresses that more climate finance is needed to fund developing countries' actions on climate change. International public finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation is growing and, while still relatively small, can act as a catalyst to leverage larger flows of public and private investments. More climate finance needs to flow to sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry to fund the large-scale transformation and the development of climate-smart food production systems. \"

He said this yesterday in his presentation at the 22nd Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) holding in Marrakech, Morocco. Buhari, who noted that Nigeria had no choice but to key into the global action on climate change, said: ""For us in Nigeria, the larger dimension of the challenge goes beyond emission rights. Survival rights are also at stake."" Buhari said: ""The Lake Chad Basin for example, has shrunk to a mere 10% of its original size, and this has seriously affected the livelihood of over 5 million people and contributed to the growth of insecurity in the region, including the emergence of Boko Haram as a terrorist group. ""Hence the urgent need to resuscitate Lake Chad. In this regard, I seize this opportunity to express gratitude and appreciation to those who have responded to our call and to encourage other well-meaning partners to join in our efforts to revive the Lake Chad Basin.""

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria53","Power: Govt plans 45% power generation with renewables","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","SweetCrude Reports","Wind & solar energy solutions. 16 November 2016, Sweetcrude, Abuja \- In the wake of President Muhammadu Buhari's trip to Marrakech, Morocco to participate in the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Federal government has released a new energy policy document which projects a diversified electricity grid of 10,325mw by 2019, and 45 per cent renewable energy grid contribution by the year 2030. The document, according to officials, had been ready since July 2016, as the Federal government is said to be waiting for the right time to unveil the new energy policy. The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, in the document, said that the decision was informed by the unstable gas supply situation. ""From conception in January 2016 and conclusion in June 2016, our vulnerability to over dependence on gas had become apparent,"" he said. ""23 out of the 26 power plants in the country depend on gas. ""Between February 14 and June 2, 2016, there have been 14 incidents of oil and gas pipeline vandalisms. Therefore this document is also a solution to that vulnerability on the roadmap to energy diversity and security."" According to him, ""It shows that 10 per cent would come from solar power, 12 per cent of Large Hydro Power (LHP), two per cent of Small Hydro Power (SHP), and one per cent of Coal. ""The projection is that by 2030, renewable energy will solve issues of the current over-dependence on gas-to-power which accounts for 86 per cent of electricity generation so far, with Large Hydro Power (LHP) contributing only 14 per cent."" The policy, which supports huge private sector investments, targets an energy mix of 55 per cent gas-to-power. The renewable energy sources would include 16 per cent of solar, 15 per cent of Large Hydro Power (LHP), and 4 per cent from coal-to-power. Other renewable sources are four per cent Small Hydro Power (SHP), four per cent from Biomass, and three per cent from wind. However, Cape Verde, an African island nation with 550,000 population, plans to attain 30/35 per cent of renewable energy contribution to its grid by the end of 2016. It plans to raise it to 50 per cent by 2018 and completely rely on renewable energy sources from 2020, the country's energy minister, Anildo Costa, said in The Independent newspaper. The Island country which is about 500km off the coast of Senegal, is with almost no mineral resources of its own and little arable farmland. It has about 10 islands and 13 islets situated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean but has abundant wind and sun. As at 2011, the country's total capacity installed is about 116mw, including 25mw of wind power and 7.5mw solar (i.e. 28 % from renewable energies), data obtained from the World Bank website reveals. . The estimated 151mw for the country's population can only serve one-third of Nigeria's capital- Abuja, which has over 1.4m people, according to the NPC preliminary census figures. Current energy demand for Nigeria is over 12,000mw but power generation has averaged 3,500mw this month, updated statistics from the Nigeria System Operator has shown. A recent study conducted by the German international agency (GIZ) and power ministry said that over 60 per cent of the 170m population of Nigeria are unconnected to the national grid. The study identified 174m population that should be connected. It said that 34,446 clusters with 57.1m people should be assigned to the grid while the other 13,043 clusters of 116.9m people should be electrified with renewable energy. Another 7,210 clusters with 2.8m people in the rural areas should be electrified using Solar Home System (SHS), the study says. To achieve that, the construction of over 10 solar-based power plants worth $1.75bn would begin in 2017 while about 1,125mw of electricity will be added to the grid on completion around 2018. One of the investors and Managing Director of the Pan Africa Solar, Marcus Heal, said: ""Our plan is to supply electricity to millions of Nigerians by developing large scale solar technology. The investment of $1.75bn is the largest on solar so far in the country, most of them are bound to come on stream from 2017."" The plants would be sited in Katsina, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Sokoto, Kogi, Jigawa, Plateau, Kaduna and Enugu states and the FCT. The Managing Director of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Engr. Chiedu Ugbo, recently, said that his firm has got a presidential directive to provide 20,000 SHS to underserved rural areas with no access to the national grid as part of the renewable energy application process. Ugbo said that the project would be deployed within 21 months as it has partnered with a local firm, Azuri Solar Power Ltd. With the rising cost of electricity to power businesses, experts have said that more investment in solar power could cut energy cost by over 50 per cent.

The announcement was made by the spokesman of the UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres:  I am pleased to announce that I will be appointing Ms Amina J. Mohammed of Nigeria as my Deputy Secretary-General and Ms Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti of Brazil as my Chef De Cabinet. President Buhari has described Amina Mohammed\' s appointment as a  great honour to Nigeria and he thanked her for her untiring contribution to transforming Nigeria. He said he looked forward to a sustained collaboration between the UN and Nigeria.  It is expected that the Minister of Environment will be transitioning to her new role in March 2017, a statement by the president\' s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said. Mohammed served as UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser to the outgoing Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on Post-2015 Development Planning. She was instrumental in establishing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals. She is an Adjunct Professor in Development Practice at Columbia University, and serves on numerous international advisory boards and panels, including the UN Secretary-General\' s high-level panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda. She is also the UN Secretary-General\' s Global Sustainability Panel, the African Women\' s Millennium Initiative, Girl Effect and the ActionAid International Right to Education Project. Amina Mohammed worked as special adviser to the Late Musa Yar\' Adua and Goodluck Jonathan on Millennium Development Goals for six years. In this position, she was in charge of designing and developing government projects to reduce poverty in the country then in November 2015, President Buhari appointed her as the Minister of the Environment. In a statement delivered by Amina Mohammed on her Appointment as UN Deputy Secretary-General,  As directed by Mr President, I will continue in the meantime to lay strong foundations with various important ongoing initiatives critical to the government\' s success in the Environment sector. These include our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Climate Agreement, the successful launch of the first sovereign Green Bond in 2017 and the Ogoniland clean-up and development of the Great Green Wall. The next phase of my continued service to the people of Nigeria at the global level will certainly build on the rich insights and lessons drawn from engaging with leaders, colleagues and stakeholders across our beloved nation. The cleanup of Ogoniland is an initiative spearheaded by Mohammed to clean up the oil spillage in the Niger Delta region caused by the growing level of oil spill incidents caused majorly by illegal bunkering, artificial refining, oil theft and armed militancy. The devastating impacts of oil spills on the environment, health and livelihoods of our rural and urban communities have led to land degradation, loss of lives, destruction of habitats, loss of biodiversity, incidents of diseases, poor sanitation as well as the depletion of the national revenue base. The President indicated his support for the cleanup and said it would take about 30 years for the project to be completed. But the pace of the implementation of United Nations Environmental Report (UNEP) report on the cleanup has been slow, due to some hiccups the project has experienced. In December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal at the Paris climate conference (COP21). The agreement laid out a global plan on actions the world would adopt to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0;C. Nigeria officially signed the agreement in September 2016 during the 71stUnited Nations General Assembly. President Muhammadu Buhari\' s gave a speech during the United Nations Framework on Climate Change ( COP-22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. In his speech, he presented the plans of the government towards tackling climate change in Nigeria. Mohammed also stated that after Nigeria signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the ministry of Environment embarked on nationwide tour to assess the gravity of environmental challenges and interact with the concerned communities. What has been done regarding the Paris climate change agreement after her one year in office is just an evaluation of the ecological challenges facing Nigeria. The UN Security Council resolution (S/RES/1325) on women, peace and security, adopted in October 2000, is taken to be a benchmark. It reaffirms the important role of women and urges all actors to increase the participation of women and incorporate gender perspectives in all United Nations system. But despite the highly qualified seven women candidates in the UN Secretary General selection process in 2016, to succeed Ban Ki-moon at the leading UN position, neither obtained full backing of the UN Security Council. The paltry number of women among UN permanent representatives and in the United Nations administration is due mainly to a high degree of insensitivity to women\' s equality of participation at all decision-making levels. Because there are only about 35 women Permanent Representatives to the UN \- from among 193 Member States. The office of the Deputy Secretary-General was created to manage the many of the administrative responsibilities of the Secretary-General, run the Secretariat operations and ensure coherence of programmes and activities but it is hoped that as the major woman player at the UN system, she will not just represent the Secretary General but half of the world\' s population, which are women. As the second African woman to assume this position, how will this impact Africa? There is an urgent need to combat climate change, reverse environmental degradation, which is costing the continent up to $68 billion annually, fight desertification and stop biodiversity loss. The money lost by the continent annually as a result of depleted soils and degraded land could be ploughed back into African economies to drive the transformation desperately needed. \"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria55","Nigeria: Northern states boosting power with five solar plants","December 4, 2016 Sunday","SweetCrude Reports","Solar panels. 04 December 2016, Abuja  Governors from the northern states in Nigeria want to tap into the abundant solar radiation of the region to industrialise and improve the livelihood of their residents. They signed a fresh pact to generate 500 megawatts (MW) of solar energy with globally acclaimed power firm, General Electric (GE). Perhaps coming to the understanding that Nigeria's dependence on fossil fuel power generation was no longer reliable and that the world was also fast pivoting to renewable and clean energy generation modes, governors in Nigeria's northern states recently hopped onto the moving renewable energy wagon to find solutions to the chronic electricity shortage that has come to define the region and indeed Nigeria. According to a media statement, the governors under the Northern States Governors' Forum, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the General Electric International for the construction of five solar plants in some parts of the region. It's coming just days after Nigeria formally ratified its commitment to the climate change terms the world drew up and agreed to follow during the Conference of Parties ( COP - 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. The five solar plants are expected to generate 500 megawatts (MW) of electricity that could help industries and small businesses in the region regain their hitherto lost productivity. Also, the development follows the recent bold steps of the Federal Government to diversify Nigeria's energy mix, by having 14 solar farms built majorly in states in the north by solar power promoters who signed power purchase agreements (PPA) with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) to build and generate 1125MW of solar power. The Solar MoU According to the statement signed by Isa Gusau, the spokesperson of the Borno Governor, Mr. Kashim Shettima, who is also the chairman of the forum, each of the plants is expected to generate 100MW of the 500MW planned electricity output. The electricity from the solar farms, Gusau said would be used to stimulate economic activities and social services in the states, with special attention given to agricultural food processing, small scale businesses and stable electricity supply to schools and hospitals in the region. He quoted Shettima to have said at the MoU signing ceremony with GE that, ""The 19 Governors of the North jointly created this approach. We want to go beyond lamentation to provide solutions and we all know that power is key to industrial development."" Shettima further noted: ""With power, we can create jobs, stimulate our economies and make life better for our people. The General Electric has over 120-year experience in energy solutions and they have been operating in Nigeria for over 50 years, we cannot have a better partner than GE."" ""We shall do our part as governors, this I will assure you. We are deeply committed to this agreement,"" he added at the ceremony which reportedly held in Abuja. Change of Approach Coming at time when Nigeria may likely go through another round of power supply failures as generation from its largest power plant, Egbin station reportedly crashed to a record low of 172MW on Tuesday, the governors may have perhaps initiated a bold move that could create a positive ripple effect on the business of power generation and supplies in the country. According to industry data, eight of the nation's 26 power plants were idle on Tuesday while the nation recorded a total system collapse on Thursday, November 24, the second time it would happen this month and for as many times as possible this year. Shettima had stated that the governors would no longer complain about the current electricity challenge of the country, but concentrate on finding solutions to the peculiar challenges of the region. He said power could provide a vehicle for the North to reposition itself for a better future, adding that the Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-integration Programme, a newly created platform by the forum would coordinate the 500MW solar project, which is also a pilot phase. The programme would serve as the vehicle for the economic recovery of Northern states through international relations on infrastructure, manufacturing, as well as stimulation of the agricultural value chain and trade. Tanimu Kurfi, the former Chief Economic Adviser to late President Umaru Yar'Adua has reportedly been engaged as the Chief Executive Officer of the Programme and would, with his reported wide contact with leading development companies and financial institutions across the world, help nurture and stabilise the plan. Similarly, the statement noted that both the Senior Executive, Western Europe and Africa for GE, Mr. Pineda, and its President/Chief Executive Officer for Nigeria, Dr. Lazarus Angbazo, in affirming the commitment of the company to the MoU, explained that they would work to realise the project. Although no details as regard the projects' costs and execution period was provided by the forum, it was not clear if this was part of GE's existing commitment to help Nigeria grow her power infrastructure over the next 10 years. GE in 2009 signed a Country-to-Company (C2C) agreement with the Federal Government to support the financing, design and building of infrastructure and capacity across key sectors of the economy, including rail, power and healthcare. The agreement was however renewed for another five years, with the pledge to help Nigeria through its partnership with the Ministry of Power, develop up to 10,000MW of power over the next 10 years.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria57","IDEP - Joint Global Action to Eradicate Poverty","October 20, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","Abimbola Akosile examines various calls by concerned stakeholders for a poverty-free world, as Nigeria and others marked the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on October 17 Vital Theme The theme of the 2016 International Day for the Eradication of Poverty (IDEP) is 'Moving from humiliation and exclusion to participation: Ending poverty in all its forms'; a goal which all concerned nations are expected to work towards. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to ""end poverty in all its forms everywhere"" explicitly recognises that poverty results not from the lack of just one thing but from many different interrelated factors that affect the lives of people living in poverty. This means all citizens and stakeholders must go beyond seeing poverty merely as the lack of income or what is necessary for material well-being - such as food, housing, land, and other assets - in order to fully understand poverty in its multiple dimensions. The theme this year - selected in consultation with activists, civil society and non-governmental organisations - highlights how important it is to recognise and address the humiliation and exclusion endured by many people living in poverty. Crucial Goal Goal 1 of the new 17 global Sustainable Development Goals is as clear as daylight. The first and arguably most important goal of SDGs - adopted by more than 190 members of the United Nations in September 2015 - seeks to end poverty in all its forms everywhere between now and 2030, the deadline year of realisation. Nigeria, which adopted the global goals alongside the other UN member-nations, is also making strenuous moves to address the issue of poverty in a country of 170 million citizens, although that is proving difficult to achieve in an ailing economy, which is reeling from economic recession, persistent corruption, inadequate food production, years of selfish leadership, glaring income and gender inequality and fallout of insurgency. That is not to say the present administration under President Muhammadu Buhari is not trying to eradicate poverty, but the general feeling is that poverty cannot be eradicated in Nigeria, under the current circumstances. Rather, the focus appears to be on minimising poverty to a bearable and manageable level. It remains if this will fit into the targets of the SDGs. Ending Exclusion According to the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, poverty is both a cause and consequence of marginalisation and social exclusion, stressing that to fulfil the promise of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind, ""we must address the humiliation and exclusion of people living in poverty."" In his message to mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the Secretary-General said implementation of the 2030 Agenda is reaching the end of its first year, and with its 17 SDGs, it embodies a universal vision for peace, prosperity and dignity for all people on a healthy planet. Achieving this objective is inconceivable without executing the mandate of SDG 1, which aims to end poverty in all its forms, he explained, stressing that some one billion people still live in extreme poverty and more than 800 million endure hunger and malnutrition. Ban noted that ""humiliation and exclusion are powerful drivers of social unrest and, in extreme cases, the violent extremism that is troubling so many parts of our world. But, in most instances, people living in poverty respond to these societal ills with stoic resilience as they work to escape the degrading reality of their daily lives. We must break down the walls of poverty and exclusion that plague so many people in every region of the world"". The UN scribe said the theme for the IDEP can be achieved by building inclusive societies and promoting the involvement of people in global efforts. He said it is the duty of all Governments and societies to address socio-economic inequalities and facilitate the engagement of all people living in extreme poverty so they can help themselves, their families and their communities to build a more equitable, sustainable and prosperous future for all. Beyond Money In her message, on the Day, Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Irina Bokova, said, ""poverty is about money, but never just about money,"" as underlined by the agency's 2016 World Social Science Report. Better understanding of the relationships between income and other dimensions of poverty can help to empower people living in poverty as agents of change, she added. The UNESCO chief said the goal to end poverty in all its forms by 2030 is tough but achievable. ""The key to success rests on political determination, driven by solid knowledge about the causes, mechanisms and consequences of poverty,"" Ms. Bokova stated. Indeed, eradicating poverty demands renewed policy approaches and more comprehensive and sophisticated knowledge. Beyond traditional mechanisms of poverty reduction, poverty can be only solved by tackling inequalities. ""So long as injustice and exploitation are embedded in economic, social and cultural systems, poverty will continue to devastate the lives of millions of women and men,"" she said. Bokova stressed that UNESCO stands for social justice within societies, because ending poverty is not just helping the poor, but also giving everyone a chance to live with dignity. Role of Agric In a new report the United Nations agriculture agency has noted that rapid transformation of farming and food systems to cope with a warmer world, such as adopting climate-smart practices, particularly to curb greenhouse gas emissions, is critical for hunger and poverty reduction. While presenting The State of Food and Agriculture 2016 report at the agency's headquarters in Rome, Italy, the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva said ""There is no doubt climate change affects food security."" ""What climate change does is to bring back uncertainties from the time we were all hunter gatherers. We cannot assure any more that we will have the harvest we have planted,"" he added. FAO warned that a 'business as usual' approach could put millions more people at risk of hunger, than in a future without climate change. Most affected would be populations in poor areas in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia, especially those who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Future food security in many countries will worsen if no action is taken today, the report noted. Without action, agriculture will continue to be a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. But by adopting climate-smart practices and increasing the capacity of soils and forests to sequester carbon, emissions can be reduced while stepping up food production to feed the world's growing population, the report says. The report provides evidence that adoption of climate-smart practices, such as the use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop varieties, zero-tillage and integrated soil fertility management would boost productivity and farmers' incomes. Widespread adoption of nitrogen-efficient practices alone would reduce the number of people at risk of undernourishment by more than 100 million, the report estimates. It also identifies avenues to lower emission intensity from agriculture. Water-conserving alternatives to the flooding of rice paddies can slash methane emissions by 45 per cent, while emissions from the livestock sector can be reduced by up to 41 per cent through the adoption of more efficient practices. ""2016 should be about putting commitments into action,"" urged da Silva, noting the international community last year agreed to the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, which is expect to come into force early next month. Agriculture will be high on the agenda at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known by the shorthand COP 22 , in Morocco starting on 7 November. Helping smallholders adapt to climate change risks is critical for global poverty reduction and food security. Close attention should be paid to removing obstacles they may face and fostering an enabling environment for individual, joint and collective action, according to the report. FAO urged policy makers to identify and remove such barriers. These obstacles can include input subsidies that promote unsustainable farming practices, poorly aligned incentives and inadequate access to markets, credit, extension services and social protection programmes, and often disadvantage women, who make up to 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force. RANDOM THOTS Food for All Nigeria and the rest of the world celebrated World Food Day on October 16, a day set aside by the United Nations to create awareness in the global fight against hunger, with 'Climate is changing, Food and Agriculture must too' as the 2016 theme. Nigeria, according to the Global Food Security Index is presently ranked 80 out of 105 surveyed countries in terms of affordability, availability and quality of food. The country spends about $22 billion annually importing food items such as rice, wheat, fish, etc. and is still a net importer of food, although agriculture contributed 22 per cent of GDP in 2014/2015, while farming provides livelihoods for 60 per cent of the population. The Food Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has called on countries to address food and agriculture in their climate action plans and invest more in rural development, in order to achieve zero hunger globally. Although Nigeria celebrated meeting the hunger target before the 2015 deadline of the UN Millennium Development Goals, millions still go to bed hungry. To tackle this, government at all levels must ensure food security by making land available for modern agriculture, luring youths back to the farms through incentives and infrastructure; irrigation farming, mechanisation and by investing more funds in interest-free agricultural loans to farmers and entrepreneurs. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) must implement the new Agriculture Promotion Policy (2016-2020) tagged, 'The Green Alternative,' which is designed to address Nigeria's food security challenges and position the country as a net food exporter. Experts have called for major public investments in agriculture to encourage people to produce enough food for local consumption and export. Beyond ban on importation of food products, government must grow the agriculture subsector, with improved seeds and varieties from research institutions also made available to farmers. Food for all should be the norm, rather than the exception. A worthwhile goal... \"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria58","FG sourcing N30bn to store 30,000 tons of grains to avoid hunger in January \u8211 Ogbeh","December 14, 2016 Wednesday","The Sun (Nigeria)","By Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye The Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, was chairman of the Peoples By Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye The Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, was chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) from 2001 until January 2005. He is currently the Minister of Agriculture. Ogbeh who is also known for his literary works in this interview with a select group of\~ newsmen spoke about the challenges facing the country as farmers now export grains to neighbouring countries among other issues. What are we really dealing with in terms of the grain issue? We are dealing with excessive pressure on our grain supplies. We have had a bumper harvest this year especially of millet and very soon of soghurm. In sorghum production, we are number two in the world now and in millet we are almost number one and then we find ourselves feeding over seven or eight other countries in the North, West, and to the Central part of Africa. Our grains go as far as Southern Libya, Sudan, Chad, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali and they come in trucks from about five markets in West Africa to Nigeria; 500 trucks leave Nigeria daily. From the Dawanu market in Kano, Maigatari in Jigawa, Laila in Sokoto and before Boko Haram, from Bama market. They just keep loading. The climate change has created a problem in these areas. There is very little rain and therefore the soils are parched and it has become impossible for them to grow food and produce their own grains, so they depend entirely on Nigeria. Now, we have a situation where you cannot stop them because they are part of ECOWAS and since you can't stop them, they come in and buy. Number two, it is an unrecorded trade because it is informal. They come, they change their cephas in the market and then they load. Number three, our currency is so weak now that shopping in Nigeria is the finest thing in the world to do. It means in one way, we have a market for our produce, but the other point is that we have to feed ourselves first before we think of selling. Now, to strike a balance between the two is our dilemma, so we have to do something. We have to look for money now to begin to buy also and storing in our green reserves because by January, they will have dried up and if they do, then we go hungry and then people get angry. They are buying rice as well and we don't have enough rice yet; we have been depending on imports for the last 40 years at the cost of $5 million a day. Now, we are getting close to self sufficiency in rice but if this pressure goes on, then we have about 900 million people to feed in addition to our nearly 200 million. It throws a challenge, it means fine you have a market, produce more, but the ability to produce that more is not yet with us. We are short of machinery, tractors, we are short of harvesters, technology and ICT to monitor agriculture and we are short of rice mills. It means therefore that we are coping with two challenges, pressure from the outside and demand from within. So, this is what the Presidency was talking about. I am already talking to banks and so on to find money for us, about N30 billion to store at least 25 to 30,000 tons of grains in our silos. We have 33 silos and most of them have the capacity of a 100,000 tons each and we have to fill them up quickly. Thank God sorghum is not yet being harvested; it is only millet now and rice. The second good news is that right now, I have 110 rice mills varying in capacity from a 100 tons a day to 10 tons, which I am about to deploy. Every state will have a minimum of two beginning in Lagos where the biggest demand is. Two units of 40 tons a day plus one existing rice mill will be revived by Christmas. Installations take a while and the machines didn't arrive too long ago. So, what it now means is that Nigeria has to feed West, North and Central Africa and at the same time feed 200 million people. Don't forget that for nearly 40 years, we made the tragic mistake of forgetting agriculture. Brazil, India and Russia made the same mistake and it took them 30 years, some 40 or 50 to catch up to correct their mistakes. Here we have a problem, 40 years is a long time, we don't have that time, the populace is hungry, the populace is angry, they don't want to hear stories about what happened, they want food, you can't do agriculture overnight but we are moving at the speed of light and we have done quite a few things which are helping us. We did a soil map of the country which didn't exist before. In the process, we realised that serious mistakes have been made in the past. The wrong type of fertiliser has been steadily applied to the soil for the wrong type of crops in the wrong environment steadily for 40, 50 years. So, the yields have been low, we have been destroying the soil, the farming have been earning too little and therefore agriculture has not been encouraging in any shape or form. We now carried out this test state by state, broadly analysing what kind of soils we have in the states. We still have to do more work because on one farm of 200 hectares, you may find soil disparities in different places, but for now we have an average of what kind of fertiliser to apply in what state to what club and in what quantity because the soil has 16 ingredients-the Micro and the macro. The macro, urea, potassium and phosphate, there are the three major ones. There are smaller ones like boron, zinc and manganese and what have you. Each crop requires a certain amount of that to reach the potential. In the past, we have been fixing just three into the soil, what they call MPK 15,15,15 or just the urea. No soil and no crop accepts an exact amount of this three, 15 percent of each. Some soils have too much phosphate, some already have too much potassium, so if you add more the potassium becomes too much and locks down the other ingredients, so you might have a lot of leaves but no food. We have corrected that and the result is fantastic. Farmers are now harvesting instead of two tons per hectare, seven and a half and some even 10 tons.\~ As we improve on it, they are going to have yields of 10, 15 tons. The other major challenge we have this year is maize\~ The early planters had a good harvest. Those who planted a bit late to harvest in the dry season ran into a problem of an insect called the army worm. They destroyed the maize farms and we are going to have a shortfall of maize. That is a challenge we face which is affecting the poultry industry and human feeding. We are correcting that. When we got chemicals, the farmers didn't know how to apply the chemicals. For spraying against the army worm, you apply the chemical vertically not horizontally, because the army worm settles in the stem of the maize. It is when you apply vertically, it goes down and kills them. And they can stay there even into the dry season and re-emerge in the soil latter in the year for the new crop. These are the challenges we face. You spoke about the loan you are sourcing from banks, any head way and which banks are involved? We are making some headway, we are talking primarily with the Central Bank because whatever we buy, we are going to sell in February, March and then pay them back. They are the biggest possibility. A few other banks we are also talking to are ready to have a conversation. The President spoke on strategies for a climate friendly farming at COP 22 , what are the specifics? We are building a minimum of 10 dams and lakes in every state in the next two years in addition to the existing 200 dams, we are building more dams. We have resolved that we must not wait for the rains to plant food and that agriculture has to be all year round. Three crops of maize, millet and rice each year, then we can meet the demands of North, West and Central Africa and meet our own demands, outside of that, you cannot do anything. What is your target for next year? The construction of dams will begin as soon as the new budget is passed, we are already working on some, we are cleaning up the whole dams in cooperation with the ministry of water resources; we are already cleaning up the whole dam. Some of them are silted full of sand over the years because we never used them. We have to clean them up and it costs money. We are going to start using them. The big dams Goronio, Bakalori, Dadinkowa and so on. And then in the South West, Oyo State has 22 dams and not one has been used for anything; Ogun has eight dams, Ekiti has one large dam stretching up to 22 kilometres, Kogi has one about\~ 28 kilometres stretching from Kogi into Ondo. These dams have been idle and we are reviving them and once we do, the areas around them, we will install pumps, solar pumps and other pumps drive water and go. By now, the second crop of maize should be approaching flowering. But all these years, we have been waiting for the rainy season and only the peasants, poor small holders have been working and we the elite unfortunately have treated them with nothing but scorn and so production has been very poor. Their yields have been low, they have no credit, the banks are scared of giving them money because they say they can't repay. There are too few tractors to work with, so the young people can't be interested in agriculture because it is too tedious so we have been feeding off imports. What is being done to curb wastage of what we produce when farmers cannot preserve what they harvest? Most harvest losses have been about 30 per cent or sometimes 40 per cent and we are dealing with that. We have 33 silos, big, some 80,000 or 100,000 tons. We were going to concession them, we now realised that the national demand is so huge that concessioning may not be immediately useful. We may put ourselves in a situation where the private concessioners have control and the government has none and the government has the duty to feed its people; it is in the constitution. We are expected to guarantee the good feeding of our people. So, storage is not an issue anymore with grains, the real question is value addition. We have a programme in the ministry called Livelihood Improvement Family Enterprise (LIFE). We are moving small scale processing machineries into rural areas. Palm oil mills, palm kernel mills, rice mills, groundnut oil mills, Shea butter mills spreading as far into the rural areas as possible because there have been one strategic mistake in our development strategy. A tree is not irrigated from the leaves but from the roots and unless and until we recognise that our attempt to develop will be a complete failure as long as we continue to think only of the cities and the big factories, we will never make it. We want to take life to the villages. You go into the village, a family is going to bed and not one member has a hundred naira. You have been hearing of people stealing pots of soup and amala. Frankly I am not a propagandist, the change we are talking about is taking place slowly, it is not loud. We have been visiting farm and talking to farmers. One man sold his rice in Jigawa last week for N120,000 for one ton and he said ""is this my rice and I alone this made this money? He gave out half the money to people in his excitement and said they should go and pray for the government that he never thought that in his life he will see N120,000. That is one ton and that fellow if he plants one hectare will make N1.1million and I saw farmers with rice farms stretching 100 kilometres along the Hadejia river bank, three giant rice mills processing Nigerian rice, fresh rice, 10 trailers leaving Jigawa daily heading South. We are encouraging them to put one in Maigatari which is at the borders with Niger Republic, because the people of Niger don't eat parboiled rice, they eat white rice. I told the governor let us put one these for exports, but this time people change their money in the bank so that they can take the naira and we know how much is coming in. \"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria59","Why the World Must Tackle Corruption and Terrorism Now","September 27, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","The two main issues that dominated the just concluded 2016 Annual Conference of the International Bar Association in Washington DC were Corruption and Terrorism. Jude Igbanoi who was at the conference reports on why the two global issues formed the focal point at this year's IBA Conference from September 18 - 23. For good reasons the International Bar Association prides itself as the Global Voice of the Legal Profession and this year's conference of the worldwide body of lawyers truly lived up to this reputation. Over 6,000 lawyers from every country in the world converged in the United States Capital, Washington DC to participate in the conference. For Nigerian lawyers, IBA has become an instructive lesson on conferencing as the body has continued to deliver quality conferences over the years. Registration is smooth, seamless and hassle-free. On the average it takes less than 10 minutes to get registered with all conference materials, including bag given to delegates. This is a sharp difference from what obtains in Nigeria at the Nigerian Bar Association conferences. In an exclusive chat with the IBA Executive Director, Dr. Mark Ellis, the key is 'early planning.' IBA meticulously plans its conferences years ahead. For instance preparation for its 2017 conference in Sydney Australia is already in top gear. Dr. Ellis also told THISDAY LAWYER that in fact plans for the association's 2018 conference in Rome, Italy are already in advance stages. Perhaps, Nigeria has a lot to learn from this and the President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr. A.B. Mahmoud SAN in a chat with THISDAY LAWYER said 'I had extensive meetings with the IBA President Mr. Rivkin and the Executive Director, Dr. Ellis on the possibility of our collaborating with the IBA with a view to improving on our conferences. I hope to visit the London Headquarters of the IBA with some staff of the NBA to enable some staff of the NBA National Secretariat understudy the IBA and see what we can learn from them. They have been successful at organizing their conferences for many years and we must acknowledge this.' This year's Keynote Speaker was the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde and her presentation Mending the Trust Divide was quite emotive and inspiring. Lagarde told the august body of lawyers that the unique mandate of the IMF is to promote economic prosperity and financial stability, through international cooperation and an open system for the free flow of goods and investments. She anchored her paper on corruption and public trust saying 'A key factor fueling this distrust is corrupt and unethical behavior, actual or perceived - and in both the public and private sector. Addressing corruption and unethical behavior involves not only improving the quality of the legal framework but also the quality of the individuals who implement this framework.' Other distinguished personalities who spoke at the conference included Jack Straw, British Foreign Secretary 2001-2006, Arlene Foster First Minister of Northern Ireland, General Colin Powell US Secretary of State (2001-2005), Christopher Dodd Former Senator from Connecticut and Ben Bernanke, former Chairman, Board of Governors, US Federal Reserve. Nigerian lawyers also presented papers at the various sessions of the conference including Mr. Femi Falana SAN, Dr. Babatunde Ajibade SAN and Mallam Yusuf Ali SAN. Our 69 Years of Global Commitment to Lawyers - IBA President, David Rivkin We are here to see old friends, to meet new ones, and to enjoy the hospitality and the sights of Washington, but also of course to engage in the many important substantive conversations that will take place at our keynote, showcase and committee sessions throughout the week. Given the many challenges faced by lawyers and our clients around the world, the work of the IBA has never been more important, and I thank all of you for being involved in it. Since its founding in 1947, the IBA has been dedicated to the promotion and preservation of the Rule of Law throughout the world. Today, as we face many new challenges to the Rule of Law around the world, it is important to remember that it is neither a new concept nor one rooted only in the tradition of some countries. The Rule of Law is an ancient and universal concept. As early as the 5th century BC, China developed and advocated the philosophy of legalism - a political system based on laws. In ancient Greece, Plato wrote, ""Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the Gods shower on the state."" When I had the honor of visiting the Mexican Supreme Court last month, I saw on its walls a statement by Cicero that ""We are servants to the Supreme Court in order to be free."" In Islamic law, the concept of justice is paramount. The Quran says ""David, we have made you master in the land. Rule with justice among men."" The Prophet is said to have proclaimed, ""one hour of justice is worth more than 60 years of divine service."" And of course, last year, the IBA joined with many others in celebrating the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, a document that continues to inspire the conviction that no person, not even a Ruler, is above the law, as well as the fundamental principle that any accused person is entitled to due process. Since we last met in Vienna, the IBA has had an extraordinary year in serving this mission. In January in Myanmar, I had the honor of joining Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in addressing the inaugural conference of the Independent Lawyers Association of Myanmar. Thanks to the diligent work of the IBA's Human Rights Institute in forming this association, thousands of lawyers came together in the recognition that independent lawyers serving their clients' interests, free of government interference, are an essential step in the creation of a new democracy. Similarly in Cuba, the IBA has been conducting training programs for Cuban lawyers on the essential aspects of international business law: corporate organization, intellectual property, international sales and dispute resolution. In my meetings last year with the Chief Justice, Attorney General and other senior officials, they recognized that Cuba cannot open its doors to new trade and investment unless lawyers have the ability to serve their clients in these areas. As you know, earlier this year the IBA Council adopted the IBA Practical Guide for Business Lawyers on Business and Human Rights. To serve our clients effectively these days, lawyers must understand the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and similar documents. And no matter what our practice area, we must advise our clients in a manner that assists them in avoiding human rights impacts and promotes their, and our, integrity. The IBA's Presidential Initiatives have taken many important, practical steps towards solving some of our most difficult problems. Thanks to the time that many of you took in completing our survey on judicial corruption, our Judicial Integrity Initiative published an enormously useful report on the types of corruption that arise in judicial systems and the manner in which such corruption occurs. Building from that base, the Judicial Integrity Initiative is now undertaking many projects designed to have a practical impact in reducing corruption in judiciaries where it occurs: Last month, I attended a ceremony in Mexico City at which the Chief Justice and the presidents of the three Mexican bars signed the IBA Judicial Anti-Corruption Compact. The Compact is designed to be signed by individual judges, lawyers, prosecutors and court administrators; they commit to each other and to the public that they will not engage in corrupt activities and that they will report any such activities that they may witness. By publishing the Compact and its signatories on the websites of our member bar associations and the judiciaries, we hope to change the expectation in many countries that corruption is the only way to succeed in a judicial proceeding. We look forward to many other countries following Mexico's excellent example. We are also working on developing a set of standards and an organization through which judiciaries may be certified as having procedures in place that will prevent corrupt activities. We are researching best practices in investigating allegations of judicial corruption, and also the manner in which all of our member bar associations and law societies investigate and sanction potential corrupt conduct by their members. And we are surveying national laws to determine if the laws, in fact, make illegal the types of corruption found in our survey. If we find gaps and deficiencies, the IBA will propose a model statute to correct them. The Presidential Task Force on Human Trafficking has issued a seminal report on the impact of corruption on human trafficking. The report makes vividly clear that human trafficking could not occur without corruption, and it proposes concrete steps that governments, private companies and NGOs should take to prevent human trafficking. I had the honor of presenting these findings, along with the IBA's efforts on judicial corruption, to a conference of judges and prosecutors organized by the Vatican at which Pope Francis gave a beautiful and passionate speech about how much the law is needed in order to preserve morality. The Pope proclaimed, ""Justice is the first attribute of society."" The Presidential Task Force on the Independence of the Legal Profession has also issued an important report on the essential criteria of an independent bar and why an independent bar is so essential to democracy. These reports are available on the IBA website, and I encourage you to read them. Whatever your area of practice, you will find them illuminating. The IBA's work on Climate Change Justice and Human Rights has continued aggressively as many IBA committees have worked to implement the recommendations of our flagship 2014 report. Our working groups on remedies and adaptation have drafted important proposals that will be discussed at this conference. From the Vatican to David Cameron's governmental conference on corruption to a UN conference on climate change headed by Ban Ki-Moon, and in many other fora, the IBA's voice has been sought and listened to as the authoritative voice of the legal profession - for the ideas that we present and the contributions we have made and will continue to make. I strongly encourage you to attend the showcase sessions this week at which the work of each of these task forces - Judicial Integrity, Climate Change Justice, Human Trafficking and Independence of the Profession - is discussed. You will be proud of the work they have done. And of course, the 77 committees of the IBA have remained enormously active. Their accomplishments are far too many for me to mention tonight, so let me highlight one as an example. Our committees on Access to Justice and Legal Aid conducted an extensive research project on the challenges children face gaining access to justice and the strategies and solutions employed by countries around the world to address them. By raising awareness of the problem and highlighting best practices, the project has demonstrated the fundamental importance of access to justice as an empowerment tool for children to help reduce poverty and realize the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda. The results of this work will also be presented at a committee session on Thursday morning. Indeed, the conference this week offers more than the usual number of extraordinary sessions. In addition to the showcase sessions that I have already mentioned, this conference offers special opportunities, and I hope that you will take advantage of them. To be in Washington at the end of an Administration I very much admire gives us a chance to hear from high government officials about their view of the world and what the Obama Administration has achieved. Whatever else you have planned for this week, please come to the special Morning Keynote Addresses, to be presented by three Cabinet officers and Congressman: On Monday, the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who has a unique perspective on how to combat terrorism while maintaining adherence to the rule of law; on Tuesday, the Deputy US Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Holleyman, who will discuss the latest status of TPP and TTIP and why the Administration believes that TPP can have a direct and meaningful impact developing the rule of law in the region; on Wednesday, we can hear directly from Attorney General Loretta Lynch -who has been called the savior of FIFA -- about US efforts to combat corruption, human trafficking, terrorism and cyber-crime. And on Thursday, we will discuss the Presidential election and the stalemate that affects Washington politics with Congressman Scott Peters. I hope that you will join me at all of these keynotes at 9:30 each morning; we have scheduled the committee sessions to start after they are concluded, so that everyone has a chance to attend. And we have a roll call of other guests: Colin Powell and Robert Mueller, among others, in the lunchtime Conversations With; SEC Chair Mary Jo White at the LPD lunch on Wednesday and Legal Adviser to the State Department Brian Egan at the SPPI lunch on Thursday. On Friday, come hear Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy at our Rule of Law Day. And of course, in a few moments, we will get to hear from a leader with enormous influence around the world: IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. I am looking forward to hearing her, as I know you are. At the Rule of Law Day, you can also share in an IBA project that has been very meaningful and thoroughly enriching. At the beginning of my term, we searched for young Israeli and Palestinian lawyers who would one day be leaders in their communities in the hope that bringing them together to discuss issues of common interest and how international law could impact the conflict in their region could one day lead to peace. We found 12 extraordinary lawyers: Israeli Jews, Arab Israelis and Palestinians. We brought them to Prague for three three-day sessions and again this weekend in Washington, and the results have far exceeded our expectations. They have bonded; they have cried together; they have respectfully disagreed; and they have found common approaches to international law to propose solutions to intractable problems. Witnessing their discussions has been among the most memorable moments of my IBA Presidency. On Friday morning, many of them will appear together in our Rule of Law program to discuss what they have learned from one another. They will be joined by two experts who have worked towards Middle East peace. Please come and share the experience that has so touched me. This has been a challenging year for lawyers around the world. We have seen lawyers and judges imprisoned, disbarred and removed from office in China, Turkey, Venezuela, Egypt and elsewhere. In Pakistan, we have witnessed the premeditated slaughter of lawyers who had come to a hospital in respect of a bar leader who had been previously assaulted. Those who want to rule autocratically know that they have to intimidate and remove lawyers who will use the rule of law to oppose them. As lawyers who have been fortunate enough to be successful in our practices, we have an obligation to defend them, to speak out, to make clear that this cannot stand. As IBA President, I have used the power of the office to speak directly to those who suppress lawyers and freedom. All of us have the power to do so, as individuals, collectively or through our bars, and we must do so. Our Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, little knowing that he would one day be the subject of perhaps the most successful musical in Broadway history, wrote in the Federalist Papers, ""Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever will be, pursued until it be obtained, or liberty be lost in the pursuit."" One way to benefit lawyers under attack is for all of us to do a better job explaining to the general public the important role that we play in defending everyone's liberties, the time and expense we commit to defending those who cannot afford to pay us, and in making the law more fair and just for all. Write a piece in your local newspaper or social media. Speak at your place of worship or a local school about the rule of law. And to do this, we also have to preserve the reputations of all lawyers, because publicity about one lawyer who has crossed the line harms all of us. By all means defend your clients' interests but do so in a way that respects the ethics and morality that we expect of one another. The law does not give us an excuse to turn a blind eye to what we know is right or wrong. In this respect, we will soon announce an important project to explore the proper ethical rules for lawyers in light of the disclosures of the Panama Papers, and also how government should properly fight corruption without infringing on the attorney-client privilege and professional secrecy that are vital to our serving our clients. John F Kennedy famously said, ""For those to whom much is given, much is required."" The late great Muhammad Ali stated succinctly, ""Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth."" I have had the privilege and the honor the last two years to represent the IBA and all of you in fighting for these principles. I thank you for that opportunity; it has been a remarkable and memorable time in my life. This is a complex and difficult time to be a lawyer, but it is also a great time. After this ceremony, we will celebrate at the Museum of the American Indian, as well as the Air & Space Museum. Native Americans tell the following legend about human nature. A chief is speaking to a young child. He tells the child that in him, as in every person, there are two wolves fighting with each other, one good and one bad. The child asks which one will win. The chief answers, ""Whichever one you feed."" I ask that each one of you feed your good wolf to help us fulfill our role as protectors of democracy and of the rule of law. That the World May Be Safer For All - US Attorney-General Loretta Lynch I want to address the recent events in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Charlotte, North Carolina. The Department of Justice is aware of, and we are assessing, the incident that led to the death of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte. We are in regular contact with local authorities as their investigation into the shooting begins to unfold. And on Monday, the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As always, the Justice Department will be thorough, impartial and exhaustive in reaching a determination about this incident. These tragic incidents have once again left Americans with feelings of sorrow, anger and uncertainty. They have once again highlighted - in the most vivid and painful terms - the real divisions that still persist in this nation between law enforcement and communities of color. And in Charlotte, they have once again led to widespread protest. Unfortunately, we saw several instances of violence during the protests and 12 police officers and a number of demonstrators were injured as a result. Protest is protected by our Constitution and is a vital instrument for raising issues and creating change. But when it turns violent, it undermines the very justice that it seeks to achieve and I urge those demonstrating in Charlotte to remain peaceful in their expressions of protest and concern. At the Department of Justice, we are working tirelessly to build trust between law enforcement officers and the communities we serve and we will continue to do so. We will continue to forge dialogue between citizens and police officers. We will continue to do everything we can to give the brave men and women who wear the badge the tools and training they need to do their jobs safely, effectively and fairly. And we will continue to protect the rights and liberties of every American - no matter who they are, what they look like, or what uniform they wear. I also want to take a moment to address recent developments regarding the bombings that occurred last weekend in New York City and New Jersey. Last night, the Department of Justice filed multiple charges against Ahmad Khan Rahami for conducting and attempting to conduct bombings in New York City and various locations in New Jersey. Charges were filed in both the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the near future, it is our intention to bring the defendant to the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over the Manhattan neighborhood where more than 30 innocent people were wounded - and countless others were gravely endangered - by his bombs. I have full confidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, led by Preet Bharara, will succeed in bringing the defendant to justice for his heinous actions. And I know that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, led by Paul Fishman, will also seek to hold the defendant accountable for his deplorable actions in their district. These filings reflect the Justice Department's unwavering determination to find, capture and prosecute all those who attempt to commit or commit acts of terror against our nation. I want to thank my colleagues in the National Security Division, the U.S. Attorney's Offices, the FBI, the ATF and other parts of the Department for their tireless efforts over the last several days. I want to commend our local law enforcement partners and first responders for their vital contributions to this ongoing investigation. I applaud the citizens who played a crucial role in preventing further harm by alerting law enforcement when they discovered unexploded bombs. And I want to once again offer my prayers for the swift and full recovery of all the law enforcement officers and citizens who were harmed by the defendant's actions. It is a privilege to join so many distinguished colleagues, devoted public servants and good friends as we gather to reaffirm our shared commitment to fostering international cooperation, upholding the rule of law and promoting justice and human rights around the world. For 69 years, achieving those noble aims has been the mission of the International Bar Association. In the decades since you were founded to bolster the cooperative aims and timeless principles of the newly created United Nations, this organization has become an indispensable champion of human dignity and equal justice the world over. By providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and perspectives, you have created a community of lawyers that transcends the boundaries of nations and the barriers of language. By providing human rights training, you help your members to fight for rights and liberties in their home countries - especially in those nations where democracy is young and institutions are fragile. And by monitoring trials, investigating human rights abuses and advocating on behalf of judges and lawyers facing harassment or intimidation, you make clear that might does not make right - and that laws must not be the tools of repression, but the bulwarks of liberty. Through these and so many other efforts, the IBA has fought tirelessly so that all people around the world can enjoy the freedom, the dignity, the opportunity and - above all - the justice that is their birthright. That work has never been more important. As information flows ever more freely around the world; as our economies are bound ever more closely together; as the threat from terrorists and cyber actors continues to grow without regard to national borders, those of us in the legal profession - especially those of us who serve in government - must acknowledge that our work to protect our people from harm, to fight crime and to secure justice increasingly requires international cooperation. Today, I would like to talk to you about four areas of the Justice Department's work where this is certainly true: fighting terrorism; strengthening our cybersecurity; eradicating international corruption; and protecting the most vulnerable among us. Each of these goals is one of my top priorities as Attorney General and they are all in the core interest not only of the United States, but of others around the world. None of them can be achieved by the U.S. alone. They require us to work with other nations to strengthen international norms and to deepen international cooperation - and I am proud to say that in each of these vital areas, we are doing just that. My highest concern as Attorney General of the United States is defending our nation and protecting our people - and citizens worldwide -- from terrorism. At the Department of Justice, we are working tirelessly to detect, deter and disrupt plots that target not only the U.S., but also nations around the globe. We are relentlessly investigating and prosecuting those who seek to harm innocent people. And we are using all of the resources at our disposal to prevent American citizens from traveling overseas to fight with groups like ISIL and then returning home or traveling elsewhere to commit further attacks. Since 2013, we have publicly charged more than 100 individuals for conduct related to foreign terrorist fighter or homegrown violent extremist activity and we have thwarted a number of plots on American soil. These are all notable achievements, but they leave us with no illusions that we can successfully combat terrorism alone. That's why we have been so committed to deepening international ties that allow us to share information, uncover plots against ourselves and our allies and ensure that violent extremists can find no safe haven on our shores or those of our partners. Through bodies like Interpol and Europol, we are sharing information on foreign fighters and their movements across borders, giving us a seamless view of those who might be planning an attack. We have provided a range of resources, including FBI agents, to Interpol's Fusion Cell, which tracks terrorist training, planning and financing around the world. We have entered into information-sharing agreements with more than 45 nations in order to identify and follow suspected terrorists, providing Interpol with profiles on approximately 4,000 foreign terrorist fighters. And we have helped to establish the 24/7 cyber network, which now has more than 70 members. This rapid reaction system allows investigators to work with internet service providers to preserve valuable digital data before it disappears - exactly the kind of collaboration that the fight against terrorism demands. Similar cooperation is essential to meeting yet another modern challenge that doesn't stop at the water's edge: the variety of threats we face in cyber space. Our growing reliance on the internet provides an abundance of enticing targets to wrongdoers - from criminals attempting to steal consumer data, to state-sponsored actors seeking to commit espionage or disable crucial infrastructure, to rogue hackers looking to sow mayhem. Preventing these incidents before they happen - and bringing perpetrators to justice when they do happen - requires increased cooperation among nations and the Justice Department is doing its part to advance that goal in a number of ways. The FBI's Cyber Division recently created three new Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\'e9 positions in London, Ottawa and Canberra, allowing us to embed our personnel with foreign law enforcement agencies in order to streamline information sharing and further our cooperation on a range of cyber issues. Our Office of International Affairs has expanded the staff of its Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty Modernization Project, a critical effort to keep pace with the increasing volume of requests for electronic evidence from foreign authorities. And we are strongly committed to our obligations under the Budapest Convention, a landmark agreement that established global cooperation on cyber issues as a core aspect of international relations in the 21st century. Working with international partners, we have succeeded in a number of notable cyber cases, including the takedown of a number of online marketplaces for drugs, firearms and other illegal goods; the shuttering of more than 200 websites that trafficked in child pornography; and the elimination of the Darkode hacking forum, an illicit online marketplace for the sale of malicious software and other tools of the cybercriminal's trade. Of course, in all of our efforts to counter both terrorism and cyber attacks, the United States is determined to protect privacy and civil liberties. This administration has taken a number of unprecedented steps to ensure that in our pursuit of security, we don't undermine the very ideals that we are sworn to protect. In 2014, for instance, President Obama issued a presidential policy directive setting forth new principles for how the United States collects signals intelligence. Among other provisions, the directive requires us to review our intelligence decisions on an annual basis, ensuring regular scrutiny of how we safeguard the privacy of our people at the same time that we uphold their security - and, importantly, as President Obama stressed, the directive takes the ""unprecedented step"" of extending protections that previously applied only to the American people to people overseas as well. In addition, earlier this year, I had the privilege of traveling to Amsterdam to sign the ""Umbrella"" Agreement, which commits the European Union and the U.S. to protecting personal data when it is transferred for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes. The damage inflicted by international corruption may not be as visible as the harm done by terrorism or cyber incursions, but all of us here know that it is anything but a victimless crime. The Department of Justice is determined to work with our law enforcement counterparts around the world to ensure that the United States offers no shelter for the perpetrators - or the proceeds - of corruption. As all of you know, last May, we joined with our colleagues in Switzerland to indict nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives for illegally enriching themselves through the corruption of international soccer. Since then, we have indicted 16 more defendants and along with our Swiss partners, we remain committed to keeping the beautiful game free from the stain of corruption. In 2010, our Criminal Division established the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which has opened cases involving billions of dollars in criminal assets. Where possible, we use the funds forfeited by the Kleptocracy Initiative to benefit the people of the countries who were harmed and we will remain vigilant against those who seek to abuse positions of public trust for private gain. Finally, the Department of Justice is working alongside our international partners to take a firm stand against one of the most appalling crimes of our time: human trafficking. Ending this heinous practice - which is nothing less than modern-day slavery - is not easy. It is a largely invisible crime, which makes it difficult to determine precisely how many millions of men, women and children are in its clutches. But we know that it occurs in countries around the world, including right here in the United States. As in our counterterrorism operations, we have committed to sharing intelligence, combining resources and working through regional and international bodies to tighten the net against traffickers, resulting in operations like the one last June in the Ivory Coast, which arrested 25 suspects and rescued more than 75 children. And more and more nations are developing more stringent anti-trafficking measures within their borders. Here in the United States, the Justice Department has joined the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security in launching the Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team Initiative, which assembles specialized units of attorneys and agents from across the federal government to more effectively apprehend traffickers, rescue victims and support survivors as they begin to reclaim their lives. We recently expanded this vital initiative and I pledge that the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously pursue those who treat other human beings as little more than means to be exploited. Of course, we still have a long way to go before human trafficking is erased from our planet - just as we have a long way to go before terrorism is ended, cyber threats are neutralized and corruption no longer plagues our societies. But we have made tremendous progress by working together as an international community - and I believe that if we meet our obligations and continue to deepen that cooperation, our progress will only grow. I say ""obligations"" because as lawyers, we have a fundamental responsibility to serve justice above all else. And in our interconnected world, serving justice increasingly requires a global outlook. So I would ask all of you to continue to champion these issues in your home countries. Explore ways to ensure that our laws do a better job of thwarting terror; of protecting our networks; of upholding public integrity; and of safeguarding human dignity. That is your calling as lawyers - and that is your duty as members of the International Bar Association. After all, the IBA was established amidst the ashes of the deadliest conflict in human history, the Second World War, a struggle that was in no small part the result of a failure of justice - both within nations and between them. The hope that gave rise to the IBA was that through closer ties between the world's lawyers - through a transnational group devoted to the highest principles of justice - the world would never again suffer the kind of cataclysm it experienced in World War II. For 69 years, the IBA has kept faith with that sacred mission. And I am certain that by keeping faith with it today, we will continue our shared progress toward a brighter, a safer and a more just future for all. \"

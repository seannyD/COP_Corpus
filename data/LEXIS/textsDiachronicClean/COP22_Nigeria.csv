The second best time is now."" \- Chinese ProverbIn December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal at the Paris climate conference (COP21). The agreement laid out a global plan on actions the world would adopt to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0;C. Nigeria officially signed the agreement in September 2016 during the 71st United Nations General Assembly.On Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari's gave a speech during the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (COP-22) in Marrakech, Morocco. In his speech, he presented the plans of the government towards tackling climate change in Nigeria.The fight towards tackling desert encroachment was what led to former President Olusegun Obasanjo's proposal to the African Union to build a wall of trees.The Lake Chad Basin has experienced immense depletion over the years to less than 10 percent of its original size. The lake, which used to cover over 25, 000 square kilometres in 1925, has shrunk to 2, 500 square kilometres. This massive depletion has led to the displacement of over 5 million people living in that region. The effect of the displacement has been a major factor for the high level of migration to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. President Buhari has said that it would require $14 billion to revive the lake.Nigeria has also experienced changes in weather conditions, such as increased rainfall and excessive heat. Flooding has risen extremely, and it is said to be at its highest rate in the past 50 years. ""In Nigeria for example, the impact is being felt by more than 2.1 million people displaced by devastating floods that the country has continued to suffer since 2012. If not addressed by 2050, the human and financial cost would be colossal"", said President Buhari during his speech at COP22.Issues such as this reflect the intensive urgency towards redirecting Nigeria on a path of sustainability. President Buhari in his speech disclosed some initiatives of Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). One of the initiatives includes issuing green bonds in order to raise climate funds. Other initiatives in the Presidency's strategic plan include:Substantially increasing the use of climate smart agricultureDiversification of our energy mix through renewable and efficient gas powerCreating a more efficient, cleaner and lower-carbon oil and gas sector especially through a gas to energy programmeInitiated the implementation of the cleanup of the Ogoni-Land in the Niger-Delta regionThe President pledged that Nigeria would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2030, with the intention of raising the target to 45 percent, with the support of the international community.The implementation of these goals would rather seem improbable at the moment, as the Nigerian government has not physically shown their commitment to the implementation of the agreement. Nigeria is a huge consumer of fossil fuels, which is a major cause of greenhouse emissions. The country's love for fossil fuels exhibits the lack of political will to reduce carbon emissions.Just immediately after signing the Paris Agreement in September, Nigeria's Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun stated her disappointment in western countries and multilateral institutions for blocking coal to power projects in Nigeria. In a world where the global economy has agreed to drop the use of fossil fuels, how would it support Nigeria? Her statement indicated a hypocritical move by the government as Nigeria had just agreed to reduce carbon emissions.The government has consistently stated that it would utilise its fossil fuel reserves rather than adopt renewable energy. The argument being that renewable energy is more expensive than using fossil fuels. The cost of adopting renewable energy been proven to be reducing and several countries have started joining the renewable train. The apparent drop in solar prices reflects this: the price of photovoltaic (PV) cells has fallen by 99 percent over the past twenty-five years. With the advancement in technology and manufacturing scale, the trend shows that the prices would keep falling. In comparison with fossil fuels, renewable energy has lower marginal costs.Nigerian companies are also increasing their use of fossil fuels rather than dropping them. Lafarge Cement WAPCO Plc. and Dangote Cement Plc. have embraced the use of coal to power their plants. The lack of government policies to regulate the use has just shown a neglect of climate changes but rather a support of its effects.The effect that fossil fuels have on the environment in terms of contamination cannot be overstated. An example is the Okobo community in Kogi State, where after the commencement of coal mining, there has been an increase in infant mortality rates and new respiratory diseases. The Ogoni Land oil spillage is another testament to the crippling effect of the Nigeria's fossil fuel obsession.The government announced that it has commenced the cleanup of Ogoni Land in the Niger Delta. The cleanup, which was finally signed by President Buhari this year, was as a result of the United Nations Environmental Report (UNEP) submitted since 2011. The President who has indicated his support for the cleanup has said it would take about 30 years for the project to be completed. However, with the political climate of the country, the feasibility of the project is questionable.It is not enough for the government to create a plan and present it to the world. We need to see physical steps being taking towards solving the climate change issues in Nigeria. The Nigerian needs to act fast towards tackling these issues. The first step to be taken is changing the mindset of Nigerians that we are not affected by climate change, that fossil fuels and other causes of greenhouse emissions are okay to use.The Nigerian Government also need to a viable investment climate for the adoption of renewable energy. The Government should also support research towards reducing the cost of renewable energy, thereby increasing its usability. The President himself said in his COP22 speech, ""If (the climate change problem is) not addressed by 2050, the human and financial cost would be colossal.""

It is a major carbon sink; it absorbs heat, and produces half the oxygen we breathe. It sustains the lives and livelihoods of the coastal and island communities who call it home, and who rely on its bounty to meet their nutritional needs.The important role our oceans play was recognised at the 43rd Session of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Nairobi, Kenya earlier this year, which decided to prepare a special, scientific report on climate change and the oceans.But while oceans are key to mitigating climate change, a warming planet also places them, and the services they provide, at great risk. Climate variability and change, habitat degradation and ocean acidification all pose additional risks to the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans, and to the well-being of dependent coastal and island communities.This ambitious package of technical and financial assistance by these organisations, will support ocean economies in Africa, and build greater resilience of coastal areas to climate change, tailoring approaches based on the countries' specific priorities and objectives. The initiative will mobilise $500-900 million and implement programmes linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation over the period 2017-2020.According to Maria Helena Semedo, FAO's Deputy Director-General for Natural Resources, 'These ambitious programmes aimed at strengthening the resilience of African coastal communities are critical to meeting the challenges and opportunities of climate change, especially for vulnerable Small Island Development States.'World Bank Group Vice President for Sustainable Development, Laura Tuck, said 'The package could make a significant contribution to meeting the adaptation needs of African countries as they develop their ocean economies. We plan to ramp up our own concessional financing in this area and look forward to working with our partners to increase the effectiveness of overall development assistance.'\l"

'Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative.'The report, Unbreakable: Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters, warns that the combined human and economic impacts of extreme weather on poverty are far more devastating than previously understood.In all of the 117 countries studied, the effect on well-being, measured in terms of lost consumption, is found to be larger than asset losses. Because disaster losses disproportionately affect poor people, who have a limited ability to cope with them, the report estimates that impact on well-being in these countries is equivalent to consumption losses of about $520 billion a year. This outstrips all other estimates by as much as 60 per cent.With the climate summit, COP22, underway, the report's findings underscore the urgency for climate-smart policies that better protect the most vulnerable. Poor people are typically more exposed to natural hazards, losing more as a share of their wealth and are often unable to draw on support from family, friends, financial systems, or governments.\l"

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria25","Nigeria's faux anti-tobacco campaign","November 30, 2016 Wednesday","Nigerian Tribune","The hysteria that accompanies tobacco issues in Nigeria is particularly difficult to understand when viewed against the backdrop of developmental challenges that beset the country and its people on an ongoing basis. Take the case of Nigeria's participation in the just-concluded Conference of Parties (COP7) and (COP22). While the former was on regulating tobacco use, the latter was on climate change. COP7 held in India; Nigeria was represented by officials of the Ministry of Health, Standards Organisation of Nigeria and members of the anti-tobacco campaign groups. President Muhammadu Buhari led Nigeria's delegation to COP22, which was held in Morroco.You can be forgiven if you imagine that Nigerians will all be dying from tobacco use in the not-too-distant future, while the impact of climate change is at best a diversionary issue that should not be accorded any importance, with the sound and fury that is the anti-tobacco campaign.The impact of climate change in the country is profound. The milder impacts are seen in more regular and severe floods in areas that used not to experience flooding; prolonged drought and in the case of Nigeria, the disappearance of Lake Chad, with very damaging impact on habitat and livelihood of tens of millions of people living around the Lake Chad Basin. One of the consequences of climate change on Lake Chad is the strife over water and the consequent rise in terrorism among a people who were once considered agrarian and lovers of peace.While tobacco use is reported to be responsible for six million deaths annually across the globe, and preventing these avoidable deaths is important, how do you stop the accelerating impact of climate change with its potentially dire consequences such as drought, famine, displacement and deaths of tens of millions of Nigerians?When the theme of the recently-concluded COP7 was announced, there was optimism that the grave impact of illicit trade on youth access to tobacco and the underground trade in cigarettes fueling crime and terrorism, will receive much-needed attention. It turned out that the organisers could not hold themselves to the same standard that they prescribe for others. Deliberations and how conclusions were reached were made in the closet; invited journalists were literarily thrown out of the conference. Their participation in COP7 was limited to press conferences. If the organisers had nothing to hide, invited journalists ought to have been observers of the process and how decisions were reached.Organisers accused journalists of colluding with tobacco companies to undermine their efforts. This allegation is in reaction to many journalists challenging the World Health Organisation and the anti-tobacco lobby on the several untested, unverified and sometimes false 'facts' with which the WHO and tobacco lobby use to browbeat governments into toeing their l"

The agency cited irrigation as ""a key factor to help transform rural societies and economies,"" as it plays a critical role in ending poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, as well as sustaining natural resources and responding to climate change.The theme of this year's Forum is 'Water Management in a Changing World: the Role of Irrigation in Sustainable Food Production.' In her remarks, Assistant Director-General and FAO Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific, Kundhavi Kadiresan, announced that solutions to agriculture necessitated addressing water issues and that the challenges of today's water problems likewise depend on addressing food production.""Future irrigation practices should also move beyond conventional approaches of productivity gains, and also focus on rural prosperity, facilitating inclusive, equitable and greener growth,"" she urged.The FAO expects the world population to rise to nine billion people by 2050, which will exacerbate the demand for food and water and require a scaling up of agricultural productivity to ensure that everyone is fed.The world must transition to more productive, resilient, and sustainable forms of agriculture in order to ensure its continuation at both local and industrial levels. This especially includes adapting water management systems to meet evolving challenges.The forum is expected to also adopt a Ministerial Declaration on delivering the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through agriculture water management. Ms. Kadiresan introduced the declaration through the FAO's new global initiative, ""Coping with Water Scarcity in Agriculture: a Global Framework for Action in a changing climate.""The objective's main initiative is to build on the FAO and partners' technical capacity in order to support worldwide development and policy implementation for sustainable water use in agriculture.

The amount of work that needs to be done is considerable. Developing countries will need about $100 billion of new investments by 2020 to bolster their economic resilience against the effects of climate change.

It has destroyed crops and infrastructure such as schools and roads. 'In February 2016 alone, over 300 people lost their lives over herdsmen and farmers' conflict right here in Benue State. This is a conflict over scarce over green pasture. Unfortunately, the reality is that these pockets of conflict will continue to rise if adequate attention is not given to climate change,' Tchona said.Wife of the Benue State Governor, Mrs Eunice Ortom, in her remark, said that food security is a top priority to every nation.'We believe that agriculture is one of the key activities that Nigerians, particularly, women should adopt for their social and economic good.'A society which cannot feed itself cannot boast of any economic growth, peace and happiness or meaningful progress.'Our collaboration with Oxfam is already yielding better results just like state government is showing faith in helping Benue women to embrace farming.'\l"

DOYIN ADEOYE, who followed the two-week event, brings the report, especially from Africa's perspective, as well as experts 'opinions on what lies ahead for Africa after COP 21.Climate change poses complex challenges for Africa, and as such, addressing climate change issues has become central to the continent's development agenda.The realisation of a need for an international political response to climate change started more than a decade ago with the 'Rio Earth Summit' in 1992, where the adoption of the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was birthed. And over the years, the Conferences of Parties (COPs) of the UNFCCC have become an important platform for improving global response to climate change.With major impacts on Africa as well as its growing economies, the COP 21 could not have been timelier, as it was an opportunity to put Africa as a strategic player in the negotiations, thereby ensuring that commitments under the new agreement are favourable to the continent's realities and solutions.Speaking with participants at the conference, United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, stressed that 'Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as much of its economy depends on a climate-sensitive natural resource base, including rain-fed subsistence agriculture. Disruptions in food or water supplies pose serious risks not only for African economies, but also for political stability, particularly in fragile states.'Ahead of the convergence of stakeholders for COP21, more than 180 countries submitted voluntary climate action plans to the UNFCCC, through the development of the Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDCs), and this supposedly formed the basis of the agreement reached at the end of the conference.

They were angry over non-reconstitution of federal boards as well as the controversial ambassadorial nominees' list, which has seen two nominees rejecting the offers.Before Buhari left the country, Saraki had met with him thrice over his request for approval to get $29.9 billion loan.The Senate had recently rejected Buhari's request for the facility.The MTEF is yet to be approved by the Senate.Saraki, when approached by State House Correspondents to speak on what transpired at the meeting, said: "" I am sure the VP will issue a statement.

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria47","Crowding the private sector into Africa's climate action","December 13, 2016 Tuesday","Ventures Africa","The global community for climate action was spooked by the November 8 election of Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. The US President-elect had earned the sobriquet of  climate denier for his claim that climate change is a hoax. However, there is cautious optimism that his presidency will not overturn the global agenda on climate change. Hopefully, his views on climate change will change and align with reality when he settles into the Oval Office. Policymakers also believe that global climate agreements cannot be reversed easily.In the meantime, stakeholders are pressing on with formulating strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the United Nations\' agency on climate change held on November 7 \- 18 in Marrakech, Morocco. At the climate talks, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, Pakistan and seven other countries ratified the December 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A total of 111 countries, including the United States, China and member countries of the European Union ratified the agreement by the time COP 22 concluded.Since the Paris accord entered into force on November 4th, quite earlier than anticipated, global action against climate change has effectively shifted to strategic programming. Therefore, in Marrakech, Canada, Germany, Mexico and the United States published their plans to significantly decarbonise their economies by 2050. A group of 47 developing nations also committed to running entirely on renewable energy sources  as rapidly as possible. Some of the plans are already gaining traction. Investments in renewable energy totalled $286 billion in 2015. This surpassed by 3 percent the previous high of renewable energy investment achieved in 2011. Data gleaned from Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2016, a joint publication by United Nations Environment Programme and Bloomberg, further revealed that last year coal and gas-fired electricity generation drew less than half the record investment made in solar, wind and other renewable energy sources.The trend in renewable energy investment is a mixed bag, even in developing countries. China alone accounted for 55 percent of total investment last year; Africa\' s share was less than 5 percent. As climate change mitigation is being driven by investment in green energy, Africa is already taking the familiar position at the back seat on the \' green energy train\' .This was not unanticipated by climate policymakers. Although China is the clear leader in investment in renewables, other developing countries, in particular the low-income countries, are not expected to be able to keep pace without international assistance. But the advanced countries appear to be reneging on their pledges to help finance both mitigation and adaptation frameworks in the developing world, including Africa. This generated some rumblings in Marrakech, with regard to the commitment by the developed countries to raise $100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate actions in developing countries.Disappointing as this is, the prospects of improvement in international assistance at the required scale are not assuring. One, virtually all the advanced countries have been bedevilled by over half a decade of weak economic growth. This has put investment in infrastructure below ideal levels, suggesting near-term pressure on the fiscal regimes to close the infrastructure gap, create domestic jobs, and boost economic growth.Two, the economic malaise is also driving populist nationalistic sentiments in Europe and the United States. The backlashes for the emerging isolationist regimes are expected to include decl"

"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria50","Agriculture: UN calls for adoption of climate-smart practices for poverty reduction","October 25, 2016 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","THE rapid transformation of farming and food systems to cope with a warmer world, such as adopting climate-smart practices, particularly to curb greenhouse gas emissions, is critical for hunger and poverty reduction, the United Nations agriculture agency said today in a new report.'There is no doubt climate change affects food security,' said the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, as he presented The State of Food and Agriculture 2016 report at the agency's headquarters in Rome. 'What climate change does is to bring back uncertainties from the time we were all hunter gatherers. We cannot assure any more that we will have the harvest we have planted', he added.That uncertainty also translates into volatile food prices, he noted. 'Everybody is paying for that, not only those suffering from droughts,' raziano da Silva said.FAO warns that a 'business as usual' approach could put millions more people at risk of hunger, than in a future without climate change. Most affected would be populations in poor areas in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia, especially those who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Future food security in many countries will worsen if no action is taken today.'The benefits of adaptation outweigh the costs of inaction by very wide margins,' emphasized Mr. Graziano da Silva.However, it is agriculture, including forestry, fisheries and livestock production, which is contributing to a warmer world by generating around a fifth of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, agriculture must both contribute more to combating climate change while bracing to overcome its impacts, the report says.Time for actionWithout action, agriculture will continue to be a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. But by adopting climate-smart practices and increasing the capacity of soils and forests to sequester carbon, emissions can be reduced while stepping up food production to feed the world's growing population, the report says.The report provides evidence that adoption of climate-smart practices, such as the use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop varieties, zero-tillage and integrated soil fertility management would boost productivity and farmers' incomes.Widespread adoption of nitrogen-efficient practices alone would reduce the number of people at risk of undernourishment by more than 100 million, the report estimates.It also identifies avenues to lower emission intensity from agriculture. Water-conserving alternatives to the flooding of rice paddies can slash methane emissions by 45 per cent, while emissions from the livestock sector can be reduced by up to 41 per cent through the adoption of more efficient practices.'2016 should be about putting commitments into action,' urged Mr. Graziano da Silva, noting the international community last year agreed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change, which is expect to come into force early next month. Agriculture will be high on the agenda at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known by the shorthand COP 22, in Morocco starting on 7 November.Helping small farmers adapt to climate change risks is criticalDeveloping countries are home to around half a billion small farm families who produce food and other agricultural products in greatly varying agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions. Solutions have to be tailored to those conditions; there is no one-size-fits-all fix.Helping smallholders adapt to climate change risks is critical for global poverty reduction and food security.Close attention should be paid to removing obstacles they may face and fostering an enabling environment for individual, joint and collective action, according to the report.FAO urges policy makers to identify and remove such barriers. These obstacles can include input subsidies that promote unsustainable farming practices, poorly aligned incentives and inadequate access to markets, credit, extension services and social protection programmes, and often disadvantage women, who make up to 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force.The report stresses that more climate finance is needed to fund developing countries' actions on climate change. International public finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation is growing and, while still relatively small, can act as a catalyst to leverage larger flows of public and private investments. More climate finance needs to flow to sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry to fund the large-scale transformation and the development of climate-smart food production systems.\l"

He said he looked forward to a sustained collaboration between the UN and Nigeria.  It is expected that the Minister of Environment will be transitioning to her new role in March 2017, a statement by the president\' s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said.Mohammed served as UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser to the outgoing Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on Post-2015 Development Planning. She was instrumental in establishing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals. She is an Adjunct Professor in Development Practice at Columbia University, and serves on numerous international advisory boards and panels, including the UN Secretary-General\' s high-level panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda. She is also the UN Secretary-General\' s Global Sustainability Panel, the African Women\' s Millennium Initiative, Girl Effect and the ActionAid International Right to Education Project.Amina Mohammed worked as special adviser to the Late Musa Yar\' Adua and Goodluck Jonathan on Millennium Development Goals for six years. In this position, she was in charge of designing and developing government projects to reduce poverty in the country then in November 2015, President Buhari appointed her as the Minister of the Environment.In a statement delivered by Amina Mohammed on her Appointment as UN Deputy Secretary-General,  As directed by Mr President, I will continue in the meantime to lay strong foundations with various important ongoing initiatives critical to the government\' s success in the Environment sector. These include our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Climate Agreement, the successful launch of the first sovereign Green Bond in 2017 and the Ogoniland clean-up and development of the Great Green Wall. The next phase of my continued service to the people of Nigeria at the global level will certainly build on the rich insights and lessons drawn from engaging with leaders, colleagues and stakeholders across our beloved nation. The cleanup of Ogoniland is an initiative spearheaded by Mohammed to clean up the oil spillage in the Niger Delta region caused by the growing level of oil spill incidents caused majorly by illegal bunkering, artificial refining, oil theft and armed militancy. The devastating impacts of oil spills on the environment, health and livelihoods of our rural and urban communities have led to land degradation, loss of lives, destruction of habitats, loss of biodiversity, incidents of diseases, poor sanitation as well as the depletion of the national revenue base. The President indicated his support for the cleanup and said it would take about 30 years for the project to be completed. But the pace of the implementation of United Nations Environmental Report (UNEP) report on the cleanup has been slow, due to some hiccups the project has experienced.In December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal at the Paris climate conference (COP21). The agreement laid out a global plan on actions the world would adopt to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0;C. Nigeria officially signed the agreement in September 2016 during the 71stUnited Nations General Assembly. President Muhammadu Buhari\' s gave a speech during the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (COP-22) in Marrakech, Morocco. In his speech, he presented the plans of the government towards tackling climate change in Nigeria. Mohammed also stated that after Nigeria signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the ministry of Environment embarked on nationwide tour to assess the gravity of environmental challenges and interact with the concerned communities. What has been done regarding the Paris climate change agreement after her one year in office is just an evaluation of the ecological challenges facing Nigeria.The UN Security Council resolution (S/RES/1325) on women, peace and security, adopted in October 2000, is taken to be a benchmark. It reaffirms the important role of women and urges all actors to increase the participation of women and incorporate gender perspectives in all United Nations system. But despite the highly qualified seven women candidates in the UN Secretary General selection process in 2016, to succeed Ban Ki-moon at the leading UN position, neither obtained full backing of the UN Security Council. The paltry number of women among UN permanent representatives and in the United Nations administration is due mainly to a high degree of insensitivity to women\' s equality of participation at all decision-making levels. Because there are only about 35 women Permanent Representatives to the UN \- from among 193 Member States.The office of the Deputy Secretary-General was created to manage the many of the administrative responsibilities of the Secretary-General, run the Secretariat operations and ensure coherence of programmes and activities but it is hoped that as the major woman player at the UN system, she will not just represent the Secretary General but half of the world\' s population, which are women. As the second African woman to assume this position, how will this impact Africa?There is an urgent need to combat climate change, reverse environmental degradation, which is costing the continent up to $68 billion annually, fight desertification and stop biodiversity loss. The money lost by the continent annually as a result of depleted soils and degraded land could be ploughed back into African economies to drive the transformation desperately needed.\l"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria55","Nigeria: Northern states boosting power with five solar plants","December 4, 2016 Sunday","SweetCrude Reports","Solar panels. 04 December 2016, Abuja  Governors from the northern states in Nigeria want to tap into the abundant solar radiation of the region to industrialise and improve the livelihood of their residents. They signed a fresh pact to generate 500 megawatts (MW) of solar energy with globally acclaimed power firm, General Electric (GE).Perhaps coming to the understanding that Nigeria's dependence on fossil fuel power generation was no longer reliable and that the world was also fast pivoting to renewable and clean energy generation modes, governors in Nigeria's northern states recently hopped onto the moving renewable energy wagon to find solutions to the chronic electricity shortage that has come to define the region and indeed Nigeria.According to a media statement, the governors under the Northern States Governors' Forum, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the General Electric International for the construction of five solar plants in some parts of the region.It's coming just days after Nigeria formally ratified its commitment to the climate change terms the world drew up and agreed to follow during the Conference of Parties (COP -) in Marrakech, Morocco. The five solar plants are expected to generate 500 megawatts (MW) of electricity that could help industries and small businesses in the region regain their hitherto lost productivity.Also, the development follows the recent bold steps of the Federal Government to diversify Nigeria's energy mix, by having 14 solar farms built majorly in states in the north by solar power promoters who signed power purchase agreements (PPA) with the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) to build and generate 1125MW of solar power.The Solar MoUAccording to the statement signed by Isa Gusau, the spokesperson of the Borno Governor, Mr. Kashim Shettima, who is also the chairman of the forum, each of the plants is expected to generate 100MW of the 500MW planned electricity output.The electricity from the solar farms, Gusau said would be used to stimulate economic activities and social services in the states, with special attention given to agricultural food processing, small scale businesses and stable electricity supply to schools and hospitals in the region.He quoted Shettima to have said at the MoU signing ceremony with GE that, ""The 19 Governors of the North jointly created this approach. We want to go beyond lamentation to provide solutions and we all know that power is key to industrial development.""Shettima further noted: ""With power, we can create jobs, stimulate our economies and make life better for our people. The General Electric has over 120-year experience in energy solutions and they have been operating in Nigeria for over 50 years, we cannot have a better partner than GE.""""We shall do our part as governors, this I will assure you. We are deeply committed to this agreement,"" he added at the ceremony which reportedly held in Abuja.Change of ApproachComing at time when Nigeria may likely go through another round of power supply failures as generation from its largest power plant, Egbin station reportedly crashed to a record low of 172MW on Tuesday, the governors may have perhaps initiated a bold move that could create a positive ripple effect on the business of power generation and supplies in the country.According to industry data, eight of the nation's 26 power plants were idle on Tuesday while the nation recorded a total system collapse on Thursday, November 24, the second time it would happen this month and for as many times as possible this year.Shettima had stated that the governors would no longer complain about the current electricity challenge of the country, but concentrate on finding solutions to the peculiar challenges of the region. He said power could provide a vehicle for the North to reposition itself for a better future, adding that the Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-integration Programme, a newly created platform by the forum would coordinate the 500MW solar project, which is also a pilot phase.The programme would serve as the vehicle for the economic recovery of Northern states through international relations on infrastructure, manufacturing, as well as stimulation of the agricultural value chain and trade.Tanimu Kurfi, the former Chief Economic Adviser to late President Umaru Yar'Adua has reportedly been engaged as the Chief Executive Officer of the Programme and would, with his reported wide contact with leading development companies and financial institutions across the world, help nurture and stabilise the plan.Similarly, the statement noted that both the Senior Executive, Western Europe and Africa for GE, Mr. Pineda, and its President/Chief Executive Officer for Nigeria, Dr. Lazarus Angbazo, in affirming the commitment of the company to the MoU, explained that they would work to realise the project.Although no details as regard the projects' costs and execution period was provided by the forum, it was not clear if this was part of GE's existing commitment to help Nigeria grow her power infrastructure over the next 10 years.GE in 2009 signed a Country-to-Company (C2C) agreement with the Federal Government to support the financing, design and building of infrastructure and capacity across key sectors of the economy, including rail, power and healthcare.The agreement was however renewed for another five years, with the pledge to help Nigeria through its partnership with the Ministry of Power, develop up to 10,000MW of power over the next 10 years.

He is currently the Minister of Agriculture. Ogbeh who is also known for his literary works in this interview with a select group of\~ newsmen spoke about the challenges facing the country as farmers now export grains to neighbouring countries among other issues.What are we really dealing with in terms of the grain issue? We are dealing with excessive pressure on our grain supplies. We have had a bumper harvest this year especially of millet and very soon of soghurm. In sorghum production, we are number two in the world now and in millet we are almost number one and then we find ourselves feeding over seven or eight other countries in the North, West, and to the Central part of Africa. Our grains go as far as Southern Libya, Sudan, Chad, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali and they come in trucks from about five markets in West Africa to Nigeria; 500 trucks leave Nigeria daily. From the Dawanu market in Kano, Maigatari in Jigawa, Laila in Sokoto and before Boko Haram, from Bama market. They just keep loading. The climate change has created a problem in these areas. There is very little rain and therefore the soils are parched and it has become impossible for them to grow food and produce their own grains, so they depend entirely on Nigeria. Now, we have a situation where you cannot stop them because they are part of ECOWAS and since you can't stop them, they come in and buy. Number two, it is an unrecorded trade because it is informal. They come, they change their cephas in the market and then they load. Number three, our currency is so weak now that shopping in Nigeria is the finest thing in the world to do. It means in one way, we have a market for our produce, but the other point is that we have to feed ourselves first before we think of selling. Now, to strike a balance between the two is our dilemma, so we have to do something. We have to look for money now to begin to buy also and storing in our green reserves because by January, they will have dried up and if they do, then we go hungry and then people get angry. They are buying rice as well and we don't have enough rice yet; we have been depending on imports for the last 40 years at the cost of $5 million a day. Now, we are getting close to self sufficiency in rice but if this pressure goes on, then we have about 900 million people to feed in addition to our nearly 200 million. It throws a challenge, it means fine you have a market, produce more, but the ability to produce that more is not yet with us. We are short of machinery, tractors, we are short of harvesters, technology and ICT to monitor agriculture and we are short of rice mills. It means therefore that we are coping with two challenges, pressure from the outside and demand from within. So, this is what the Presidency was talking about. I am already talking to banks and so on to find money for us, about N30 billion to store at least 25 to 30,000 tons of grains in our silos. We have 33 silos and most of them have the capacity of a 100,000 tons each and we have to fill them up quickly. Thank God sorghum is not yet being harvested; it is only millet now and rice. The second good news is that right now, I have 110 rice mills varying in capacity from a 100 tons a day to 10 tons, which I am about to deploy. Every state will have a minimum of two beginning in Lagos where the biggest demand is. Two units of 40 tons a day plus one existing rice mill will be revived by Christmas. Installations take a while and the machines didn't arrive too long ago. So, what it now means is that Nigeria has to feed West, North and Central Africa and at the same time feed 200 million people. Don't forget that for nearly 40 years, we made the tragic mistake of forgetting agriculture. Brazil, India and Russia made the same mistake and it took them 30 years, some 40 or 50 to catch up to correct their mistakes. Here we have a problem, 40 years is a long time, we don't have that time, the populace is hungry, the populace is angry, they don't want to hear stories about what happened, they want food, you can't do agriculture overnight but we are moving at the speed of light and we have done quite a few things which are helping us. We did a soil map of the country which didn't exist before. In the process, we realised that serious mistakes have been made in the past. The wrong type of fertiliser has been steadily applied to the soil for the wrong type of crops in the wrong environment steadily for 40, 50 years. So, the yields have been low, we have been destroying the soil, the farming have been earning too little and therefore agriculture has not been encouraging in any shape or form. We now carried out this test state by state, broadly analysing what kind of soils we have in the states. We still have to do more work because on one farm of 200 hectares, you may find soil disparities in different places, but for now we have an average of what kind of fertiliser to apply in what state to what club and in what quantity because the soil has 16 ingredients-the Micro and the macro. The macro, urea, potassium and phosphate, there are the three major ones. There are smaller ones like boron, zinc and manganese and what have you. Each crop requires a certain amount of that to reach the potential. In the past, we have been fixing just three into the soil, what they call MPK 15,15,15 or just the urea. No soil and no crop accepts an exact amount of this three, 15 percent of each. Some soils have too much phosphate, some already have too much potassium, so if you add more the potassium becomes too much and locks down the other ingredients, so you might have a lot of leaves but no food. We have corrected that and the result is fantastic. Farmers are now harvesting instead of two tons per hectare, seven and a half and some even 10 tons.\~ As we improve on it, they are going to have yields of 10, 15 tons. The other major challenge we have this year is maize\~ The early planters had a good harvest. Those who planted a bit late to harvest in the dry season ran into a problem of an insect called the army worm. They destroyed the maize farms and we are going to have a shortfall of maize. That is a challenge we face which is affecting the poultry industry and human feeding. We are correcting that. When we got chemicals, the farmers didn't know how to apply the chemicals. For spraying against the army worm, you apply the chemical vertically not horizontally, because the army worm settles in the stem of the maize. It is when you apply vertically, it goes down and kills them. And they can stay there even into the dry season and re-emerge in the soil latter in the year for the new crop. These are the challenges we face.You spoke about the loan you are sourcing from banks, any head way and which banks are involved? We are making some headway, we are talking primarily with the Central Bank because whatever we buy, we are going to sell in February, March and then pay them back. They are the biggest possibility. A few other banks we are also talking to are ready to have a conversation.The President spoke on strategies for a climate friendly farming at COP 22, what are the specifics?We are building a minimum of 10 dams and lakes in every state in the next two years in addition to the existing 200 dams, we are building more dams. We have resolved that we must not wait for the rains to plant food and that agriculture has to be all year round. Three crops of maize, millet and rice each year, then we can meet the demands of North, West and Central Africa and meet our own demands, outside of that, you cannot do anything.What is your target for next year?The construction of dams will begin as soon as the new budget is passed, we are already working on some, we are cleaning up the whole dams in cooperation with the ministry of water resources; we are already cleaning up the whole dam. Some of them are silted full of sand over the years because we never used them. We have to clean them up and it costs money. We are going to start using them. The big dams Goronio, Bakalori, Dadinkowa and so on. And then in the South West, Oyo State has 22 dams and not one has been used for anything; Ogun has eight dams, Ekiti has one large dam stretching up to 22 kilometres, Kogi has one about\~ 28 kilometres stretching from Kogi into Ondo. These dams have been idle and we are reviving them and once we do, the areas around them, we will install pumps, solar pumps and other pumps drive water and go.By now, the second crop of maize should be approaching flowering. But all these years, we have been waiting for the rainy season and only the peasants, poor small holders have been working and we the elite unfortunately have treated them with nothing but scorn and so production has been very poor. Their yields have been low, they have no credit, the banks are scared of giving them money because they say they can't repay. There are too few tractors to work with, so the young people can't be interested in agriculture because it is too tedious so we have been feeding off imports.What is being done to curb wastage of what we produce when farmers cannot preserve what they harvest? Most harvest losses have been about 30 per cent or sometimes 40 per cent and we are dealing with that. We have 33 silos, big, some 80,000 or 100,000 tons. We were going to concession them, we now realised that the national demand is so huge that concessioning may not be immediately useful. We may put ourselves in a situation where the private concessioners have control and the government has none and the government has the duty to feed its people; it is in the constitution. We are expected to guarantee the good feeding of our people. So, storage is not an issue anymore with grains, the real question is value addition. We have a programme in the ministry called Livelihood Improvement Family Enterprise (LIFE). We are moving small scale processing machineries into rural areas. Palm oil mills, palm kernel mills, rice mills, groundnut oil mills, Shea butter mills spreading as far into the rural areas as possible because there have been one strategic mistake in our development strategy. A tree is not irrigated from the leaves but from the roots and unless and until we recognise that our attempt to develop will be a complete failure as long as we continue to think only of the cities and the big factories, we will never make it. We want to take life to the villages. You go into the village, a family is going to bed and not one member has a hundred naira. You have been hearing of people stealing pots of soup and amala. Frankly I am not a propagandist, the change we are talking about is taking place slowly, it is not loud. We have been visiting farm and talking to farmers. One man sold his rice in Jigawa last week for N120,000 for one ton and he said ""is this my rice and I alone this made this money? He gave out half the money to people in his excitement and said they should go and pray for the government that he never thought that in his life he will see N120,000. That is one ton and that fellow if he plants one hectare will make N1.1million and I saw farmers with rice farms stretching 100 kilometres along the Hadejia river bank, three giant rice mills processing Nigerian rice, fresh rice, 10 trailers leaving Jigawa daily heading South. We are encouraging them to put one in Maigatari which is at the borders with Niger Republic, because the people of Niger don't eat parboiled rice, they eat white rice. I told the governor let us put one these for exports, but this time people change their money in the bank so that they can take the naira and we know how much is coming in.\l"
"COP22","Nigeria","COP22_Nigeria59","Why the World Must Tackle Corruption and Terrorism Now","September 27, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","The two main issues that dominated the just concluded 2016 Annual Conference of the International Bar Association in Washington DC were Corruption and Terrorism. Jude Igbanoi who was at the conference reports on why the two global issues formed the focal point at this year's IBA Conference from September 18 - 23.For good reasons the International Bar Association prides itself as the Global Voice of the Legal Profession and this year's conference of the worldwide body of lawyers truly lived up to this reputation.Over 6,000 lawyers from every country in the world converged in the United States Capital, Washington DC to participate in the conference. For Nigerian lawyers, IBA has become an instructive lesson on conferencing as the body has continued to deliver quality conferences over the years. Registration is smooth, seamless and hassle-free. On the average it takes less than 10 minutes to get registered with all conference materials, including bag given to delegates. This is a sharp difference from what obtains in Nigeria at the Nigerian Bar Association conferences.In an exclusive chat with the IBA Executive Director, Dr. Mark Ellis, the key is 'early planning.' IBA meticulously plans its conferences years ahead. For instance preparation for its 2017 conference in Sydney Australia is already in top gear. Dr. Ellis also told THISDAY LAWYER that in fact plans for the association's 2018 conference in Rome, Italy are already in advance stages.Perhaps, Nigeria has a lot to learn from this and the President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr. A.B. Mahmoud SAN in a chat with THISDAY LAWYER said 'I had extensive meetings with the IBA President Mr. Rivkin and the Executive Director, Dr. Ellis on the possibility of our collaborating with the IBA with a view to improving on our conferences. I hope to visit the London Headquarters of the IBA with some staff of the NBA to enable some staff of the NBA National Secretariat understudy the IBA and see what we can learn from them. They have been successful at organizing their conferences for many years and we must acknowledge this.'This year's Keynote Speaker was the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde and her presentation Mending the Trust Divide was quite emotive and inspiring. Lagarde told the august body of lawyers that the unique mandate of the IMF is to promote economic prosperity and financial stability, through international cooperation and an open system for the free flow of goods and investments.She anchored her paper on corruption and public trust saying 'A key factor fueling this distrust is corrupt and unethical behavior, actual or perceived - and in both the public and private sector. Addressing corruption and unethical behavior involves not only improving the quality of the legal framework but also the quality of the individuals who implement this framework.'Other distinguished personalities who spoke at the conference included Jack Straw, British Foreign Secretary 2001-2006, Arlene Foster First Minister of Northern Ireland, General Colin Powell US Secretary of State (2001-2005), Christopher Dodd Former Senator from Connecticut and Ben Bernanke, former Chairman, Board of Governors, US Federal Reserve.Nigerian lawyers also presented papers at the various sessions of the conference including Mr. Femi Falana SAN, Dr. Babatunde Ajibade SAN and Mallam Yusuf Ali SAN.Our 69 Years of Global Commitment to Lawyers - IBA President, David RivkinWe are here to see old friends, to meet new ones, and to enjoy the hospitality and the sights of Washington, but also of course to engage in the many important substantive conversations that will take place at our keynote, showcase and committee sessions throughout the week.Given the many challenges faced by lawyers and our clients around the world, the work of the IBA has never been more important, and I thank all of you for being involved in it.Since its founding in 1947, the IBA has been dedicated to the promotion and preservation of the Rule of Law throughout the world. Today, as we face many new challenges to the Rule of Law around the world, it is important to remember that it is neither a new concept nor one rooted only in the tradition of some countries. The Rule of Law is an ancient and universal concept. As early as the 5th century BC, China developed and advocated the philosophy of legalism - a political system based on laws.In ancient Greece, Plato wrote, ""Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the Gods shower on the state.""When I had the honor of visiting the Mexican Supreme Court last month, I saw on its walls a statement by Cicero that ""We are servants to the Supreme Court in order to be free.""In Islamic law, the concept of justice is paramount. The Quran says ""David, we have made you master in the land. Rule with justice among men."" The Prophet is said to have proclaimed, ""one hour of justice is worth more than 60 years of divine service.""And of course, last year, the IBA joined with many others in celebrating the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, a document that continues to inspire the conviction that no person, not even a Ruler, is above the law, as well as the fundamental principle that any accused person is entitled to due process.Since we last met in Vienna, the IBA has had an extraordinary year in serving this mission.In January in Myanmar, I had the honor of joining Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in addressing the inaugural conference of the Independent Lawyers Association of Myanmar. Thanks to the diligent work of the IBA's Human Rights Institute in forming this association, thousands of lawyers came together in the recognition that independent lawyers serving their clients' interests, free of government interference, are an essential step in the creation of a new democracy.Similarly in Cuba, the IBA has been conducting training programs for Cuban lawyers on the essential aspects of international business law: corporate organization, intellectual property, international sales and dispute resolution. In my meetings last year with the Chief Justice, Attorney General and other senior officials, they recognized that Cuba cannot open its doors to new trade and investment unless lawyers have the ability to serve their clients in these areas.As you know, earlier this year the IBA Council adopted the IBA Practical Guide for Business Lawyers on Business and Human Rights. To serve our clients effectively these days, lawyers must understand the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and similar documents. And no matter what our practice area, we must advise our clients in a manner that assists them in avoiding human rights impacts and promotes their, and our, integrity.The IBA's Presidential Initiatives have taken many important, practical steps towards solving some of our most difficult problems. Thanks to the time that many of you took in completing our survey on judicial corruption, our Judicial Integrity Initiative published an enormously useful report on the types of corruption that arise in judicial systems and the manner in which such corruption occurs. Building from that base, the Judicial Integrity Initiative is now undertaking many projects designed to have a practical impact in reducing corruption in judiciaries where it occurs: Last month, I attended a ceremony in Mexico City at which the Chief Justice and the presidents of the three Mexican bars signed the IBA Judicial Anti-Corruption Compact.The Compact is designed to be signed by individual judges, lawyers, prosecutors and court administrators; they commit to each other and to the public that they will not engage in corrupt activities and that they will report any such activities that they may witness. By publishing the Compact and its signatories on the websites of our member bar associations and the judiciaries, we hope to change the expectation in many countries that corruption is the only way to succeed in a judicial proceeding. We look forward to many other countries following Mexico's excellent example.We are also working on developing a set of standards and an organization through which judiciaries may be certified as having procedures in place that will prevent corrupt activities. We are researching best practices in investigating allegations of judicial corruption, and also the manner in which all of our member bar associations and law societies investigate and sanction potential corrupt conduct by their members. And we are surveying national laws to determine if the laws, in fact, make illegal the types of corruption found in our survey. If we find gaps and deficiencies, the IBA will propose a model statute to correct them.The Presidential Task Force on Human Trafficking has issued a seminal report on the impact of corruption on human trafficking. The report makes vividly clear that human trafficking could not occur without corruption, and it proposes concrete steps that governments, private companies and NGOs should take to prevent human trafficking. I had the honor of presenting these findings, along with the IBA's efforts on judicial corruption, to a conference of judges and prosecutors organized by the Vatican at which Pope Francis gave a beautiful and passionate speech about how much the law is needed in order to preserve morality. The Pope proclaimed, ""Justice is the first attribute of society.""The Presidential Task Force on the Independence of the Legal Profession has also issued an important report on the essential criteria of an independent bar and why an independent bar is so essential to democracy. These reports are available on the IBA website, and I encourage you to read them. Whatever your area of practice, you will find them illuminating.The IBA's work on Climate Change Justice and Human Rights has continued aggressively as many IBA committees have worked to implement the recommendations of our flagship 2014 report.Our working groups on remedies and adaptation have drafted important proposals that will be discussed at this conference.From the Vatican to David Cameron's governmental conference on corruption to a UN conference on climate change headed by Ban Ki-Moon, and in many other fora, the IBA's voice has been sought and listened to as the authoritative voice of the legal profession - for the ideas that we present and the contributions we have made and will continue to make. I strongly encourage you to attend the showcase sessions this week at which the work of each of these task forces - Judicial Integrity, Climate Change Justice, Human Trafficking and Independence of the Profession - is discussed. You will be proud of the work they have done.And of course, the 77 committees of the IBA have remained enormously active. Their accomplishments are far too many for me to mention tonight, so let me highlight one as an example.Our committees on Access to Justice and Legal Aid conducted an extensive research project on the challenges children face gaining access to justice and the strategies and solutions employed by countries around the world to address them. By raising awareness of the problem and highlighting best practices, the project has demonstrated the fundamental importance of access to justice as an empowerment tool for children to help reduce poverty and realize the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda. The results of this work will also be presented at a committee session on Thursday morning.Indeed, the conference this week offers more than the usual number of extraordinary sessions. In addition to the showcase sessions that I have already mentioned, this conference offers special opportunities, and I hope that you will take advantage of them. To be in Washington at the end of an Administration I very much admire gives us a chance to hear from high government officials about their view of the world and what the Obama Administration has achieved.Whatever else you have planned for this week, please come to the special Morning Keynote Addresses, to be presented by three Cabinet officers and Congressman: On Monday, the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who has a unique perspective on how to combat terrorism while maintaining adherence to the rule of law; on Tuesday, the Deputy US Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Holleyman, who will discuss the latest status of TPP and TTIP and why the Administration believes that TPP can have a direct and meaningful impact developing the rule of law in the region; on Wednesday, we can hear directly from Attorney General Loretta Lynch -who has been called the savior of FIFA -- about US efforts to combat corruption, human trafficking, terrorism and cyber-crime. And on Thursday, we will discuss the Presidential election and the stalemate that affects Washington politics with Congressman Scott Peters.I hope that you will join me at all of these keynotes at 9:30 each morning; we have scheduled the committee sessions to start after they are concluded, so that everyone has a chance to attend.And we have a roll call of other guests: Colin Powell and Robert Mueller, among others, in the lunchtime Conversations With; SEC Chair Mary Jo White at the LPD lunch on Wednesday and Legal Adviser to the State Department Brian Egan at the SPPI lunch on Thursday.On Friday, come hear Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy at our Rule of Law Day. And of course, in a few moments, we will get to hear from a leader with enormous influence around the world: IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. I am looking forward to hearing her, as I know you are.At the Rule of Law Day, you can also share in an IBA project that has been very meaningful and thoroughly enriching. At the beginning of my term, we searched for young Israeli and Palestinian lawyers who would one day be leaders in their communities in the hope that bringing them together to discuss issues of common interest and how international law could impact the conflict in their region could one day lead to peace.We found 12 extraordinary lawyers: Israeli Jews, Arab Israelis and Palestinians. We brought them to Prague for three three-day sessions and again this weekend in Washington, and the results have far exceeded our expectations. They have bonded; they have cried together; they have respectfully disagreed; and they have found common approaches to international law to propose solutions to intractable problems. Witnessing their discussions has been among the most memorable moments of my IBA Presidency.On Friday morning, many of them will appear together in our Rule of Law program to discuss what they have learned from one another. They will be joined by two experts who have worked towards Middle East peace. Please come and share the experience that has so touched me.This has been a challenging year for lawyers around the world. We have seen lawyers and judges imprisoned, disbarred and removed from office in China, Turkey, Venezuela, Egypt and elsewhere. In Pakistan, we have witnessed the premeditated slaughter of lawyers who had come to a hospital in respect of a bar leader who had been previously assaulted. Those who want to rule autocratically know that they have to intimidate and remove lawyers who will use the rule of law to oppose them.As lawyers who have been fortunate enough to be successful in our practices, we have an obligation to defend them, to speak out, to make clear that this cannot stand. As IBA President, I have used the power of the office to speak directly to those who suppress lawyers and freedom. All of us have the power to do so, as individuals, collectively or through our bars, and we must do so.Our Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, little knowing that he would one day be the subject of perhaps the most successful musical in Broadway history, wrote in the Federalist Papers, ""Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever will be, pursued until it be obtained, or liberty be lost in the pursuit.""One way to benefit lawyers under attack is for all of us to do a better job explaining to the general public the important role that we play in defending everyone's liberties, the time and expense we commit to defending those who cannot afford to pay us, and in making the law more fair and just for all.Write a piece in your local newspaper or social media. Speak at your place of worship or a local school about the rule of law. And to do this, we also have to preserve the reputations of all lawyers, because publicity about one lawyer who has crossed the l"

Even as the US delegation negotiates with representatives of other countries at this year's United Nations climate change conference in Marrakesh about how to strengthen the deal made in Paris last December, its members know their efforts could be set at nought when Trump, a climate change denier, moves into the White House. The Marrakesh event is the 22nd conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), , and its ""high-level segment"" involving ministers, which starts tomorrow, will show what countries are prepared to do to close the ""emissions gap"" and put Earth on a safer course. Just two months after taking office in January 2001, Barack Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, disowned the Kyoto Protocol on the basis that ""it exempts 80 per cent of the world, including major population centres such as China and India from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy"". The difference between then and now is that both China and India as well as every other country on Earth have signed up to the Paris agreement, pledging to work towards the goal of reducing carbon emissions to limit global warming at ""well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels"". Negative outcome Although it took eight years to ratify the more limited Kyoto Protocol after it was adopted in 1997, the Paris deal came into force in just 11 months and part of the impetus among countries in setting this UN record was to guard against a negative outcome in the US election. That negative outcome has now come to pass, magnified by a Republican-controlled Congress. And just as Bush surrounded himself with oil men as his energy advisers, the president-elect has been doing the same, with a view to ""cancelling"" the Paris agreement. Trump would also prevent the US Environmental Protection Agency regulating carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, end Obama's clean energy programme, promote more hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") and even permit drilling for oil and gas in American national parks.""Rather than continuing the current path to undermine and block America's fossil fuel producers, the Trump administration will encourage the production of these resources by opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and water,"" the incoming president's transition team has said. The permit process for ""billions of dollars"" in dirty energy projects ""held up by President Obama"" would be streaml"

It could cause reputational damage for the country that will ""sooner or later come home to roost"".The caustic view on the national response to changing climate is expressed in a blog by Prof John Sweeney of Maynooth University, who is attending the COP22 meeting in Marrakesh. Minister for Climate Action Denis Naughten addressed the assembly yesterday, describing Ireland's plans for a climate dialogue and a mitigation and adaptation strategy.Prof Sweeney noted, however, that Mr Naughten did not mention Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions were rising rather than falling. ""But then again Ireland's position is beginning to be well known in the wider world as a delinquent country when it comes to walking the walk rather than talking the talk about climate change,"" Prof Sweeney wrote.He commented on the country's ""pathetic"" contribution to the Green Climate Fund, an effort to mobilise $100 billion (EUR 93.3 billion) annually in aid to help developing countries to reach their climate targets.""Ireland, with the second highest GDP per capita in the EU and one of the highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita, has pledged EUR 0.53,"" he wrote in an earlier blog.The latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency show Ireland is unlikely to meet EU emission-reduction targets for at least this year and 2017.Agriculture emissions are projected to increase 7 per cent up to 2020, and transport by 16 per cent.Prof Sweeney's blogs are being published by An Taisce.\l"

In other words, a warming planet reduces the likelihood of extremely low temperatures.The WMO report confirms that the last five years were the hottest on record. It adds that of 79 studies published between 2011 and 2014, more than half found that human-induced climate change contributed to the extreme event in question.High impact events for which these conclusions are drawn include Storm Desmond in Ireland and the UK last winter and the heatwave which struck western and central Europe last July. Others include the record temperatures in the United States in 2012 and Australia in 2013.The report was submitted to the UN Climate Change Conference, COP22, which takes place at Marrakech in Morocco until November 18, where implementation of the historic Paris climate deal, which came into force last Friday, will be discussed.It aims to limit global temperature increases to well below 2C by making profound cuts in emissions, but Ireland is lagging behind. The latest assessment of Ireland from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says that emissions from transport and agriculture will continue to rise through to 2020.The European Environment Agency yesterday named Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg as being the only EU member states which must introduce additional policies to achieve legally-binding cuts by 2020.\l"

They are commuting between the scattered remnants of our great coastal salt marshes and our burgeoning city sportsfields, adapting rapidly to the world our species is remaking so fast, and so recklessly.The Phoenix Park on a December morning is a place of full of magic, right in the middle of the capital. Nature doesn't sleep in winter, if we keep our senses awake. Yet every venture into the natural world in our era may be fraught with anxieties.For example, I can't help wondering whether our culture is slowly turning the brent geese, whose migration links us directly to wild Arctic landscapes, into domesticated suburbanites.Then, as I cycle on across the Fifteen Acres, I find another source of stress: I am running out of puff on level ground. Advancing age? Okay, that's a factor, if you insist, but there's a more immediate problem. I am all wrapped up for winter, with fleeces, gloves, scarf and woolly hat. It slowly dawns on me that I have overheated drastically. In December? Yes, it's 14 degrees at 10am. I have to shed all upper layers but my shirt to regain my energy. So why the anxiety? There have always been freak warm spells in winter, haven't there? Yes, but the past year is already likely to be the hottest on record.So the unseasonal clamminess triggers a sharp, angry pang about our failure to tackle climate change, at home and abroad - about the Taoiseach's shameful doublespeak at COP21, the United Nations in Paris exactly a year ago, for instance. He told the delegates inside the hall that Ireland was ""serious"" and ""determined to play its part"" in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Moments later he told Irish journalists outside that Ireland would do no such thing but would demand exemptions for rising emissions created by his Government's agricultural policy.

"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland7","Leading change and powering the future","September 10, 2016","Eolas Magazine","The energy system and the electricity system are changing and the scale and pace of that change is accelerating. Working with business and communities around the country, and with our stakeholders in the energy sector, EirGrid is stepping up to this challenge. For large businesses that are making investment decisions here in Ireland, a secure supply of electricity is at the top of their list of critical priorities. In fact, a recent survey highlighted that 90 per cent of major companies viewed quality of electricity as important or very important in their investment decisions in Ireland.Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon have all located data centres here in the in the past two years. Given that these centres all require a large amount of reliable quality electricity; this would not have been possible without confidence in our electricity system.Demonstrating leadership In order to maintain and build on this confidence, EirGrid is focused on planning for the future. To ensure a secure supply of electricity now and for years to come, EirGrid must maintain and develop the national grid. This may sometimes require new infrastructure, such as the proposed North-South Interconnector, but where possible, we make the most of existing assets. We're continuously pushing the envelope of knowledge around power system operation with our innovation programmes, including DS3 (Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System) and the Smart Grid Innovation Hub. These initiatives explore the use of new technologies and methodologies to allow for a more flexible and adaptive use of the grid. This is in response to the increasing role of renewable energy sources, which can't simply be ""turned on"" to meet demand for electricity. In the meantime, it is critical that we continue to look ahead. At EirGrid, we base our plans on the key forces that are central to shaping the energy industry in the future. These include climate change, new technology, regionalisation and user participation. Climate changeEirGrid has no role in choosing one form of energy generation over another, and we have no interest or involvement in any form of energy generation. However, we are required to respond to Government policy, and to connect new energy generators to our grid when requested. Because of the threat of climate change, there is an increasing push for greater use of renewable energy sources. This requires significant changes to how we operate the grid, and how we plan for its future. On a positive note, what was agreed in Paris last year at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) was remarkable. As Al Gore commented: ""This universal and ambitious agreement sends a clear signal to governments, businesses, and investors everywhere; the transformation of our global economy from one fuelled by dirty energy to one fuelled by sustainable economic growth is now firmly and inevitably underway.""New technologyIn technological terms, the electricity industry is changing rapidly. What we're now seeing is new technologies, new telecommunication capabilities and the rise of big data. These all have the ability to disrupt the value chain and introduce new business models across many sectors. The electricity industry, and especially the transmission grid, will need to respond. There are new technology innovations in energy generation and transmission. The Irish grid now includes 10MW of battery storage, operated by AES in Belfast. EirGrid is also trialling new devices to control, in real time, the flow of power on our transmission system.These provide a glimpse of how we will manage and transition the power system over the coming 20 years.RegionalisationAt EU level, approaching energy from a regional perspective will continue to be important for a number of reasons. It assists us as we seek to establish the foundations to address climate change. It also empowers us to drive competition as it decreases barriers to trade and drives out lower prices for consumers. Finally, it addresses energy security in what is an increasingly noisy and fractious geo-political environment. Regionalisation has a number of implications for Ireland. First of these is the new wholesale energy market arrangements being put in place to meet the EU target model. There is also a focus on increased interconnection. EirGrid commissioned the East West Interconnector to the UK in 2012 and EirGrid is now looking at a new interconnector to France, called the Celtic Interconnector. This will all lead to increased coupling between markets, which will drive consolidation, increased competition, and ultimately lower energy prices.User participation In contrast to regionalisation at a European level, user participation is about individuals at household and domestic level becoming active in the energy market. This will be enabled by technology advances and will lead to the transformation of today's energy models. In turn, this will raise some interesting dilemmas in terms of how assets are paid for. For example, if you have invested in solar panels and a battery and largely use the grid as a back-up, how should you pay for the grid that's there providing that back-up? Also, not everyone will have the opportunity or the resources to invest in a solar panel or a battery. There is a danger that these people could end up paying disproportionately more for the grid when it is providing a service to all. This is an issue of social equity and needs to be addressed as we see new business models emerge.Social acceptance As we think about these changes in the energy system over the next 20 years, we need to ensure that we bring people and communities with us. Without that, we won't have the ability to change the energy system to address these challenges.At EirGrid we are acutely aware of the need to engage with communities at the earliest possible opportunity. We need to build trust and respect to get input into deliberations and decision making right from the start.EirGrid must achieve the trust and permission of the public to carry out our work. This is so Ireland can respond to the coming changes in our energy system. To achieve this, EirGrid will continue to bring people and communities into our decision making process at the earliest possible opportunity. Driving innovations - residential demand side management In June, EirGrid launched a new residential demand-side management initiative. Power Off & Save is an innovative pilot that will reward customers who agree to reduce their energy use in response to a signal from the national control centre. Over the next 18 months, we're trialling this programme, in conjunction with Electric Ireland to 1,500 homes across the country. The key, innovative part of all of this is that we are enabling these domestic households to participate in meeting the needs of the power system without the need for a smart meter. As we take this pilot forward, we will see very significant benefits in terms of more efficient operation of the power system and lower costs for consumers as a whole.Powering the future Continued collaboration across society, from leaders in the public sector, the business community and communities right across the country, will be central to shape the future of our energy industry. These partnerships will also ensure EirGrid can respond to the challenges and opportunities of change in the energy market. Working together, we can be ready for the future.EirGrid plc - Transmission System Operator, Ireland.The Oval, 160 Shelbourne Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.\l"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland8","Donald Trump and the fox with the keys to the eco-henhouse","November 19, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","People laughed in 2005 when a little-known energy-industry advocate with a BA in philosophy and an MSc in political science rounded on the UK's chief scientist, David King, calling him ""an alarmist with ridiculous views who knows nothing about climate change"". They're not laughing now. The man in question, Myron Ebell, has been named by President-Elect Donald Trump to head his transition team at the US Environmental Protection Agency. The fox has been handed the keys of the ecological henhouse. Where some people see an overwhelming expert consensus, Ebell scents a conspiracy. He clumped climate scientists and environmentalists together as what he called the forces of darkness.Trump's ever-pivoting positions on a range of issues could be likened to a Rorschach test, where what you see depends largely on what you choose to see. One big exception is his consistent hostility to environmental regulation. He has peddled the theory that global warming is a hoax ""invented by the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive"".This week, at the United Nations' COP22 climate-change conference in Marrakesh, the outgoing US secretary of state, John Kerry, just back from a fact-finding mission to Antarctica, stressed the deadly consequences of inaction. He said that ""2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. Every month so far has broken a record. At some point even the strongest sceptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening."" The world, he added, stands at a critical juncture. ""If we lose this moment for action there's no speech decades from now that will put these ice sheets back together.""While routinely dismissing the ""bullshit"" science of global warming, Trump quietly bowed to reality when his own Doonbeg golf links, in Co Clare, applied for planning permission to build an enormous sea wall after 8m of frontage fell into the Atlantic during a recent storm. The application to Clare County Council cited the threat of global warming and rising sea levels. It seems that only self-interest can motivate the president-elect to articulate a different point of view. The same cannot be said of his team. Vice-President-Elect Mike Pence is a creationist, believing that Earth is just a few thousand years old and that a billion years of geological evidence is, presumably, another branch of the vast scientific conspiracy against his belief in the literal truth of the Bible.In 2002 Karl Rove, President George W Bush's senior adviser, berated a New York Times reporter for being part of the ""reality-based community . . . We're an empire now, and when we act we create our own reality."" Bending reality to your ideology may work in politics. Physics is less pliable.What if Trump turns for counsel to his new chief strategist, Steve Bannon? Bannon's reality-warping Breitbart News Network website has personally targeted climate scientists for years, smearing them as ""scum-sucking slime balls"" and ""eco Nazis"" who are ""corrupt, mendacious, bullying, fascistic, misanthropic, greedy, totalitarian and rotten to the very core"". While Trump has often been at odds with the Republican Party, they stand shoulder to shoulder in their ambition to wipe out half a century of environmental regulations by gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and doing their best to sabotage the fragile international consensus of the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change. This ensures four years of backsliding just as the global climate system may be tipping ever-closer to irreversible catastrophe.Even before November 8th scientists and activists were shocked by the dire news emanating almost daily from climate science. For many this is now full-blown panic. ""We're talking about anxiety disorder, but this is not a disorder,"" Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist based in Washington, DC, says. ""Civilisation is on the tracks, and you can see the train coming. That's not a disorder: that's responding to reality."" John Gibbons is an environmental writer and commentator; @think_or_swim\l"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland9","Spiral of silence on climate change needs to be broken","November 19, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","Most people who like to read probably have a couple of books that sit in a privileged spot on a bookshelf because they wielded so much influence on their thinking that it is comforting to have them close to hand. For me one of those books is The Spiral of Silence by Elisabeth Noelle Neumann.When I read her work, ideas that had been floating around in my head in an inchoate form took proper shape for the first time. It's an old book, first published in 1974, and revised in 1994.\~ Noelle-Neumann was a political scientist who was puzzled by the inability of opinion polls to accurately predict election results. Then a chance encounter in the early 1970s with a student who was wearing a Christian Democrat badge changed everything. When Noelle-Neumann commented mildly that she had not been aware that the student was a Christian Democrat supporter, the student explained that she was not: she just wanted to experience what it was like. When Noelle-Neumann met her later, the badge was gone. The student told her that she took it off because the reaction was so awful.Noelle-Neumann suddenly had a major insight. She began to research a hypothesis that people stay silent when they feel their views are not those of the majority because they fear isolation. The spiral begins because when people self-silence, others also become more reticent, and so it appears that there is no opposition to the prevailing consensus.However, in the privacy of the ballot box people could do what they wish. By adding one simple question to polls, accuracy increased exponentially. The question was: aside from your own opinion, who do you think will win the election? By being allowed to dissociate themselves from unpopular opinion, they told the truth of their own voting intentions. Holds true Of course, the book was written before the internet, but I think it still holds true. It just means that due to Facebook's algorithms you are less and less likely to realise that there are other enclaves where people hold entirely different views. The spiral of silence explains why commentators, aside from a few, did not see Brexit or Trump's victory coming.\~I was interested to see the spiral of silence referenced in a recent post by the Yale Program on Climate Communication. It was pondering whether there is a spiral of silence around climate change because it had conducted polls that showed two out of three Americans are moderately or very interested in climate change, yet seven out of 10 rarely spoke about it to friends or neighbours.At first glance I was not sure that the spiral of silence theory fits. There would have to be an overwhelming media and public consensus that climate change is not real, or not due to human factors, for people to keep so quiet about their contrarian view that it exists. In fact, what the same survey showed is that less than half of those surveyed heard about climate change in the media once a month or more. Far from an overwhelming push in one direction, there was very little about it at all. It is the same in this country. There will be dutiful coverage of Marrakesh and COP22, the current negotiations on implementing the agreement reached in Paris last year.Likewise, few are aware of our record on renewable energy. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy only accounts for 23 per cent of our electricity generation compared to 38 per cent in Scotland. EU fines Similarly, even though it will probably cost us up to EUR 6 billion in EU fines, the fact that we will not meet our emission-reduction targets by 2020 will scarcely register in the average person's mind. This is not because there is a huge climate change denial movement in Ireland. Nor are there vast numbers on the other side. There are a few passionate voices trying to raise awareness of climate change, but they can be dismissed by one phrase - tree hugger.Maybe that is where the spiral of silence theory fits - being passionate about ameliorating the effects of climate change is only for those who are slightly eccentric or whacky.Then there is the indisputable fact that if you take climate change, environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity seriously, it scares the hell out of you. In Ireland, the general response to having the hell scared out of you is to have another pint.One response to this crisis is to highlight the job opportunities and the better, cleaner world that will result. This is important, but people need motivation to change entrenched habits. Finding a judicious balance between being paralysed by terror and yet motivated to change is not easy.Aside from any spiral of silence, there are real feelings of overwhelm induced by fear. In any area of life the most effective counter to feeling overwhelmed is to begin to take action, no matter how small. And if the Yale study is accurate, breaking the silence by having conversations about climate change with friends and family is a good place to start.\l"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland10","Let's be thought-leaders on climate smart agriculture; Ireland has an opportunity to become a global pioneer in the areas of food security and climate change","July 14, 2016 Thursday","The Irish Times","Ensuring food and nutrition security for all while avoiding climate change is one of the key challenges of the 21st century. The world population is projected to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050 from 7.3 billion now, requiring an increase of 70 per cent in food production.Food security and climate change are interconnected. Agriculture is a contributor to and is affected by climate change. In recent years, climate smart agriculture (CSA), an approach linking agriculture and climate policies, has received attention. CSA seeks to increase agricultural productivity and incomes, build resilience to climate change and reduce emissions.In the past 18 months the Institute of International and European Affairs/Royal Dublin Society Leadership Forum has worked to identify how CSA could apply to agriculture here and how Ireland could contribute to policy on global food security and climate change. The forum brought together key stakeholders from Government departments, State agencies, the private sector, farm organisations, and development and environmental non-governmental organisations. The outcome of this process is an independent IIEA/RDS report which will be launched today by Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.The report concludes that Ireland should become a global pioneer in climate smart agriculture, and seek to provide policy and thought leadership at European and international level to the food security/climate change debate.In seeking to attain such a leadership position, Ireland faces unique circumstances. Due to the structure of the Irish economy and the livestock-based agricultural sector, agriculture accounts for a higher proportion of greenhouse gas emissions here than in other EU countries. Following the abolition of the EU milk quota last year the Government is committed to expanding food production, which will increase emissions. At the same time, the State faces formidable European and international targets to reduce emissions.Climate change These circumstances also bring opportunities. Due to demanding EU climate targets in place since 2008, considerable innovation in policy, technology and on-farm practices has been delivered. Irish officials have been at the forefront of policy thinking on agriculture and climate change at EU and UN negotiations. Bord Bia's Origin Green scheme brings together the Government, the agrifood sector and farmers to set and achieve measurable sustainability targets and reduce the environmental impact of food production. The Farm Carbon Navigator, developed by Bord Bia and Teagasc, promotes technologies to reduce input use, increase farm income and reduce emissions.The IIEA/RDS report seeks to build on progress made. If Ireland is to aspire to credible international leadership in this area, however, progress must be brought to a different level. The report sets out an ambitious agenda that could deliver such leadership and the benefits that would flow from it. The agenda needs to be delivered through Government policy and political commitment; implementation by the farming and agri-food sector of an ambitious CSA programme; and policy advocacy at international level.An ambitious programme, anchored in a credible domestic policy on climate change and supported by high level political commitment, is required. We recommend the strategic reorientation of agricultural and food policy around agricultural productivity and incomes, resilience, and emissions reduction at Irish and European level. The Government should detail how the progressive vision of a ""carbon neutral"" agriculture and land use sector by 2050, to which it is committed, can be attained, with progress measured annually and reported upon.The end of milk quotas presents an opportunity for the expansion of dairy and beef enterprises which are climate smart and economically beneficial for farmers. There are opportunities for farmers and rural communities investing in renewable energy: financial incentives targeting citizens should be part of an innovative sustainable development policy for rural Ireland. Irish Aid The report recommends that the domestic focus on CSA leadership be complemented by mainstreaming it into our diplomacy at EU and UN level. Irish Aid should integrate climate smart agriculture into its current prioritisation of nutrition and food security, linking up with the main Irish NGOs with such programmes in developing countries. During the next round of UN climate negotiations at COP22 in Marrakesh in November, Ireland should advocate for a specific work programme on the agriculture-climate-food nexus.The IIEA/RDS report focuses on the potential we believe exists for Ireland to play an international leadership role on CSA. If such a role can be attained Ireland could position itself as a leader in the production of sustainable and carbon-efficient food, with obvious commercial gain. But there is another dimension: if the State can influence policy on agriculture and climate change in developing countries, backed up by proven technologies and domestic experience of mainstreaming climate change into agricultural and nutritional strategies, we will contribute to improving the life chances of tens of millions of people.

Oil demand for passenger cars will reduce due to increased electrification of the fleet and use of biogas, but there will be greater oil price volatility over the coming years.""We see clear winners for the next 25 years - natural gas but especially wind and solar - replacing the champion of the previous 25 years, coal,"" said Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. ""But there is no single story about the future of global energy. In practice, government policies will determine where we go from here.""The report includes a detailed analysis of the pledges to reduce emissions, but warns if current proposals from parties to the Paris Climate Agreement, who are currently meeting at COP 22 in Marrakech, are upheld, warming will increase by 2.7C by 2100. Scientists have warned that 2C of warming is a tipping point. If warming goes beyond this, changes to the climate system could be irreversible. The current pledges will only ""slow down"" projected increases in emissions from an average of 650 million tonnes a year to 150 million tonnes.""While this is a significant achievement, it is far from enough to avoid the worst impact of climate change as it would only limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2.7C by 2100,"" the IEA said.Emissions must peak in the next few years, and there needs to be 700 million electric cars by 2040 and increased use of renewables to the industrial, building and transport sectors.Use of natural gas, which is less-polluting, will expand while oil and coal will play a reduced role. The IEA warned that record falls in investment levels in oil and gas could lead to a ""significant risk"" of a shortfall, and that we were entering a period of ""greater oil price volatility"".Increased gas supply from the US, Australia and elsewhere will ""trigger"" a shift to a more competitive market.\l"

His comments are a huge source of worry for delegates attending the COP 22 climate talks in Marrakesh, especially in light of the World Meteorological Organisation this week warning 2016 will be the hottest year on record.There is a justifiable concern that if the world's secondbiggest polluter after China does nothing to tackle climate change, what hope of other nations playing their part? Almost 200 countries are represented in Morocco, with world leaders due to arrive today. They are working to advance policies to limit warming to no more than 2C and help the most vulnerable countries adapt.Regardless of Mr Trump and other contrarians, the world is changing, albeit slowly. As UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, action on climate change has become ""unstoppable"".But Ireland lags far behind. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Concerns about agriculture are paid lip service for fear of offending the powerful farmers' lobby. Plans to roll out renewable energy are stymied by mistrust, and there isn't enough funding to retrofit houses, despite being a proven way to reduce emissions, save households money and create employment.More worrying still is the increase in transport emissions, which have risen every year for the last three. Some 1,200 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, which is largely driven by engine fumes. In this context, the National Transport Authority's Rail Review comes at an opportune time.Although stark in its message - fund the railways or cut services - this has been said before, and ignored. The harsh reality is that unless services are used, the taxpayer cannot keep subsidies flowing.During the big freezes of recent years, trains were packed. But when the snow melted, commuters went back to their cars. Why? Those who remained on board were not rewarded for doing the right thing either. As funding plummeted, they were hit with fare increases and higher parking charges at stations.What are the Department of Transport and NTA doing? Are they consulting with communities on what services they need to allow them to leave the car at home? Are they talking to business, and looking at staggered working times to make best use of the public transport system we have? The lack of leadership is telling.The Government has a choice. Allow congestion to grow and emissions to rise, or tackle transport. Congestion charging, bans on city centre traffic, provision of parkand-ride sites and additional funding must be discussed. Schoolchildren should be on buses, not driven to school. Local authorities like Dublin City Council making bold moves to reduce car use in our cities should be supported, not pilloried.Billions of euro has been invested in our public transport network over the years, but yet we seem happy to ignore this public resource and use the car instead. Tackling transport not only helps address our climate problem, but could also make our cities and urban areas far more pleasant places in which to live and work.\l"

After losing Bowie and Prince and gaining the most controversial US president of recent memory, I think people are ready to move on to next year. That said, I saw so many good creative things come out of Dublin in the last 12 months that I can't wait to see what 2017 holds. The creative community is slowly building here, one that takes its own initiative.I'm a photographer and publisher of a small photo journal called Junior, and the number of other printed magazines and journals that have come out this year is impressive to say the least. District funded and released their first printed issue, and Guts released their sixth edition this month. Aisling Farinella's beautiful, free fashion loose-leaf Thread returned in September and can now be found around Ireland and abroad, featuring both Irish and international talents in writing, photography and fashion design. I have been so lucky to have had a hand in some of these publications and to have been present in the community of doers and makers that bring these beautiful objects to life.In a time where nothing is concrete, I'm so happy to see people going out and making things happen for themselves, creating their own path. I'm moving to London in the New Year and am planning on working between there and Dublin. Having spent the last year out of college working in the creative community, Dublin has shown me that the grass isn't necessarily greener elsewhere. It has so much more to offer and 2016 was just a taste of what we're capable of. Bring on 2017, and all the great and awful things it might contain.The default is to hope for change in the New Year. I hope for less of it - in regard to the climate, that is.This month marked a year since the UN in Paris. At the convention, it was agreed that countries must work towards keeping the average temperature rise to well below 2\'b0C, mainly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the time since, Ireland has not only signed, but also ratified, this agreement. The Government has now firmly committed Ireland to being part of a global movement to actively fight climate change.This month has also signalled the commitment of various cities and institutions internationally to divest a collective sum of $5trillion from fossil fuels, demonstrating that many people are no longer willing to invest money in companies that are driving us toward climate disaster. Here in Ireland, Trinity has taken part in this global movement by divesting shares worth (EURO)6.1million.What I hope, and maybe expect, from 2017 is that our Government will try to take further steps to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, by incentivising the public to live more sustainably.Combating climate change now is not just important for safeguarding the future, it's also critical for protecting communities around the world who are experiencing the effects of global warming right now. It's crucial that in 2017 we take solid steps toward a greener future. Our government can no longer simply discuss climate change; we simply do not have the time. We must act now.2 CHRISTIAN TIERNEY 20, photographer, filmmaker and writer Until 2016, making music videos was all I did, but this year I branched out further and pursued new things like music photography. I ended up shooting all of the major festivals in Ireland, photographing people like Kendrick Lamar, Tame Impala, Major Lazer, The 1975 and others.I stepped away from music for the first time this year and made videos for Conor McGregor, and I did my first public speaking jobs, which I absolutely loved. I did a lot of work with (singer-songwriter) Gavin James, and I'm really excited to continue working with him in 2017 as his success continues to grow.I feel like 2016 was the year where I laid the foundations which will allow me to properly explore all of these new avenues in 2017, and that makes me extremely excited for the year ahead!7 JAKE HURLEY 21, musician I think 2017 is going to have to top 2016. 2016 was pretty wacky...In terms of creativity, there's a lot going on in Dublin at the moment. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. There are so many amazing people around making music, especially. Right now I'm working on my mixtape - it's going to be called Cartooniverse, coming out early 2017. It's fun for all the HYPERLINK http://www.family.Nowww.family.No cursing. Very clean, very Will Smith.I don't know if Ireland is changing much politically. Hopefully it will. Hopefully the Eighth will be repealed soon and other issues will follow suit. People love to complain about millennials and that 'Generation Snowflake stuff ', and it's so completely pointless. They're from a different generation half the time. When they were young, they were able to take out a loan of a million euro to buy a house.Growing up, I always bought into the narrative that the world was gradually becoming more progressive and that people were gradually becoming more open-minded, but 2016 disproved that. It showed you can take a step back, and that there are a lot of terrible people out there. Terrible young people, too. That really disillusioned me. I had assumed all the crazy Alt-Right people were only in America, but I see them here. They show up in the comment sections of Irish newspapers.8 SEAN GALLAGHER 25, content creator at Clear Haze I'm quite concerned about Trump and the backlash that'll likely come with his presidency. He's going to directly affect the rest of the world, and that's worrying. There could be a resistance, but there's so much apathy, maybe because of social media bombarding us with so much news. If you're being hit with bad news story after bad news story, it's hard to feel like you have any power. It's tempting to just sit back and watch cat videos.I make mini-documentaries on different things - most recently, we made one about food called 'Burger Bonanza'. It had seven episodes where we went around trying to find the best burger in Ireland... I'm also about to start a course in computer science, which I'm looking forward to.Looking at the current job climate, it feels like tech skills are necessary.Dublin can feel like a bit of a departure lounge; if you want to make it in certain industries you have to be prepared to leave, in order to make any impact. But I think it depends on the sector you're in - tech is certainly continuing to flourish.When I was applying for my course, they told me I'd have to do an interview, and it turned out to be with an app rather than with a person. It makes sense that they're using an automated system to power through applicants, but it still was pretty strange. I just thought, ""Wow, this is what it's like living in the future "" 9 DAMOLA FAMUYIBO 24, musician As a hip-hop artist from Dublin, I expect 2017 to be a very busy year for me with the release of a lot of new music. I have a bunch of records I put together during 2016 and I just want to feed the people with a lot of music next year. The records will also be released with music videos.I did a lot of shows in 2017, but I've decided to lay low for the first two months of 2017 and work on new material with my live band. The plan is to switch up the sound of the music and add theatrics to the performance, gearing us up for festivals in the summer. As well as working with some really good producers, my live band will be instrumental in the production of most of my new records for next year.I'm a member of Dublin based Irish hip-hop group BackShed inc, and I'll also be releasing collaborative material with members of the group, including Ange MC, Sam Ojo and Ama.We plan on officially launching the brand with a live show and some releases which we can't give away much about now...10 INA ALBRECHT 22, QA Tester at Keywords Studios and artist I arrived in Dublin near the end of 2015, so I got a glimpse of a much calmer year before we crashed into 2016. What I like about this country is the people, they fight for what they care about. Maybe I'm just lucky to have ended up around people who have strong opinions and things they care deeply about. That said, sometimes I struggle with how small Ireland is; it makes things like dating intimidating.One of the things which defined 2016 was a sense of rage. Rage can be a good thing sometimes, but I strongly believe that empathy should come first. Anger can help you work through things, but often we end up living in little bubbles by ourselves.Every year we think we're the most advanced we've ever been in history, and yes, we have made huge progress and leaps in technology, but sometimes I suspect that emotionally we're still taking baby steps. We look at Aleppo and wonder how it could happen, but that could happen here just as easily.In 2017 I'd love to see people open up a bit. We spend so much time focusing on the things which divide us that we forget to communicate and understand each other. Often, our biases project more about our own flaws than about other people. Deep down, I think we're all the same, and want to do good.5 ERIC DAVIDSON 25, editor of District Magazine I run an alternative music, art and culture website and publication called District Magazine. We cover homegrown hip-hop and R&B, which I think are going to be some of the most exciting things about 2017.The reason music is blossoming now, and will undoubtedly continue to blossom, is the multicultural nature of our island. So many young people whose parents emigrated to Ireland have now grown up. Their creativity has been shaped by the cultures of their parents and family, bringing a new stream of influence into Irish music. It's pushing everyone to make better, more diverse music. Young artists are adopting different ideas and sounds. They've realised the old constraints and stereotypes don't apply any more.Artists like Jafaris (Percy Chamburuka, who played Ngig in the film Sing Street), Kojaque, Soul\'e9, Huva, Farah Elle and Bobby Basil are part of the wave of artists taking the underground Irish hip-hop and R&B to a new level. Add to that the experimental electronic artists and leftfield bands in other genres, and you've got the makings of an exciting year for music.6 LAUREN TIEDT 21, medicine student I'm hoping 2017 will bring some positive developments to overshadow the disappointments and horrors of worldwide events from this year. I'm especially excited to see the benefits of all the hard work that's being carried out to repeal the Eighth Amendment, in the hopes of granting women in this country their reproductive rights.I'm also hoping the popularity of veganism continues to grow in Ireland in 2017, despite all the backlash it seems to attract. Since gradually adapting to a vegan lifestyle, I've noticed a mini-revolution of sorts, where people, especially teenagers and young adults, are becoming much more conscious about what exactly they're consuming and where it's coming from. I hope that this movement will also shed light on the damage unknowingly being done to the environment, before it's too late.Overall, I'm optimistic about what 2017 can offer, especially considering the amazing l"

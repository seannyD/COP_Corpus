"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland1","Meeting climate change targets after Trump election will be acid test of Paris agreement; The Marrakesh climate change conference gets under way in the shadow o....","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","The Irish Times","The Paris agreement on climate change, adopted less than a year ago and ratified internationally earlier this month, is now in danger of being undermined or even ending up dead in the water as a result of the election of Donald Trump as 45th president of the United States. Even as the US delegation negotiates with representatives of other countries at this year's United Nations climate change conference in Marrakesh about how to strengthen the deal made in Paris last December, its members know their efforts could be set at nought when Trump, a climate change denier, moves into the White House. The Marrakesh event is the 22nd conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), COP22 , and its ""high-level segment"" involving ministers, which starts tomorrow, will show what countries are prepared to do to close the ""emissions gap"" and put Earth on a safer course. Just two months after taking office in January 2001, Barack Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, disowned the Kyoto Protocol on the basis that ""it exempts 80 per cent of the world, including major population centres such as China and India from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy"". The difference between then and now is that both China and India as well as every other country on Earth have signed up to the Paris agreement, pledging to work towards the goal of reducing carbon emissions to limit global warming at ""well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels"". Negative outcome Although it took eight years to ratify the more limited Kyoto Protocol after it was adopted in 1997, the Paris deal came into force in just 11 months and part of the impetus among countries in setting this UN record was to guard against a negative outcome in the US election. That negative outcome has now come to pass, magnified by a Republican-controlled Congress. And just as Bush surrounded himself with oil men as his energy advisers, the president-elect has been doing the same, with a view to ""cancelling"" the Paris agreement. Trump would also prevent the US Environmental Protection Agency regulating carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, end Obama's clean energy programme, promote more hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") and even permit drilling for oil and gas in American national parks. ""Rather than continuing the current path to undermine and block America's fossil fuel producers, the Trump administration will encourage the production of these resources by opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and water,"" the incoming president's transition team has said. The permit process for ""billions of dollars"" in dirty energy projects ""held up by President Obama"" would be streamlined. Even as China moves away from coal, Trump's team pledged to ""end the war on coal . . . and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama administration"". Given this grim backdrop, it is no wonder that the figure of Trump has hung like a dark spectre over the climate talks in Marrakesh. But despite his determination to reverse energy policy in the US, other countries, including China, have made it clear that they will implement the Paris deal. The latest ""emissions gap report"" from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), published as the talks opened last week, shows that there is a gulf of 14 gigatonnes between what countries have pledged to do and what's actually needed to limit the rise in global surface temperatures below 2 degrees. ""UNEP's report paints a bleak picture of hunger, floods and people being forced from their homes as we hurtle towards a devastating 3.5 degree C warming of the planet [by 2100],"" Asad Rehman, spokesman for Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, has warned at the Marrakesh meeting. The World Meteorological Organisation has confirmed that the average global concentration in the atmosphere of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, has already exceeded the symbolic and significant milestone of 400 parts per million for the first time as global temperatures continue to increase. UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said: ""Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris agreement is not a given. We have embarked on an effort to change the course of two centuries of carbon-intense development. The peaking of global emissions is urgent, as is attaining far more climate-resilient societies."" The Mexican diplomat, who took over from Christiana Figueres last July, identified the provision of billions of dollars in aid for developing countries to ""green their economies"" as one of the key areas. Another major priority is to provide support for the most vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change. But Meena Raman, of the Third World Network, said: ""Against estimated needs in the trillions, rich countries are promising $100 billion (EUR 92.9 billion) and having to resort to fudging the numbers even for that. ""Without finance, the early entry into force of the Paris agreement will be much ado about nothing."" Under the Paris timetable, ideally no later than 2018, parties to the deal are meant to complete details of a ""rulebook"" that would measure, account for and review the adequacy of actions taken by all countries to accelerate global climate action and ensure that the targets agreed last December are met. How this will be done in the context of a Trump presidency will be an acid test of the rest of the world's commitment to dealing with the climate crisis. If the new administration in Washington decides to pull the plug on US participation in the UNFCCC process, the likelihood is that China will take the lead. Veteran UNFCCC participant Alden Meyer, of the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said even Trump ""will not be powerful enough to change the laws of physics or wish away the serious impacts climate change is having on people in the US and around the world."" That's the reality check. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland2","Ireland a 'delinquent' given lack of action on climate change","November 18, 2016 Friday","The Irish Times","Ireland is a delinquent country given its failure to respond adequately to climate change. It could cause reputational damage for the country that will ""sooner or later come home to roost"". The caustic view on the national response to changing climate is expressed in a blog by Prof John Sweeney of Maynooth University, who is attending the COP22 meeting in Marrakesh. Minister for Climate Action Denis Naughten addressed the assembly yesterday, describing Ireland's plans for a climate dialogue and a mitigation and adaptation strategy. Prof Sweeney noted, however, that Mr Naughten did not mention Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions were rising rather than falling. ""But then again Ireland's position is beginning to be well known in the wider world as a delinquent country when it comes to walking the walk rather than talking the talk about climate change,"" Prof Sweeney wrote. He commented on the country's ""pathetic"" contribution to the Green Climate Fund, an effort to mobilise $100 billion (EUR 93.3 billion) annually in aid to help developing countries to reach their climate targets. ""Ireland, with the second highest GDP per capita in the EU and one of the highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita, has pledged EUR 0.53,"" he wrote in an earlier blog. The latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency show Ireland is unlikely to meet EU emission-reduction targets for at least this year and 2017. Agriculture emissions are projected to increase 7 per cent up to 2020, and transport by 16 per cent. Prof Sweeney's blogs are being published by An Taisce. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland3","Trump's climate change denial poses major threat to global warming fight; President-elect has promised to tear up the Paris accord ratified last year","November 11, 2016 Friday","The Irish Times","The greatest danger posed by US president-elect Donald Trump may be his threat to ""cancel"" the Paris accord on climate change, which was concluded last December after decades of negotiations. The Paris accord seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial revolution levels; 1.5 degrees if possible. ""Article 28 of the text I negotiated foresees that a state which has signed - and President Obama signed - may renounce the accord three years after it enters into force,"" Laurent Fabius, who presided over the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP, told France Inter Radio. The accord took effect on November 4th, after the required two-thirds threshold of ratification by 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse emissions, was met. Trump could renounce the agreement in 2019, Fabius said. A US withdrawal would take effect in 2020. The US is the world's second-largest producer of carbon emissions, after China. Fabius recalled going through the agreement, line by line, with US and Chinese envoys. China linked its ratification to that of the Americans, and a US pullout could create a domino effect. ""It would have huge repercussions,"" Fabius said. ""Once you put greenhouse gases in the air, they stay there for up to 10,000 years. There's a risk that other countries will say, 'If the US is doing nothing, we won't either.' It would be extremely grave for the world; the future of the world is at stake."" News of Trump's election cast a pall over COP22 in Marrakech, the first international climate summit since the Paris accord. The meeting had started with great optimism on November 7th, because the ratification procedure had been completed much more quickly than expected. In other positive news for the fight against climate change, the first global climate deal for aviation was reached on October 6th, and an agreement to phase out planet-warming hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, used in air conditioners and refrigerators, was concluded in Kigali on October 15th. Great uncertainty This hard-won progress is threatened by Trump's climate negationism. ""With Donald Trump's election, a period of great uncertainty regarding US climate policy has opened,"" Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists told from Marrakech. ""It will have an undeniable psychological effect, even if it doesn't block the working session in Marrakech."" On Tuesday, US election day, the World Meteorological Organisation presented its analysis of the global climate from 2011 to 2015 at COP22 . The five-year period was the hottest on record. The organisation reported ""the increasingly visible human footprint on extreme weather and climate events with dangerous and costly impacts"". The same day, the Germanwatch group reported that more than 528,000 people have died in the past decade due to some 11,000 extreme weather events. Trump has often ridiculed one of the most powerful scientific consensuses of our time. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive,"" he tweeted in November 2012. Global warming In a campaign speech last May, In other tweets, Trump has cited freak cold weather events as proof that global warming is a hoax, claimed that wind turbines are ""bad for people's health"" and that low-energy light bulbs cause cancer. Trump does not even need to renounce the Paris accord to sabotage it. At the insistence of the US and other parties, the accord is non-binding, and there are no sanctions against countries who do not fulfil their pledges to cut carbon emissions. Trump has vowed to dismantle the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has an $8 billion budget, and whose work he termed ""shameful"". He also said he would cut US funding for UN projects that fight climate change. President Barack Obama's ""Clean Power Plan"", designed to reduce emissions from power plants, has been suspended since February, following a lawsuit by 27 mostly Republican states. The president-elect wants to develop fossil fuels and increase reliance on coal mining and coal-fired power plants, which are responsible for 40 per cent of US carbon dioxide emissions. And he may resurrect plans for the Keystone XL pipeline between Alberta, Canada, and refineries in Illinois and Texas. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland4","Healy-Rae's bluster on climate change a new low","May 9, 2016 Monday","The Irish Times","At the RDS in Dublin last Thursday night, Naomi Klein asked the sold-out audience, ""I was wondering if Danny Healy-Rae made it? I saw all kinds of people offering him tickets on Twitter."" It is a privilege for Healy-Rae to be mentioned by Klein - one of the great minds of her generation - even if it is as a punchline. Klein was in town for the International Literature Festival Dublin, and spoke mostly about her recent book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs . Klein repeatedly criticised Irish governments for neglecting and ""forgetting"" climate change, but also cited several Irish examples that feed into the climate justice movement; the anti-fracking movement in Leitrim, water charges protests, the Shell To Sea protests. She said: ""We need to divest from the infrastructure of the past, and invest in the infrastructure of the future."" Klein spoke eloquently about the fact that up until now, the climate justice movement has suffered by being very much against things that were happening, and not necessarily being able to offer up the practicalities of what they are for. That is changing too. She is right in saying that what is happening to our planet is too important to leave to the environmental movement, and that alliances need to be forged everywhere to find solutions to save us from ourselves. Nonsense Nobody could be proud of Healy-Rae's performance in the chamber last week, shouting away to himself while talking absolute nonsense. He might feel like the big man with a platform, sticking the boot into Eamon Ryan - who actually knows what he's talking about on this issue - but perhaps, in time, Healy-Rae will come to realise that the cartoon version of a rural TD he is selling isn't in step or tune with those looking on. There was nothing to admire in Healy-Rae's bluster on climate change, even if you had voted for him and think the Healy-Raes are great value altogether. This was a new low, embarrassing posturing that served no one but wags on Twitter. ""If we go back to the 11th and 12th centuries, this country was roasted out of it,"" Healy-Rae said, ""and in the 13th, the 15th and the 16th centuries we were drowned out of it."" He continued, ""I believe that God above is in charge of the weather and that we here can't do anything about it. Indeed I will say to ye, this last government didn't do the things they were supposed to do, not to mind, not to mind to regulate or rectify the weather."" By denying climate change, Healy-Rae is abandoning the interests of the very people he claims (repeatedly) to be representing. Denying climate change is anti-farming, anti-agriculture, anti-rural life, anti-reality. By denying climate change, Healy-Rae is saying that Kerry can go to hell in a hand basket, not to mention the rest of the country, and the world. You have to feel for the constituents of Kerry, especially farmers, who have someone who denies basic science representing them. Above anyone else, it is those who are in touch with the land who understand what is happening. Farmers aren't part of the problem, they are part of the solution. Irish cute hoorism is often applauded in politics. But in Healy-Rae's case his is devoid of tactical skill, and his particular brand of it - not as polished as Michael's - is stupidity dressed up as self-interest. Danny Healy-Rae is playing to his own stereotype, banking on the idea that nobody wants a change of tune and that if a Healy-Rae started banging a different kind of drum, the rhythm would throw the whole of Kerry off. Doing jigs outside Leinster House is one thing, and painting everyone outside The Kingdom as Gordon Gekkos ready to suck the life out of rural Ireland is another. But speaking as ignorantly as he did is something else altogether. It's easy to write off such Healy-Raeisms as colourful eejitry that make for good headlines on Waterford Whispers (although they outdid themselves with their story ""Danny Healy-Rae suggests leaving Child of Prague under bush to combat climate change""). We can laugh, but perhaps Healy-Rae isn't putting this on. Maybe he does indeed not understand the difference between addressing climate change through policy that must be implemented in the aftermath of 2015 United Nations climate change conference , and in his own words a government tasked with ""regulating"" the weather. Difference Perhaps he doesn't understand the difference between ""weather"" - which is right now, and ""climate"" - how atmospheric conditions act longterm. Irish governments aren't in the business of cloud-bursting, but they are required to use policy to address the greatest threat to our planet. So does Healy-Rae care about the land of the farmers who vote for him? Will he choose prayer over policy when their fields are flooded? Or will he just posture in parliament and shake his fist at the sky? For a man who talks so much about the place he's from and the people who voted for him, denying the basic science of climate change has catastrophic consequences for his constituents. The people of Kerry deserve someone who understands environmental issues, because they will continue to be hugely impacted by those issues. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland5","Savage winter storms blamed on man-made climate change","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","Irish Independent","Paul Melia Environment Editor THE extreme rainfall of last December and January which wreaked havoc across large parts of the country is directly attributable to man-made climate change. A new report says that Storm Desmond, which struck Ireland on December 4 last year and which resulted in widespread flooding across Mayo, Donegal and Cork, was made 40pc more likely because of global warming. The probability of extreme heatwaves has increased by 10 times or more due to man-made global warming it warns. ""One example of a precipitation (rainfall) extreme for which a discernibly anthropogenic influence could be identified was the extreme rainfall in the UK in December 2015, where it was found that climate change had made an event on the scale measured approximately 40pc more likely,"" the 'Global Climate in 2011-2015' report says. Storm Desmond was quickly followed by Storm Eva and Storm Frank the same month, and resulted in hundreds of properties and transport links across the country being hit with flood waters, with insurers paying out (EURO)70m to cover the damage. The WMO also says that the extreme cold of 2010 and 2011 was made ""less probable"" due to climate change. In other words, a warming planet reduces the likelihood of extremely low temperatures. The WMO report confirms that the last five years were the hottest on record. It adds that of 79 studies published between 2011 and 2014, more than half found that human-induced climate change contributed to the extreme event in question. High impact events for which these conclusions are drawn include Storm Desmond in Ireland and the UK last winter and the heatwave which struck western and central Europe last July. Others include the record temperatures in the United States in 2012 and Australia in 2013. The report was submitted to the UN Climate Change Conference, COP22 , which takes place at Marrakech in Morocco until November 18, where implementation of the historic Paris climate deal, which came into force last Friday, will be discussed. It aims to limit global temperature increases to well below 2C by making profound cuts in emissions, but Ireland is lagging behind. The latest assessment of Ireland from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says that emissions from transport and agriculture will continue to rise through to 2020. The European Environment Agency yesterday named Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg as being the only EU member states which must introduce additional policies to achieve legally-binding cuts by 2020. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland6","THE ENVIRONMENT NEEDS A NEW STORYLINE; The threat to the natural world has risen sharply this year, making it more important than ever to shape new narratives a....","December 24, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","A late sunrise slides up from behind a cloudbank over Dublin's spires and office blocks and sets the few remaining golden leaves on the silver birches dancing; its beams pick up the antlers of a dozen stags along the woodland edge, resting amicably together after a long autumn's fighting and rutting. A skein of brent geese stretches out in a ragged vee, low over the trees. They are commuting between the scattered remnants of our great coastal salt marshes and our burgeoning city sportsfields, adapting rapidly to the world our species is remaking so fast, and so recklessly. The Phoenix Park on a December morning is a place of full of magic, right in the middle of the capital. Nature doesn't sleep in winter, if we keep our senses awake. Yet every venture into the natural world in our era may be fraught with anxieties. For example, I can't help wondering whether our culture is slowly turning the brent geese, whose migration links us directly to wild Arctic landscapes, into domesticated suburbanites. Then, as I cycle on across the Fifteen Acres, I find another source of stress: I am running out of puff on level ground. Advancing age? Okay, that's a factor, if you insist, but there's a more immediate problem. I am all wrapped up for winter, with fleeces, gloves, scarf and woolly hat. It slowly dawns on me that I have overheated drastically. In December? Yes, it's 14 degrees at 10am. I have to shed all upper layers but my shirt to regain my energy. So why the anxiety? There have always been freak warm spells in winter, haven't there? Yes, but the past year is already likely to be the hottest on record. So the unseasonal clamminess triggers a sharp, angry pang about our failure to tackle climate change, at home and abroad - about the Taoiseach's shameful doublespeak at COP21, the United Nations climate-change conference in Paris exactly a year ago, for instance. He told the delegates inside the hall that Ireland was ""serious"" and ""determined to play its part"" in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Moments later he told Irish journalists outside that Ireland would do no such thing but would demand exemptions for rising emissions created by his Government's agricultural policy. That memory triggers other thoughts: who could have imagined then that the US president-elect, Donald Trump, had, among many other terrifying decisions, just nominated a fossil-fuel advocate to head the US Environmental Protection Agency? Who could have guessed, indeed, that the song line ringing most tellingly in our heads, after Leonard Cohen gracefully checked out, would be not Hallelujah but his chilling prophecy that ""I have seen the future, baby, and it's murder""? Or who imagined, a year ago, that Britain, a country whose people have spearheaded so remarkably successful campaigns for nature, would opt for Brexit, thus threatening many cross-border environmental standards and programmes? It would be folly, for anyone who knows that the environment is our common home, not to pay attention to such anxieties; they are rooted in grim and dangerous realities. But it would be equally foolish to give them all our focus, because they are not the full story, or the only stories, on the environment. And they may not be the stories that will create most momentum for better environmental management. Looking back over the many projects and individuals we have featured over the past year, one common thread links them, again and again. It is summed up by the author and activist Tony Juniper, whom we interviewed in August: ""We desperately need a new storyline,"" he says. The dominant story about the environment in our societies at present, he believes, is that ""the protection of nature is harmful to people and the economy"". He argues that the opposite is true: that unless we attend to health of our environment our economies cannot survive. The dominant story in the environmental movement has also often been problematic, tending to focus on disabling narratives of impending catastrophe and on a polarising opposition between enlightened environmental activists, evil corporate forces and a supposedly ignorant populace. That narrative has fostered too much reliance on top-down regulation and much too little engagement with the communities directly affected by those regulations when they hit the ground. It has misinformed our futile and heart-breaking battles over turf-cutting and inadvertently given Brexit, Trumpism and other right-wing populist movements some of their energy. This is changing, though, and new narratives are being forged. We have reported on them on this page. Environmental campaigners are joining forces with trade unionists in Europe to protect fossil-fuel workers during the transition to a low-carbon economy. Ecologists are talking to economists, and vice versa, about how to make our nations, corporations and agribusinesses fully accountable for actions which damage the environmental fabric that sustains all our lives and to reward those who enhance that fabric. We have looked at initiatives by seedsavers, social scientists, farmers, community activists, educationalists, architects, bog restorationists, foresters and one young schoolboy to deepen our understanding of, and delight in, the natural world. Farther afield we reported on the implications of new international targets for forest restoration and on a very significant agreement in marine conservation. And, as he has done for many, many years before this page was established, Michael Viney has continued to offer his peerless insights into all aspects of the natural world, rooted in his home on Mayo's Atlantic edge but extending to the stars, in his Another Life column. Meanwhile his wife, Ethna, keeps us focused on readers' nature observations through her Eye on Nature, through which you can offer your images, your questions and your insights. At this solstice season we wish our readers the many pleasures of exploring nature over the holidays. And if there are times when some these winter pleasures are hard to savour, in the face of an icy gale or a blizzard of bad news from Trump Tower, always remember that, to adapt the catchphrase from a popular TV narrative of human folly in another era, spring is coming. Gift of giving What's on environment's wish list its wish list might read like this: 1 Donald Trump gets stuck in a lift with David Attenborough and is persuaded that the science on climate change is sound and compelling. When the Potus-elect gets out he deselects Scott Pruitt as director of the EPA and nominates Bill McKibben instead. 2 The human species realises that its recent addiction to buying more and more stuff is a form of dementia, does not bring happiness and is leading us towards extinction. We buy experiences and services instead, human wellbeing soars, and nature rebounds. 3 The Department of Agriculture and the Irish Farmers' Association agree to reduce our national herd, in order to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, and to diversify quality cereal, vegetable, fruit and native woodland production. They extend the principles of the Burren Farming for Conservation programme across the nation, rewarding farmers for enhancing our natural heritage. Agricultural incomes rise (well, the lower ones do), our landscapes blossom, quality tourism booms. 4 The National Parks and Wildlife Service is given the resources and authority to do its job properly. Politicians who still undermine conservation legislation lose their seats. 5 Local communities are genuinely with us at every stage of every conservation project. Conservation becomes part of what we are. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland7","Leading change and powering the future","September 10, 2016","Eolas Magazine","The energy system and the electricity system are changing and the scale and pace of that change is accelerating. Working with business and communities around the country, and with our stakeholders in the energy sector, EirGrid is stepping up to this challenge. For large businesses that are making investment decisions here in Ireland, a secure supply of electricity is at the top of their list of critical priorities. In fact, a recent survey highlighted that 90 per cent of major companies viewed quality of electricity as important or very important in their investment decisions in Ireland. Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon have all located data centres here in the in the past two years. Given that these centres all require a large amount of reliable quality electricity; this would not have been possible without confidence in our electricity system. Demonstrating leadership In order to maintain and build on this confidence, EirGrid is focused on planning for the future. To ensure a secure supply of electricity now and for years to come, EirGrid must maintain and develop the national grid. This may sometimes require new infrastructure, such as the proposed North-South Interconnector, but where possible, we make the most of existing assets. We're continuously pushing the envelope of knowledge around power system operation with our innovation programmes, including DS3 (Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System) and the Smart Grid Innovation Hub. These initiatives explore the use of new technologies and methodologies to allow for a more flexible and adaptive use of the grid. This is in response to the increasing role of renewable energy sources, which can't simply be ""turned on"" to meet demand for electricity. In the meantime, it is critical that we continue to look ahead. At EirGrid, we base our plans on the key forces that are central to shaping the energy industry in the future. These include climate change, new technology, regionalisation and user participation. Climate change EirGrid has no role in choosing one form of energy generation over another, and we have no interest or involvement in any form of energy generation. However, we are required to respond to Government policy, and to connect new energy generators to our grid when requested. Because of the threat of climate change, there is an increasing push for greater use of renewable energy sources. This requires significant changes to how we operate the grid, and how we plan for its future. On a positive note, what was agreed in Paris last year at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) was remarkable. As Al Gore commented: ""This universal and ambitious agreement sends a clear signal to governments, businesses, and investors everywhere; the transformation of our global economy from one fuelled by dirty energy to one fuelled by sustainable economic growth is now firmly and inevitably underway."" New technology In technological terms, the electricity industry is changing rapidly. What we're now seeing is new technologies, new telecommunication capabilities and the rise of big data. These all have the ability to disrupt the value chain and introduce new business models across many sectors. The electricity industry, and especially the transmission grid, will need to respond. There are new technology innovations in energy generation and transmission. The Irish grid now includes 10MW of battery storage, operated by AES in Belfast. EirGrid is also trialling new devices to control, in real time, the flow of power on our transmission system. These provide a glimpse of how we will manage and transition the power system over the coming 20 years. Regionalisation At EU level, approaching energy from a regional perspective will continue to be important for a number of reasons. It assists us as we seek to establish the foundations to address climate change. It also empowers us to drive competition as it decreases barriers to trade and drives out lower prices for consumers. Finally, it addresses energy security in what is an increasingly noisy and fractious geo-political environment. Regionalisation has a number of implications for Ireland. First of these is the new wholesale energy market arrangements being put in place to meet the EU target model. There is also a focus on increased interconnection. EirGrid commissioned the East West Interconnector to the UK in 2012 and EirGrid is now looking at a new interconnector to France, called the Celtic Interconnector. This will all lead to increased coupling between markets, which will drive consolidation, increased competition, and ultimately lower energy prices. User participation In contrast to regionalisation at a European level, user participation is about individuals at household and domestic level becoming active in the energy market. This will be enabled by technology advances and will lead to the transformation of today's energy models. In turn, this will raise some interesting dilemmas in terms of how assets are paid for. For example, if you have invested in solar panels and a battery and largely use the grid as a back-up, how should you pay for the grid that's there providing that back-up? Also, not everyone will have the opportunity or the resources to invest in a solar panel or a battery. There is a danger that these people could end up paying disproportionately more for the grid when it is providing a service to all. This is an issue of social equity and needs to be addressed as we see new business models emerge. Social acceptance As we think about these changes in the energy system over the next 20 years, we need to ensure that we bring people and communities with us. Without that, we won't have the ability to change the energy system to address these challenges. At EirGrid we are acutely aware of the need to engage with communities at the earliest possible opportunity. We need to build trust and respect to get input into deliberations and decision making right from the start. EirGrid must achieve the trust and permission of the public to carry out our work. This is so Ireland can respond to the coming changes in our energy system. To achieve this, EirGrid will continue to bring people and communities into our decision making process at the earliest possible opportunity. Driving innovations - residential demand side management In June, EirGrid launched a new residential demand-side management initiative. Power Off & Save is an innovative pilot that will reward customers who agree to reduce their energy use in response to a signal from the national control centre. Over the next 18 months, we're trialling this programme, in conjunction with Electric Ireland to 1,500 homes across the country. The key, innovative part of all of this is that we are enabling these domestic households to participate in meeting the needs of the power system without the need for a smart meter. As we take this pilot forward, we will see very significant benefits in terms of more efficient operation of the power system and lower costs for consumers as a whole. Powering the future Continued collaboration across society, from leaders in the public sector, the business community and communities right across the country, will be central to shape the future of our energy industry. These partnerships will also ensure EirGrid can respond to the challenges and opportunities of change in the energy market. Working together, we can be ready for the future.

"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland8","Donald Trump and the fox with the keys to the eco-henhouse","November 19, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","People laughed in 2005 when a little-known energy-industry advocate with a BA in philosophy and an MSc in political science rounded on the UK's chief scientist, David King, calling him ""an alarmist with ridiculous views who knows nothing about climate change"". They're not laughing now. The man in question, Myron Ebell, has been named by President-Elect Donald Trump to head his transition team at the US Environmental Protection Agency. The fox has been handed the keys of the ecological henhouse. Where some people see an overwhelming expert consensus, Ebell scents a conspiracy. He clumped climate scientists and environmentalists together as what he called the forces of darkness. Trump's ever-pivoting positions on a range of issues could be likened to a Rorschach test, where what you see depends largely on what you choose to see. One big exception is his consistent hostility to environmental regulation. He has peddled the theory that global warming is a hoax ""invented by the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive"". This week, at the United Nations' COP22 climate-change conference in Marrakesh, the outgoing US secretary of state, John Kerry, just back from a fact-finding mission to Antarctica, stressed the deadly consequences of inaction. He said that ""2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. Every month so far has broken a record. At some point even the strongest sceptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening."" The world, he added, stands at a critical juncture. ""If we lose this moment for action there's no speech decades from now that will put these ice sheets back together."" While routinely dismissing the ""bullshit"" science of global warming, Trump quietly bowed to reality when his own Doonbeg golf links, in Co Clare, applied for planning permission to build an enormous sea wall after 8m of frontage fell into the Atlantic during a recent storm. The application to Clare County Council cited the threat of global warming and rising sea levels. It seems that only self-interest can motivate the president-elect to articulate a different point of view. The same cannot be said of his team. Vice-President-Elect Mike Pence is a creationist, believing that Earth is just a few thousand years old and that a billion years of geological evidence is, presumably, another branch of the vast scientific conspiracy against his belief in the literal truth of the Bible. In 2002 Karl Rove, President George W Bush's senior adviser, berated a New York Times reporter for being part of the ""reality-based community . . . We're an empire now, and when we act we create our own reality."" Bending reality to your ideology may work in politics. Physics is less pliable. What if Trump turns for counsel to his new chief strategist, Steve Bannon? Bannon's reality-warping Breitbart News Network website has personally targeted climate scientists for years, smearing them as ""scum-sucking slime balls"" and ""eco Nazis"" who are ""corrupt, mendacious, bullying, fascistic, misanthropic, greedy, totalitarian and rotten to the very core"". While Trump has often been at odds with the Republican Party, they stand shoulder to shoulder in their ambition to wipe out half a century of environmental regulations by gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and doing their best to sabotage the fragile international consensus of the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change. This ensures four years of backsliding just as the global climate system may be tipping ever-closer to irreversible catastrophe. Even before November 8th scientists and activists were shocked by the dire news emanating almost daily from climate science. For many this is now full-blown panic. ""We're talking about anxiety disorder, but this is not a disorder,"" Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist based in Washington, DC, says. ""Civilisation is on the tracks, and you can see the train coming. That's not a disorder: that's responding to reality."" John Gibbons is an environmental writer and commentator; @think_or_swim \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland9","Spiral of silence on climate change needs to be broken","November 19, 2016 Saturday","The Irish Times","Most people who like to read probably have a couple of books that sit in a privileged spot on a bookshelf because they wielded so much influence on their thinking that it is comforting to have them close to hand. For me one of those books is The Spiral of Silence by Elisabeth Noelle Neumann. When I read her work, ideas that had been floating around in my head in an inchoate form took proper shape for the first time. It's an old book, first published in 1974, and revised in 1994.\~ Noelle-Neumann was a political scientist who was puzzled by the inability of opinion polls to accurately predict election results. Then a chance encounter in the early 1970s with a student who was wearing a Christian Democrat badge changed everything. When Noelle-Neumann commented mildly that she had not been aware that the student was a Christian Democrat supporter, the student explained that she was not: she just wanted to experience what it was like. When Noelle-Neumann met her later, the badge was gone. The student told her that she took it off because the reaction was so awful. Noelle-Neumann suddenly had a major insight. She began to research a hypothesis that people stay silent when they feel their views are not those of the majority because they fear isolation. The spiral begins because when people self-silence, others also become more reticent, and so it appears that there is no opposition to the prevailing consensus. However, in the privacy of the ballot box people could do what they wish. By adding one simple question to polls, accuracy increased exponentially. The question was: aside from your own opinion, who do you think will win the election? By being allowed to dissociate themselves from unpopular opinion, they told the truth of their own voting intentions. Holds true Of course, the book was written before the internet, but I think it still holds true. It just means that due to Facebook's algorithms you are less and less likely to realise that there are other enclaves where people hold entirely different views. The spiral of silence explains why commentators, aside from a few, did not see Brexit or Trump's victory coming.\~ I was interested to see the spiral of silence referenced in a recent post by the Yale Program on Climate Communication. It was pondering whether there is a spiral of silence around climate change because it had conducted polls that showed two out of three Americans are moderately or very interested in climate change, yet seven out of 10 rarely spoke about it to friends or neighbours. At first glance I was not sure that the spiral of silence theory fits. There would have to be an overwhelming media and public consensus that climate change is not real, or not due to human factors, for people to keep so quiet about their contrarian view that it exists. In fact, what the same survey showed is that less than half of those surveyed heard about climate change in the media once a month or more. Far from an overwhelming push in one direction, there was very little about it at all. It is the same in this country. There will be dutiful coverage of Marrakesh and COP22 , the current negotiations on implementing the agreement reached in Paris last year. Likewise, few are aware of our record on renewable energy. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy only accounts for 23 per cent of our electricity generation compared to 38 per cent in Scotland. EU fines Similarly, even though it will probably cost us up to EUR 6 billion in EU fines, the fact that we will not meet our emission-reduction targets by 2020 will scarcely register in the average person's mind. This is not because there is a huge climate change denial movement in Ireland. Nor are there vast numbers on the other side. There are a few passionate voices trying to raise awareness of climate change, but they can be dismissed by one phrase - tree hugger. Maybe that is where the spiral of silence theory fits - being passionate about ameliorating the effects of climate change is only for those who are slightly eccentric or whacky. Then there is the indisputable fact that if you take climate change, environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity seriously, it scares the hell out of you. In Ireland, the general response to having the hell scared out of you is to have another pint. One response to this crisis is to highlight the job opportunities and the better, cleaner world that will result. This is important, but people need motivation to change entrenched habits. Finding a judicious balance between being paralysed by terror and yet motivated to change is not easy. Aside from any spiral of silence, there are real feelings of overwhelm induced by fear. In any area of life the most effective counter to feeling overwhelmed is to begin to take action, no matter how small. And if the Yale study is accurate, breaking the silence by having conversations about climate change with friends and family is a good place to start. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland10","Let's be thought-leaders on climate smart agriculture; Ireland has an opportunity to become a global pioneer in the areas of food security and climate change","July 14, 2016 Thursday","The Irish Times","Ensuring food and nutrition security for all while avoiding climate change is one of the key challenges of the 21st century. The world population is projected to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050 from 7.3 billion now, requiring an increase of 70 per cent in food production. Food security and climate change are interconnected. Agriculture is a contributor to and is affected by climate change. In recent years, climate smart agriculture (CSA), an approach linking agriculture and climate policies, has received attention. CSA seeks to increase agricultural productivity and incomes, build resilience to climate change and reduce emissions. In the past 18 months the Institute of International and European Affairs/Royal Dublin Society Leadership Forum has worked to identify how CSA could apply to agriculture here and how Ireland could contribute to policy on global food security and climate change. The forum brought together key stakeholders from Government departments, State agencies, the private sector, farm organisations, and development and environmental non-governmental organisations. The outcome of this process is an independent IIEA/RDS report which will be launched today by Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed. The report concludes that Ireland should become a global pioneer in climate smart agriculture, and seek to provide policy and thought leadership at European and international level to the food security/climate change debate. In seeking to attain such a leadership position, Ireland faces unique circumstances. Due to the structure of the Irish economy and the livestock-based agricultural sector, agriculture accounts for a higher proportion of greenhouse gas emissions here than in other EU countries. Following the abolition of the EU milk quota last year the Government is committed to expanding food production, which will increase emissions. At the same time, the State faces formidable European and international targets to reduce emissions. Climate change These circumstances also bring opportunities. Due to demanding EU climate targets in place since 2008, considerable innovation in policy, technology and on-farm practices has been delivered. Irish officials have been at the forefront of policy thinking on agriculture and climate change at EU and UN negotiations. Bord Bia's Origin Green scheme brings together the Government, the agrifood sector and farmers to set and achieve measurable sustainability targets and reduce the environmental impact of food production. The Farm Carbon Navigator, developed by Bord Bia and Teagasc, promotes technologies to reduce input use, increase farm income and reduce emissions. The IIEA/RDS report seeks to build on progress made. If Ireland is to aspire to credible international leadership in this area, however, progress must be brought to a different level. The report sets out an ambitious agenda that could deliver such leadership and the benefits that would flow from it. The agenda needs to be delivered through Government policy and political commitment; implementation by the farming and agri-food sector of an ambitious CSA programme; and policy advocacy at international level. An ambitious programme, anchored in a credible domestic policy on climate change and supported by high level political commitment, is required. We recommend the strategic reorientation of agricultural and food policy around agricultural productivity and incomes, resilience, and emissions reduction at Irish and European level. The Government should detail how the progressive vision of a ""carbon neutral"" agriculture and land use sector by 2050, to which it is committed, can be attained, with progress measured annually and reported upon. The end of milk quotas presents an opportunity for the expansion of dairy and beef enterprises which are climate smart and economically beneficial for farmers. There are opportunities for farmers and rural communities investing in renewable energy: financial incentives targeting citizens should be part of an innovative sustainable development policy for rural Ireland. Irish Aid The report recommends that the domestic focus on CSA leadership be complemented by mainstreaming it into our diplomacy at EU and UN level. Irish Aid should integrate climate smart agriculture into its current prioritisation of nutrition and food security, linking up with the main Irish NGOs with such programmes in developing countries. During the next round of UN climate negotiations at COP22 in Marrakesh in November, Ireland should advocate for a specific work programme on the agriculture-climate-food nexus. The IIEA/RDS report focuses on the potential we believe exists for Ireland to play an international leadership role on CSA. If such a role can be attained Ireland could position itself as a leader in the production of sustainable and carbon-efficient food, with obvious commercial gain. But there is another dimension: if the State can influence policy on agriculture and climate change in developing countries, backed up by proven technologies and domestic experience of mainstreaming climate change into agricultural and nutritional strategies, we will contribute to improving the life chances of tens of millions of people.

"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland11","Climate pledges 'will not prevent dangerous warming'","November 17, 2016 Thursday","Irish Independent","CURRENT pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous climate change will not be enough to keep warming below safe thresholds, the International Energy Agency has warned. Although the World Energy Outlook 2016 report predicted ""broad transformations"" in the global energy landscape out to 2040, the era of fossil fuels appears to be ""far from over"". The outlook says that re-newables and natural gas are the ""big winners"" in the race to meet rising energy demands out to 2040, but coal and oil will continue to play a part. Oil demand for passenger cars will reduce due to increased electrification of the fleet and use of biogas, but there will be greater oil price volatility over the coming years. ""We see clear winners for the next 25 years - natural gas but especially wind and solar - replacing the champion of the previous 25 years, coal,"" said Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. ""But there is no single story about the future of global energy. In practice, government policies will determine where we go from here."" The report includes a detailed analysis of the pledges to reduce emissions, but warns if current proposals from parties to the Paris Climate Agreement, who are currently meeting at COP 22 in Marrakech, are upheld, warming will increase by 2.7C by 2100. Scientists have warned that 2C of warming is a tipping point. If warming goes beyond this, changes to the climate system could be irreversible. The current pledges will only ""slow down"" projected increases in emissions from an average of 650 million tonnes a year to 150 million tonnes. ""While this is a significant achievement, it is far from enough to avoid the worst impact of climate change as it would only limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2.7C by 2100,"" the IEA said. Emissions must peak in the next few years, and there needs to be 700 million electric cars by 2040 and increased use of renewables to the industrial, building and transport sectors. Use of natural gas, which is less-polluting, will expand while oil and coal will play a reduced role. The IEA warned that record falls in investment levels in oil and gas could lead to a ""significant risk"" of a shortfall, and that we were entering a period of ""greater oil price volatility"". Increased gas supply from the US, Australia and elsewhere will ""trigger"" a shift to a more competitive market. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland12","Extreme weather disrupts more than conflict, says UN","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","The Irish Times","Weather-related hazards are displacing twice as many people as conflicts and violence, according to latest figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Extreme weather and climate-related events have had a negative impact on agriculture and food security, affecting more than 60 million people around the world. The figures demonstrated the humanitarian issues that can arise from long-term changes in the environment, the World Meteorological Organisation said in its provisional ""status of the global climate"" statement for 2016. The new figures also ""underline the need for action in these areas, particularly in Ireland where emissions are growing"", said Dr Paul Deane, a research fellow at University College Cork's Environmental Research Institute. Weather-related disasters The WMO in its statement quoted the International Organisation for Migration, saying population migration would increase because of more intense weather-related disasters. These displaced 14.7 million people in 2015. Things are unlikely to improve soon on the basis of the WMO's climate report, which it presented yesterday to an international climate change meeting under way in Marrakesh, Morocco. The WMO predicts that 2016 will go down as the hottest year on record. This means 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have all occurred in this century, with the exception being 1998. The year has seen temperature records broken, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere topping 400 parts per million, large swathes of coral in Australia's Great Barrier Reef killed and increased melting of Greenland's ice sheets. Temperatures have been well above normal in parts of the Arctic region, with long-term averages broken by 6-7 degrees in parts of Russia, and by 3 degrees in Russia, Alaska and northwest Canada, the WMO said. The deadliest event so far is Hurricane Matthew, which devastated Haiti as it passed over the island nation, killing at least 546 people. Deaths also occurred from typhoons along the Pacific Rim and due to major flooding in countries including China, Sri Lanka and Mali. Records were broken in countries around the world during the year. South Africa set all-time records including 42.7 degrees at Pretoria and 38.9 degrees at Johannesburg. Thailand set a record of 44.6 degrees and India at 51 degrees. Mitribah in Kuwait recorded 54 degrees on July 21st, the highest temperature yet reached across all of Asia. The Irish are doing a poor job of reducing our personal carbon footprints compared to our EU colleagues, Dr Deane said. The Irish have one of the largest carbon footprints, at 12.6 tonnes of carbon per capita, the fourth-highest in the EU. Germany is at 11.1 and the EU average is 9.2. The report was delivered to the COP 22 meeting, the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakesh. \"
"COP22","Ireland","COP22_Ireland13","Government must stop paying lip service and tackle climate change","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Irish Independent","THERE is no doubt that US President-elect Donald Trump's views on climate change are worrying. Mr Trump has described the science of global warming as a 'hoax', and has suggested he will pull the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement without delay. His comments are a huge source of worry for delegates attending the COP 22 climate talks in Marrakesh, especially in light of the World Meteorological Organisation this week warning 2016 will be the hottest year on record. There is a justifiable concern that if the world's secondbiggest polluter after China does nothing to tackle climate change, what hope of other nations playing their part? Almost 200 countries are represented in Morocco, with world leaders due to arrive today. They are working to advance policies to limit warming to no more than 2C and help the most vulnerable countries adapt. Regardless of Mr Trump and other contrarians, the world is changing, albeit slowly. As UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, action on climate change has become ""unstoppable"". But Ireland lags far behind. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Concerns about agriculture are paid lip service for fear of offending the powerful farmers' lobby. Plans to roll out renewable energy are stymied by mistrust, and there isn't enough funding to retrofit houses, despite being a proven way to reduce emissions, save households money and create employment. More worrying still is the increase in transport emissions, which have risen every year for the last three. Some 1,200 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, which is largely driven by engine fumes. In this context, the National Transport Authority's Rail Review comes at an opportune time. Although stark in its message - fund the railways or cut services - this has been said before, and ignored. The harsh reality is that unless services are used, the taxpayer cannot keep subsidies flowing. During the big freezes of recent years, trains were packed. But when the snow melted, commuters went back to their cars. Why? Those who remained on board were not rewarded for doing the right thing either. As funding plummeted, they were hit with fare increases and higher parking charges at stations. What are the Department of Transport and NTA doing? Are they consulting with communities on what services they need to allow them to leave the car at home? Are they talking to business, and looking at staggered working times to make best use of the public transport system we have? The lack of leadership is telling. The Government has a choice. Allow congestion to grow and emissions to rise, or tackle transport. Congestion charging, bans on city centre traffic, provision of parkand-ride sites and additional funding must be discussed. Schoolchildren should be on buses, not driven to school. Local authorities like Dublin City Council making bold moves to reduce car use in our cities should be supported, not pilloried. Billions of euro has been invested in our public transport network over the years, but yet we seem happy to ignore this public resource and use the car instead. Tackling transport not only helps address our climate problem, but could also make our cities and urban areas far more pleasant places in which to live and work. \"

After losing Bowie and Prince and gaining the most controversial US president of recent memory, I think people are ready to move on to next year. That said, I saw so many good creative things come out of Dublin in the last 12 months that I can't wait to see what 2017 holds. The creative community is slowly building here, one that takes its own initiative. I'm a photographer and publisher of a small photo journal called Junior, and the number of other printed magazines and journals that have come out this year is impressive to say the least. District funded and released their first printed issue, and Guts released their sixth edition this month. Aisling Farinella's beautiful, free fashion loose-leaf Thread returned in September and can now be found around Ireland and abroad, featuring both Irish and international talents in writing, photography and fashion design. I have been so lucky to have had a hand in some of these publications and to have been present in the community of doers and makers that bring these beautiful objects to life. In a time where nothing is concrete, I'm so happy to see people going out and making things happen for themselves, creating their own path. I'm moving to London in the New Year and am planning on working between there and Dublin. Having spent the last year out of college working in the creative community, Dublin has shown me that the grass isn't necessarily greener elsewhere. It has so much more to offer and 2016 was just a taste of what we're capable of. Bring on 2017, and all the great and awful things it might contain. The default is to hope for change in the New Year. I hope for less of it - in regard to the climate, that is. This month marked a year since the UN conference on climate change in Paris. At the convention, it was agreed that countries must work towards keeping the average temperature rise to well below 2\'b0C, mainly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the time since, Ireland has not only signed, but also ratified, this agreement. The Government has now firmly committed Ireland to being part of a global movement to actively fight climate change. This month has also signalled the commitment of various cities and institutions internationally to divest a collective sum of $5trillion from fossil fuels, demonstrating that many people are no longer willing to invest money in companies that are driving us toward climate disaster. Here in Ireland, Trinity has taken part in this global movement by divesting shares worth (EURO)6.1million. What I hope, and maybe expect, from 2017 is that our Government will try to take further steps to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, by incentivising the public to live more sustainably. Combating climate change now is not just important for safeguarding the future, it's also critical for protecting communities around the world who are experiencing the effects of global warming right now. It's crucial that in 2017 we take solid steps toward a greener future. Our government can no longer simply discuss climate change; we simply do not have the time. We must act now. 2 CHRISTIAN TIERNEY 20, photographer, filmmaker and writer Until 2016, making music videos was all I did, but this year I branched out further and pursued new things like music photography. I ended up shooting all of the major festivals in Ireland, photographing people like Kendrick Lamar, Tame Impala, Major Lazer, The 1975 and others. I stepped away from music for the first time this year and made videos for Conor McGregor, and I did my first public speaking jobs, which I absolutely loved. I did a lot of work with (singer-songwriter) Gavin James, and I'm really excited to continue working with him in 2017 as his success continues to grow. I feel like 2016 was the year where I laid the foundations which will allow me to properly explore all of these new avenues in 2017, and that makes me extremely excited for the year ahead! 7 JAKE HURLEY 21, musician I think 2017 is going to have to top 2016. 2016 was pretty wacky... In terms of creativity, there's a lot going on in Dublin at the moment. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. There are so many amazing people around making music, especially. Right now I'm working on my mixtape - it's going to be called Cartooniverse, coming out early 2017. It's fun for all the HYPERLINK http://www.family.No www.family.No cursing. Very clean, very Will Smith. I don't know if Ireland is changing much politically. Hopefully it will. Hopefully the Eighth will be repealed soon and other issues will follow suit. People love to complain about millennials and that 'Generation Snowflake stuff ', and it's so completely pointless. They're from a different generation half the time. When they were young, they were able to take out a loan of a million euro to buy a house. Growing up, I always bought into the narrative that the world was gradually becoming more progressive and that people were gradually becoming more open-minded, but 2016 disproved that. It showed you can take a step back, and that there are a lot of terrible people out there. Terrible young people, too. That really disillusioned me. I had assumed all the crazy Alt-Right people were only in America, but I see them here. They show up in the comment sections of Irish newspapers. 8 SEAN GALLAGHER 25, content creator at Clear Haze I'm quite concerned about Trump and the backlash that'll likely come with his presidency. He's going to directly affect the rest of the world, and that's worrying. There could be a resistance, but there's so much apathy, maybe because of social media bombarding us with so much news. If you're being hit with bad news story after bad news story, it's hard to feel like you have any power. It's tempting to just sit back and watch cat videos. I make mini-documentaries on different things - most recently, we made one about food called 'Burger Bonanza'. It had seven episodes where we went around trying to find the best burger in Ireland... I'm also about to start a course in computer science, which I'm looking forward to. Looking at the current job climate, it feels like tech skills are necessary. Dublin can feel like a bit of a departure lounge; if you want to make it in certain industries you have to be prepared to leave, in order to make any impact. But I think it depends on the sector you're in - tech is certainly continuing to flourish. When I was applying for my course, they told me I'd have to do an interview, and it turned out to be with an app rather than with a person. It makes sense that they're using an automated system to power through applicants, but it still was pretty strange. I just thought, ""Wow, this is what it's like living in the future "" 9 DAMOLA FAMUYIBO 24, musician As a hip-hop artist from Dublin, I expect 2017 to be a very busy year for me with the release of a lot of new music. I have a bunch of records I put together during 2016 and I just want to feed the people with a lot of music next year. The records will also be released with music videos. I did a lot of shows in 2017, but I've decided to lay low for the first two months of 2017 and work on new material with my live band. The plan is to switch up the sound of the music and add theatrics to the performance, gearing us up for festivals in the summer. As well as working with some really good producers, my live band will be instrumental in the production of most of my new records for next year. I'm a member of Dublin based Irish hip-hop group BackShed inc, and I'll also be releasing collaborative material with members of the group, including Ange MC, Sam Ojo and Ama. We plan on officially launching the brand with a live show and some releases which we can't give away much about now... 10 INA ALBRECHT 22, QA Tester at Keywords Studios and artist I arrived in Dublin near the end of 2015, so I got a glimpse of a much calmer year before we crashed into 2016. What I like about this country is the people, they fight for what they care about. Maybe I'm just lucky to have ended up around people who have strong opinions and things they care deeply about. That said, sometimes I struggle with how small Ireland is; it makes things like dating intimidating. One of the things which defined 2016 was a sense of rage. Rage can be a good thing sometimes, but I strongly believe that empathy should come first. Anger can help you work through things, but often we end up living in little bubbles by ourselves. Every year we think we're the most advanced we've ever been in history, and yes, we have made huge progress and leaps in technology, but sometimes I suspect that emotionally we're still taking baby steps. We look at Aleppo and wonder how it could happen, but that could happen here just as easily. In 2017 I'd love to see people open up a bit. We spend so much time focusing on the things which divide us that we forget to communicate and understand each other. Often, our biases project more about our own flaws than about other people. Deep down, I think we're all the same, and want to do good. 5 ERIC DAVIDSON 25, editor of District Magazine I run an alternative music, art and culture website and publication called District Magazine. We cover homegrown hip-hop and R&B, which I think are going to be some of the most exciting things about 2017. The reason music is blossoming now, and will undoubtedly continue to blossom, is the multicultural nature of our island. So many young people whose parents emigrated to Ireland have now grown up. Their creativity has been shaped by the cultures of their parents and family, bringing a new stream of influence into Irish music. It's pushing everyone to make better, more diverse music. Young artists are adopting different ideas and sounds. They've realised the old constraints and stereotypes don't apply any more. Artists like Jafaris (Percy Chamburuka, who played Ngig in the film Sing Street), Kojaque, Soul\'e9, Huva, Farah Elle and Bobby Basil are part of the wave of artists taking the underground Irish hip-hop and R&B to a new level. Add to that the experimental electronic artists and leftfield bands in other genres, and you've got the makings of an exciting year for music. 6 LAUREN TIEDT 21, medicine student I'm hoping 2017 will bring some positive developments to overshadow the disappointments and horrors of worldwide events from this year. I'm especially excited to see the benefits of all the hard work that's being carried out to repeal the Eighth Amendment, in the hopes of granting women in this country their reproductive rights. I'm also hoping the popularity of veganism continues to grow in Ireland in 2017, despite all the backlash it seems to attract. Since gradually adapting to a vegan lifestyle, I've noticed a mini-revolution of sorts, where people, especially teenagers and young adults, are becoming much more conscious about what exactly they're consuming and where it's coming from. I hope that this movement will also shed light on the damage unknowingly being done to the environment, before it's too late. Overall, I'm optimistic about what 2017 can offer, especially considering the amazing line-up of gigs already announced for this summer. I expect that 2017 will give us all some new hope and aspirations by wiping the slate clean, because if there's one thing that we're good at, it's picking ourselves up and carrying on! 4 MAIJA SOFIA 21, musician I am not optimistic about how the aftermath of the political disasters of 2016 will play out, but I am hoping that, in reaction to them, there will be a strengthened and unified left. In an ideal world, I'd like to see a political movement towards empathy, but I'm not sure if this is going to happen. I would like to see more equality on the music scene - right now it feels like it's basically a boys club. It's not as bad as it used to be, but it's pretty disheartening to be a woman trying to make music on her own, being the only woman on gig line-ups and being patronised by sound engineers and male colleagues on a regular basis. Something needs to change. I want 2017 to be the year I finish an album. Whatever happens, it can only be better than the year we've just had! \"

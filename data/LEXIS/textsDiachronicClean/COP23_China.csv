The Trump administration intends to formally leave the Paris Climate Accord by the year 2020.The Paris treaty obliges its signatories to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in an attempt to stave off the worst effects of climate change.In order to draw attention to the acute threat of rising sea levels, this year's COP is presided over by the Pacific island nation of Fiji whilst technically being hosted by Germany. The key objective of the two-week conference is to formulate uniform standards for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions with a view to the objectives agreed to in Paris.Syria was unable to participate in the 2015 conference which first witnessed the entry of states into the Paris Climate Accord due to its simultaneously raging civil war and UN sanctions against the government of President Bashar Al-Assad.France is organizing another multilateral climate summit in Paris which will take place on the second anniversary of the original conference, Dec 12.

Xie made the remarks while addressing the high-level forum on south-south cooperation on climate change held in the China pavilion at COP 23 Wednesday. Xie said as COP 23 was crucial to implementing the Paris Agreement and to consolidating mutual trust and multilateral processes, China hoped that substantial results would be achieved at the current climate talks to address issues that concern developing countries, including adaptation, funds, technology and capacity building. Besides, an unequivocal arrangement on detailed plans to implement the Paris Agreement is also expected to be nailed down in Bonn, Xie said. Apart from these trust-building actions, Xie also proposed ""development for all"" and ""bridging cooperation"" to strengthen international cooperation in the climate field. ""Developing countries, though at different stages of development, are all confronted with multiple challenges, ranging from economic growth, people's livelihood, poverty eradication, to environmental and climate protection,"" said the special representative. Therefore, while carrying out north-south climate cooperation and leveraging funds offered by developed countries, developing countries can boost exchanges under south-south cooperation, sharing their best practices and policy measures against climate change, Xie proposed. Recognizing the proactive roles of various international organizations, Xie said he hoped they would continue playing the bridging or binding roles in the fight against climate change. Xie said, as a responsible developing country, China conscientiously takes on its international obligations that match both its development stage and actual capacity, and implements the Paris Agreement with concrete action. To this end, China will carry forward actions including walking the promises it submitted concerning the nationally determined contribution, pursuing industrial restructuring, optimizing energy mix, promoting energy-conserving products, launching various low-carbon demonstration projects, and inaugurating the nationwide emission-trading scheme, among other actions. ""The efforts made to fulfill all these above mentioned targets count as significant contribution to the global endeavor to fight climate change, which requires not only tremendous efforts from the Chinese side, but also international cooperation,"" Xie said. He further introduced China's efforts in helping developing countries cope with climate change under south-south cooperation. He said, through donating energy conserving or renewable-energy facilities as well as climate change surveillance instruments, and promoting climate-friendly techniques, China has offered funds, technologies and capacity building to the least developed countries, small-island countries and African countries. Since 2011, Chinese government has channeled 580 million yuan (about 85 million U.S. dollars) to help other developing countries to cope with climate change, through various initiatives ranging from low-carbon and adaptation projects to capacity building activities. China has signed 32 MOUs with 28 developing countries on the donation of materials needed in battling climate change, including over 1.2 million energy-saving or solar-energy lamps, some 13,000 solar photo-voltaic power generating facilities, and over 10,000 clean stoves, among other donations. China also donated satellite monitoring facilities to help these countries with early warning of extreme weather. Moreover, China helped train thousands of climate officials as well as technicians from more than 120 countries on five continents, according to Xie.

""California will resist this misguided and insane course of action,"" Brown said in a statement released before Trump finished his speech at Rose Garden of White House announcing his decision to withhold U.S. obligations under the international accord. ""Trump is AWOL but California is on the field, ready for battle,"" according to the written statement. AWOL stands for Absent Without Official Leave, a term in the U.S. military, meaning away from military duties without permission. As the sixth-largest economy in the world, California has advanced its nation-leading climate goals while also growing the economy, Brown noted, adding that in the last seven years, California has created 2.3 million new jobs, outpacing most of the United States, cut its unemployment rate in half, eliminated a 27 billion U.S. dollars budget deficit and has seen its credit rating rise to the highest in more than a decade. ""Donald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course. He's wrong on the facts. America's economy is boosted by following the Paris Agreement. He's wrong on the science. Totally wrong,"" said Brown, who has been working to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders, under what is known as the Under2 MOU, a memorandum of understanding signed or endorsed by 170 jurisdictions around the world to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Representing 33 countries and six continents, the Under2 Coalition claims to represent more than 1.18 billion people and 27.5 trillion dollars in gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to 16 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the global economy. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions have joined the Under2 Coalition, representing 89 million people and 28 percent of the U.S. population. Brown is scheduled to start Friday a travel to China to strengthen the Golden state's climate, clean energy and economic ties with the nation. In an interview with Xinhua before his departure, Brown explained his sense of urgency for action against climate change: ""It is urgent. It is urgent because what we do today will create irreversible consequences in the years ahead. Time is running out. This is very serious. If the Himalayas start melting their ice more quickly, more dramatically, this will cause a lot of tension, a lot of suffering."" He pointed to the fact that in California, fires are not just in the summer, but are in ""most of the year."" ""We are experiencing already the effect of climate change,"" he said. ""In 10, 15 or 20 years, the seas will be rising, the weather will be becoming far less benign, so it is imperative that we act.""

"COP23","China","COP23_China15","All hopes rest on Katowice to deliver on climate pledge","November 23, 2017 Thursday","China Daily","Climate organizations, NGOs and environmentalists have already been criticizing the slow progress made by the rich countries, and, as things stand today, the rich economies will not have contributed $100 billion to the fund by 2020.General view shows the opening session of the COP23 United NationsClimate Change ConferenceOn a staid note, that's how the UN Climate Change Conference ended in Bonn, Germany, over the weekend, framing just the skeleton of the rulebook of the 2015 Paris Agreement and leaving it to the 2018 climate conference in Poland to put flesh and muscles on it.Many believe the Paris climate accord, if implemented to the letter, will keep the rise of global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. But contrary to popular belief, the Paris pact is important not because of its science, but because of its timing and framework. The targets each country agreed to keep the global temperature rise to 2 C were not binding. And since the global temperature will rise to 3 C\u-243 at the least\u-243 even if all the countries meet their targets, the world needed the Paris Agreement.Moreover, as the Paris pact cannot be implemented without a rulebook, which in turn has to be completed by 2018, world leaders have no choice but to get their acts together to finalize it by next year's climate conference. And while finalizing the rulebook, the negotiators must keep the needs of the vulnerable countries in mind, and ensure the rich nations pay their promised share of funds and transfer the necessary technologies to poorer countries to help them adapt to and combat climate change.The Bonn conference was not altogether sedate though; it had its high points, such as when 12-year-old Fijian boy Timoci Naulusala gave an emotional yet calm description of how Cyclone Winston devastated his village last year. His most emphatic words: ""Climate change is real, not a dream.""Fiji, in a way, characterized the conference as delegates adopted the ""Talanoa Dialogue"". Under this Fijian concept, negotiators listen to each other, respect each other's opinions, and seek solutions that benefit everyone. Which came as a surprise, because isn't that what the climate negotiators were supposed to be doing in the first place?Dialogue brings us to US President Donald Trump. Not satisfied by just pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump sent a delegation to Bonn to promote ""clean coal"". Leading Trump's charge were White House energy aide George David Banks and officials from Peabody, the US coal company that for years has, as court documents show, been funding climate deniers. Their attempt to promote coal, however, drew boos and jeers from the delegates, many of whom walked out of the White House-sponsored panel discussion.Still, the sad reality is, even though the US cannot formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement before November 2020\u-243 when Trump's presidency will perhaps, given the opinion polls, practically end\u-243 without Washington contributing its share to the Climate Fund, it will be difficult for the other rich economies to fill the fund gap.Climate organizations, NGOs and environmentalists have already been criticizing the slow progress made by the rich countries, and, as things stand today, the rich economies will not have contributed $100 billion to the fund by 2020.Worse, the increasing use of coal in the United States and large emerging countries, including India among others, is likely to push global temperature rise to above 2 C well before 2100. Unfortunately, an end to this trend cannot be seen even on the distant horizon. By the way, if air pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions is not drastically curbed, the horizon, as we know it, will be seen only in photographs.The Paris climate talks gave the indication that perhaps dirty fossil fuels were on their way out. Ironically, the next climate talks will be held in Katowice in Poland, a country that is highly dependent on coal due to geographical and economic factors.Will Katowice make good on the climate promise? Or, like other climate meetings, will it end with a whimper? We have to wait for the curtains to fall on that story.The author is a senior editor with China Daily.

"COP23","China","COP23_China16","Here\u8217 s the meaty side of climate change: All those pesky cows are poisoning our air","December 25, 2017 Monday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","LAST year, three of the world\' s largest meat companies  JBS, Cargill, and Tyson Foods  emitted more greenhouse gases than France, and nearly as much as some big oil companies. And yet, while energy giants like Exxon and Shell have drawn fire for their role in fueling climate change, the corporate meat and dairy industries have largely avoided scrutiny. If we are to avert environmental disaster, this double standard must change.To bring attention to this issue, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, GRAIN, and Germany\' s Heinrich B\'f6ll Foundation recently teamed up to study the  supersized climate footprint of the global livestock trade. What we found was shocking. In 2016, the world\' s 20 largest meat and dairy companies emitted more greenhouse gases than Germany. If these companies were a country, they would be the world\' s seventh-largest emitter.Obviously, mitigating climate change will require tackling emissions from the meat and dairy industries. The question is how.Around the world, meat and dairy companies have become politically powerful entities. The recent corruption-related arrests of two JBS executives, the brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, pulled back the curtain on corruption in the industry. JBS is the largest meat processor in the world, earning nearly US$20 billion more in 2016 than its closest rival, Tyson Foods. But JBS achieved its position with assistance from the Brazilian Development Bank, and apparently, by bribing more than 1,800 politicians. It is no wonder, then, that greenhouse-gas emissions are low on the company\' s list of priorities.In 2016, JBS, Tyson and Cargill emitted 484 million tons of climate-changing gases, 46 million tons more than BP, the British energy giant.Meat and dairy industry insiders push hard for pro-production policies, often at the expense of environmental and public health.From seeking to block reductions in nitrous oxide and methane emissions, to circumventing obligations to reduce air, water, and soil pollution, they have managed to increase profits while dumping pollution costs on the public.One consequence, among many, is that livestock production now accounts for nearly 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That is a bigger share than the world\' s entire transportation sector. Moreover, much of the growth in meat and dairy production in the coming decades is expected to come from the industrial model.If this growth conforms to the pace projected by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, our ability to keep temperatures from rising to apocalyptic levels will be severely undermined.At the United Nations () in Bonn, Germany, last month, several UN agencies were directed, for the first time ever, to cooperate on issues related to agriculture, including livestock management. This move is welcome for many reasons, but especially because it will begin to expose the conflicts of interest that are endemic in the global agribusiness trade.To skirt climate responsibility, the meat and dairy industries have long argued that expanding production is necessary for food security. Corporate firms, they insist, can produce meat or milk more efficiently than a pastoralist in the Horn of Africa or a small-scale producer in India.Unfortunately, current climate policies do not refute this narrative, and some even encourage increased production and intensification.Rather than setting targets for the reduction of total industry-related emissions, many current policies create incentives for firms to squeeze more milk from each dairy cow and bring beef cattle to slaughter faster. This necessitates equating animals to machinery that can be tweaked to produce more with less through technological fixes, and ignoring all of this model other negative effects.California\' s experience is instructive. Pursuing one of the world\' s first efforts to regulate agricultural methane, the state government has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions in cattle processing.But California is addressing the issue by financing programs that support mega-dairies, rather than small, sustainable operators. Such  solutions have only worsened the industry\' s already-poor record on worker and animal welfare, and exacerbated adverse environmental and health-related effects.Solutions do exist. For starters, governments could redirect public money from factory farming and large-scale agribusiness to smaller, ecologically focused family farms. Governments could also use procurement policies to help build markets for local products and encourage cleaner, more vibrant farm economies.Many cities around the world are already basing their energy choices on a desire to tackle climate change. Similar criteria could shape municipalities\' food policies, too. For example, higher investment in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programs would ensure healthier diets for residents, strengthen local economies, and reduce the climate impact of the meat and dairy industries.Dairy and meat giants have operated with climate impunity for far too long. If we are to halt global temperature spikes and avert an ecological crisis, consumers and governments must do more to create, support, and strengthen environmentally conscious producers.

""This platform aims at helping to mobilize all those wishing to commit themselves to projects, carry on research, take action, seek funding or move to France for the protection of our planet,"" Macron said in a statement released by his office. Supported by Business France, a state-run institution, the web was the outcome of civil society efforts, including scientists, teachers, entrepreneurs, associations and NGOs and students ""to mobilize and join France to lead the fight against global warm."" The web platform, available in both French and English languages, ""provides a single tool that is challenging, practical and action-oriented,"" the statement added. Last Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he has decided to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, a landmark deal to stop global warming.

"COP23","China","COP23_China18","3rd LD: California governor vows to ""resist"" withdrawal from Paris agreement","June 2, 2017 Friday 5:47 AM EST","Xinhua General News Service","Governor Jerry Brown of the U.S. state of California vowed Thursday to resist President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate change. ""California will resist this misguided and insane course of action,"" Brown said in a statement released before Trump finished his speech at Rose Garden of White House announcing his decision to withhold U.S. obligations under the international accord. ""Trump is AWOL but California is on the field, ready for battle,"" according to the written statement. AWOL stands for Absent Without Official Leave, a term in the U.S. military, meaning away from military duties without permission. As the sixth-largest economy in the world, California has advanced its nation-leading climate goals while also growing the economy, Brown noted, adding that in the last seven years, California has created 2.3 million new jobs, outpacing most of the United States, cut its unemployment rate in half, eliminated a 27 billion U.S. dollars budget deficit and has seen its credit rating rise to the highest in more than a decade. ""Donald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course. He's wrong on the facts. America's economy is boosted by following the Paris agreement. He's wrong on the science. Totally wrong,"" said Brown, who has been working to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders, under what is known as the Under2 MOU, a memorandum of understanding signed or endorsed by 170 jurisdictions around the world to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Representing 33 countries and six continents, the Under2 Coalition claims to represent more than 1.18 billion people and 27.5 trillion dollars in gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to 16 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the global economy. Eighteen U.S. jurisdictions have joined the Under2 Coalition, representing 89 million people and 28 percent of the U.S. population. Hours after releasing the first statement, Brown, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Washington State Governor Jay Inslee announced the formation of the United States Climate Alliance, a coalition that will convene U.S. states committed to upholding the Paris agreement and taking action on climate change. ""The President has already said climate change is a hoax, which is the exact opposite of virtually all scientific and worldwide opinion,"" Brown said in the second statement of the day. ""I don't believe fighting reality is a good strategy -- not for America, not for anybody. If the President is going to be AWOL in this profoundly important human endeavor, then California and other states will step up."" Together, representing over one-fifth of the country's GDP and about 68 million people, or nearly one-in-five Americans, the governors from California, New York and Washington said they will commit to achieving the U.S. goal of reducing emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. ""New York State is committed to meeting the standards set forth in the Paris accord regardless of Washington's irresponsible actions,"" said Cuomo. ""We will not ignore the science and reality of climate change which is why I am also signing an Executive Order confirming New York's leadership role in protecting our citizens, our environment and our planet."" The U.S. Climate Alliance will also act as a forum to sustain existing climate programs, promote the sharing of information and best practices, and implement new programs to reduce carbon emissions. ""I am proud to stand with other governors as we make sure that the inaction in (Washington) D.C. is met by an equal force of action from the states,"" said Governor Inslee of Washington state in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. ""Today's announcement by the president leaves the full responsibility of climate action on states and cities throughout our nation. While the president's actions are a shameful rebuke to the work needed to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren, states have been and will continue to step up,"" Inslee added. On his part, Brown will travel to China to strengthen the Golden State's climate, clean energy and economic ties with the nation, which he identified as a Pacific neighbor. In an interview with Xinhua before his scheduled Friday departure, Brown explained the need to take action on climate change: ""It is urgent. It is urgent because what we do today will create irreversible consequences in the years ahead. Time is running out. This is very serious. If the Himalayas start melting their ice more quickly, more dramatically, this will cause a lot of tension, a lot of suffering."" He pointed to the fact that in California, fires are not just in the summer, but are in ""most of the year."" ""We are experiencing already the effect of climate change,"" he said. ""In 10, 15 or 20 years, the seas will be rising, the weather will be becoming far less benign, so it is imperative that we act."" Brown's office said the governor will also attend the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23) in Bonn, Germany, to represent subnational jurisdictions that remain committed to climate action. \l"

Speaking in the parliament, Bainimarama, whose country is currently chair of the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties () to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said he had taken up the responsibility because no corner of the planet would be spared the fury of climate change, and climate-vulnerable people around the world were crying out for help. ""If we are to avoid events like Cyclone Winston, and Hurricane Harvey and Irma, then we need to put the industrialized world into action to reduce carbon emissions and spare us from the worst effects of climate change,"" he said. ""Given the extreme threat we faced, Fijians should not make Fiji's Presidency a political issue,"" he said, adding that ""this is not a fight for any one party or any one community, it is a fight for Fiji, the Pacific and every nation on earth.""

"COP23","China","COP23_China20","Spotlight: China reasserts itself responsible player at Bonn climate talks","November 17, 2017 Friday 3:32 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","The UN climate talks in Bonn is scheduled to conclude on Friday. As the world once again focused on climate change, China, as the largest developing country, also attracted worldwide attention for how it acted. Through statements made in official speeches, active participation in the Bonn talks, and various side events the country organized to exchange ideas and practices, China has reasserted itself a responsible player in global battle against climate change at the 23rd Conference of Parties (COP23) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). China's special representative on climate change affairs Xie Zhenhua stated at an event of the COP 23, that as a responsible developing country, China conscientiously takes on its international obligations that match both its development stage and actual capacity, and implements the Paris Agreement with concrete action. OVER DELIVERED ON CLIMATE TARGETS In terms of domestic efforts, ""China has over delivered on achieving its targets in fighting climate change, and reversed the rapid rise of CO2 emission that had lasted for years,"" Xie stated while addressing a high-level meeting of COP 23. Moreover, the share of coal in the total consumption of energy had decreased from 72 percent to 64 percent in the 2005-2015 time frame, while the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption rose from 7.4 percent to 12 percent, and at the same time, the country's forest reserve had expanded by 3 billion cubic meters, according to Xie. ""This year, we will jumpstart the nation-wide carbon-trading market,"" Xie said during his speech. China's domestic climate actions have been widely recognized in the international community. Barbara Hendricks, German environment minister, told Xinhua that she is aware that China planned to build far fewer thermal power plants than five years ago, and to generate more and more power from renewable energy, which means China is on a good path of development. Dylan Murray, policy advisor with the Nature Conservancy, told Xinhua ""China is taking real steps to peak emissions"". In the future, China's economy will further decouple with fossil fuels, and tougher controls on the efficiency, or even on the total consumption of coal are foreseeable, estimated Liu Qiang, director of Strategy and Planning Department of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation. GUARDIAN OF MULTILATERAL PROCESSES Globally, China has promised to peak its CO2 emission by around 2030, and made crucial contributions to the signing of the Paris Agreement that seeks to limit a rise in temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. Norbert Salomon, deputy director of the Emission Control, Safety of Installations and Transport at the German Federal Ministry for Environment, said ""China's engagement and contributions to combat climate change is itself an inestimable value for global community."" Xie Zhenhua pledged at a high-level meeting of the COP 23 that China is ready to play the role as a guardian of multilateral processes and will work with other countries to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement. At the COP 23, China has played a proactive role, Gu Zihua, a Chinese negotiator, said in an interview with Xinhua. ""We have been substantially engaged in the talks on each agenda, and contributed China's proposals,"" Gu said. Moreover, China has been acted as a mediator of the developing countries to coordinate their stances and kept close consultations with the president on facilitative dialogue. DRIVING SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION China has set aside a total of 100 million U.S. dollars for South-South cooperation with 27 developing countries over the years, Xie announced at a high-level meeting at the COP 23. Best practices of many such projects are shared at the side events of COP 23. Among them, a project of low carbon town in Gampola, Sri Lanka, showed how China helped developing countries with adaptation. Global Environmental Institute (GEI), a Chinese NGO, has completed assessment of solar energy and biomass potential of Gampola and introduced the Sri Lanka side to the fund for south south cooperation. Ranish Hettige, deputy assistant secretary of Sri Lanka's Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry, told Xinhua that the GEI offered them toolkits, mechanisms and technologies to adapt to climate change. ""It is very hard for Sri Lanka to afford many new technologies, like introducing solar energy or electric vehicles. There are funds from other countries like China that helped us to make sure we are adapting to climate change. The help of China is very important to us,"" Hettige said. Now, with the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, a new opportunity arises for south-south climate cooperation. Robert Ddamulira, with the World Wildlife Fund in Uganda, said the initiative offers a great opportunity especially considering that China is a leading country in renewable energy. Looking into the future, Wang Shi, a former real estate tycoon and now Chair of the Board of Vanke Foundation, said he is optimistic. Having followed the UN climate talks since Copenhagen in 2009, Wang said he had witnessed that the Chinese government is getting more and more proactive. Moreover, when the foundation is promoting environmental projects in various Chinese localities, he found the green and low-carbon concept had been ingrained in everybody's mind. \l"

This would be done in accordance with the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which was convened last month, said Ma Xiaoguang with the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office at a press conference. Earlier this year, the mainland introduced policies supporting Taiwan-funded enterprises investing on the mainland, encouraging them to take part in the Belt and Road Initiative, and allowing qualified Taiwan lawyers to handle a wider range of civil cases. High school students with qualified college entrance exam scores in Taiwan can apply directly to universities on the mainland from Oct. 1 and Taiwan students are now eligible for more scholarships thanks to new policies, according to Ma. The Ministry of Education also required universities to offer employment guidance to Taiwan students if they are willing to work on the mainland. When answering a question about Taiwan\' s failure to participate in the United Nations held in Germany, Ma said Taiwan\' s refusal to adhere to the 1992 Consensus is the crucial reason for its problems in participating in international affairs. Taiwan authorities refuse to adhere to the 1992 Consensus, which has led to the suspension of communication with the mainland and made it impossible for the two sides to solve problems, Ma said.  The Taiwan side should reflect on its own mistake, rather than falsely accuse the mainland, he said.

Calling climate change a question of humanity's fate, Merkel said additional efforts were needed to fulfil the 2015 Paris climate accord, stressing that the current endeavors were not sufficient. In the landmark Paris accord, the participating countries agreed to keep global temperature increase in this century below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and seek to decrease it further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Before her speech, Steinmeier warned that the ""dramatic"" consequences of climate change were already apparent in the melting of Alpine glaciers as well as recent extreme weather patterns that had destroyed the homes of thousands. Consequently, he said, the community of states needs to act swiftly and decisively to implement the Paris agreement. The German president was optimistic that the current momentum of international cooperation on climate change would be maintained, suggesting that even the United States could rejoin the multilateral effort at a later stage. U.S. President Donald Trump announced withdrawal from the Paris accord on June 1, making the United States the only UN member that does not support the landmark deal. Attended by 25,000 delegates from 195 countries, COP23 is the largest in history since the first edition was held in Berlin in 1995. Since COP23 According to German media reports, a first success has been achieved in drafting a regulatory framework to implement the Paris accord. The organizers of COP23 hope that a formal agreement on it would be achieved at the next UN climate conference to be held in Poland. Merkel has drawn criticism from Greenpeace and German environmental organizations for her alleged failure to fulfill her promises regarding climate change. As COP23 opened, environmental activists blocked access to the Weisweiler coal plant near Germany's westernmost city of Aachen. Data from the German Environmental Ministry indicate that Weisweiler emits 18 million tons of CO2 each year, making it one of the five most polluting power plants in the country. RWE, the firm operating Weisweiler, told the press that it was forced to partially shut down the plant. Police have sent special forces to end the blockade, which was called an act of sabotage, and said they would arrest the dozens of protesters involved. The parallel incident at Weisweiler has attracted considerable attention in Berlin, where the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union, Free Democratic Party and Greens are in the middle of coalition negotiations. The Greens are demanding that the next German government shut down 20 coal plants to achieve national climate policy objectives. The proposal has been met with heavy resistance from the other three, who have voiced concerns over the impact of an exit from coal power on domestic employment and energy security. Further discussions on the subject, which has become a key stumbling block in coalition negotiations, are due when Merkel returns from Bonn to Berlin Wednesday night. \l"

For Fiji, 2017 is certainly a significant year as the state has done a lot in dealing with climate change, including co-hosting the U.N. Oceans Conference in New York in June and presiding over COP23-- the U.N. climate negotiations in Bonn, Germany in November. In fact, Fiji has made history by becoming the first such state to preside over COP23. COP23 and Minister for Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management, the future of Fiji is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. And Fiji has taken on these climate change-linked responsibilities not only for every Fijian and every Pacific islander but for all 7.5 billion people on earth. For Fiji and the rest of the world, it is imperative to act now to save the planet by reducing carbon emissions and reducing the impact of climate change. Voreqe Bainimarama, president of COP23 and Fijian prime minister, has stressed that ""We have only one planet to call home and now is the time to move forward together to save it."" ""I appeal to the entire world to support Fiji's efforts to continue building the global consensus to confront the greatest challenge of our age. We owe it not only to ourselves but also to future generations to tackle this issue head on before it is too late,"" he said. ""Unless the world acts decisively to begin addressing the greatest challenge of our age, then the Pacific, as we know it, is doomed."" For Fiji, climate change is really a ""to be or not to be"" question because the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic. A study released in Bonn this November showed that by 2050, Fiji's annual losses due to extreme weather events could reach 6.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) because of the impact of climate change, with more than 32,000 people pushed into hardship every year. According to Fiji's National Climate Change Policy, global sea level changes will more than double by the end of this century. Fiji has since 1993 recorded a 6mm increase in its sea level per year, larger than the global average. The rapid rise of sea levels and the resulting saltwater intrusion that stems from the increased ferocity of coastal floods have made portions of the island nation uninhabitable. As a small state with more than 300 islands and a population of around 900,000, Fiji is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the unsustainable exploitation of the oceans. Fiji very keenly feels the negative effects of climate change, including unpredictable storms of extreme intensity, such as Tropical Cyclone Winston. Winston lashed the island state and killed 44 people and caused serious economic losses in February 2016. In addition, the sea levels rising has caused the Fijian government to identify quite a number of villages to be relocated to higher ground. Meanwhile, warming seas have caused changes in fish populations and the bleaching of coral reefs. Currently, Fiji has relocated three villages to higher ground, and the country has another 42 to 43 villages earmarked to be moved to higher ground from coastal areas. Having assumed the presidency of the the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations at , and being the first nation to ratify the 2015 U.N. Paris Agreement, Fiji fully understands the pivotal role ""green growth"" plays in creating a sustainable economy. The COP23 Fiji and the countries involved, launched the Ocean Pathways Partnership to further action to protect their oceans from climate effects. They also reached an historic agreement on agriculture, an action plan on gender and a decision that benefits local communities and indigenous peoples. They secured greater funding for critical climate adaptation work, and took the next step in ensuring that the Adaptation Fund shall serve the Paris Agreement. Finally, they launched a global partnership to provide millions of climate-vulnerable people around the world with affordable access to insurance. Fiji, which has pledged to transition completely to renewable energy sources by 2030, has adopted a reforestation policy intended to store carbon from freshly planted trees. Working alongside the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and several United Nations agencies, Fiji has initiated efforts to monitor and launch rapid responses to climate-related risks. Fiji has, this October, hosted high-level delegations from around the world to begin dialogues to find ways of addressing the impact of climate change. As one of the 43 nations on the Climate Vulnerable Forum, Fiji has been a vocal proponent of limiting the temperature rise from global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In 2017, Fiji became the first small island developing state to join the Under2 Coalition, which is an international pact among cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius by either reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels, or holding emissions to less than 2 annual metric tons per capita by 2050. Besides Fiji's first-ever National Climate Change Week being launched in September, the island state also became the first country in the Pacific, the first emerging economy and the first small island state to issue this November a 100 million Fiji dollars (about 48 million U.S. dollars) Green Bond. The Green Bond will fund projects for climate mitigation and adaptation to build a stronger, more resilient Fiji. In fact, Fiji is also the third in the world to issue the sovereign Green Bond, after France and Poland. The successful COP23 and the measures Fiji has taken have made the world aware of Fiji in a way that has never been experienced in the nation's history. Fiji is now more than a vacation spot and a rugby powerhouse, it is a global leader which is at the forefront of the most pressing issue of our time, climate change. \l"

China's plan aims to seek the broadest consensus among the signatories to the Paris Agreement, reflecting the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities,"" climate equity, and matching action and support, Xie said. In 2016, China's carbon intensity dropped 6 percent from the previous year, much higher than the original goal of 3.9 percent, Xie said. China has taken a series of restrictive measures in the 13th Five Year Plan, including reducing 18 percent of carbon intensity and raising the proportion of non-fossil energy in primary energy to 15 percent from 2016 to 2020, according to Xie. China has launched the South-South Cooperation Foundation on climate change and cooperated with 27 countries to help improve their adaptability to climate change as well as their management and financing capabilities, Xie said. To carry out the Paris Agreement, China proposes enhancing political mutual trust and accelerating the implementation of the Paris Agreement, turning the efforts to implement the agreement into endeavors to promote economic transition and develop new energy industries, boosting win-win cooperation and setting up incentive mechanisms to ensure sustained implementation of the agreement, Xie said. China will stick to its concept of development marked by innovation, coordination, green development, opening up and sharing, and cope with climate change actively no matter how the international situation changes, Xie said. China will fully support Fiji to host this year's UN Climate Change Conference (COP) and promote the formulation by the conference of a draft resolution on subsequent negotiations following the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Xie said. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue, an annual informal ministerial meeting launched by Germany in 2010, mainly focuses on preparing for the COP each year. The Paris Agreement was agreed by the 195 member economies which attended the 2015 United Nations (COP21) in Paris. It went into effect last November. \l"

The event, organized by Climate Action Pacific Partnership (CAPP), brought together relevant stakeholders to promote the exchange of ideas, innovations and solutions, Fiji Broadcasting Corporation said on its website. It will seek to produce transformative outcomes and initiatives to boost fight against climate change in the Pacific, and urge more actions and enthusiasm on the fight elsewhere in the world. The agenda features interactive sessions with contributions from Pacific leaders, civil society and the private sector. Inia Seruiratu, Fiji's climate champion minister, urged the participants to exchange ideas, innovations and solutions to initiate and accelerate transformative actions that result in credible and sustainable greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The government of Fiji will be the president of the 23rd Climate Change Conference (COP23) to be held in Bonn, Germany. Fiji's Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has given high priority to COP23, aiming to continue the momentum for action since the entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement in 2016. The entire region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The London School of Economics estimated that across the Pacific Islands, home to 10 million people, up to 1.7 million could be displaced due to climate change by 2050. Fiji, like other Pacific Island states, faces challenges in fully implementing government policies due to limited technical, human resource and financial capacities. Home to over 870,000 people in the central South Pacific Ocean, Fiji's 300 volcanic islands include low-lying atolls that are highly susceptible to cyclones and floods. The country is no stranger to the devastation wrought by climate change. Sea flooding is usually associated with the passage of tropical cyclones close to the coast. Heavy swells, generated by deep depressions and/or intense high pressure systems some distance away from Fiji, have also caused flooding to low-lying coastal areas. According to a World Bank report, climate threats to Fiji's society and economy include higher rates of disease as average temperatures rise; increasingly destructive storms as oceans get warmer and weather patterns become more severe; disruptions to agriculture as the intrusion of saltwater damages existing farmland, among others. On Fiji's main island of Viti Levu, these factors are expected to contribute to economic damages of up to 25 million U.S. dollars per year, or roughly 4 percent of Fiji's gross domestic product. \l"

But why care about the increase in temperature, if not because of its impact on life on Earth, including human life?That is an important question to consider, in view of the relative lack of attention devoted to a closely related and equally important threat to human survival: the startling pace of global biodiversity loss.The availability of food, water, and energy  fundamental building blocks of every country\' s security  depends on healthy, robust and diverse ecosystems, and on the life that inhabits them. But, as a result of human activities, planetary biodiversity is now declining faster than at any point in history. Many policymakers, however, have yet to recognize that biodiversity loss is just as serious a threat as rising sea levels and increasingly frequent extreme weather events.This lack of sufficient attention comes despite international commitments to protect biodiversity. In October 2010, global leaders met in Aichi, Japan, where they produced the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which included 20 ambitious targets  such as halving global habitat loss and ending overfishing  that signatories agreed to meet by 2020. Safeguarding biodiversity is also specifically included in the UN\' s Sustainable Development Goals. Yet progress toward these global biodiversity goals is likely to fall dangerously short of what is needed to ensure an acceptable future for all.Policymakers have largely agreed on the importance of holding the increase in global temperature to less than two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels  the goal of the Paris climate agreement. But too few leaders have shown any sense of urgency about stemming biodiversity losses. The sustainable future we want depends on ending this indifference.Toward that end, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which I chair, will release a series of landmark reports next March on the implications of biodiversity decl"

""Today we're sending a clear message to the world that America's states, cities and businesses are moving forward with our country's commitments under the Paris Agreement -- with or without Washington,"" said Brown, who announced last week that the Golden State on the U.S. West Coast would convene in San Francisco the world's climate leaders for the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit. The top official in California was recently named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of the United Nations' 23rd Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP23. ""In the U.S., emission levels are determined far more by cities, states, and businesses than they are by our federal government -- and each of these groups is taking action because it's in their own best interest,"" noted Bloomberg, the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. ""Reducing emissions is good for the economy and good for public health. The American government may have pulled out of the Paris Agreement, but American society remains committed to it -- and we will redouble our efforts to achieve its goals."" Reached in late 2015 and signed so far by more than 190 U.N. members around the world, the Paris Agreement calls on all nations to respond to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees. However, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in early June his decision to withdraw from the agreement. Since then, a number of U.S. states, cities, businesses, and colleges and universities have reaffirmed their support for the Paris Agreement through collaborations including the ""We Are Still In"" declaration, the Climate Mayors coalition of cities and the U.S. Climate Alliance group of states. Through America's Pledge, Brown and Bloomberg said they would work to demonstrate that subnational action can significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at a time of limited federal leadership.

But once again the rich countries didn't commit to paying the $100 billion they had promised to developing economies by 2020 to help the latter cope with and adapt to climate change. And, as they have done earlier, some Western outlets said the Bonn talks made ""little progress"".However, the Bonn talks can be seen as a ""success"" if we consider it a critical step toward completing the ""rule-book"" for the 2015 Paris Agreement.This conference was organized at a time when the international community seems ""increasingly divided"", mainly because some of the Western powers have not fulfilled the commitments they made at some previous climate talks. For example, US President Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, although the European Union was an active player at the Bonn talks. The international community, it seems, needs some positive energy to work together to deal with the common threat to humanity.Some of that energy was evident in Bonn, though.Moreover, the international community accepted the Pacific island's wisdom by including the ""Talanoa Dialogue"", a Fijian concept that encourages people to listen to each other, respect each other's views, and seek solutions that benefit everybody - in other words, a process of inclusion and transparent dialogue that will lead to the ""rule book"" to be adopted at next year's conference in Katowice, Poland.This encouraging cooperation-oriented approach is likely to enrich global climate politics, which have long been dominated by the pressure, finger-pointing and dilly-dallying tactics of some Western countries and media outlets.Certain factors are essential to climate talks. First, which country, or countries, has contributed most to global warming? Second, joint efforts are needed to fight climate change but the process of seeking solutions should be inclusive and democratic. And, most importantly, promises made on paper should be honored and fulfilled. In this regard, the Talanoa Dialogue can help build mutual trust and understanding, which the international community badly needs.The Paris Agreement, ratified by 170 economies, is part of an ambitious global effort to deal with global warming in the period after 2020. To realize this agreement, the UN had asked every country to submit its plan for voluntary contribution to reducing global greenhouse gas emission. This approach gave enough room to each country to raise its targets while implementing the Paris Agreement.Now, the Talanoa Dialogue process is expected to help each participant to share its knowledge of low-carbon development model with the others, and vice-versa. Such dialogue could inspire countries to embark on a green path of development, which the negotiators in Bonn described as a post-2020 ambitious plan, which will also need the transfer of low-carbon technology and funds from the rich countries to the poorer ones to succeed.Also, as agreed in the Kyoto Protocol and the second phase of this landmark global deal, the rich countries have to honor their promises both in letter and spirit.And if that happens, the transition from Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement will be smooth even if the US, the world's largest economy, remains a non-party to the two historic climate pacts.The author is deputy chief of China Daily European Bureau.

According to Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC), this was said by Fiji's Attorney-General Aiyaz-Sayed Khaiyum while responding to climate change-related questions raised in the Parliament. As the President of the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP23), Fiji is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the unsustainable exploitation of the oceans.

""We should get organized,"" he said. \~ \~BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE \~ \~De Villepin said the Belt and Road Initiative not only benefits the Chinese economy, but also helps safeguard the safety of countries along the routes. \~ \~He pointed out that the Belt and Road Initiative creates an opportunity for countries with different state systems along the Belt and Road to work together for their common interest, which is to protect the region from terrorism. \~ \~""One should be counting all the benefits of stability, with less wars, less tension, less crises and less terrorism. It is very important to have a global picture,"" he said. \~ \~He also advised Europe to learn from what China has done for Africa, and to launch a big European-African project. \~ \~""China's strategy for Africa is not only about the economy, but also involves politics, stability, culture and communication,"" he said. \~ \~By building more infrastructure in Africa, African people will stay in their own countries instead of coming to Europe as they have enough job opportunities in their own countries, he said. \~ \~EUROPE-CHINA PARTNERSHIP \~ \~""Europe and China can take more responsibilities, contribute more to world harmony and dialogue between countries,"" de Villepin said. \~ \~One of the best examples to show the beneficial cooperation between the two parties is the COP 21 (the 2015 United Nations , the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and their joint efforts in combating environmental challenges, he said. \~ \~China, one of the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is committed to limiting carbon emissions. \~ \~Over the past years, China has been in the forefront of fighting against climate change. Now, the two leading forces in the world for climate change are Europe and China. \~ \~Regarding the measures taken by the European Union on steel imports, de Villepin said that every country has to be able to control things without adopting protectionist measures. \~ \~""This has to be done in a very civilized way. It needs not to be a fight, my interest against your interest,"" he said. \~ \~Both China and Europe have to take care of their own economic interests. The escalation of measures which could be considered aggressive should be avoided, he noted. \~ \~Through dialogue between not only governments, but also companies, civil societies, universities and tourism groups, Europe and China could become closer and understand each other better. \~ \~""We need more Chinese tourists. We are happy to see that more Chinese are coming to Europe. At the same time, Europeans want to know China better,"" de Villepin said. \~ \~He said that the optimism of the Chinese people attracts him the most. Whenever he travels to China, he said he senses Chinese people's confidence in a better future. Chinese people are interested in new ideas, which is not the case for Europe. \~ \~""If you discuss with a young European, he has the feeling that tomorrow might be not as good as or maybe even worse than today. In China, it is different. Chinese people have seen in the last decade that things are becoming better, and they feel that they will be stronger tomorrow,"" he said. \~\l"

Although COP23 is mainly to hash out the nitty-gritty of the Paris climate agreement that was signed in 2015, all eyes have been on what the US' contribution to the talks will be. War-torn Syria signed up to the Paris agreement a day after the meeting started, and Nicaragua signed on in October, making the US feel out of step with the world.Environmental organization Sierra Club responded to the news of Syria's joining by issuing a statement, ""As if it wasn't already crystal clear, every other country in the world is moving forward together to tackle the climate crisis,"" the BBC reported.Former US vice president Al Gore, a passionate climate campaigner, rued being unable to persuade incumbent President Donald Trump over climate change. The Trump administration's plans to promote coal as a solution to man-made climate change at Bonn had already left delegates from other nations and scientists aghast. A White House spokesperson said that fossil-fuel use could be ""efficient and clean,"" outraging environmental experts. Observers agree that the US is isolating itself, and this means other nations such as China, Canada and the EU will start to move the agenda. Media reports suggest that far from being ""America First,"" on climate change it will be ""America Alone."" The US has not been invited to a summit to be held in Paris in December. The World Meteorological Organization reports that 2017 is set to be one of the top three hottest years on record. Another report from the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) predicted that tens of millions of people would be forced from their homes by climate change. Retired US military experts told the EJF that Europe will need to prepare for a new influx of climate refugees from sub-Saharan Africa. Many experts think we have already seen the start of the first big waves of climate refugees - some point to an extreme drought in Syria as being one of the precipitating factors of the conflict, with large numbers of rural people forced to migrate to cities. The World Health Organization has warned that climate change is causing health problems. As if this weren't enough, a damning report from the US government cited a multi-agency study saying it was extremely likely that climate change was man-made. Volume II of the National Climate Assessment said that more of the predicted impacts of climate change were becoming a reality, The New York Times reported.The US administration sought to downplay this report, which directly contradicts views of top US officials, who have voiced skepticism about the role of greenhouse gases produced by human activity, including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. But with the entire world standing against one nation - the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases - can the US alone derail this global consensus? The ""We Are Still In"" coalition, led by former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, and Jerry Brown, current California governor, has set up their own pavilion at Bonn, an altogether flashier affair than the official US presence, according to reports. Bloomberg, The New York Times reported, has put $1 million of his own money into the initiative, which represents states, cities, businesses and other institutions, which, if added together, would comprise the world's third-largest economy at $6.2 trillion in economic output. It says it represents 130 million Americans. Added to this, at least seven out of 10 Americans believe climate change is man-made, the report said. This is of course good news. But the fragmented US response is confusing. Who can we believe, especially as you have an administration working against other civil society movements? Brown told media that he is trying to step into the vacuum led by other high-ranking officials. States and cities enacting pro-green policies certainly will have an effect, but in the end, it may just be big business that is the deciding factor. We Are Still In has over 1,000 state governors, mayors and CEOs in the non-partisan coalition. Businesses not only need natural resources - the supply of which may be disrupted as the effects of climate change kick in - from crops, to water to energy - they also need customers. Policies at national and multilateral levels will also force change. As many nations, including China, have pledged to phase out vehicles that run on fossil fuels, the auto industry knows it must adapt. If US car makers wish to compete with their Asian and European rivals, they should start making electric vehicles, or risk being left behind. It is to be hoped that whatever Trump says or does during his term will not be able to derail the global, political and business-led consensus on climate change.The author is a Beijing-based freelance writer who is doing postgraduate studies in sustainability at SOAS, University of London.

Soil is a major carbon storage system, essential for sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation, the United Nations agriculture agency said, launching the comprehensive global map showing the amount of carbon stocks contained in soil. ""Soil is the foundation of agriculture, it is where food begins,"" said Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ""Maintaining the soil's important functions and ecosystem services to support food production and increase resilience to a changing climate calls for sustainable soil management practices,"" she added. The world's soils act as the largest terrestrial carbon sink, reducing greenhouse gases. Intensifying its role could significantly offset the rapid rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In an historic decision on agriculture, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn (COP23 ) recognized the need for improved soil carbon, soil health and soil fertility. The Global Soil Organic Carbon Map, the most comprehensive to date, illustrates the amount of organic carbon stock in the first 30 cm of soil, revealing natural areas with high carbon storage that require conservation along with regions where further sequestration would be possible. This information can prove a powerful tool to guide decision-making on practices aimed to preserve and increase the current soil carbon stocks, helping win the fight against climate change. The map shows that globally the first 30 cm of soil contains around 680 billion tons of carbon, almost double the amount present in our atmosphere. The degradation of one third of the world's soils has already prompted an enormous release of carbon into the atmosphere. Restoring these soils can remove up to 63 billion tons of carbon, significantly reducing the effects of climate change. The next step is for countries to monitor their national soil information systems for organic carbon levels to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage and monitor their soils. December 5 is World Soil Day, a day set aside by the United Nations to acknowledge the importance of healthy soil and to advocate for the sustainable management of soil resources. \l"

The most affected regions would be the Chota Nagpur Plateau, northeastern India, and Bangladesh, according to the study published by the U.S. journal Science Advances. ""Our findings have significant implications to the ongoing considerations regarding climate change policy,"" said the study, which is based on detailed computer simulations using the best available global circulation models. The new findings were conducted by Professor Elfatih Eltahir of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Assistant Professor Eun Soon Im of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Professor Jeremy Pal at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Scientists have known that hot weather's most deadly effects for humans come from a combination of high temperature and high humidity, an index which is measured by a reading known as wet-bulb temperature. At a wet-bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, the human body cannot cool itself enough to survive more than a few hours. A previous study found that the wet-bulb temperature has rarely exceeded about 31 degrees Celsius anywhere on Earth in the past decades. However, when it does happen, ""the most detrimental human impacts of climate change on heat waves could potentially be those in developing nations because of the vulnerability of their populations,"" the study said. In much of India and Pakistan, an apparent rising trend in the frequency of deadly heat waves has been observed, it said. For example, the fifth deadliest heat wave in recorded history affected large parts of India and Pakistan, claiming around 3,500 lives in 2015. The new study showed that by century's end, absent serious reductions in global emissions, wet-bulb temperatures are projected to approach the threshold of survivability over most of South Asia, including the Ganges river valley, northeastern India, Bangladesh, the eastern coast of India, Chota Nagpur Plateau, northern Sri Lanka, and the Indus valley of Pakistan. And the temperatures could exceed the upper limit at a few locations in the Chota Nagpur Plateau, northeastern India, and Bangladesh. In today's climate, about 2 percent of the Indian population sometimes gets exposed to extremes of 32-degree wet-bulb temperatures. According to this study, by 2100 that will increase to about 70 percent of the population, and about two percent of the people will sometimes be exposed to the survivability limit of 35 degrees. And because the region is important agriculturally, it's not just those directly affected by the heat who will suffer, Eltahir said. ""With the disruption to the agricultural production, it doesn't need to be the heat wave itself that kills people. Production will go down, so potentially everyone will suffer,"" he said. However, under a moderate mitigation scenario, which is roughly comparable to the goals pledged by the 2015 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris, these dramatic, deadly effects can largely be averted, the researchers noted. ""With mitigation, we hope we will be able to avoid these severe projections. This is not something that is unavoidable,"" Eltahir said. \l"

Written by dozens of international legal experts, the draft agreement aims to set out an international framework in the fight against climate change and for the protection of the environment. ""On the planetary scale, we must reach a new step after the Paris agreement,"" said the president on Saturday, speaking in a large amphitheater in the Sorbonne at the close of a day-long working session on the environment which brought together some dignitaries, including former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, founding president of the R20 (Regions for Climate Action) and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with French officials, law experts and ecology activists from different countries around the world. Calling for further fight against climate change, the French president said ""the United Nations is the correct venue."" The text, composed of 26 articles, reemploys major legal principles already adopted in other international declarations on the environment, such as the polluter-payer principle, the right to an ecologically healthy environment, the right to access to information, the principle of non-regression, and others. Once adopted, it will serve to complement the first two international pacts adopted by the United Nations in 1966, of which one deals with civil and political rights, the other concerning economic, social and cultural rights, in addition to international environmental law which is today fragmented into dozens of thematic agreements. But Macron admitted that the adoption may still take time. ""The process which is waiting for us in order to have this world agreement ratified...will be slow, difficult,"" said President Macron, while underlining that it is no longer possible to wait, because ""the world cannot wait."" He reminded listeners that the G20 summit to be held on July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany would be a key meeting in order to reach full implementation of the Paris Agreement, and that the COP23 in November would also be an occasion to raise commitments taken on the international level on greenhouse gas emissions. Saturday's international meeting, where the draft ""world pact for the environment"" was presented, was developed on the initiative of the French think tank ""Club des jurists"" in collaboration with some 80 experts from 40 different countries and regions. \l"

"COP23","China","COP23_China66","Climate Champion","November 30, 2017 Thursday","Beijing Review","China's determination to address climate change stands outThe High-Level Segment of the United Nations climate talks is held in Bonn, Germany, on November 15 (XINHUA)2017 appears to be not a smooth year for combating climate change. On the opening day of the United Nations , which was held in Bonn, Germany, from November 6 to 18, the World Meteorological Organization released a report announcing that 2017 was set to be in the top three hottest years since meteorological records began in 1850 and to have record-breaking extreme weather. The severity of the situation has also been exacerbated by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in June to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.Against this background, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, also President of the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said at the opening ceremony of the conference, ""All over the world, vast numbers of people are suffering, bewildered by the forces ranged against them. Our job as leaders is to respond to the suffering with all means available to us ... This means to meet our commitments in full, not back away from them,"" he said.Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, also stressed that millions of people around the world have suffered and continue to suffer extreme weather events. ""Never have we met with a greater sense of urgency"" to deal with climate change, she said.After hard negotiations, this year's UN Climate Change Conference closed on November 18 following over 20 hours of bargaining. On the positive side, the conference succeeded in adopting the Fiji Momentum for Implementation decision, forming negotiating text for various aspects of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, further clarifying how the facilitative dialogue would be organized in 2018, and passing a series of arrangements to accelerate pre-2020 actions.AchievementsXie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said though the conference was ""not 100 percent satisfactory"", it succeeded in reflecting the concerns of all sides in a balanced manner. And it also laid a foundation for completing negotiations on detailed plans to implement the Paris Agreement as scheduled and for continuing enhancing support and action to cope with climate change.To be specific, progress has been made in three ways, said Xie. First, detailed plans for implementation of the Paris Agreement were put on the agenda. Xie hoped the conference would pave the way for future negotiations to work out an outcome document which can effectively bring the Paris Agreement into reality and balance all factors and demands. Now, divergences and differences are being narrowed.Second, the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which would facilitate the continuance of negotiations in 2018, was appraised. China appreciates Fiji's proposal to exchange best practices in a facilitative dialogue conducted in the spirit of the Pacific tradition of Talanoa.However, the biggest obstacle is still the issue of funding, on which developed and developing countries have not yet reached a consensus. At the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, developed countries promised to provide developing countries with $100 billion every year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that was also confirmed with the signatures of the 196 parties to the Paris Agreement. However, after the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the implementation of funding once again became the main topic of concern, especially for developing countries, at this year's conference. Developing countries require developed countries to fulfill their commitment to jointly provide $100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation, adaptation and new technological support development and to make plain how they will increase the amount after 2020. While some developed countries tried to pass the buck, Germany and France expressed EU's willingness to provide financial support.Third, divergences existed over the topics to be added to the discussion agenda before 2020. In an effort to urge all countries to keep their promises, developing countries demanded that everyone should report their actions to tackle climate change, a call echoed by China and the Group of 77. A consensus was reached accordingly.Xie also stressed that the negotiation would be still hard next year, and all sides should follow the principles of ""equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities"", in order to advance negotiations on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. He hoped that developed countries could continue to fulfill their obligations to support developing countries with funds, technologies and capacity building.China-Africa Renewable Energy Cooperation and Innovation Alliance Chairman Shi Dinghuan and Ghana Energy Commission Executive Secretary Alfred Ahenkorah sign a general planning memorandum for Ghanaian renewable energy on the sidel"

However, China's stance eventually shifted. In the talks held in Durban in 2011, China, for the first time, signalled that it was willing to establish a legal binding agreement in 2015.The shift is a result of China's domestic pressure to cut carbon emissions develop clean energies. It was also seen by analysts at the time as a move to improve its image after it was blamed for wrecking the negotiation in Copenhagen.Now with US pulling out from the Paris accord reached in 2015, there are high hopes for China to take up a leadership role.Here we look back at how China changed HYPERLINK http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1884037/climate-change-how-china-went-zero-hero-fight-againstA climate for change: how China went from zero to hero in fight against global warming in just 6 yearsChina refuses to agree to binding targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, saying it doesn't have the capability. Lu Xuedu, the deputy director of China's office of global environmental affairs, criticises developed countries for playing the ""games of children"" over global warming.At a UN summit in Bali, 180 countries - including China - agree to a compromise on a deal which doesn't require binding greenhouse gas targets for developing countries. HYPERLINK http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2096545/how-china-overtook-us-leading-battle-against-climateHow China overtook the US in leading the battle against climate changeCountries agree on a clean development mechanism which allows richer countries to earn credits if they invest in emissions reduction projects in developing countries.China remains resistant to internationally binding goals for emissions reductions and continues to stress that the main responsibility lies with developed nations at the Poznan climate change conference in Poland. Before the conference, Chinese premier Wen Jiabao urges rich nations to cast aside their ""unsustainable lifestyle"".Outwardly, China appears to change its tune: it commits to raising the share of its renewable energy to 6 per cent by 2020, and says at least 10 solar farms are under construction. It agreed to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45 per cent by 2020.But when parties meet in December at the Copenhagen Summit, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark, they struggle to reach an agreement after hours of tense negotiation. China rejected calls from America for its emissions to be independently monitored and resisted a worldwide agreement to halve emissions by 2050. HYPERLINK http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2096625/can-china-move-laggard-leader-global-fight-against-climate-changeWith US out of Paris climate deal, China's now able to lead ... but is it willing?In the final chaotic hours, world leaders, including the United States and China, agree to the Copenhagen Accord, which recognises the need to limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius.But the countries still can't agree on a legally binding commitment. China, the world's biggest polluter, is widely criticised for wrecking the talks and insisting on an awful deal.China joins the United States and more than 130 nations as a party to the Copenhagen Accord, which was announced in December 2009. The non-binding accord requires participating countries to pledge actions they'll take to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and is the first time all of the world's major economies offer explicit climate pledges.

Parties agree to establish a Green Climate Fund to help finance projects in developing countries. This time, China is seen as taking a more constructive approach and Chinese negotiators hint they might be willing to settle on a legally binding deal.In Durban, South Africa, China says it is willing to enter into a legally binding agreement - if it and other developing countries can be treated differently from rich countries. It's a deal breaker for the United States. The parties can't agree on treaty, but agree to establish a legally binding deal in 2015.It was the first time the world's three biggest emitters - United States, China and India - signed up to a legal treaty to cut carbon. ""After years of preferring to slink into the background, China is now a powerful player in the climate talks,"" said a comment piece in The Globe and Mail.In December, countries meet in Doha, Qatar, and agree to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which was days away from expiring. Parties also agreed that countries worst hit by climate change could be entitled to compensation. The head of the Chinese delegation at Doha, Xie Zhenhua, continues to reiterate that developed countries should do more as developing countries are the ""victims of climate change"".The ongoing stalemate between China and the United States over whether developed countries should do more means there's still nothing legally binding when nations meet in Warsaw, Poland. The G77 countries and China led 132 poor countries in a walkout during discussions over compensation for countries hit hardest by global warming. Countries agree to announce their emission reduction contributions in 2015.Both the United States and China commit to ambitious new targets in Lima, Peru. China says its carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030 or earlier, and boost non-fossil fuels to about 20 per cent by 2030. Leaders around the world promise to reach a new climate agreement the next year.Leaders from 200 countries negotiate the Paris Agreement - the deal that United States President Donald Trump has pulled out of. They promise to voluntarily reduce their emissions to targets they set themselves, which are not legally binding. The agreement will enter into force when at least 55 countries join, representing at least 55 per cent of global greenhouse emissions. China claims the deal as a victory. Then-United States President Barack Obama calls Chinese President Xi Jinping to express his appreciation for the ""important role China played in securing an historic climate agreement in Paris"".On Earth Day, 2016, 174 countries sign the Paris Agreement in New York. United States and China, the world's two biggest emitters, announce they will formally ratify the agreement. The move is seen as two big countries coming together to tackle the problem. China's vow to cut coal consumption is seen as China actively behaving like a superpower.Xi Jinping urges the international community to stand behind the Paris Agreement, while Trump pulls out of the deal.Copyright (c) 2017.

It should be noticed that GWM is the first Chinese automobile enterprise member of Hydrogen Council. Meanwhile, Audi, BMW, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Toyota and other well-known multinational auto corporations are members of Hydrogen Council.Hydrogen Council was set up in 2017 Davos World Economic Forum and it aims to promote development of hydrogen technology in global energy structure transition and curb global warming. In addition to famous automakers, Anglo American plc, Air Liquide (France), Iwatani, Linde, Shell, Statoil, Total, etc. are also members of Hydrogen Council.Hydrogen Council believes that with ever-increasing attention paid to hydrogen energy by governments and investors of global countries, widespread application of hydrogen technology is expected to get a decisive breakthrough in next five to ten years. It is predicted through research that by the middle of this century, hydrogen energy is expected to meet 18% of global energy demands, help to reduce 6Gt carbon dioxide emissions, create a gross output of USD 2.5 trillion, and offer 30 million jobs. Activities held by Hydrogen Council become parts of major international events, including World Economic Forum, Climate Week NYC, ""One Planet, One Blue Sky"" Summit, COP23, etc., and their participants are heads of countries and governments.Wei Jianjun, as the Chairman of the first Chinese auto enterprise member of Hydrogen Council, believes that hydrogen will play a critical role in energy and transportation fields in China, even in the world. Hydrogen energy, as a carrier of renewable energy and clean energy of HFCVs, can help humans to utilize intermittent energy as renewable energy and realize true zero-emission traffic. Facing such important tasks as easing air pollution and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, China is expected to be the leader of a renewable energy society of the world. Through being a member of Hydrogen Council, GWM will assume corresponding responsibilities and make contributions to establishing a global hydrogen society.It is known that auto electrification, including development of vehicles with hydrogen cell as power system, has become one of the R&D cores of GWM. GWM has dedicated himself to developing high-power FCVs which will enjoys such advantages as low-cost design, light-weight vehicle body, high energy efficiency and low carbon emission. Through building a world-class team of experts and a top hydrogen test center, GWM has focused on technical research and development in such aspects as hydrogen production, hydrogenation and fuel cell drive system, striving to manufacture highly competitive products in China and even the world.From signing Letter of Intent to set up a new energy vehicle company with BMW, launching the R&D Center in Austria to going to release pure electric vehicle brand in Beijing Auto Show, GWM has walked faster in the field of new energy and 2018 will witness its rapid development.Source: Great Wall Motors Company Limited\l"

Speaking in Hong Kong the 63-year-old novelist explained that he had gradually stepped away from the Nobel spotlight and learned to largely ignore the public's high expectations, comparing himself to an athlete who needs to unwind to perform well in a major competition. ""Some athletes perform well in regular races, but they can't compete at their best during international sport events, such as the Olympics,"" he said. ""To some degree, it also applies to writers. When you are under lots of pressure and demand more from yourself, it's not good for writing."" After a five-year hiatus, Mo started publishing some short stories and poems in Chinese literature magazines late last year, although most of these works had been written before he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 and he only recently polished them up for publication. Mo is the only Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize for literature. Gao Xingjian, who was born in Ganzhou, Jiangxi province, in 1940, won the prize in 2000, three years after becoming a French citizen. ""During the first two years after [the award], there were so many invitations that even if I picked one out of 10 I was still fully occupied,"" Mo said. ""Over the past two years, I feel I have paid back most of the favours that I owed my friends ... so now I have more time for myself and my writing."" These days he usually spends the morning reading, before sparing some time in the afternoon for catching up with friends and the news, and then devotes two hours in the evening - usually between 8pm and 10pm - to writing.

In March, he became one of the most high-profile figures to stand down as one of the delegates to the annual Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. He had been nominated for the position in 2013 by the Chinese National Academy of Arts, something he later described as a responsibility rather than an honour. During his five-year tenure, Mo delivered proposals for improving preschool education in rural areas, shortening the school year and increasing subsidies for families that lost their only child. But the post brought with it long hours spent in meetings, as well as researching and drafting proposals, along with a bombardment of media interviews. ""My body simply cannot handle that amount of work. So I suggested not being elected for another tenure,"" Mo said. ""Besides, I want to focus more on my writing.""

But now Mo says: ""My teaser is as untrustworthy as county-level weather report. The novel is not done. New material keeps coming."" Critics have often portrayed Mo as a writer ""inside the establishment""- he has been the deputy chairman of the Communist Party-affiliated China Writers Association since 2011, an organisation often lambasted for being too close to the government. In a 2013 interview with the South China Morning Post, Mo argued that censorship gave writers the motivation to challenge topics seen as taboos and described the 1980s as a golden period for literature when writers dared to confront forbidden topics creatively.

When asked if he had witnessed any changes in the environment on the mainland, Mo answered: ""I can only speak for myself ... I feel I am still following my old writing style. And the topics as well as the people in my works also keep pace with times. There are historical figures, my memory of history, and people's lives that are happening and changing."" While he does not follow Hong Kong news closely, he said the Hongkongers who felt only a loose attachment to the mainland only represent a small group and he did not worry about relations between the two, adding: ""History won't backtrack"".

The award, named after the gambling and entertainment mogul Lui Che-woo, grants prizes of HK$20 million (US$2.5 million) in three categories: sustainable development, improving people's welfare and promoting ""positive energy"". This year the prize in the third category will focus on people or groups who have worked to tackle illiteracy, a topic Mo feels particularly strongly about. He said it reminded him of people from his parents' generation who did not know how to read and wrote and also brought back memories of his childhood, when as a primary school student he was mobilised to teach illiterate farmers. Past winners of the prize include Xie Zhenhua, head of the Chinese delegation to the United NationsClimate Change Conference, China's ""father of hybrid rice"" Yuan Longping, former US president Jimmy Carter, the International Paralympic Committee, Seattle-based NGO Landesa Rural Development Institute and medical humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres. Mo said the award, now in its third year, was a big prize ""not only because of its unprecedented cash awards, but also because it sets a high bar and covers a wide array of fields, with a focus on issues influencing mankind"". He said the success of the Nobel Prize is partly down to its 100-year history and widespread public engagement, but believed the newcomer can achieve a similar level of influence. ""We have studied the selection process and style of almost every prestigious award around the world ... I believe it will become an international prize that attracts global attention,"" he said.

Unprecedented snow storms batter the northern hemisphere, and summer heat waves have intensified.Just how much man has contributed to climate change has been a long-running debate between rich and poor countries.Pollution is recognized as a contributing factor to climate change, and China leads the world in the fight to clean up those industries that most affect air and water quality.Since the drafting of the Paris Agreement on climate change, green financing and sustainable development have become key development objectives in China's growth plans.In just a few short years, China's green bond market, born as one of Beijing's responses to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, has become the world's biggest.Internationally aligned green bond issuance from China last year raised US$22.9 billion, according to data from Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), an investment industry advocacy group based in London. Clear trend set by one of the most committed nations in the global fight against climate changeIn its annual report China Green Bond Market 2017 it said this was slightly lower than the US$23.6 billion reached in 2016.The report noted, however, that despite the slight decrease, China remains one of the largest sources of issuance in the global green bond market in 2017.""Globally, the United States was the largest issuer in 2017 with US$42.4 billion, followed by China and France. Other emerging markets, such as India and Mexico, were also among the top 10 issuers."" Since China's green bond market began in 2015, the country has issued over US$47 billion worth of green bonds and has become one of the world's most committed nations in the fight against climate change.The environment is an issue President Xi Jinping has taken a particular interest in, putting China at the forefront of the climate change debate.In his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on Oct 18 last year, Xi said China and its people had devoted ""serious energy to ecological conservation"".""Taking a driving seat in international cooperation to respond to climate change, China has become an important participant, contributor and torchbearer in the global endeavor for ecological civilization,"" he said.""The Chinese green bond market started to kick off in 2015, mostly due to the Chinese authorities' responses to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference,"" she told China Daily Asia Weekly.Social responsibilityThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has estimated the country needs US$320 billion a year to meet government targets for addressing widespread air, soil and water pollution.Most green bonds in China have a three- or five-year tenor. This allows Chinese banks and project developers to address a pressing problem - the mismatch in maturities between long-term infrastructure projects and the much shorter terms of trust products or other wealth management products that many banks have come to rely on in recent years, analysts say.In China, green bonds play a larger role than in other economies, accounting for 2 percent of all bonds issued by domestic institutions and corporations, compared with 0.2 percent internationally, according to CBI.""For investors, there is an increasing demand to satisfy environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles as part of their corporate policies,"" said Ashurst's Lee.She said green bonds offer investors direct access to the ESG-related sector.""Investing in green bonds will help them gain international recognition for contributing to sustainable development,"" she said.""Further, green bonds also have stricter information disclosure responsibilities and more transparent use of the proceeds, so investors can invest in environmental projects at a lower risk, at the same time satisfying their sense of social responsibility.""For issuers, green bonds have attracted new types of investors to the market and provide diversification for the issuer.""Those who demand green bonds are usually responsible investors from the international capital market, banks, insurance companies, pension funds and fund companies that have a mandate for sustainable investment.""This means they usually have a considerable investment allocation for green projects in their asset portfolio and therefore a large demand for green bonds,"" Lee said.The proceeds raised by green bonds are invested in green projects, most of which enjoy subsidies from central and local governments.Besides subsidies, preferential policies such as lower investment thresholds and more favorable tax rates are expected for green bonds.These preferential policies can lower the financing cost to some extent, leading issuers and investors to invest more in projects for environmental protection, low-carbon development and sustainable development.In China, commercial banks make up the largest proportion of issuance.""This is partly attributable to the PBOC's announcement No 39 (2015), which encourages financial institutions to support green development and issuance of green bonds,"" Lee said.More than 80 percent of China's green bonds are issued by commercial banks.""China is one of the countries most exposed to pollution, particularly air pollution. Following the Paris 2015 Climate Change Conference, they have shown keenness to fight climate change,"" said Alban de Fay, a portfolio manager at Amundi Asset Management who handles socially responsible, fixed-income investments.Government supportTo many observers, China's status as a leading issuer of green bonds signals its commitment to address the environmental problems that have come with the country's rapid industrialization.The growth of China's green capital market has come largely as a result of better government support, analysts said.Sean Kidney, CBI's chief executive officer, told Xinhua recently that issuances of green bonds by three of the largest Chinese banks - Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Development Bank - were a ""sign of the internationalization"" of China's bond market.In November last year, Bank of China issued a green bond in Paris denominated in three currencies - euro, US dollar and yuan - for a total equivalent amount of US$1.5 billion.It was the first issuance of a yuan-denominated green bond in the French capital, the Paris branch of Bank of China said in the statement.This CBI-certified bond was issued in three tranches, namely 700 million euros, US$500 million and 1 billion yuan.The issuance was subscribed by more than 230 investors, while the order book was more than 2.6 times oversubscribed, the bank said in the statement.Proceeds were mainly for the construction of clean transport, renewable energy production and other green industry projects.Kidney told Xinhua the green bond market was growing and that China was its most significant player.""There has been very strong demand from offshore investors for quality green bonds, and the demand for this Bank of China green bond from international investors reflects that there is an appetite there for certified, quality green issuance out of China,"" said Kidney.He said the government has been pushing for the development of green finance in order to seek sustainable growth and honor its commitments in addressing climate change.Kidney said: ""China is likely to stay at the head of the league table for global bond issuance, and green bond issuance will accelerate in 2018.""China accounted for nearly 40 percent of new green bonds in 2016, followed by the United States, France and Germany, said Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency.

The Taiwan-funded company developed a new kind of feed which helps pigs absorb more nutrition, reduces the amounts of excreta they produce and costs less than some other feeds that are widely available.""Many companies are focusing on earnings, it's important that good corporate citizens focus on the long term, because that's creating value, and stay in sustainable business,"" said Vivek Pathak, Director for East Asia and the Pacific at the International Finance Corp. (IFC), at a forum with the theme Creating Markets for China's Climate Business Innovation held in Beijing on November 13.Being a member of the World Bank Group and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets, IFC is centering its attention on promoting climate change-related business solutions, or ""climate-smart business,"" by mainly cooperating with private companies such as Anyou in emerging markets like China.A model of an energy-conserving building on display at the Third Green Building and Energy-Saving Technologies and Products Expo in Jinan, Shandong Province, on October 27, 2016 (XINHUA)Driving innovationAs technological development of the new feed matured, Anyou expanded its research to new fields such as the use of solar energy in pigsties, rainwater recycling and reuse, and alternative uses for livestock manure.However, creating environmentally friendly products and production methods requires much research and experimentation as well as weighing pros and cons. For example, researchers at the company used to cultivate algae with livestock waste. But they soon found that although it is a circular process, which seemed to be sustainable and environmentally friendly, in practice it requires a lot of space and water, resulting to another form of energy waste.Through further trials, the company found a more sustainable concept the use of pig excrement to raise black soldier fly, an insect high in protein that can be fed to livestock.""The entire process has zero release [of emissions], and we are promoting the method to our customers,"" Dr. Hong Yifen, head of Anyou's low-carbon research department, said at the forum.Anyou is one of many private Chinese companies making a contribution to protecting the environment in their business operations. Guangxi Fenglin Wood Industry Group, one of the earliest manufacturers of wooden floorboards in China, has developed technology to also turn wood offcuts and chips, by-products of the manufacturing process, into wooden flooring. Mlog, a company focused on meteorological science and technology and IT technology research and development, helps its customers reduce production losses due to whether changes using big data analysis, cloud computing and the Internet of Things to provide customized weather services and solutions.In 2015, China indicated that it is targeting ""zero growth"" in consumption of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers by 2020. In response, Kingenta, a leading producer of fertilizer in the country, started transforming its business model from just manufacturing fertilizer to providing integrated solutions supporting farmers with high quality and locally tailored fertilizers and advice.Many environment-conscious companies like them have joined hands with IFC in promoting climate-smart agriculture.IFC is investing $200 million to help Kingenta implement a $1-billion program that will upgrade 10 conventional fertilizer plants to produce more efficient and specialty fertilizers and establish a platform of 300 crop-production service centers across eight Chinese provinces. These investments may reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of 377,000 tons per year through the use of appropriate fertilizer, according to an IFC Climate Investment Opportunities report.Business opportunitiesJos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, noted that emissions from the agriculture sector are set to increase in the future, further contributing to climate change, unless the world adopts sustainable, climate-smart ways of producing, transporting, processing and consuming food, at the United Nations in Bonn on November 14.According to the IFC report, food and agriculture are a $5-trillion global industry that represents 10 percent of consumer spending and 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. The report also points out that a majority of agricultural investments are not yet climate-smart. This means climate-smart agriculture presents large business opportunities.Other climate-related technologies including renewable energy, green buildings, sustainable urban transport, climate-smart urban water infrastructure and urban waste management, also offer great business potential, with the combined market already worth $1 trillion, according to the IFC report.Investment in the sector is accelerating, as an increasing number of companies are delivering solutions that reduce their customers' greenhouse emissions and help protect the environment for a profit. ""The customers have better products, companies get better returns, and investors are proud that they've done the right thing,"" Pathak said.According to the IFC report, energy service companies have emerged as a key business model for improving energy efficiency in buildings. They typically invest in energy-efficient technologies for commercial buildings and earn royalties on the energy savings without owning the buildings.This model is particularly prominent in China, with Chinese energy service companies earning revenues amounting to $13 billion in 2015, compared to U.S. revenues of $6 billion and EU revenues of $3 billion for the sector the same year.China provides an example of a national market that uses a combination of financing, economic instruments, PPPs and feed-in tariff to drive growth in waste-to-energy plants.The government allows private partners to build, finance and operate waste-to-energy plants. China's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) targeted more than $12 billion worth of investment for waste-to-energy about half of the nation's total investment in municipal solid waste. Waste-to-energy plants also benefit from a 5-percent reduction in tax. These policies make China an attractive waste-to-energy market for the private sector.Role of governmentThe Chinese Government is doing its bit to cope with climate change and to protect the environment.As one of the first nations both to ratify the Paris Agreement and to submit to the UN a national program to tackle climate change, China has made great contributions to the endeavor. As early as 2015, China pledged to peak its carbon dioxide emissions in 2030, and began striving to realize the goal earlier still.The IFC report says that China has become a green energy leader since the government designated renewable energy as a strategic industry. It now has more than one third of the world's wind power capacity and a quarter of its solar power, and is leading a revolution in battery technology.China also leads the way in greener finance. It introduced Green Credits in 2012 and is, to date, the only nation to have introduced standardized mandatory reporting on green loans for its largest banks. It has established the world's biggest green credit market, valued at more than $1 trillion. The loans cover energy saving, green transport, pollution treatment and resource recycling.The Chinese Government has also created guidel"

It will also obtain the distribution of greenhouse gases and ozone, providing information for short-term climate monitoring and climate change forecasting. \~ \~According to experts, the country will send up another four Fengyun-3 satellites around 2018 to 2021, which will nearly double the efficiency of meteorology monitoring system. \~ \~Other recent anti-global warming technology includes the weather satellite Fengyun-4 as well as its first carbon monitoring satellite TanSat launched last December. \~ \~Besides weather monitoring and forecasting, Fengyun-4 is able to provide evidence for climate change forecasts. It can closely detect temperature changes on the surface of the entire western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. \~ \~TanSat was China's first satellites to monitor greenhouse gas emissions, which is of great importance to a full understanding of the global carbon cycle process and its impact on global climate change, Yang Jun, director general of the National Satellite Meteorological Center, part of the China Meteorological Administration, said in late October. \~ \~China is also taking solid measures to fight global warming on the ground. \~ \~It is at the forefront of the renewable energy use, with a surge in its number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and its increasing ability to harness hydro, wind, solar and nuclear power. \~ \~Electric vehicle battery producers are flourishing in China. Some of the leading companies have made breakthroughs in the core technology and are competitive in both domestic and overseas markets. \~ \~The government has taken solid steps to encourage the use of NEVs, such as tax exemptions, discounts for car purchases and an order for government organizations to buy more NEVs. \~ \~Last year, China surpassed the United States as the world's biggest electric car market, with 507,000 NEVs sold in the country, an increase of 53 percent year on year. \~ \~China is the world's biggest producer, consumer and investor in renewable energy, according to a report about it's renewable energy development in 2016 published this October. \~ \~The country ranks first in terms of generation capacity of hydro, wind and solar power, as well as nuclear power capacity under construction, Li Gao, an official with the climate change department of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a State Council press conference in October. \~ \~The country is not only accelerating its renewable energy capacity building, but also exporting clean energy technologies to the rest of the world. \~ \~Recently, Chinese renewable energy company BYD sealed a deal with a factory in Sao Paulo to supply 180 megawatts of solar modules. \~ \~""The current annual production of solar modules of the factory is 200 megawatts,"" said Li Tie, manager of BYD Brazil Branch. ""The increased production with the help of BYD will meet the demand of Brazil's growing renewables market."" \~ \~CRRC Zhuzhou Electric, a propulsion and control systems provider, signed a framework agreement with German wind turbine maker Senvion to supply 100 wind driven generators in October. \~ \~The Chinese company agreed to produce at least 100 3.7MW-144 wind turbines for Senvion in the next three years. \~ \~Over the past decade, while maintaining economic growth, China has cut carbon dioxide emissions by 4.1 billion tonnes.

To implement the pre-2020 actions, developed countries are supposed to carry out and improve their roadmap for mobilizing 100 billion U.S. dollars of climate financing per year to developing countries by 2020, and to further review their pre-2020 targets, Xie said. Xie also introduced China's low-carbon development in the speech, saying from 2005 to 2015, China's economy had grown by 1.48 times, and at the same time the carbon intensity, the measure of CO2 emission per unit of GDP, had dropped by 38.6 percent, adding the country had avoided emitting 4.1 billion tonnes of CO2. Moreover, the share of coal in the total consumption of energy had decreased from 72 percent to 64 percent in the same period, while the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption rose from 7.4 percent to 12 percent, and at the same time, the country's forest reserve had expanded by 3 billion cubic meters, according to Xie. ""China has over delivered on achieving its targets in fighting climate change, and reversed the rapid rise of CO2 emission that had lasted for years,"" Xie said.

Dylan Murray, policy advisor with the Nature Conservancy, told Xinhua that China can be a ""net exporter of opportunities, lessons learned and best practices for countries in Asia or beyond"", when participating the side-event in China Pavilion at the 23rd Conference of Parties (COP 23) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""China has big plans for renewable energy, nationally determined contributions, forest restoration and forest carbon. We see a lot of opportunities with the Chinese government when it comes to policy issues and also opportunities for bottom-up projects,"" Murray said. The U.S.-based Nature Conservancy is working on leveraging nature to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Murray said a recent report of the organization found that up to 2030, or in the next 13 years, 37 percent of opportunities to tackle climate change comes from the nature. ""But we are nowhere near to get the work done. We see China as really a good opportunity for us to scale up quickly,"" said Murray, eyeing greater presence in China for the organization. Ottmar Edenhofer, a leading climate expert in Germany and Deputy Director & Chief Economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), sees great opportunities of cooperation between China, Germany and Europe. In an interview with Xinhua, Edenhofer expected that China and Germany step up cooperation in electric mobility, photovoltaic industry, and city planning to enable electronic mobility as well as to address congestion and local pollution. ""As China is now pushing for electric cars, regulations in China will have strong impact on European and German industry, so in that sense, China is influencing our regulations and pushes us also to invest more in electric mobility because China is an increasing market,"" said Edenhofer. Moreover, Edenhofer expected best practices about the carbon emission trading scheme can be shared among China and Europe. ""China should not replicate mistakes made by Europe"" when implementing the scheme, said the scholar. For Brad Page, CEO of Global CCS (carbon capture and storage) Institute, he sees great potential in China to boost the global efforts in tackling climate through Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) as China is accelerating very quickly in this field. Page said the institute published each year a report showing where the CCUS projects are worldwide. ""When I started this job six years ago, China had none. This year, in the catalogue we are going to publish next week, China comes the second in terms of the number of CCUS projects, just behind the U.S.,"" said Page. ""Every time I hear updates when I visit China about what is happening in China, I think China is a very exciting place for climate change actions,"" Page said. Developing countries also held high expectations for South-South cooperation with China. Mr. Nguyen Tuan Anh, with the Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment, said climate change adaptation is a challenge that must be jointly faced by developing nations, island nations, and least-developed countries. ""Both China's financing and development experience are of great significance to us."" \l"

It is: 'What about Donald Trump?'"" Solheim told a panel in Geneva by videoconference from Nairobi.""In all likelihood, the United States of America will live up to its Paris commitment, not because of the White House, but because of the private sector,"" he said. ""All the big American companies are dedicated to go in the green direction.""But UNEP said countries and industries still need to do more to meet targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions that experts say contribute to global warming. The report criticizes coal-fired electricity plants being built in emerging economies, and insists that investment in renewable energies will pay for itself - and even make money - over the long term.""The Paris agreement boosted climate action, but momentum is clearly faltering,"" said Edgar Gutierrez-Espeleta, Costa Rica's Environment Minister, who heads the UN Environment Assembly. ""We face a stark choice: up our ambition, or suffer the consequences.""The Paris accord aims to cap global temperature increases to 2 C by the year 2100 compared to average world temperatures at the start of the industrial era - and even hopes to limit the increase to 1.5 C.UNEP says trends suggest that even if current national commitments are met, a temperature increase of 3 C by the end of the century is ""very likely - meaning that governments need to deliver much stronger pledges when they are revised in 2020"".A new round of UN climate talks known as COP 23 starts in Bonn, Germany, on Monday, when countries will take stock of their achievements and prepare more ambitious goals.On the positive side, UNEP highlighted ""rapidly expanding mitigation action"" and says carbon-dioxide emissions have remained stable since 2014, thanks partly to renewable energy use in China and India. It cautioned that other greenhouse gases like methane continue to rise, however.UNEP has trumpeted solar and wind energy, efficient appliances and cars, and efforts to preserve forests. Solheim cited tests this week on the world's first solar-powered railroad in Australia and the launch of a hydrogen-run subway system in northern China.""We are at the watershed moment: We have stopped the rise in CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions - there is every reason to believe we can bring them down,"" Solheim said.

If they are not being filled, the gaps will ultimately transfer to the post-2020 period.""Unlike the Paris Agreement made in 2015, where nearly 200 signatories set clear targets to combat climate change starting from 2020, the onus is on developed nations in the pre-2020 Actions, in which it requires developed countries to meet quantified targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Rulebook draftSignatories to the Paris Agreement around the world are striving to draft a rulebook for implementing the Paris pact in Bonn, which is expected to be finalized at next year's climate conference. But the ongoing negotiations face ""a crisis of trust"" if developed nations refuse to agree to formally address pre-2020 actions during the talks, according to Gu Zihua, another senior Chinese negotiator.""We're not asking for unrealistic commitment from developed countries. We simply want developed nations to fulfill pledges that have already been made,"" said Gu.""Pre-2020 is really a trust-building issue for developing countries,"" he said, ""If they turn down all proposals, then how could developing countries have trust in future discussions?""China and other developing countries have submitted a request to the UN climate change secretariat to organize an event to commemorate the 20th anniversary of adoption of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an earlier key document setting binding targets on greenhouse-gas emissions for the world's leading economies which have accepted it.As for financing gap left by the United States, China hopes other developed countries are able to enhance their contributions to fill that gap, according to Gu.""Despite with the US withdrawal, there is still progress being made. Non-state actors in the US can play a role to fill that gap,"" said Gu. China will continue to make financial contributions through south-south cooperation scheme, he added.

"COP23","China","COP23_China85","China's science and technology powers ahead","November 16, 2017 Thursday 8:47 AM EST","Xinhua General News Service","China has made a series of landmark achievements in science and technology recently as the country quickens its pace in becoming a science and tech powerhouse by the middle of the century. The biannual ranking of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers published Monday showed China's Sunway TaihuLight in the lead for the fourth time, with Tianhe-2 the second. China has overtaken the United States in the total number of ranked systems by a margin of 202 to 144. As China's computers run faster, its Antarctic research expedition is going further. Icebreaker Xuelong headed south from Shanghai last Wednesday bound for Antarctica, where the country's fifth station will be set up within five years. The new base will provide year-round support for researchers conducting tasks such as observations of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice shelf and biology, establishment of an observation and monitoring network in the Antarctic, and survey of marine environmental protection. China is also dealing with global issues with science and technology. On Wednesday, a new meteorological satellite, Fengyun-3D, was launched to work in tandem with Fengyun-3C, already in orbit, improving atmospheric sounding and monitoring greenhouse gases. At the ongoing 23rd conference of parties (COP 23) to the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) in Bonn, China was commended for its action in combating climate change. German environment minister Barbara Hendricks said that she was aware that China planned to generate more power from renewable energy. Norbert Salomon, deputy director of emission control, safety of installations and transport at the German Federal Ministry for Environment, praised China for expansion of electric mobility. China stressed innovation in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), with the aim of becoming an ""innovation nation"" by 2020, an international leader in innovation by 2030, and a world powerhouse in scientific and technological innovation by 2050. In recent years, China has commissioned the dark matter probe satellite Wukong, launched the Tiangong-2 space lab, quantum science satellite Mozi and carrier rocket Long March-6, which took 20 micro-satellites for space testing. With two BeiDou-3 satellites taken into space on a single carrier rocket this month, China is on track to create a global BeiDou Navigation Satellite System by around 2020, which will make it the third country after the United States and Russia with its own navigation system. In its step toward unravelling the mystery of the universe, China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, has identified multiple pulsars after one year of trial operations, the National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC) announced in October. Li Di, chief scientist of the NAOC radio astronomy division, predicted that when FAST starts formal operations in 2019, it will find over 100 pulsars each year. The telescope is expected to discover twice the number of pulsars currently known. All this, along with the success of deep-sea manned submersible Jiaolong, shows China leading the world in a number of fields, but still with weaknesses. Large sums are spent on chip imports every year -- 227 billion U.S. dollars in 2016, twice that spent on crude oil, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. Increased investment and new technology must be devoted to domestic chip research, development and production. According to a national plan on science and technology innovation during the 2016-2020 period, high-end common chip R&D is still on the list of key projects. Other projects include a deep-sea space station, space probes, quantum telecommunications, brain science, artificial intelligence and clean energy. \l"

"COP23","China","COP23_China87","Feature: Fiji strives for a cashless society","April 30, 2018 Monday 9:22 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","SUVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Fijian government is taking steps towards replacing cash with electronic payments after it introduced an e-ticketing public transport payment system in October last year which the population is now accepting to live with.Many commuters have adapted well to the eticketing system while some miss handling cash daily because in their view it remains a cheaper exercise.Atasa Marama, a single mother of one who lives with her baby son, parents and brother, said that eticketing card is expensive for her and her family.She tops up daily and must have 4 Fijian dollars (about 1.93 U.S. dollars) in his card to be able to travel to and from work to Suva as she lives about 15 minutes drive away in a settlement in Tacirua, a place near Suva. Before she only needed was 1.15 Fijian dollars (55 U.S. cents) each way.She said that she tops up only when she needs to travel and still hates the idea because for her it is not as cheap as using cash.Harold Koi, a father of five with three kids attending different schools in Suva, likes the new eticketing card system because all he does is to top up each child's card with 10 Fijian dollars (about 4.84 U.S. dollars) a fortnight.He said that it was hard when one loses the card because there are forms that needed to be filled and he had to take time off work to do that.Another commuter Adi Losalini said that every fortnight she budgets 10 Fijian dollars (about 4.48 U.S. dollars) for her bus fare card.""Sometimes the remaining money can be like 10 Fijian cents (about 0.48 U.S. cents) but I don't seem to know where it goes,"" said Levi Tabakau, a farmer and father of three, who likes the new system. He said that it helps him budget his money well. ""Before I travel, I would think if I really need to go somewhere so it's good that way. When I used cash I didn't seem to really plan my travelling.""In last October the eTransport system was introduced in Fiji which has a population of more than 880,000.The system was introduced to counter pilferage by bus companies and also help Fijians adapt to a cashless society as the world is changing that way.The overhaul of the fare collection system was recommended by the Swiss consultants after the bus strike crisis of 2008 in Fiji.According to this report, bus drivers pilfered 7 million Fijian dollars (about 3.38 million U.S. dollars) annually from 66 registered operators who had a total of 1000 buses running.The report stated drivers were in total control of the cash and the receipt butts and the bus company's revenue was whatever the driver took to the owner. So the recommendation was for eTicket machines to be installed in buses where fare is prepaid and the company will know exactly how much they should collect. It was predicted that the new system would mean more revenue for bus companies.This new eTicketing system that came into effect on October 1, 2017 dawned signs of a new age of a cashless public bus industry in the island nation.Vodafone Fiji's Head of Commerce and Corporate Affairs Shailendra Prasad said that Vodafone was certain the fare programmed in the system for each stage was the regulated fare approved by Fiji's Land Transport Authority (LTA).""These have been thoroughly tested. Every time a fare is processed, a ticket is issued instantly which details of the date, the time of travel, the bus registration number on which the passenger travels, the fare the passenger has been charged and the remaining balance on the card,"" he said.""For any wrong fares charged to the passenger, there is a redress mechanism in place through LTA as the regulated enforcement body. It is advised that passengers keep their tickets to substantiate their claims for wrong fare being charged.""Fiji Bus Operators Association (FBOA) said that there are some 600,000 cards out there for Fiji's bus commuters.Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama, who is the president of COP 23 (the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), is determined to reduce carbon emissions and in the island nation by using less paper.Since last December, all payments made by the Fijian government departments have been switched to be done electronically without issuing cheques, adding to Fiji's change of becoming a cashless society.Head of the Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank in Fiji Saud Minam said that the Fijian people were adapting well to the switch of using electronic platforms, and businesses were also conforming to limiting the use of paper.

"COP23","China","COP23_China90","Spotlight: World leaders uphold multilateralism, Paris Agreement in chorus","September 22, 2017 Friday 5:47 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","World leaders attending the UN General Assembly here have reached an unseen degree of unity and solidarity on two major things: firmly protecting and upholding multilateralism and the Paris Agreement on climate change as they believe only by pooling efforts of all countries can they tackle the unprecedented challenges and threats facing the human beings. MULTILATERALISM: ON LIPS OF LEADERS Multilateralism was a major theme of the speech delivered by French President Emmanuel Macron when he addressed the General Debate of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly. He noted that the world's greatest problems, from climate change to the problems of ""unregulated capitalism,"" could only be solved by nations working together. ""We can only try and address those challenges through multilateralism, not through the law of the survival of the fittest,"" he said. Macron's perspective and determination were echoed by almost all presidents, prime ministers and other senior national representatives gathering at the UN's annual most important event discussing ways and solutions to thorny problems facing the world. President of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, said Thursday that multilateralism is ""the only way to preserve the planet."" Anastasiades spoke extensively about multilateralism in his speech, stressing that sticking to the path of multilateralism is the only way ""to preserve the planet; peacefully resolve conflicts; end terrorism and extremism; prevent natural disasters and alleviate humanitarian crises around the world."" Romanian President Klaus Werner Iohannis mirrored his views, noting that multilateralism is ""the only clear path"" in tackling today's challenges. Lohannis said that ""rising tensions over cultural identity and faith along with terrorist attacks"" are deepening insecurity. ""People across the globe suffer from war, poverty, inequality and injustice,"" he said, adding that ""no other path serves us better than multilateralism in finding viable solutions for the current global challenges."" Not only leaders from small and less developed countries hold the stance, those from the West exhibited similar perspective. Germany warned the United Nations not to be lured by the siren song of ""our country first,"" calling it a recipe for more conflict and less prosperity that must be eschewed in favor more international cooperation and the strengthening of the UN. ""A world view which puts one's own national interests first and is no longer engaged in a balancing of interests between the nations and countries of this world is gaining ever more ground,"" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the debate. The motto ""our country first not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity. In the end, there will only be losers,"" said Gabriel. Looking over the General Assembly Hall packed with world leaders and other senior officials anxious to search for solutions to common threats and challenges, UN chief Antonio Guterres said ""multilateralism is more important than ever"" when there are competing interests and even open conflict. ""We call ourselves the international community; we must act as one,"" he said. China, one of the five permanent member of the UN Security Council, has always been a staunch supporter of multilateralism. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that the country will bring more dividends of peace, of development and of governance to the world, noting that China is ""a propeller for multilateralism."" China is willing to work with other countries to build a better future for mankind, he said. Multilateralism, international cooperation, unity and other words calling for collective action against common challenges and threats are like air filling every inch of the UN headquarters these days, while almost all hate to talk about unilateralism which has become a taboo at the ongoing high-level meeting. PARIS AGREEMENT: ACCORD FOR COMMON GOOD ""As small island Pacific countries, we are no longer protected by our isolation,"" said Samoa's Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi. ""Climate change, like other global challenges, cross borders seamlessly. It has no respect for sovereignty and does not discriminate countries between rich or poor."" Joining the Pacific leaders expressing concern over the threat posed by climate change, Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, also underscored the importance of the Paris Agreement, especially for the tens of millions living in low-lying islands and coastal areas around the world. ""The Paris Agreement is our common hope of a decent life on a sustainable planet. For Tuvalu, it is our hope of security and survival,"" said the prime minister. However, the hope is ""dimmed with the announcement by the United States that it will abandon the Agreement,"" Sopoaga said. Catastrophes such as the most recent devastating earthquake in Mexico and the successive hurricanes that have hit the Latin American and Caribbean region ""remind us that we are at a key moment in human history in which the notion of development that has prevailed until now has been shaken by the relentless reality of climate change,"" President of Chile Michelle Bachelet warned in her speech. ""We can close our eyes and deny a reality whose devastating effects will become more frequent and intense, or assume our responsibility,"" Bachelet said, reiterating the need to join the fight against climate change, because in fact: ""there is no space for denial."" Devastating hurricanes and other extreme weather events are worrying almost all world leaders, but fortifying their determination to join hands. Prime Minister of Fiji, Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, said his people share a special sense of solidarity with those affected by the recent hurricanes and earthquakes, recalling that Fiji lost a third of its economy last year when struck by the biggest cyclone ever to make landfall in the southern hemisphere. As the incoming president of the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the UN Convention on Climate Change, Bainimarama is deeply conscious of the need to lead a global response to the underlying causes of these events. ""Unless we tackle the underlying causes of climate change, we already know that some places will become unlivable and others will disappear altogether,"" he stressed, saying that Fiji has offered refuge to the people of Kiribati and Tuvalu, its neighbors at risk. Climate change affects Fijian lives, whether it is entire villages being moved away from rising seas; the loss of ancestral burial grounds; salinity affecting crops; or the constant threat of destruction to homes and infrastructure. Climate is changing and has changed. Extreme weather events as showcased by recent deadly and frequent hurricanes, floods and droughts have made world leaders, especially those from countries severely inflicted by the climate change-caused disasters, firmly believe: we the peoples are in the same boat. ""Act now!""""Let's waste no time!"" All firmly believe that urgent action must be taken to keep the earth a paradise for human being, which might be the best legacy for future generations. \l"

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ribera said it is necessary to combine the transformation of the economic, energy and industrial models with social measures. These measures include employment opportunities and the protection of the most vulnerable so that it is an inclusive agenda that generates opportunities, said Ribera. Citing reports, Ribera said climate change will affect low-income communities and underdeveloped countries the most. She called on different sectors of society, public and private, to pay greater attention to those most vulnerable. The minister also referred to China's important role in combating climate change, as it has become one of the major financiers of development not only domestically but also in the developing countries. According to the minister, it is very important for China to maintain its commitment to a low--emission development model as it can lead by example in this field. In 2018, China drastically reduced carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 45.8 percent from 2005 levels. It had met, ahead of schedule, the target of reducing 40 to 45 percent emissions by 2020, according to Chinese official sources. What China has done to increase investment in green energy in its economy is hugely interesting and stimulating, said Ribera. ""China understood that it not only needed green energy, but also an engine for its industrial growth and the maturation of sectors with a high technological content,"" she said. ""Therefore, it was an element that helped the country continue improving its capacity for innovation with a highly qualified output,"" she noted. The minister recalled that during the ongoing COP25 participants discussed models of development cooperation and financing of resources through multilateral funds with a climate orientation. With regard to the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, the minister said it was ""a wrong decision and contrary to the interests of the American people.""

When reporters made their way to the room where Thunberg was expected to have a news conference on Monday, they learned that she was not going to speak. ""It's our moral duty to use that media attention,"" she said of herself and Luisa Neubauer, a young German climate activist. ""Luisa and I want to use our platform and to lend our voices to those who need to tell their stories. It's the people, especially from the Global South, and from the indigenous communities who need to tell their stories."" The Global South is a term used to refer to low-and middle-income countries in contrast to the high-income nations of the Global North. Thunberg described the indigenous people as ""among the ones who are being hit the quickest and most by climate and environmental emergency"" but, she said, they ""have been living in balance with nature for hundreds of years  so we need to listen to them because they have valuable knowledge we need in facing this climate crisis.""

(hereinafter referred to as ""LONGi Group""), a leading global solar energy technology enterprise, attended the 25th UN Climate Change Conference and released ""China's Photovoltaic Development Outlook in 2050"" (hereinafter referred to as ""the Outlook""), during the exchange meeting of ""Promoting Energy Revolution Through Renewable Energy"" held at China Pavilion. This is the first national clean energy technology outlook report issued worldwide by private renewable energy enterprise as important contributor. The Outlook points out, driven by factors such as system efficiency improvement through technological progress, the cost of photovoltaic power generation decrease rapidly, and the cost advantage of photovoltaic power generation will become more significant in the future. Before 2025, photovoltaic power generation will become one of the most economical new power generation technologies. By 2050, photovoltaic, as the NO.1 power supply source in China, will account for nearly 40% of the total electricity consumption of the whole society. A number of guests, including Mr. Zhao Yingmin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China; Mr. Dan Jorgensen, Minister of Climate, Energy and Public utilities of Denmark; Mr. Wang Zhongying, deputy director of the Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission; and Mr. He Jiankun, deputy director of the National Climate Change Expert Committee of China, attended the exchange meeting. The Outlook report points out that photovoltaic will become the most important power source in China in the future, and will bring great benefits to China and the world to curb climate change and achieve sustainable development. Continuous technological progress is the biggest force driving the cost reduction of photovoltaic power generation, and the rapidly decreasing cost of photovoltaic power generation is the cornerstone for realizing high proportion of photovoltaic installation in the energy structure. By 2025, the cost of newly installed photovoltaic power generation is expected to be less than 0.3 yuan / kWh. The cost advantage of photovoltaic power generation will become more significant in the future. By 2035 and 2050, the cost of new photovoltaic power generation will be reduced to about 0.2 yuan / kWh and 0.13 yuan / kWh respectively. The report predicts that China's photovoltaic installation will be accelerated starting from the 14th Five Year Plan period (2020-2025); from 2025 to 2035, China's photovoltaic installation will be accelerated on an even larger scale. In 2025 and 2035, the total installed capacity of photovoltaic power generation in China will reach 730GW and 3000GW respectively; by 2050, the data will reach 5000GW and photovoltaic power will become the largest power source in China, accounting for about 40% of the national electricity consumption. At the same time, with the development of distributed photovoltaic and the innovative application of energy storage technology, energy consumption will also change dramatically in the future. BIPV (building integrated PV) will bring at least 3 billion kilowatts of photovoltaic installation. Light storage polymerizationlight storage sharing and ""virtual power plant"" etc will fully reshape the energy consumption pattern of household and commercial institutions. Finally, the Outlook points out that a high proportion of photovoltaic power generation will bring huge ecological and environmental benefits, and significantly reduce environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the source of energy supply, reflecting the important role LONGi is playing in the global sustainable development and transformation process. LONGi redefine the role and significance of photovoltaic in climate change action At the 24th Climate Change Conference in 2018, Mr. Li Zhenguo released the concept of ""solar for solar"" and demonstrated the future photovoltaic development method of ""manufacturing of clean energy with clean energy"". The Outlook release is the second time LONGi voiced its opinion at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , demonstrating its deep insight in photovoltaic technology, manufacturing and the whole industry chain. During the conference, LONGi also deeply participated in a series of important meetings related to sustainable development transformation and new energy development, including the side meeting of documentary release of ""The Journey to the Climate Conference"", side meeting of Chinese enterprises' climate action: Empowerment and Innovation, side meeting of ""Energy Mix with Solar Energy Focus to Fight Against Climate Change"", etc., showing the insight and responsibility of Chinese new energy enterprises in the global action against climate change.

The motto for COP 25 , which will be held in Spain because of social unrest in Chile (that presides over the conference) is ""Time for Action"" and the event aims to place emphasis on the need to turn words into deeds after a recent UN study showed higher than ever emissions of greenhouse gases in 2018. ""For many decades the human species has been at war with the planet and the planet has begun fighting back. The last five years are the hottest ever recorded, seas levels are the highest in human history. Ice caps are melting at an unprecedented speed and the oceans are becoming more acidic with all its consequences. Biodiversity on land and sea is under severe attack,"" said Guterres. He said that air pollution ""kills 7 million people"" every year and that climate change is ""a direct threat to human survival and human security."" ""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon, it is in sight and hurtling towards us,"" he warned. Guterres criticized a lack of ""political will to put a price on carbon, to stop subsidies on fossil fuels, or to stop building coal fueled power stations from 2020 onwards... we have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the possibilities offered by renewable solutions."" However Guterres said he wanted to send a message of ""hope and not despair."" The roadmap to stay below the 1.5 degree rise in climate (in the Paris Climate Agreement) is in reach. The technology is available. Public opinion is waking up everywhere and young people are showing commitment, he said, adding that he hoped that COP25 will see ""more ambition and more commitment, especially from the main emitters."" Finally he said he hoped to see 100 billion U.S. dollars made available to help developing nations react to the challenge of climate change and that the current Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will be appointed as a special UN Ambassador to help with this issue. ""We are in a deep hole and we are still digging, soon it will be too deep to escape,"" he concluded. Spain said over 50 world leaders will visit the COP 25 summit over the next two weeks, and 196 countries will send delegations to Madrid.

The Parliament on Monday started debating a motion for the declaration when members of the European Parliament, or MEPs, assembled in Strasbourg for their four-day plenary meeting. ""The next five years must be a game-changer for our climate and our environment and our actions should be driven with a sense of emergency,"" Dacian Ciolos, president of Renew Europe, until a few months ago known as the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, said in a statement on the group's website. ""The first 100 days of the next European Commission will be critical to deliver the right level of ambition for the Green Deal,"" he said, referring to the European Union's ambition to become the first continent to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The goal was laid out by European Commission president-elect Ursula von der Leyen, who is due to take office on Dec 1. Pascal Canfin, chair of the environment committee of the group, said in a tweet last week: ""It is time to declare #Climate and environmental emergency in Europe. Two weeks after @realDonaldTrump decided to leave the#ParisAgreement and ahead of the # COP25 . It would send a clear message to the rest of the world."" The Socialists& Democrats group said it wants the European Parliament to declare a climate emergency. ""The EU must act together and lead by example in international climate negotiations through concrete actions and measures,"" it said in a statement. Von der Leyen has been under constant pressure from MEPs to take stronger action on climate change after she was elected in July. She has since vowed repeatedly that combating climate change will be one of her top priorities. She has said she hopes to raise the goal for the EU's cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50 percent from 1990 levels by 2030. The current goal is for a reduction of 40 percent. Most of the EU's 28 member states have signed up to the new target. Resisting the move are Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which prevented the bloc from promoting its stance at a UN climate action summit in New York in September.

""Over the last 24 hours, 90 percent of the participants have not been involved in this process,"" said Kevin Conrad, Papua New Guinea's climate envoy, reflecting the frustration of many developing countries. United States President Donald Trump's announcement on June 1, 2017, to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement has dealt a heavy blow to the global momentum on fighting climate change. The US started a formal process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement last month. The process will be completed on Nov 4, 2020, a day after the 2020 US presidential election. Several Democratic candidates such as Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have all said they will rejoin the Paris Agreement if they win the election. The issues that were unresolved at COP25 will be dealt with at COP26 to be held from Nov 9-19 in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, when nations are also expected to submit their new pledge in cutting carbon emissions. There were reports that a meeting might be called next June to deal with some of the outstanding issues. The European Union, which rolled out its Green Deal last week to make it the first climate neutral continent by 2050, and small island nations, which are facing the biggest threat from climate change, have expressed disappointment at the lack of ambitions achieved at COP25 .

[Photo/Agencies] Former United States vice-president Al Gore on Thursday praised China's achievements in fighting against climate change and developing renewable energy. Gore, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his climate change activism, said that as far as government policies are concerned, China continues to offer leadership on climate change in many areas. The multiple facts he cited included China being on track to meet its commitment in the Paris Agreement; China being the global leader in financing renewable energy development; China leading the world in the deployment of renewable energy, with more than half of all its new electricity generation to come from solar and wind; and China leading the world in electric vehicles. Gore, who served as US vice-president from 1993 to 2001 under Bill Clinton, described the bilateral relationship between the United States and China as ""by far the most important one in the world"". ""It is worth remembering in this unusual time that the greatest progress the world has made on climate has come when China and the United States have been able to work together,"" he told a climate seminar on Thursday morning at the China Pavilion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP25 . It was attended also by China's Vice-Minister of Ecology and Environment Zhao Yingmin and China Vanke chairman Wang Shi. Gore said that the majority of people in the US had expressed very strong views about the climate crisis. And he hoped that when the world gathered in Glasgow, in the United Kingdom, next year for COP26, there would be ""an opportunity for China and the US once again to work together very, very closely"". The COP26, to be held over Nov 9-19, will call on 195 nations in the world to raise their ambition by committing to steeper reductions in carbon emissions. Gore said it was impossible to gain an accurate perspective on how incredibly serious this environmental crisis was for the people of China, the US and the entire world. ""It is outside the boundaries of our moral imagination, but we must find some ways to understand in our hearts as well as in our heads that the decisions made by those of us who are alive right now will have a profound impact on the future of the human species,"" he said. Gore's 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, has educated many people in the world about the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis. \"

Speaking on the eighth day of the conference, which is being held in the Spanish capital until Dec. 13, the 67-year-old Belgian admitted that greenhouse gasses have ""reached record levels"" and ""the truth is that we are not going down the right road,"" as biodiversity levels are also being reduced. He assured that global warming already costs around 12,000 million euros (13,300 million U.S. dollars) a year and that every year sees around 20 million people become ""climate refugees"", and that number is predicted to rise to around 140 million a year by 2050, as sea levels continue to rise and the process of desertification continues to spread. The official admitted that Europe had to play a ""leading role"" in trying to stop the climate crisis, adding that the Green Deal, which is scheduled to be unveiled by European Commission's Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans on Wednesday, has to ensure sustainability is a key part of all of the European Union's policies, with cities playing a key role. ""Local and regional governments have to be more than just mere supporters of the Green Deal: they have to become its main partner and protagonist,"" said Lambertz, who insisted on the need for a ""fair and balanced"" green transition. An ecological tax could be one way to do that, although he warned that ""the current proposal with the EU member states giving just 1.07 percent of their gross national income is laughable given the challenges we have to face.""

[Photo/Agencies] Scientists have called on world leaders to take urgent action against climate change as ministers of nearly 200 governments arrived in Madrid on Tuesday for the final days of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP25 . Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute, described a doomsday-type scenario which would see temperatures rise by 5 C if the world does nothing but continues to release greenhouse gases. He said when the world was in the depth of the ice age and ice sheets kilometers thick covered large parts of its surface, where large cities and long coastlines are located today, the planet was only about 5 C colder than it is now. ""The temperature only warmed by 5 C to come out of that frigid state to melt those several kilometers-thick ice sheets, to rearrange ecosystems across continents, to drive some species extinct and to allow others to emerge,"" he said. ""It in fact transformed the surface of the Earth, to warm just 5 C."" 'Take a gamble' No one knows what will happen if the temperature rises another 5 C, he said, going on to compare the lack of action to ""looking at an existential risk to humankind and deciding to take a gamble... that's madness. And we can't let that happen"", he said during Tuesday morning's talk moderated by climate activists Greta Thunberg and Luisa Neubauer. William Moomaw, a professor emeritus of international environmental policy at the Fletcher School of Tufts University in Boston, praised the two young activists for calling out the climate emergency, in contrast to the previous words of crisis and disaster. ""Let's be clear. We are no longer talking about climate change. The climate has changed,"" he said. Moomaw was one of the authors of a report signed last month by 11,000 scientists from 153 countries. It stated for the first time that the planet ""clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency"". He lamented that the oceans, wetlands and grasslands have been helping absorb carbon emissions. But ""we are in the process of destroying them. Let's stop playing the blame game. Let's just get on to solve the problem"", he said.

"COP25","China","COP25_China25","Hot Debate Delays UN Conference Conclusion","December 19, 2019 Thursday","Beijing Review","Demonstrators call for action on climate change at a rally in Sydney, Australia, on December 15 (AFP) This year's United Nations climate change conference in Madrid has outpaced all gatherings of its kind in running overtime. The conference, which started on December 2, was slated to end on December 13. However, heated discussions over differences delayed the closing until December 15. The highly technical Article 6 of the Paris agreement was a major factor in the delay, and the conference concluded without consensus on rules governing it, pushing the process into next year. It's not strange to see the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known widely as COP, to run overtime, but the Madrid conference surpassed COP17 to become the longest. A key task for COP25 was to finish the negotiations over rules governing Article 6 of Paris agreement. The gathering of almost every country in the world last year managed to reach consensus on other parts of the treaty, but it failed on Article 6, primarily because of a rift between two groups of nations led respectively by the European Union and Brazil. A major concern for the EU was Brazil's proposal to count its emissions that are absorbed by land use, land-use changes and forestry as credits that could be sold. That approach could result in double-counting emissions reductions, according to Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China. The little-known and highly technical language in Article 6 says that countries may resort to cooperation or an international carbon-trading mechanism to fulfill their carbon-cutting commitments - known as NDCs, or nationally determined contributions.Referring to the article as an ""outstanding issue not resolved at COP24"" in Katowice, Poland, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed its importance in helping to curb climate change in a speech at the opening ceremony of this year's Madrid conference. Since the cost of reducing carbon emissions is different in different countries, the market mechanism is believed to be one of the most efficient and cost-effective approaches for curbing global warming. ""Putting a price on carbon is vital if we are to have any chance of limiting global temperature and avoiding runaway climate change,"" he said. ""I urge all parties to overcome their current divisions to reach a common understanding on this issue."" The Madrid conference soon found, however, that the article remains a hard nut to crack. People were talking about steadily at the Madrid IFEMA Convention Center, where the conference was held. One of the key concerns for some developing countries is whether unsold carbon credits under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol will be transferable to the new Paris agreement mechanisms, and what the process for doing that would be. Avoidance of double counting remained a key concern in negotiations this year. The rift over rules for Article 6 remain unresolved after two weeks of closed-door negotiations. In an informal meeting to take stock of the conference on December 13 - itself postponed for an hour and 45 minutes - more than 10 parties spoke and Article 6 was the most frequently heard term. Two more similar meetings were held later. In the last one, which took place in the early hours on December 15, however, the rifts were still there, which appeared to trigger the decision of Carolina Schmidt, the COP25 president, to personally lead a conversation to find an agreement. ""We are almost there. It's hard. It's difficult, but it's worth it. I especially need you,"" she said. ""I know that we are very tired and know that most of you haven't slept, but we need this final effort in order to accomplish the goal that brought us all here."" Her effort failed, however. The words ""regretful"" and ""disappointing"" could be heard frequently as representatives of many parties talked about the result in the closing plenary session. Many commended the market mechanism outlined in Article 6 as having high efficiency. ""Two days without sleeping day or night. We got so close,"" Schmidt said, expressing hope that what was done at COP25 could be used in finding a final agreement during the next gathering. \"

An informal presidency stocktaking conference was postponed for 1 hour and 45 minutes on Friday afternoon after many senior delegates had seemingly just managed to pull themselves out of tight negotiations. Delegates, NGO employees and journalists soon found, however, many of the disputes were still there. The conference was tasked with putting the final touches on finishing the rules governing the 2015 Paris Agreement. Last year, parties reached consensus on guidelines for most parts of the treaty, which will be implemented after 2020, but not highly technical Article Six, which includes a global carbon trading mechanism. The mechanism allows countries to buy carbon emission credits to fulfill their carbon-cutting commitments - known as NDCs, or nationally determined contributions. Considering that the cost for carbon emission reduction is different in different countries, the mechanism is believed to be one of the most efficient and cost-friendly approaches in curbing global warming. Representatives from over 20 countries spoke at the stocktaking conference. Article Six is one of the most frequently mentioned terms, suggesting that little progress has been made over it. Many developing countries have expressed great concern on the financial commitment from developed countries when they were given the floor to speak, meaning that inadequate progress has been made in another task of the conference - to check how the commitment has been honored. According to the Paris Agreement, developed countries should provide annually $100 billon of financial support to developing countries to facilitate their climate mitigation and adaption efforts.

The fact the conference overlaps with a holiday weekend in Spain (Puente de la Constitution) means that virtually every room in the city is likely to be occupied.

"COP25","China","COP25_China33","Leveraging nature-based climate solutions","December 5, 2019 Thursday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","When world leaders gather at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid from December 2-13, they will discuss concrete steps for meeting and increasing national emissions-reduction targets. But equally important, COP25 offers an opportunity to elevate one of the most powerful tools we have to address climate change: nature. Nature-based solutions (also known as natural climate solutions) leverage the world\' s forests, grasslands, wetlands, and soils to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Healthy ecosystems absorb and store carbon on their own. And if they are protected, restored, and managed sustainably, they can provide one-third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris climate agreement\' s goal for 2030. In other words, nature is offering us an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. Reducing fossil-fuel emissions is crucial, but it will not be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels. To secure a livable future on this planet, we also must commit to funding nature-based solutions. All countries need to start incorporating nature-based solutions into their national climate pledges, and begin investing accordingly. Two years ago, scientists from The Nature Conservancy and its partners published new research showcasing nature-based solutions\' potential to fight climate change. Yet natural climate solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention  and even less funding. Fortunately, this may be starting to change. In September, nature-based solutions featured prominently at UN Climate Week in New York City. Although that event did not live up to UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres\' s call for  clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020, it did offer a platform to a new generation of climate and nature advocates. From the Youth4Nature coalition to the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, young people were on hand to demand that today\' s leaders account for the challenges they will inherit. Climate Week also produced an announcement from a coalition led by China and New Zealand, focused on encouraging nature-based solutions in both national climate plans and the corporate sector. And the private sector itself has made new commitments, with a group of 230 international investors (representing US$16.2 trillion in assets under management) calling on companies to take immediate action to address deforestation in their supply chains. Political leaders now must maintain this momentum, by taking a closer look at what nature can do to help mitigate and build resilience to climate change. For example, one promising solution is sustainable agroforestry, in which food crops are grown alongside native trees. Nurture critical wildlife Expanding this practice can bolster food security and boost incomes in rural communities and simultaneously restore soil health, sequester carbon, and nurture critical wildlife. Another nature-based solution is being pioneered in Australia, where massive bushfires are putting people and wildlife at risk  and releasing enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The Nature Conservancy is cooperating with Indigenous communities to improve grassland health, sequester carbon, and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Drawing on traditional knowledge dating back thousands of years, Indigenous rangers set smaller, controlled burns to prevent the buildup of dry grass that contributes to larger, hotter wildfires. This program contributes to healthier grasslands while generating income for Indigenous communities through the sale of carbon credits. These kinds of programs benefit people and the environment; but much more investment is urgently needed. Although natural systems play a critical role in regulating the climate, nature-based solutions still receive under 4 percent of total public funding for climate action. Worse, natural systems that could be part of the solution to climate change are facing increasingly severe threats. We have all seen the recent images of fires raging through the Amazon rainforest, which plays a major role in regulating the world\' s climate. Record-high temperatures, environmental crimes, weak oversight, ineffective firefighting, and other factors have increased the vulnerability of systems that store a disproportionate share of the planet\' s carbon. And the Amazon is just one example. The conversion and degradation of natural land and marine habitats is ongoing around the world. Such practices undermine our ability to adapt to climate effects like rising sea levels, and directly threaten our food security by wiping out species that pollinate crops, contribute to soil health, and provide habitats for fish and other marine life. Nature, climate, and human wellbeing are intimately connected; none can be addressed in isolation. COP25 offers an opportunity for world leaders to seize on these connections in the run-up to 2020, which will be a veritable  environmental super year. In addition to finalizing an international high-seas treaty and establishing a new framework for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, governments will also revisit their climate commitments at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. But any commitments that countries make at these meetings will mean little without concrete plans to back them up. We have the science, and we have the solutions. What we need now is action to leverage the power of nature. Our shared existence on this planet depends on it. Sally Jewell is Interim CEO of The Nature Conservancy.

"COP25","China","COP25_China34","Interview: Head of Chinese delegation to COP25 calls for unswerving implementation of Paris Agreement","December 12, 2019 Thursday 4:47 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","MADRID, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of Chinese delegation to the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) on Wednesday called for unswerving implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement and safeguarding multilateralism. In an interview with Xinhua, Zhao Yingmin, who's also vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said that facing the challenge of climate change, no country can address it alone. All countries need to work together and strengthen their efforts. As the head of the Chinese delegation to the COP25 , Zhao attended the high-level segment COP25 on Tuesday and delivered a speech. He said the priority of all parties taking part in the conference is to completely and precisely understand the goal stipulated in Paris Agreement, and focus on the implementation of the Agreement, based on the principles including the Common but Differentiated Responsibilities. All parties should also jointly oppose all kinds of unilateral acts and trade protectionism, in a bid to safeguard the world's joint efforts to address climate change, according to Zhao. Zhao added that both UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Carolina Schmidt, chairwoman of COP25 and Chilean environment minister, have noted the importance of completing negotiations on the Article 6 of Paris Agreement as quickly as possible, believing that would facilitate the development and operation of the carbon emission market. ""Paris Agreement is the valuable fruit of multilateralism. All parties need to work hard to finish the negotiations on the remaining details of implementation, especially Article 6. It is the core mission of this congress,"" said Zhao. As a market mechanism, Carbon emission trading could effectively reduce costs for emission cut, help achieve the goal for greenhouse gas emission control, and promote technological and industrial upgrading, according to Zhao. ""China attaches great importance to addressing climate change through market mechanisms. And building a national market for carbon emission rights trading is an important measure taken by the government to actively deal with the climate change and promote the construction of ecological civilization."" China launched the pilot carbon trading markets in seven provincial regions including capital Beijing in 2011. Since then, sound and distinctive regional carbon markets have been established, according to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Official statistics show that up to the end of October 2019, a total of 347 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalence had been traded in pilot region markets, with an aggregate trading volume of 7.68 billion yuan (1.09 billion U.S. dollars). The projects helped reduce the aggregate emission volume and the carbon intensity in those regions. Zhao said developing countries have repeatedly called for progress in funding. As the Paris Agreement is set to be implemented soon, the lack of financial support from developed countries to developing countries has become a prominent issue. Zhao added that the congress should clearly sort out the gaps of developed countries in terms of emission reduction efforts and support for developing countries before 2020, make arrangements for closing the gaps to avoid passing on the burdens to developing countries after 2020. ""Developed countries' support should match the efforts taken by developing countries,"" said Zhao. Besides climate change mitigation, China also attaches importance to climate change adaptation, said Zhao, adding that since 2013 when China issued a national strategy for climate change adaptation, the country has published a series of policies and initiated pilot city projects for climate change adaptation. As the world's biggest developing country, China has arduous work for economic development, poverty eradication and improving the people's livelihood, said the Chinese official. ""China will try hard to overcome the problems and difficulties originated by unilateralism and protectionism, unswervingly carry out the national strategy addressing climate change and fulfill its commitments, in a bid to make contributions to the construction of the global ecological civilization and the community with shared future for mankind,"" said Zhao.

The Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, called on governments to reach an agreement this year ""to create pathways of hope in 2020 and beyond."" Espinosa called for an agreement to regulate the carbon credit market, which she said is the biggest stumbling block facing countries. ""Achieving this agreement is essential to respond to the climate crisis,"" she said, recalling that this section is the only one in which the private sector participates directly. The president of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, was also present at the opening of the meeting. He joined Espinosa in warning the governments to act urgently. ""We have to act now and we have to act for the next generation. I am confident that we will make it,"" he said. Muhammad-Bande said that the Paris Agreement is the only universally binding agreement to address climate change and called it a ""milestone of multilateralism,"" because current national contributions are not enough to keep the global temperature increase below the 1.5-degrees Celsius. The Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, pointed out that ""it is not enough that this conference, traditionally focused on establishing important rules for common action, remains in that phase."" The message of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that we have ten years left to avoid a climate catastrophe gives hope but is ""challenging"", she added. According to Ribera, ""this is a different COP, a different conference... in which we are entering a new phase with great dynamism on the part of a society that is asking for more action ... and I am sure that this will have implications for our work in view of the next summits.""

"COP25","China","COP25_China37","China Focus: Leading with action in fighting climate change","December 3, 2019 Tuesday 8:06 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","BEIJING, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- China is taking leading actions in staving off climate change with widely recognized achievements, as a shortfall in global efforts calls for deeper and faster cuts in emission before ""terrible consequences for humanity"" descend. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 ) kicked off Monday in Madrid, Spain, with China pledging to try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. ""One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,"" said Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success. China has been actively participating in global climate governance. It adheres to multilateralism and firmly upholds the framework and principles of global climate governance set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement and their detailed rules of implementation. The following are some of the highlights of China's recent green efforts and acclaimed contribution to fighting global warming. China has taken urgent actions to combat climate change and adopted effective policies to strengthen response, demonstrating its commitment to sustainable development and transformation to a low-carbon green economy, according to China's Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A 2019 study using data from NASA satellites showed that China is leading the increase in greening on land. The researchers found that the global green leaf area has increased by 5 percent since the early 2000s, an area equivalent to all of the Amazon rainforests. At least 25 percent of that gain came in China. By 2018, China had slashed carbon intensity by 45.8 percent from 2005 levels, meeting the target of a 40 to 45 percent decrease by 2020 ahead of schedule. The figure indicates that the country has avoided emitting 5.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide since 2005. Meanwhile, the share of non-fossil fuels in China's primary energy consumption rose from 12 to 14.3 percent from 2017 to 2018, and power generated from renewable energy sources accounted for 26.7 percent of total power output in 2018. China is taking the lead in renewable energy to meet its commitments, investing 126.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 alone and creating enough capacity to power the United Kingdom seven times over, according to leading Swiss financial institution UBS. China's shift to renewable energy is part of a significant transition that offers a roadmap for developing countries and helps drive technological breakthroughs that will drive down the costs of renewables for consumers everywhere. ""No other country has come close to matching China's dominance in transitioning to a low carbon economy,"" wrote Michael Baldinger, an official in charge of sustainable and impact investing with UBS, in a research note. Inger Anderson, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said China ""has had a tremendous success in demonstrating climate leadership in recent years"" through large investments in clean energy and technologies, electric mobility and wide-scale land restoration. ""The problems we face today -- especially environmental ones -- are no longer confined to individual countries or regions. They are global in scope and scale. And an effective response will also be global. For that, we need a staunch multilateralism, and I am pleased to see China taking an active role in promoting this approach,"" she said. Enditem \"

Officials are continuing to prepare for the 2019 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held next month, Ribera said. ""We are continuing to plan APEC, notwithstanding the fact that we are taking appropriate measures to bring this (unrest) under control so the summit can adequately take place,"" he said. Ribera said his ministry on Monday contacted the other 20 APEC members, and ""we have not received, from any of them, any changes regarding the participation of their leaders."" The APEC bloc ""is very important to Chile because 70 percent of our exports are directed at countries that belong to the Asia-Pacific (region), and around 7 million Chileans work directly or indirectly to produce goods for these economies,"" he said. The ongoing protests are against the high cost of living, and to satisfy the protesters' demands, ""we need the country to keep growing, to keep exporting, to keep being involved with APEC,"" he said. Ribera said that Chilean officials are also working on organizing a key meeting on global warming, the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is scheduled for Dec. 2-13. ""Our willingness to help prevent climate change is not tied to any one summit, but is rather a government decision to be able to implement measures to mitigate climate change,"" he said. Protests were sparked on Oct. 14 by an increase in subway fares So far, more than 4,000 people have been arrested. On Oct. 19, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera declared a state of emergency and imposed in most of the country a curfew that is still in force in many regions.

"COP25","China","COP25_China39","Feature: Spanish foundation advocates sustainable use of food resources against climate change","November 26, 2019 Tuesday 1:58 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","BILBAO, Spain, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Spain will be the focal point of the battle to protect our planet as the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP 25 , is to be held in Madrid for two weeks starting Dec. 2. That struggle, in fact, has been going on for a long time with companies such as AZTI at the forefront to help combat climate change and promote a sustainable use of food resources. Based in the Zamudio Technology Park just outside of the city of Bilbao in the Basque region, north of Spain, AZTI is a non-profit private foundation for the public sector. It employs around 250 people and has over 300 clients in the food sector. The company, founded in 1981, describes itself as a ""specialized technology center of excellence... that conducts strategic and applied research to generate new knowledge."" Combating climate change is one of AZTI's main focus points along with sustainable fisheries management, the protection of an efficient marine ecosystem and the maintenance of an efficient and sustainable food chain -- all of which are linked to the need to stop the world overheating. ""Once a tipping point is reached, it is very difficult to reverse it,"" warned Adolfo Uriarte, research director at AZTI, at an event organized by AZTI along with the authorities in the Basque region. He pointing out the the moral dilemma posed by climate change as developing nations look to stimulate their economies and attempt to raise living standards for their people. Even in the Basque region - one of the most environmental-friendly parts of Spain, he noted, ""our carbon footprint is 2.6 - which means if the levels of carbon we emitted was produced on a worldwide level, we'd need 2.6 planets."" Uriarte explained that one of the keys to helping reduce the food sector's CO2 emissions are for people to try and source food produced as close to their homes as possible. ""Kilometer zero. Why are you eating an orange here in Spain in July if it is out of season and has to come from South Africa, when in Spain at that time we have cherries or peaches that are in season?"" he asked. ""We have to try and only eat seasonal produce,"" said Uriarte, adding ""we need to move towards more ecologically produced food, with the use of few fertilizers and pesticides."" Referring to the recent massive die-off of fish in the Mar Menor in southeast Spain, he said it can be caused by the overuse of artificial fertilizer. ""They feed nutrients to crops and the water drains into the sea and starves it of oxygen,"" he added. Uriarte highlighted the importance of oceans to the health of the planet. ""Fifty percent of the CO2 in the world is captured by plankton. If we do too much damage to the sea we risk losing that. We are killing the reservoirs that can capture CO2,"" he warned. Uriarte was not optimistic that governments could find a solution to climate change, partly because the problem needs medium and long term answers, which are not supplied in a political system which often sees drastic policy changes every four years. ""We need to take action on a civil level. Politics is a four year establishment, then you often have a change of government... To combat climate change, we need a 15-20 or 30-year plan,"" he insisted. Enditem \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China40","WORLD FEELS THE HEAT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE","January 6, 2020 Monday","China Daily European Edition","Deadly bushfires raging in Australia that have left cities, towns and vast areas of the countryside shrouded in dense smoke have made headlines around the world. The fatalities have included a volunteer firefighter battling a blaze in New South Wales on Dec 30. In that state, more than 900 homes have been destroyed, and the number is expected to rise. Late last month, images went viral of a dehydrated koala approaching a cyclist in temperatures of 40 C and begging for water in the middle of a road near Adelaide, South Australia. In New South Wales, it is estimated that 8,000 koalas, or about one-third of those in the state, have died in the fires. Around 480 million mammals, birds and reptiles have been killed directly or indirectly by the blazes, according to the website Sydney News& Life, which cited ecologists from the University of Sydney. A statement issued by 22 health and medical organizations declared the levels of air pollution caused by the bushfires a ""public health emergency"". More emergency warnings for bushfires were issued on Dec 30. About 40,000 holiday visitors were urged to evacuate East Gippsland, a large tourist resort in the state of Victoria in the southeast of the country. Many people who had decided to remain were then told it was too late to leave and they should take shelter. All six Australian states and the Northern Territory reported temperatures higher than 40 C on Dec 30. In New South Wales, there were close to 100 bushfires that day as lightning strikes in dry forests sparked new blazes. Scientists warn Scientists have long warned that a hotter and drier climate would increase the incidence and intensity of bushfires in Australia. A survey conducted in late November by polling company UComms found that more than half of the 1,500 Australians surveyed agreed that climate change had worsened the threat of bushfires, which are just one of the growing number of climate change-related disasters recorded globally in the past year. Counting the Cost 2019: A Year of Climate Breakdown, a report released on Dec 27 by Christian Aid in London, listed the 15 most destructive weather events of the year, including droughts, floods, fires, typhoons and cyclones. Each disaster caused damage of more than $1 billion, and four of them resulted in damage of over $10 billion each. The report said the figures are likely to have been underestimated, as often only insured losses are shown and no account taken of other financial costs, such as lost productivity and uninsured losses. While the vast majority of deaths were caused by just two events in India and southern Africa, reflecting how the world's poorest people pay the heaviest price for the consequences of climate change, the financial cost of disasters was highest in richer countries, such as Japan and the United States. The report said all the events were linked to climate change caused by humans. It stated that scientific studies have shown that climate change made a particular event ""more likely or stronger"", while in other cases, an event was the result of shifts in weather patterns, such as higher temperatures and reduced rainfall that made fires more likely, along with higher water temperatures that fueled tropical storms. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University in the US, said: ""If anything, 2019 saw even more profound extreme weather events around the world than the previous year. With each day now, we are seemingly reminded of the cost of climate inaction in the form of ever-threatening climate change-spiked weather extremes."" 'Not good news' At COP25 United Nations Climate Change Conference ""Global warming continues,"" he said, adding that average global temperatures had risen by about 1.1 C since the preindustrial era and in the oceans by 0.5 C. ""We have started seeing hunger increase once again after a period of decline. Now, we have more than 800 million people suffering from a lack of food."" Records have been broken worldwide concerning emissions of the three main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide; methane; and nitrous oxide. Carbon dioxide is regarded as the most significant challenge. Taalas, who comes from Finland and started his second four-year term as head of the WMO on Wednesday, said: ""We are heading toward a temperature increase of 3 to 5 degrees C by the end of the century. If we use all fossil fuel resources, we will move toward 8 C."" Some 85 percent of the world's energy still comes from fossil fuels and only 15 percent from renewable energy. The United Nations Environmental Programme's 2019 Emissions Gap Report issued in late November also painted a bleak picture. It said the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change ""will slip out of reach"" unless the world begins to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goals of the agreement, set in 2015, are limiting global warming to ""well below 2 C above preindustrial levels"" and pursuing efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5 C. Global carbon dioxide emissions have risen by about 11 percent since the first UNEP emissions gap report in 2010. Growing global emissions mean that more and faster cuts will be needed to meet the Paris agreement goals. To achieve the 1.5 C target, nations must increase their commitments fivefold starting this year, according to the UNEP report. Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute, described a doomsday-type scenario in which temperatures will rise by 5 C if the world continues to release greenhouse gases and takes no action. COP25 that in the depths of the Ice Age, when sheets of ice kilometers thick covered large parts of the Earth's surface, where large cities and long coastlines are located today, the planet was only about 5 C colder than it is now. No one knows what will happen if temperatures rise by another 5 C, he said, comparing the lack of action to ""looking at an existential risk to humankind and deciding to take a gamble ... That's madness, and we can't let that happen."" In a report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October 2018, the world's leading climate scientists warned that there are only 12 years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 C. Even half a degree beyond that will significantly increase the risk of droughts, floods, heat waves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. COP25 , which was extended for two days, was widely viewed as a failure. Nearly 200 nations attending did not agree on setting higher targets and working to settle the details of two outstanding rules of the Paris agreement: Article 6 on the international carbon market and Article 8 on the loss and damage that underdeveloped nations have endured due to the climate crisis and how they will be compensated. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed disappointment. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said. The official withdrawal of the US, the world's largest historical carbon emitter, from the Paris agreement in November has dealt a heavy blow to the global momentum on fighting climate change. This is despite the fact that many US states, cities and businesses have said they will keep their promise to cut carbon emissions. No giving up Despite his disappointment at the outcome of COP25 , Guterres said: ""We must not give up, and I will not give up. I am more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and no more than a 1.5 C temperature rise,"" he said. According to grassroots environmental advocacy group The Climate Mobilization, nearly 1,300 local governments and several national administrations have declared a climate emergency, covering a population of more than 800 million. In his message for the new year, delivered on Dec 29, Guterres said young people are the world's ""great source"" of hope. He was referring in large part to the youth climate movement led by 17-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg, a key player at COP25 . In August 2018, she began to skip school classes and protest outside the Swedish parliament, triggering the global Fridays for Future movement by students in more than 130 countries demanding action on climate change. On Dec 11, during COP25 , Thunberg was named Time magazine's Person of the Year. The global movement Extinction Rebellion, founded in the United Kingdom in 2018, now covers some 70 countries worldwide. It has resorted to civil disobedience to spread the climate change message. Action taken on Dec 14 during COP25 involved dumping horse manure in front of the conference venue. Some observers see a ray of hope in the latest International Energy Agency report, which projects warming of 2.9 C to 3.4 C, compared with its prediction at the start of the 2010s of a catastrophic warming of 6 C by the end of century. The growth of renewable energy has also far exceeded expectations. Prices of solar photovoltaic systems, which covert sunlight into electricity, have dropped by 81 percent since 2009. According to Kelly Levin, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, by 2017, the majority of new power-generating capacity added worldwide came from renewable energy. But she warned, ""We are not acting quickly enough."" Countries worldwide are expected to raise their goals at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, from Nov 9 to 19, just days after the US presidential election, with Democrat candidates pledging to rejoin the Paris agreement if they win. Taalas, from the WMO, said the world has the means to solve the climate change problem through nuclear energy, hydropower and renewables. ""There is a sense of urgency. We need transformation within 10 to 30 years for our energy, transportation and industries,"" he said.

"COP25","China","COP25_China41","Strengthening our climate adaptation now","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","As world leaders gather in Madrid for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ), they must address more than future targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. They must also address the harm to people and livelihoods that climate change is already causing. Strengthening our ability to adapt to climate change has never been more urgent. Many regions are experiencing major difficulties as a result of higher global temperatures and changing weather patterns. We must do more to help citizens and governments tackle issues such as rising sea levels, wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters, and increased coastal erosion. Even if we meet the Paris agreement\' s goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius, at least 570 cities and some 800 million people will be at risk from rising sea levels and more frequent and destructive storms. And these dangers will grow as temperatures climb ever higher. The very existence of some island countries and coastal communities will be threatened. It is thus essential to reduce the risks that climate change poses to humans and the economy. Unless action is taken, climate change will reduce global GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100, with equally severe consequences for countries, whether they are rich or poor, hot or cold. The economic and broader social benefits of adaptation to climate change are clear. In September, the Global Commission on Adaptation issued a report calling on governments, businesses, and communities to take urgent action to step up adaptation measures. The report finds that an investment of US$1.8 trillion across five key areas  early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, agriculture, mangrove protection, and resilient water supplies  from 2020 to 2030 could generate US$7.1 trillion in benefits. Still, today\' s investment gap is huge. The climate challenge demands much deeper cooperation between the public and private sector to increase green investment. We need to ensure that infrastructure is built to cope with the increased impact of climate change and develop clear global standards for disclosing the climate risks that investment projects pose. For example, how will a city cope with increased flood risk, and how will agricultural land be maintained productively as droughts grow more severe? Big and small investors alike should know exactly how their money could be affected by a changing climate. Here, public investment institutions like the European Investment Bank can assist with adaptation in many ways. The EIB has long invested in projects that reduce emissions and help countries adapt to climate change. But now we are making even larger strides toward strengthening adaptation, by deepening our expertise, creating new systems to ensure the resilience of our investments, and working closely with the public and private sectors. For example, we will no longer fund infrastructure projects that are not climate resilient. Accordingly, we have introduced a climate risk-management system, and are adding climate adaptation criteria to all infrastructure projects. Low-income countries The EIB will also be focusing on adaptation from the very earliest stages of project preparation, both through advisory services and technical assistance. Whereas we have gained much experience in the field, many of our public- and private-sector clients may lack the resources or expertise to assess climate risks. Finally, the EIB plans to increase its support for innovative technologies such as weather analytics and climate-resilient food systems, to help companies, individuals, and communities prepare for climate change. To that end, the EIB now supports the Climate Resilience and Adaptation Finance and Technology Transfer Facility, the first private-sector fund dedicated to addressing these problems in developing countries. The EIB is also raising its climate-finance target, so that at least 50 percent of its lending will support environmental sustainability by 2025. And by 2030, the EIB Group plans to support US$1.1 trillion of climate action and environmental sustainability investments through loans and grants, including for developing countries to help them strengthen the resilience of roads, railways, ports, farmland, sanitation and drinking water systems, and digital-communication networks. Underinvestment in adaptation is particularly a problem for low-income countries, most of which are located in hotter, more vulnerable regions. Supporting these countries\' efforts to adapt to climate change is essential to their ability to develop. Yet we also must not lose sight of the big picture. The higher global temperatures rise, the less we will be able to rely on adaptation. Scientists estimate that we are now heading for a temperature increase of 3-4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, with disastrous consequences for people around the world. The world\' s most vulnerable populations are already bearing the brunt of climate change, because they are the most exposed to the risks and have the fewest resources with which to adapt.

Entry is free.  Re-Cyclages is an artistic exhibition of educational photographs which presents eight courses of recycling. Its aim is to raise awareness among the public about the act of sorting and voluntary intake in order to better recycle, value our waste and preserve the environment. Between abstraction and figuration, Fouray\' s photos take another look at end-of-life for our everyday objects. Why is it important to sort and recycle? What happens to our everyday waste? What are the right reflexes to adopt? Who are the players in recycling? All these questions will be answered along the course of the educational path proposed by this original production of Fouray, presented while roaming in Paris during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and other French cities. This year, the sixth Franco-Chinese Month of the Environment invites the public to think about how to reconcile economic development with respect for the environment.

Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, confirmed that the UN had accepted the offer Spain made on Thursday to step in as host of the summit. In a tweet posted on Friday, Espinosa said, ""we are happy to announce that the COP Bureau has agreed that # COP25 will take place from 2-13 December in Madrid, Spain."" Spain's acting Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera responded to the news with a tweet of her own saying: ""It will be our pleasure to host"" the event and ""a privilege to back & facilitate global action on climate."" ""Progressive and constructive multilateralism is the best answer to global challenges,"" she added. The decision came just a day after the acting Spanish government of Pedro Sanchez issued a communique on Thursday indicating Spain would be willing to host the conference, explaining that ""multinational action on the climate is a priority on the agenda of the United Nations and the European Union and demands a major commitment from everyone."" Chile's President Sebastian Pinera had welcomed what he called a ""generous offer from the president of Spain. Espinosa had also been receptive on Thursday to Spain's willingness to take on the organization of the event at short notice, issuing a communique saying the offer would be ""taken into consideration as soon as possible."" ""It is good to see countries working together in a spirit of multilateralism against climate change, which is the biggest challenge to present and future generation,"" she added. The annual Conference of the Parties (COP) summit is a key event which allows representatives from around 200 nations to monitor and discuss the current situation of the world's warming climate and the event usually attracts thousands of delegates along with journalists and climate activists. Organizing the event at short notice is likely to provide some logistical issues given that it will be held just three weeks after the Nov. 10 general election in Spain. The conference will also be held against the backdrop of an important holiday weekend in Spain between Dec. 6-8, when tens of thousands of people from outside of Madrid traditionally visit the capital to do Christmas shopping. This factor is likely to cause transport and security issues as well as putting stress on hotel availability given that around 25,000 people are expected to attend the Cop 25 Climate Change Summit.

The Business Council of Australia (BCA), which comprises the chief executives of more than 100 of Australia's largest companies, called for a ""line in the sand"" on climate policy. Independent Member of Parliament (MP) Zali Steggall on Monday introduced a bill to Parliament that would enshrine in law a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It would establish an independent Climate Change Commission, which would advise the government on how best to reduce emissions. Both the government and opposition have ruled out support for Steggall's bill but Jennifer Westacott, the head of the BCA, said it was a sensible way forward. ""This has always got stuck on the detail. It's always got stuck on the ideology. It's always got stuck on the demons and angels,"" she said during an appearance on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television. ""We've got to move past this point right now."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ruled out pursuing ambitious climate policies if doing so would harm the economy. However, Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor on Monday confirmed that Australia will commit to a 2050 emissions reduction target at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in November. More than 80 countries have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, with Australia urged to follow their lead. Introducing her bill on Monday, Steggall -- who won her inner-Sydney electorate on the back of campaigning on climate change -- said it was ""for the long-term safety of Australians.""

""This is a climate emergency that the world is facing. This is here and now. The need for urgent action has never been clearer. COP26 is more important than Paris COP,"" Sturgeon said while addressing a ""Countdown to COP26"" event in London. The 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP26, is slated for Nov. 9 to 19 in Glasgow, Scotland this year under the presidency of the British government. Outlining Scotland's plans to reach net zero emission by 2045, she noted that the drive to get there ""must not leave any communities behind."" ""We recognise the targets will not be easy,"" she said, ""the process of decarbonization should be handled very differently to the deindustrialization of communities in the 1970s and 1980s."" ""The journey to becoming a net-zero society is one we must all make together in a fair and just way. Reducing emissions to the extent and at the pace required will bring significant change to our economy and society,"" she noted. Official data shows that Scotland provides funding to accelerate transition to a net-zero economy, including a 1.8 billion pounds (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) investment in low carbon infrastructure, and more than 500 million (647.2 million dollars) to increase efforts responding to the global climate emergency. ""There are big benefits if we get it right, but there are risks if we get it wrong,"" she said. Demonstrating Britain's resolve to reduce emissions, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that the government plans to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2035, or earlier if possible.

"COP25","China","COP25_China47","Bottom-up efforts reignite hope for US federal climate action","December 20, 2019 Friday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) that recently took place in Madrid is supposed to prepare the ground for more ambitious national climate commitments. Nowhere is this more important than in the country where national leadership on climate change is least likely: The United States. But a new report should give the world hope that it\' s not too late to keep the US on a path in line with global aspirations to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. This will require continued leadership from US states, cities and businesses that are already stepping up, combined with reinvigorated action from the federal government. The US is the world\' s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and was the largest overall emitter for decades. Although China surpassed it in 2006, America\' s cumulative emissions remain unmatched. And yet, far from leading the way on climate action, the US under President Donald Trump\' s administration has rolled back many federal climate and environmental rules and formally indicated its intention to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement by late next year. \' We are all in\' Fortunately, the rest of the US is not following Trump\' s lead. Across the country, a massive coalition of states, cities, businesses, universities and others have declared that  We Are Still In. Despite the federal government\' s official withdrawal from the Paris agreement, they will take the necessary steps to fulfill America\' s climate commitments. This is no pie-in-the-sky declaration. The coalition\' s more than 3,800 participants (and counting) include states, cities and counties that account for 65 percent of the US population, nearly 70 percent of US GDP  equivalent to an economy larger than China\' s  and over half of US emissions. For example, 145 US cities have committed to 100 percent clean electricity, and six have already achieved it. But serious questions remain. How much progress can this coalition make to reduce emissions without the federal government\' s support? And how much better would the situation be if the US administration and Congress recommit to climate action? These are the questions that America\' s Pledge, a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative, has been working to answer over the last year. The conclusions are both reassuring and daunting. According to the initiative\' s just-released third report,  Accelerating America\' s Pledge (produced in collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Institute, the University of Maryland, and the World Resources Institute), stronger action by states, cities, and businesses could reduce US greenhouse-gas emissions by 37 percent (compared to 2005 levels) by 2030. In other words, even without the federal government, the US can drastically reduce emissions, improve air quality, and stimulate broad-based economic gains. Success would require an expanded coalition of non-federal actors to move quickly and ambitiously to transform energy and transportation systems, including by building on the innovative measures that US states, cities, and businesses are already taking. Beyond borders The impact of such a movement promises to extend beyond US borders, with bottom-up commitments in the country leveraged to increase climate ambition around the world. This is already starting to happen. For example, Alliances for Climate Action connects cities, states, the private sector, investors, universities and civil-society organizations in Argentina, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, the US and Vietnam, so that they can work with one another and with their national governments to spur climate action. But the role of the national government remains important. Despite the potential of bottom-up climate leadership, the fact remains that the results are much better when combined with top-down coordination and oversight. The America\' s Pledge report shows that aggressive US federal re-engagement on climate action  in the form of a comprehensive  all-in strategy  could reduce emissions by 49 percent by 2030, putting the country on track to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. So, despite three years of federal indifference, all hope for effective climate action in the US is not lost. But we cannot afford to rest easy. The needed transformation will require broad citizen mobilization, increased energy productivity, disruptive innovation, updated market structures, and forward-thinking investment. The US Congress and executive branch must take aggressive, quick action, placing climate change and the associated economic transformation at the top of the policy agenda. The rewards would be tremendous. Beyond environmental benefits, the changes outlined in the America\' s Pledge report, if designed well and implemented efficiently, could boost prosperity, lower consumer costs, and improve public health. By 2030, the economic transformation could deliver equal or better performance in electricity, vehicles and buildings compared to fossil-fuel technologies  and at a lower price. For example, it is already cheaper to shut down coal-fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar than it is to keep the plants online. In addition, the transition will create new job opportunities and the careers of the future, including in renewable energy, electric vehicle manufacturing, and sustainable forestry (among others). Recent analysis by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate shows that smart climate action can create global economic gains of US$26 trillion by 2030, as well as generating 65 million jobs. Non-federal US actors have laid a strong foundation for climate action, and they continue to drive progress. But to achieve the necessary transformation as quickly as required, more elected US officials and national leaders will need to step up. Jules Kortenhorst is CEO of the Rocky Mountain Institute.

"COP25","China","COP25_China48","Experts: Education should boost intl understanding","December 27, 2019 Friday","China Daily","By Kang Jia | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2019-12-27 16:07 Li Zilin, a nine-year-old student from Shandong province, speaks at an event on the sidelines at the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid on Dec 5. CHINA DAILY An international way of thinking and understanding is essential to settling conflicts and achieving win-win cooperation, said Wang Guangfa, founder of the Beijing Royal Charity Foundation and chairman of the Fazheng Group, in Beijing on Thursday. He made the remarks at a conference that saw the release of a report, co-written by the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), Beijing Royal Charity Foundation, and the Research Institute of International Education South-South Cooperation, which focused on the domestic practice of education for international understanding. Advocated by UNESCO in 1946, the concept of education for international understanding mainly aims to cultivate students' global consciousness and their ability to coexist with people from different cultural backgrounds, according to the report. In 2010, education for international understanding as a term first appeared in the nation's 10-year (2010-2020) plan for educational reform and development, the report said. Li Qing, a researcher for CCG, said international understanding is essential to build a community for the shared future of mankind. However, such an educational prospective remains quite unknown and may face many problems in terms of practice. Gao Shuguo, a senior researcher for CCG, observed that the mainstream of overseas studies in China is to pursue a higher degree, while all-around development for better international understanding is often neglected. China also lacks a uniform standard of teaching when the concept is put into practice, noted Liu Ying, vice-secretary of the Beijing Royal Charity Foundation. Many schools boost students' international understanding mainly through integrating such knowledge in textbooks or organize academic visits overseas, she said. The experts called for more public attention and more efforts from society to boost international understanding among students. \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China49","Roundup: The Netherlands seeks leading role in Europe's climate change action","September 2, 2019 Monday 9:41 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Maria Vasileiou THE HAGUE, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- With climate change concerns growing, the Netherlands has stepped up efforts to advance climate action within the European Union (EU), aiming to make the EU climate neutral by 2050, in close cooperation with like-minded European countries. ""Strengthening climate protection is a high priority for the Dutch government, which aims to achieve a sharp reduction of greenhouse gas emissions within the national context, but also on EU level in cooperation with other European member states,"" said Paul Hofhuis, senior research associate at the Netherlands International Relations Institute, Clingendael. ""The Netherlands wants to raise the European target for 2030 to reduce emissions by 40 percent to 55 percent, in line with its ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. For this it seeks to lead a group of like-minded EU countries,"" the expert on sustainable development at the Hague-based institute told Xinhua. Since Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called upon the EU to revise its collective carbon target up to 55 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 last year, he has been working hard to convince not only Germany, but also France, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Finland and other European countries, to join this ambition, said Hofhuis. Until recently, Germany seemed reserved to share the Dutch plans, but following a meeting in the Hague late last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Rutte announced their intention to cooperate closer to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 at EU level. ""Together with Germany, the Netherlands can play a significant role in boosting Europe's climate ambitions and take a lead in the worldwide climate discussions,"" said Hofhuis. The Dutch-German joint meeting took place a month ahead of the 2019 United Nations (UN) Climate Action Summit on Sept. 21-23 in New York. An important driver for the discussion within the EU is the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Conference of the Parties ( COP-25 ) from Dec. 2 to 13 in Santiago, Chile. ""Like in Paris in 2015, it is important that EU member states show in Santiago that there is agreement on very ambitious climate change targets and the Netherlands will continue taking a strong position in the ongoing discussions in Brussels,"" said Hofhuis. European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has also pledged to turn the EU carbon neutral by 2050. Von der Leyen, scheduled to meet Rutte here on Tuesday to discuss the future agenda of the new European Commission, has also made it a priority to deliver a European Green Deal to reduce the block's emissions and act on the continent's deep decarbonization. ""Von der Leyen made a strong case that she would be in favour of climate neutrality by 2050 and of cutting emissions by 55 percent in 2030,"" said Hofhuis. ""But there is still a battle going on within the EU about the 2050 and the 2030 targets with objections coming mainly from Eastern European states."" Currently, the EU's commitment under the United Nations Paris Agreement set to limit global warming to ""well below 2 degrees Celsius"" is aimed at reducing the continent's greenhouse gas by 40 percent by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Adopting a climate neutrality target by 2050 has been met with opposition mainly from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Poland. The Dutch reached agreement on a national climate plan to reduce greenhouse gases by 49 percent by 2030 in June this year, while Germany is set to make key decisions on Sept. 20. Germany is lagging behind its goal of reducing greenhouse emissions by 40 percent by 2020. So far, the EU's largest economy has reduced emissions by 32 percent since 1990. The Netherlands is also a long way from reaching its goals, having reduced its greenhouse emissions by around 14.5 percent since 1990. At the same time the government faces the challenge of winning the support of the Parliament on the ambitious national Climate Agreement in the following months. ""The Parliament has to approve the plan and over the next months it will become clear how strong and how wide the support will be,"" said Hofhuis. The Dutch package, a more than 200 pages long agreement, spells out a wide range of concrete actions, including making electricity production in the country 100 percent carbon neutral in 2050 and generate 70 percent of energy from wind and solar power by 2030. ""The discussion in Parliament on these issues is very crucial for Prime Minister Rutte's climate ambition, if he is to push forward his goals on an EU level,"" said Hofhuis. ""If he cannot achieve his ambition domestically, he will meet objections ... in gaining support to reduce greenhouse emissions by 55% at the EU level."" Enditem \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China50","Young Chinese spread climate change message","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","China Daily European Edition","Thousands of people of all ages filled the streets of Madrid early this month, marching amid the flashing blue and red lights of police cars, chanting slogans and holding placards or flags. Some of the protesters in the Spanish capital sang and danced, accompanied by lively music. Sitting on his father's shoulders, one small boy, who was among the youngest in the crowd, wore a white T-shirt with a slogan on the back stating, ""Never too small to make a difference."" These scenes on Dec 6, during the United Nations climate change conference , were just one of the latest reminders of the push being made by NGOs worldwide for enhanced action on the issue. Chinese delegates attending the conference, especially the younger ones, faced question about what they had been doing at home to address global climate change. The conference, also known as COP25 for the conference of the parties that signed the Paris climate agreement, had been scheduled to end on Friday. But heated discussions over differences delayed the closure until Sunday. The event was not only attended by diplomats from nearly 200 countries, but also by NGOs from across the globe. Delegates wearing exotic costumes, including members of Amazonian tribes and people from Pacific island nations, appeared at the venue, the Madrid IFEMA Convention Center. Although they wore no special costumes, two 9-year-olds from China stood out amid the thousands at the bustling center. Chen Hetu, a boy, and Li Zilin, a girl just three months older than him, were among the youngest speakers on the event's sidelines. On Dec 5, Li, who comes from Sichuan province, the major habitat of the giant panda, delivered a speech on climate change and animal protection. She told her audience that in the next 80 years pandas may have to move to higher altitudes with lower temperatures in search of certain varieties of bamboo if global warming continues at the present rate. ""Let's stand together with the panda. Let's unite to combat climate change,"" Li said. The two primary school students joined hundreds of NGO representatives from China for the 9,000-kilometer trip to Spain to attend the conference, a stark contrast to just seven more than 10 years ago. Wang Xiangyi, deputy secretary-general of the China Association for NGO Cooperation who has observed the annual climate gathering for 12 years, said she thought representatives from Chinese NGOs first attended in 2007, when COP 13 was held in Bali, Indonesia. She said just seven Chinese from the nongovernment sector were at the event, including only three from local NGOs. The others were a journalist and a college student, while the remaining two worked for branches of international NGOs in China. Wang said their attendance attracted a lot of attention and they were interviewed by many journalists, some of whom said they did not know that Chinese NGOs were working on climate change issues. ""When Sha Zukang (former UN deputy secretary-general for economic and social affairs) saw us, he came to talk with us and asked to have a group photo taken,"" she said. Wang added that since 2007, the development of climate-related NGOs in China has boomed. When her association launched the China Civil Climate Action Network that year, the latter only had about 10 local climate-related NGOs. Now, the number has risen to 33. She said some Chinese NGOs are actively promoting projects that could help with climate change mitigation and adaptation, without knowing that these ventures are climate-related. ""There are many such cases,"" she said, citing the example of a local NGO in Yunnan province which thought its project to help farmers adapt to frequent droughts by promoting new crop species with fresh planting methods was solely an agricultural program. Chinese NGOs gained access to the UN climate change conference through their international counterparts, which held observer status for the event. Wang's association was granted such status in 2011, but there are only about 10 Chinese local NGOs that are observers, she said. Among the representatives from Chinese NGOs this year, the younger generation stood out by taking part in a range of events on the sidelines. They not only delivered speeches, but also held news conferences and joined their foreign counterparts in joint declarations on climate action. On Thursday, they, together with some international students, staged a fashion show, featuring costumes made from recycled materials to promote a low-carbon lifestyle. Back home, instead of taking the approach adopted by Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden, to motivate students to boycott classes in pursuit of enhanced action, young Chinese, motivated by local NGOs, are joining more ""classes"" with a climate-change theme. For example, Wang Zekai, who launched the NGO Youthink Center in 2009, has been promoting online classes, hoping to ""transform youth into low-carbon talent that not only thinks low-carbon is important, but will also take action and be capable of influencing people around them"". He said the online climate-themed classes attracted 500,000 young Chinese last year. Students who complete the course receive e-certificates and are encouraged to share what they learn via social media to attract increased participation in the program from NGOs. In one of the latest online classes, for example, Youthink Center will share with young participants the journey made by a Syrian girl to attend this year's UN event in Madrid. She had to take a taxi from her war-torn homeland to Jordan before flying to Spain. Participants in the program are also encouraged to make online pledges on living a low-carbon lifestyle. ""We offer them a series of choices. Some are as simple as taking public transportation. They can also make a promise to work in green industries after they graduate. With a range of interesting online activities and interaction, we want to mobilize the participation of young people,"" Wang Zekai said. The project also includes a competition on climate action plans, with the winner qualifying for a sponsored trip to the UN climate change conference. Wang Zekai said he expects the number of participants in the project to surpass 100,000 this year. There are plans to expand the project to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region by recruiting 200,000 volunteers to help mobilize 1 million young participants. Meanwhile, the China Youth Climate Action Network has launched a two-year project named 2030 Climate Change +. Every year it will choose 20 teams from across the country. In addition to offering training, half the teams will be provided with financial support to conduct yearlong climate-related field research, according to the network. The NGO will organize three cross-sector joint learning teams, who will publish at least 50 climate-themed papers written from the perspective of young people to help spread climate knowledge. Zhang Haoran, 24, who works with the network, said, ""Media exposure is a major part of the project to help promote it, with the aim of involving government, enterprises, the public and think tanks."" While motivating the teams that are chosen to contact government bodies and businesses in their field research, it is expected that the in-depth climate-themed articles published by these young people will further encourage stronger action, Zhang said. The program has a target of getting at least 10 local governments to carry out ""more ambitious actions"" in their jurisdictions, according to the network. Zhang said lectures have been organized at 10 universities nationwide to mobilize the participation of students in the project. The lectures have been attended by more than 2,000 students. The students do not usually have access to officials and may not know how to make their acquaintance. As part of the lectures, or closed-door seminars held in conjunction with them, they will learn how to communicate with officials, in addition to climate-related knowledge. Zheng Xiaowen, 28, head of the China Youth Climate Action Network, said the NGO, which was established in 2007, has been organizing young Chinese to take part in UN climate change conferences since 2008. It hopes they can develop instructive ideas on what they can do in their home country by communicating with their counterparts from overseas. Since 2007, the network has also been promoting energy conservation at universities. Previously, it mainly motivated students in leading low-carbon lifestyles or in calculating carbon emissions at their universities, Zheng said. She added that more than 500 Chinese universities have taken part in activities organized or sponsored by her NGO, involving at least 100,000 young people. The network plans to introduce a new strategy in promoting the campus project by persuading university executives to launch energy-conservation initiatives at management level. Guo Hongyu, 31, has attended UN climate change conferences since 2015. She joined Greenovation Hub, an NGO focused on policy analysis and research, two years earlier. She said that while Chinese NGOs could help promote the concept of climate change, they have yet to adequately play such a role and need to step up their efforts. Li Xiajie, deputy director of the International Department at the China Association for NGO Cooperation, said Chinese NGOs urgently need to better explain the efforts they have made on climate change to people around the world. They also need to increase their efforts to conduct work in a way that can be clearly understood and accepted by the international community. Joel Naoki Ernesto Christoph, a French student who has been studying at Tsinghua University for four months, said Chinese society is now speaking out more on climate change. ""Different countries have different ways of expressing their concerns about the challenges of climate change. If we look at what's happening in universities and also in the private sector (in China), there's a lot going on,"" he said.

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said he had taken the  painful decision to cancel the summit in Santiago, as well as a high-profile international gathering on climate change in December, to focus on restoring law and order and pushing through a new social plan. Riots, arson and protests over inequality this month have left at least 18 people dead, 7,000 arrested and Chilean businesses hit with losses of around US$1.4 billion. The metro public transport system in the capital suffered nearly US$400 million in damages. The APEC summit was scheduled to bring together 20 world leaders, including US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, on November 16-17. Chile\' s cancellation of the trade summit caught the Trump administration by surprise, a White House official told Reuters. The official said Washington learned about the decision from news reports and is seeking more information. Chile will also not be able to host the COP25 global climate summit between December 2 and December 13, said Pinera, who fired almost half his cabinet this week, including his finance, interior and economy ministers, in a bid to quell the protests, to little effect. The climate summit would have brought delegates from around 190 nations to talks aimed at thrashing out details of how to reduce global emissions to meet the Paris climate agreement. The cancellations are a further blow to Chile\' s image as one of the most stable countries in Latin America.  This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP-25 for Chile and for the world, Pinera said in a brief statement from La Moneda presidential palace. He said Chile was  deeply sorry for the problems and inconveniences that this decision will mean for both APEC and the COP.

"COP25","China","COP25_China52","Roundup: Officials call on int'l community not to give up on climate talks","December 17, 2019 Tuesday 9:02 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The international community should not give up on climate talks although the latest United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) ended with no deal on key issues, officials have said. The COP25 came to an end on Sunday after an unprecedentedly long extension, yet negotiators failed to reach an agreement on Article 6 of 2015 Paris Agreement about the details of carbon market mechanisms. The negotiations were scheduled to end on Friday but continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning. With over 40 hours of extension, it was the longest COP in history, which was quite usual to be extended due to intense discussions. In a statement released Sunday on the UN website, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he was ""disappointed"" at the results of the COP25 . ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" said Guterres. ""But we must not give up and I will not give up,"" he said. ""I am more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise,"" he said. Speaking at a press conference in New York on Monday, Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Guterres, said the UN will not consider giving up on the Paris Agreement or any other deals already reached. The Paris Agreement is clear in its scope. The problem behind the outcome of this year's COP25 is that the negotiators were unable to reach a consensus, he said. Carolina Schmidt, chairwoman of the COP25 and the environment minister of Chile, said Sunday that the meeting was not a complete loss and some ""concrete progress"" overall had been made. At a press briefing on Monday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said China regretted that negotiators failed to reach an agreement on core issues. ""To deal with climate change, the urgent task is to uphold multilateralism,"" Geng said, ""and to implement the Paris Agreement on the basis of equity and in accordance with all parties' common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities."" Geng said China would continue to push for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, improve the global climate governance system so that it is fair, equitable and mutually beneficial, and contribute to building a community with a shared future for humankind.

""China's contribution is significant because they have developed models and vehicles with good features and of good quality, and they are also lowering the prices,"" Chile's Minister of Transportation and Communications Gloria Hutt told Xinhua News Agency. In late 2017, the Chilean government published a National Electromobility Strategy, which outlined actions to ensure that 40 percent of private vehicles and 100 percent of public transport vehicles would be electric by 2050. Chinese buses have found a promising market in Chile, as the country is striving for its electric mobility and sustainability targets, said Hutt, adding that another 83 BYD buses will be arriving in Chile in two weeks. BYD and other Chinese brands have made solid contributions to the electric technology market, where ""China is an undisputed leader"", said Berrios. The new buses will run along Santiago's main east-west thoroughfare Grecia Avenue, which will become Latin America's first ""electric corridor"" for public transportation. The Chilean government plans to have at least 2,000 electric buses circulating in Santiago by the end of 2020, with 300 to 500 buses serving surrounding communities.

"COP25","China","COP25_China62","Cool, calm and collected","January 16, 2020 Thursday","China Daily European Edition","The 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which officially concluded in Madrid on Dec 15, 2019, was obviously not as fruitful as people hoped. Three important areas where consensus was lacking are: the parties' increased emissions reduction ambitions, the establishment of trading rules for international carbon markets and long-term climate finance support. COP25 was to promote more ambitious emissions cuts. However, Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States all rejected this proposal. Only the European Union finally agreed to net zero emissions by 2050. China has fully demonstrated its determination to tackle climate change. Pledging that by 2020, the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 40 percent to 45 percent compared with 2005, the proportion of non-fossil energy in primary energy consumption will be about 15 percent, and the forest area and storage volume will be increased by 40 million hectares and 1.3 billion cubic meters respectively compared with 2005. Such specific targets are clearly stated, not only in the intended nationally determined contributions submitted by the Chinese government to the United Nations, but also as part of the core content of China's National Climate Change Plan (2014-20), reflecting the importance the Chinese government places on its emissions reduction commitments. According to the 2019 Annual Report on China's Policies and Actions on Climate Change, China's carbon intensity dropped by 4 percent in 2018, down 45.8 percent compared with 2005. China has fulfilled its 2020 carbon intensity control target ahead of schedule, and it is expected to fulfill its 2030 intended nationally determined contribution ahead of schedule, thus setting a benchmark for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. China has made concrete efforts, adjusting its industrial structure, saving energy and improving efficiency, optimizing its energy structure, controlling greenhouse gas emissions from non-energy activities, and increasing its carbon sink, among other things. China has worked hard to reduce the overcapacity in steel, coal and power generation industries, developed the service sector and supported the development of strategic emerging and less energy intensive industries. China's tertiary industry now accounts for more than half of its GDP. Industrial restructuring is making a big contribution to China's low-carbon and clean development. China has promoted energy conservation in construction, transportation and renovation projects. Green building standards have been implemented in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The implementation of ultra-low emissions and energy-saving retrofitting projects for thermal power units has also been progressing steadily. China has been heavily subsidizing the renewable industry. In 2018, coal accounted for about 59 percent of its total energy consumption, down 1.4 percent year-on-year. The conversion and storage capacity of wind and solar power have been quickly improved with a more competitive economic cost. At the same time, as coal is still the main energy source in China, the clean use of coal is also the focus, including the cleaning-up and efficiency improvement of the whole industrial chain. In addition, due to the substantial reduction in the cost of renewable energy generation, the main obstacle in the development of new energy has changed, and the focus of the difficulty in the future development is infrastructure construction. The greenhouse gas emissions from non-energy activities have also been controlled and reduced. China is committed to promoting the destruction of hydro fluorocarbons (HFCS), strictly controlling cement production capacity and implementing green manufacturing projects. In agriculture the comprehensive utilization rate of fertilizer and straw comprehensive utilization level have been improved. China has also increased its carbon sink by pushing ahead with land carbon sequestration projects, including forest, grassland and wetland carbon sequestration. At present, China's forest coverage rate is about 23 percent, and its forest stock is about 17.6 billion cubic meters, making it the largest contributor of green area in the world. To sum up, China has figured out its basic strategy and made a variety of efforts to address climate change. At the COP25 conference, China appealed to reviewing the intended nationally determined contributions in 2020, providing support to developing countries, identifying the gaps existing between the reality and intended national determined contributions, and preventing transfer of social responsibility to developing countries in the next round of commitments. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202001/16/5e1fa9a9a310a2fa8bc91145.png Link to Image MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY \~ \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202001/16/5e1fa9a9a310a2fa8bc91148.png Link to Image \~ \~ \"

The UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) came to an end on Sunday after an unprecedentedly long extension, as negotiators failed to reach an agreement on Article 6 of 2015 Paris Agreement about the details of carbon market mechanisms. (Xinhua/Lu Yang) MADRID, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- The UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) came to an end on Sunday after an unprecedentedly long extension, as negotiators failed to reach an agreement on Article 6 of 2015 Paris Agreement about the details of the carbon market mechanisms. The negotiations were scheduled to end on Friday but continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning. With over 40 hours of extension, it was the longest COP in history, which was quite usual to be extended due to intense discussions. MARKET MECHANISMS ""We had so many talks till so late, without sleeping all night,"" said Carolina Schmidt, chairwoman of the COP25 and the environment minister of Chile, at the closing plenary of the conference that ended Sunday afternoon. Over the past two weeks, delegates from almost 200 countries focused on Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is about some technical details of the implementation of the deal in building the market mechanisms, especially the global carbon market. ""We want to close Article 6... which will generate resources to bring about projects, and the projects would allow us to move toward sustainable development... The Mechanisms contribute to helping us to move forward,"" said Schmidt. ""Clearly it is said to reach the agreement, but we were so very close. I thank you for your efforts, the long hours and achieving agreement we were on the edge. We have concrete progress on concrete texts to allow us to look ahead with hope,"" according to Schmidt. At the closing plenary, delegates from most countries express their regret or frustration of failing to achieve the agreement on Article 6. The work will be left for further discussion on the next congress COP26, which is scheduled to be held in Glasgow next year. CHINESE EFFORTS In a statement issued after the closing plenary, the Chinese delegation said China played a positive and constructive role during the event. Although the agreement about Article 6 was not reached, China will promote that all parties concerned to reach the consensus as soon as possible. ""The results of the congress are below our expectations, especially that the core issue, talks over the implementation details of Article 6, had reached only a procedural conclusion. I believe that all of us feel regretful, and it cannot match our efforts,"" said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation and vice minister of the Ecology and Environment, at the closing plenary on behalf of the so-called BASIC countries -- China, Brazil, India and South Africa. Zhao also noted that the BASIC countries felt disappointed that developed countries did not answer developing countries' demand for finance. The four countries also expressed regret over the arrangement of pre-2020 implementation and ambition. He urged developed countries to take effective actions to fill the gap of emission cut and the support to developing countries. Zhao said China will work with other parties to address the ""last mile"" of the implementation of Paris Agreement and carry out South-South cooperation on climate change. Participating countries also had differences in the ambitions of addressing climate change, as some countries want to have more ambitious goals, but others want to stick to the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement. Negotiators took stock of actions and implementation addressing climate change in the pre-2020 period. Climate change adaptation, finance, technological transfers and capacity building have also been discussed. TIME FOR ACTION Among the adopted documents include the ""Chile-Madrid Time for Action"" agreement that lays the groundwork for countries to present more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020 in response to the climate emergency. It expresses the ""urgent need"" for these new commitments by countries to bridge the existing gap with the Paris Agreement target of avoiding a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to a statement issued by the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition, COP25 reaffirms the value of multilateralism and international cooperation to solve a global challenge such as climate change. ""Even in complex global contexts, COP25 did not drop the climate agenda in a crucial time for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. On the contrary, it has shown an activist multilateralism,"" said Spanish environment minister Teresa Ribera. The conference shifted from Chile to Spain at the last minute due to unrest in Chile's capital Santiago. Over 26,000 people came to the Spanish capital for the event, including people from NGOs, private sectors and multilateral institutions who promoted global cooperation for addressing climate change, while many climate activists held multiple protests outside the congress venue and in downtown Madrid. \"

China has seen a boom in the number of climate-related NGOs in the past decade, according to Wang Xiangyi, deputy secretary-general of the China Association for NGO Cooperation. When her association launched the China Civil Climate Action Network in 2007, it only had 10 local NGOs. The number has since increased to 33, she said. She also said there are still many Chinese NGOs who don't know their ventures are climate-related, although they have been actively promoting projects that could help with climate change mitigation and adaptation. Wang cited planting of drought resistant crops as an example, which had a side benefit of mitigating climate change. Many Chinese NGOs participated in this year's United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, held from Dec 2 to 15, to share their stories. One of them was the Yunnan Green Environment Development Foundation, which is based in Kunming, Yunnan province. Though the foundation is only a grassroots NGO with 12 employees, it has been carrying out climate-related projects for more than a decade. Jia Yuan from the foundation said among its achievements was the promotion of 47,000 methane-generating pits in 37 villages from 2008-2015 to discourage locals' reliance on wood for cooking. They had also promoted the use of solar-energy powered street lamps and water heaters, as well as energy-saving stoves. Environmental protection awareness classes had also been run, and from May to October a low-carbon program was extended to a Laotian village with over 400 people. But very little of the good work on climate change had been publicized to the outside world, insiders said. Guo Hongyu, who works with Greenovation Hub, an NGO focused on policy analysis and research, said China had done a lot on climate mitigation and adaptation. However, a great deal of that work was not known by the outside world. Chinese NGOs needed to play a stronger role in publicizing their achievements, she said. Li Xiajie, deputy director of the International Department at the China Association for NGO Cooperation, echoed Guo's assessment. ""They (Chinese NGOs) also need to beef up their capability in conducting climate-related work in a way that can be clearly understood and accepted by the international community,"" she said. \"

Commissioner Frans Timmermans said in October that research would soon begin on a so-called Carbon Border Adjustment, a tax to protect European firms from unfair competition by raising the cost of products imported from countries with inadequate climate action, Reuters reported. Timmermans is the European Commission's executive vice-president-designate for the European Green Deal. The tax is intended to shelter EU businesses striving to meet a goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. Lu is also deputy secretary-general of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, Spain. Opening on Dec 2, the climate conference will last till Dec 13. ""These unilateral acts will seriously undermine the international community's willingness and confidence to cope with climate change. Eventually, they will affect the collective efforts of the world in addressing climate challenge,"" he said. China will firmly send out strong signals to support multilateralism, he added. He Jiankun, chairman of a committee of Tsinghua University's Institute for Climate Change and Sustainable Development, warned that the unilateral action of EU may cast ""inestimable influences"". ""Now we are upholding and implementing the Paris agreement, which includes a bottom-up architecture and a mechanism that each country determines their contributions to promote reduction of carbon emissions,"" he said. He also said rolling out such a unilateral measure could affect the friendly atmosphere of countries working collectively to promote global climate progress. Ahead of this week's formal presentation of Nobel Prizes, laureates gathered in Stockholm also stressed the importance of involvement of multiple countries in tackling climate change. Esther Duflo, one of the economics laureates, cautioned that dealing with climate change ""will require a change in behavior, particularly in the rich countries"" that are heavy consumers of goods and energy. Zhao Yingmin, Chinese vice-minister of ecology and environment told a news conference late last month in Beijing that China would continue to play a constructive role, safeguard multilateralism, and do its best to promote the success of this year's UN climate conference.

Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said Pinera telephoned Guterres earlier in the day to tell him that Chile, beleaguered by nearly two weeks of deadly anti-government demonstrations, would be unable to host the COP25 on Dec. 2-13 in its capital Santiago. ""He (Guterres) was informed first-hand about the reasoning that they cannot provide the venue,"" Haq told correspondents at a regular briefing. ""The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is now trying to see what alternative arrangements can be made at this time,"" he said. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UNFCCC based in Bonn, Germany, said in a statement that she was informed of the ""decision by the government of Chile not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing."" Haq said the host and the venue do not have to be in the same location. There has been speculation that the conference might be held at the UN headquarters in New York. However, Haq refused to speculate. ""The UNFCCC will be in dialogue to see what the best arrangements can be,"" he said. Pinera announced earlier on Wednesday that his country would also cancel the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in mid-November, citing the need to focus on the social crisis in the country. At least 20 deaths have been reported in the nearly two weeks of demonstrations in Chile, which started over a subway fare hike. Enditem \"

The COP25 , which shifted from Chile to Spain at the last minute, kicked off on Dec. 2 and was scheduled to end on Friday. But negotiations lasted overnight from Friday to Saturday, and the closing plenary was rescheduled from midnight to Saturday afternoon. ""We are working hard to come to an end"", Andres Landerretche, Coordinator of COP25 Presidency, said in a press briefing on Friday evening, ""we are making the utmost effort to sort out the issue"". Landerretche referred to Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is about the implementation of the market mechanisms, the design of the carbon emission markets in particular. Negotiators still had some differences in technical details concerning carbon markets, and they have to continue to discuss it on Saturday. Landerretche said the congress may reach a general agreement and leave some details to the next congress in Glasgow next year. Negotiators also have different opinions on the wording of the draft final text of the congress, which must take into consideration the stances of all of the almost 200 countries. Li Shuo, an observer of the congress and senior global policy advisor of Greenpeace East Asia, told Xinhua that the participating countries have differences on the ambitions of addressing climate change, as some countries want to have more ambitious goals but others want to stick to the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement. In addition, negotiators disagree with each other on the balance of the work addressing climate change, including climate change mitigation, adaptation and the support of the developing countries in doing so. Many developing countries complained that developed countries failed to give enough support to them to address the global common challenge. However, according to experiences in the past, it was normal that the congress has been extended. NGOs and climate activists held multiple protests outside the congress venue to express their frustration at the slow pace of the negotiations. Enditem \"

"COP25","China","COP25_China71","'People power' reminds climate change delegates of impatience on the streets","November 30, 2019 Saturday","China Daily","BARCELONA - As young people took to the streets around the world again on Friday urging more action to curb climate change, analysts warn that the United Nations climate conference taking place over the coming two weeks will likely fall short of their expectations. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has inspired a global movement of children who skip school on Fridays to hold marches and rallies demanding politicians treat climate change as an ""emergency"" and boost efforts to reduce planetwarming emissions. On Friday, groups of young people in the United States were planning a ""Black Friday Strike"", from Los Angeles to New York, to boycott the celebration of consumer discount shopping and to advocate for ""a change to business-as-usual to confront the climate crisis"". About six in 10 Americans say they are at least ""somewhat worried"" about global warming and 23 percent say they are ""very worried"", according to a survey conducted by Yale and George Mason universities in March and April. Andrew Steer, who heads the US-based World Resources Institute, noted the rise of ""people power"" over the past year, with more than 7 million turning out for protests in September as the UN chief convened a summit to drive climate action. ""The issue is rising on the agenda, both in the US and globally,"" Steer told journalists ahead of the Dec 2-13 UN talks in Madrid, known as COP25 . In Britain and the US, political contenders have taken part in public debates on climate change ahead of planned elections. Meanwhile, a growing number of governments at national and city level are declaring ""climate emergencies"", joined on Thursday by the European Parliament. Others, including small-island developing states and some Latin American and African countries, have pledged to work on cutting their emissions to net-zero by the middle of the century. But ahead of COP25 Former Costa Rica climate negotiator Monica Araya said the ""very best"" that could be expected from COP25 was ""a promise"" that countries would upgrade their national climate action plans by the end of 2020, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement. But that outcome would likely seem out of step with the ""more angry, urgent moral narrative"" shaped by youth-led popular climate strikes around the world since 2018, she noted. ""Now more than ever in this COP, we will see a very big gap between the negotiations inside and the emotions outside,"" said Araya, founder of clean development platform Costa Rica Limpia. Ahead of the Madrid talks, Spain's Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the meeting should mark ""the start of a decisive year for climate ambition"". It needed to lay the foundation for countries in 2020 to commit to cut emissions more steeply, as scientists advise, with the aim of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 C, the lower goal set in the Paris accord, she said. ""This is what societies are demanding,"" Ribera said, noting that efforts would be made to ""try to ensure that the demands by young people to raise climate ambition echo throughout COP25 "".

"COP25","China","COP25_China72","Nation playing crucial role on climate change","December 16, 2019 Monday","China Daily","By WANG MINGJIE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2019-12-16 10:09 A protester makes a point at a Greenpeace climate demonstration at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands on Saturday. PIROSCHKA VAN DE WOUW/REUTERS Editor's note: In ""Footprint"", a series of stories recalling important examples of China interacting with the rest of the world, we follow the country's path over the past seven decades. This is part of the series. In Australia, many areas have experienced devastating bush fires that have already left six people dead and destroyed hundreds of properties. Elsewhere, vast tracts of land have been shrouded in smoke, with flames burning huge swaths of forests in the US state of California and in Greece, Spain, Russia, France, Indonesia and some African nations. While scientists cannot attribute any single fire directly to climate change, it is clear that the extent and severity of wildfires in recent years are closely linked to global warming. Stefan H. Doerr, professor of geography at Swansea University in Wales and editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Wildland Fire, said: ""Climate change has increased the probability of extreme fires in many parts of the world. Simply, the frequency of these extreme conditions and their magnitude is increasing due to climate change. ""We are now seeing fire behaviors that we really have not seen so extensively in recent years,"" Doerr said. ""In many places, fires are becoming larger and more destructive."" Man-made global warming has also led to rising sea levels, intense hurricanes and strong storms. According to a report from the charity Save the Children, ""climate shocks"" are threatening 33 million people in East and Southern Africa with cyclones and droughts. Climate change is now regarded as one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and the key to addressing the issue is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A goal to keep global warming to below 2 C was agreed by the participating countries at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, at which China was widely seen as a major player in concluding the accord. Anthony Cox, deputy director of environment at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, said, ""This was the first time that China had really put its huge power behind the goal of climate change."" On Nov 30, 2015, President Xi Jinping put forward China's position on addressing global climate change challenges at the 21st Conference of the Parties, also known as COP21, in Paris. He pledged to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and to raise the share of non-fossil fuels to 20 percent in primary energy consumption. Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, European Commission spokeswoman on climate change, said China's commitments in the French capital were ""absolutely vital"" to the Paris agreement and inspired other nations to follow suit. ""In international climate diplomacy as well as climate action globally, China plays an absolutely crucial role, and this is one of the reasons the European Union has sided with China. For us, it's very important to have China as a partner in our climate action work,"" she said. The country has come a long way to play a leading role in global climate change cooperation. It was not until the early 1980s that environmental protection became a basic Chinese government policy. Since then, significant efforts have been made in working toward climate change mitigation and promoting energy conservation. During a meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1991, China was opposed to the idea of targets, and supported a general framework convention with no specific responsibilities. Ksenia Chmutina, a senior lecturer at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom, said in a report titled China's Participation in Global Climate Change Cooperation that from the 1980s to the post-Kyoto era, China has been successful in establishing a unified front for developing countries in order to resist any singling out of such nations' commitments by developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol, reached in the Japanese city in 1997, set specific emissions reduction targets for each industrialized nation. More than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the treaty. Pan Jiahua, director of the Institute for Urban and Environmental Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said, ""The Kyoto Protocol did not bring any real pressure on China after it came into effect, but it did have a huge impact on China's future climate negotiations."" At the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, China expressed quiet satisfaction at the outcome of the talks, which clarified the obligations of developed and developing countries and actions they should take according to the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"". China's efforts on global climate mitigation negotiations hit the headlines at the 2015 World Climate Change Conference in Paris, where the country was hailed as a ""constructive shaper"" of the process. Cox, from the OECD, who attended the meeting, said, ""The mood at the whole conference was one of tremendous optimism  and the fact that China came on board and showed leadership, I think had a very unifying effect on the conference."" By playing a more active role in global efforts to mitigate climate change, experts believe China has much to gain and little to lose. Karl Hallding, senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute in Sweden, said, ""A growing global focus on low-carbon economic development provides opportunities for China to gain competitiveness, international reputation and environmental benefits, at the same time as it lays the foundation for more-balanced economic and social development."" While Xi's speech in Paris was important in reaffirming China's commitment to what became the Paris process, the key step was the joint statement made by him and United States president Barack Obama in Beijing on Nov 12, 2014, where both countries asserted that climate change is ""one of the greatest threats facing humanity"" and committed to their national targets. However, on becoming US President, Donald Trump reversed his predecessor's policy toward climate change. On June 1, 2017, Trump announced that the US would cease all participation in the 2015 Paris agreement, claiming the Paris climate accord, which has been signed by more than 190 countries, would hurt the US economy with job losses. Despite US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi attending the UN Climate Change summit, also known as COP25 , in Madrid this month, environmentalists want to see concrete steps being taken by the US government. Jean Su, energy director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Arizona, said in an interview with the BBC before the summit, ""While it's great that Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action. ""America remains the No 1 historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share,"" she said. With the US exiting the Paris agreement, the global community is looking to China to help fill the leadership gap in international climate politics. Despite being the largest emitter in the world, the country is leading the way in developing renewable energy. It has more solar panels and wind turbines than any other country, and last year more electric vehicles were sold in China than in the rest of the world combined. Cox believes that China has a huge opportunity to lead the world in driving the transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient economy. ""A policy focus on harnessing the benefits from innovation will be essential to driving the structural changes and emissions reductions that will help achieve the global climate goals,"" he said. However, China's path toward a stronger economy that is less dependent on coal has never been straightforward, and the huge pressure to cut carbon emissions while maintaining stable economic growth could affect its battle against global warming. Last year, China's carbon emissions intensity\u-243 emissions per unit of GDP\u-243 fell by 45.8 percent compared with 2005, and it has already fulfilled its promise that by next year such intensity would fall by 40 to 45 percent compared with 2005. Given the overall positive trend, challenges still remain. According to Global Carbon Budget, which tracks carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, China's carbon emissions have risen in the past three years after falling for several years. Sharon George, a climate change expert at Keele University in the UK, said, ""China needs to act urgently if it is going to meet its commitments and reduce the use of coal-fired power production, which provides around three-quarters of its electricity."" While taking into consideration the historical differences between developed and developing countries, some academics argue that it would be unjust to seek to meet climate targets by restricting the development of nations such as China, where there is evidence of significant improvements in energy efficiency. Neil Hirst, a senior policy fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London, said that while still facing challenges in developing the economy and improving people's livelihoods, China has moved from heavy industry toward lighter-and-higher-value industries and services that are less energy intensive. He underlined that the nation has already achieved and far surpassed most of its climate targets to cut carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent between 2005 and next year, well ahead of schedule, adding, ""China's rapid economic growth has created room for big investments in solar and wind power, and electric vehicles."" Hirst, author of The Energy Conundrum: Climate Change, Global Prosperity, and the Tough Decisions We Have to Make, said he believes China can lead the way in showing how economic development and emissions reduction can work in tandem, and he expects that it will successfully implement its Paris commitments. The Paris agreement provided the foundation for emissions reductions, but at the COP25 meeting in Madrid this month and at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, next year, nations will need to come together to realize their ambitions. Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe, said, ""In 2015, it was China and the US that both got a lot of attention and credit, but in Glasgow if it really succeeds, I think China will be the one."" \"

"COP25","China","COP25_China74","Climate change vows urged to be honored","December 5, 2019 Thursday","China Daily European Edition","While vowing to maximize efforts in carbon emission reduction, China urged developed countries to close gaps in support committed to the Third World for their pre-2020 climate actions as delegates from almost 200 countries gather in Madrid for the United Nations climate change conference . ""The biggest problem in the current multilateral climate process is developed countries' lack of political will in offering support (to the developing countries),"" said Lu Xinming, deputy director of climate change in China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Developed countries had promised to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 for developing countries, a figure that was included in the landmark Paris agreement on climate change in 2015. Lu, who is also deputy secretary-general of the Chinese delegation, said, however, that many developed countries have labeled other financial support they offer as climate-related and have calculated that support as such. He said China is hopeful that the conference\u-243 which began on Monday and runs through Dec 13\u-243 will clearly specify the measures wealthier countries will take to honor their pre-2020 targets in reducing carbon emissions and to offer the support they pledged to developing countries. ""They should offer explicit plans to further close the gaps in support and ensure they won't transfer the responsibilities they should shoulder to developing countries after 2020,"" he noted. He also said the support should come from public funds in a transparent, predictable, sustainable and timely manner. With the annual $100 billion support offered before 2020 as a ""starting point"", developed countries should also hammer out a detailed road map and timetable for a new post-2020 target in its support to the Third World, he added. Sun Jin, special representative for climate change affairs of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said China will maximize its efforts to make the largest possible contribution in mitigating global warming. ""As a responsible developing major power, we are willing to shoulder the due international obligations. That is to say, as our capacity allows, we will make all-out efforts,"" Sun said. He said though the nation is currently the largest carbon emitter in the world because of the size of the country and also its development stage, China is also the largest contributor in carbon emission reduction. According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP last year in China was 45.8 percent lower than 2005 levels, achieving the nation's goal of decreasing carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent ahead of the 2020 deadline. The decline can be translated into a total emissions reduction of 5.26 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

""Let me make this very clear: What happens if we do nothing,"" Timmermans said. ""What happens if instead of 400,000 people a year dying prematurely every year in Europe because of poor air quality, it is a million?"" Timmermans asked. ""What will be the cost of inaction and in having more frequent natural disasters?"" he continued, making reference to the heavy rains this fall which caused damage worth millions of euros in southern and eastern Spain. The Dutch politician said it is ""very important"" to take action against climate change, adding that ""we can fix it"" by working together. Timmermans also expressed his hope that a growing number of people in the future would live a greener lifestyle, in an effort to protect the environment.

[Photo/Xinhua] Carbon credits can encourage nations to cooperate to realize emissions targets China will make all-out efforts and demonstrate the utmost sincerity to help reach consensus on some of the more technical details of the 2015 Paris agreement at the ongoing United Nations climate change conference in Madrid, a senior Chinese delegate said. Lu Xinming, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's deputy director-general for climate change, also said it will be a great pity if the conference fails to hammer out rules for market-based climate change mitigation mechanisms in Article 6 of the agreement. Though last year's UN climate change conference was tasked with setting rules for the Paris agreement's implementation, which will occur after 2020, parties failed to reach consensus on the little-known and highly technical section. ""To put the finishing touches on the detailed rules for the implementation of the Paris agreement concerns the effectiveness of multilateralism,"" Lu said. Mechanisms laid out in the section allow parties to realize greenhouse gas emissions targets through cooperation. One of them establishes a global market for trading polluting carbon emissions, through which richer countries can buy emission credits from other countries' programs. Lu said there are still disputes among parties over the core issues related to Article 6. ""Based on the current situation, there is the possibility that parties may fail to address differences in time,"" he said. One of the key concerns for some developing countries is whether unsold carbon credits under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol will be able to be transferred to the new Paris agreement mechanisms and how that could be done. ""That is to say, for the sake of the people, China, as a responsible major power, will maximize its efforts,"" he said. ""Its actions show its utmost sincerity on tackling climate change... We hope parties can reach consensus on the market mechanisms at the conference."" The mechanisms are the least expensive way to meet the world's targets for carbon emission reductions, he added. The international carbon-trading market will be vital to limiting the increase of global temperatures in future years, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the conference's opening ceremony on Monday. He also warned that failure to hammer out the guidelines for such a market at this year's conference might undermine overall efforts to mitigate climate change. ""To put a price on carbon is vital if we are to have any chance of limiting global temperature rise and avoiding runaway climate change,"" Guterres said. Successfully dealing with Article 6 will help markets get up and running, mobilize the private sector and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone. Failing to deal with the issue risks fragmenting carbon markets and would send a negative message that could undermine overall climate efforts, he said. ""I urge all parties to overcome their current divisions and find common understanding on this issue,"" Guterres said. \"

"COP25","China","COP25_China84","Official: Nation a key climate contributor","November 25, 2019 Monday","People's Daily Online - English","China has made significant contributions to global climate action with its dramatic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to reduce the cost of renewable energy. As a developing country, however, it will not help rich countries close the gap in the level of support they had pledged to the Third World, a senior environmental official said. Li Gao, director-general for climate change at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the comment ahead of the United Nations climate change conference , slated for Dec 2 to 13 in Madrid, Spain. Last year, China managed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 45.8 percent from 2005 levels, achieving its goal of reducing carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent ahead of the 2020 deadline, together with a reduced carbon dioxide equivalent of 5.2 billion metric tons, he said in a recent interview with China Daily. ""This is a huge contribution to the world in tackling climate change,"" he said. China has also made a marked contribution to the world by lowering the cost of new energy as it works to decarbonize energy consumption, he added. With 34 percent of the world's total installed capacity of renewable energy, China is responsible for 40 percent of the global growth in the sector. By the end of last year, the share of nonfossil fuels in the country's primary energy consumption had increased to 14.3 percent. ""China has outpaced all other countries with its investment in renewable energy in the past seven years or so,"" Li said. He said the development of the country's renewable energy industry could be of much greater significance than what many countries have realized. ""Thanks to the development of the sector, China has managed to bring down the cost of renewable energy worldwide, which has created favorable conditions for its further application. ... The applications will also further fuel the development of relevant technologies,"" he said. Despite the contributions, however, Li dismissed the call of some foreign politicians, who say China should contribute as a developed nation, not a developing one, to global climate action. That call had come on the backdrop of rich countries' failure to fulfill their financial support commitments to poor countries. Developed countries had promised to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 for developing countries, a figure that was included in the Paris agreement on climate change. ""Some statistics show that financial support from developed nations has reached about $60 billion a year,"" Li said. ""The developing countries, however, have generally failed to feel the support."" The gap is partly the result of some developed powers labeling other financial support they provide as climate-related and calculate that support as such, he said. He said that as a developing country, China will not help fill the gap in developed countries' commitments, although it will continue to make proactive efforts to contribute to global climate action. ""The per capita GDP in China has yet to reach the global average level. ... Despite advancement in various aspects, the country still has a long way to go in its development,"" he said, adding that national conditions in China as a developing country can be expected to continue for an extended period. ""China is willing to fulfill its obligation in tackling climate change with proactive efforts consistent with its capabilities and development stage,"" he said. ""But we are not going to shoulder responsibilities that should be taken up by the developed powers."" \"

To not lose time, the 12-day conference was moved at the last minute from original host Chile due to social unrest.

Over the past two weeks, delegates from almost 200 countries focused on Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is about some technical details of the implementation of the deal in building the market mechanisms, especially the global carbon market. ""We want to close Article 6... which will generate resources to bring about projects, and the projects would allow us to move toward sustainable development...

At the closing plenary, delegates from most countries express their regret or frustration of failing to achieve the agreement on Article 6. The work will be left for further discussion on the next congress COP26, which is scheduled to be held in Glasgow next year. CHINESE EFFORTS In a statement issued after the closing plenary, the Chinese delegation said China played a positive and constructive role during the event. Although the agreement about Article 6 was not reached, China will promote that all parties concerned to reach the consensus as soon as possible. ""The results of the congress are below our expectations, especially that the core issue, talks over the implementation details of Article 6, had reached only a procedural conclusion. I believe that all of us feel regretful, and it cannot match our efforts,"" said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation and vice minister of the Ecology and Environment, at the closing plenary on behalf of the so-called BASIC countries -- China, Brazil, India and South Africa. Zhao also noted that the BASIC countries felt disappointed that developed countries did not answer developing countries' demand for finance. The four countries also expressed regret over the arrangement of pre-2020 implementation and ambition. He urged developed countries to take effective actions to fill the gap of emission cut and the support to developing countries. Zhao said China will work with other parties to address the ""last mile"" of the implementation of Paris Agreement and carry out South-South cooperation on climate change. Participating countries also had differences in the ambitions of addressing climate change, as some countries want to have more ambitious goals, but others want to stick to the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement. Negotiators took stock of actions and implementation addressing climate change in the pre-2020 period. Climate change adaptation, finance, technological transfers and capacity building have also been discussed. TIME FOR ACTION Among the adopted documents include the ""Chile-Madrid Time for Action"" agreement that lays the groundwork for countries to present more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020 in response to the climate emergency. It expresses the ""urgent need"" for these new commitments by countries to bridge the existing gap with the Paris Agreement target of avoiding a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to a statement issued by the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition, COP25 reaffirms the value of multilateralism and international cooperation to solve a global challenge such as climate change. ""Even in complex global contexts, COP25 did not drop the climate agenda in a crucial time for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

As president of the COP25 , Schmidt said ""world leaders have to understand that we need to consider the urgency of climate action,"" before the damage is irreversible. ""Today we are facing a crisis situation in facing climate change. The commitments countries made through the Paris Agreement are not enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, that's why it is essential to make the change from negotiation to collaboration on effective climate action,"" said Schmidt. The Santiago Climate Change Conference ""will be the COP of action, and our work and pledge is to significantly increase the means of implementing climate action -- financing means, the transfer of capacities, and the transfer of technology that are fundamental to making progress,"" said Schmidt. Effective climate action requires not just the commitment of governments, but also of the private sector and other non-state agents, which ""are going to lead the innovation needed to swiftly advance in this transformation,"" said the minister. Chile's agenda will champion the protection of the oceans and Antarctica, electric mobility, renewable energy, and the safeguarding of forests, ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as the circular economy, a system that contrasts with today's disposable economy, minimizing waste and maximizing recycling. Schmidt also confirmed that China will help to promote electric mobility by donating the electric buses to be used during the world's biggest environmental forum. ""We want to make the COP25 the COP of electric mobility,"" she said. Santiago is already a showcase of electric mobility, with a public transit fleet of some 200 Chinese-made electric buses in service since December.

"COP25","China","COP25_China94","US' anti-science attitude hurting its fight against the pandemic","May 8, 2020 Friday","China Daily European Edition","It was shocking to hear the US president imply that disinfectant injections could be used to treat COVID-19 patients. That was two weeks ago. He shocked people again on Tuesday, by not wearing a face mask and ignoring social distancing norms during a visit to Honeywell's mask factory in Arizona despite a sign saying that observing both rules was mandatory. But most shocking for me of late were the many abusive comments against Bill Gates on my Twitter account after I posted a video clip of the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist. In the video, Gates is responding to a question from CNN's Fareed Zakaria on the US administration lacking the cooperative spirit when it comes to jointly fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic with China. Gates described the US blame game vis-\'e0-vis China as a distraction. He said China did a lot of things right at the beginning of the outbreak. But it's sad, he said, that the US, which people expected to do well, did a particularly poor job of fighting the pandemic. However, Gates reiterated that this is not the time to talk about that, it's time to talk about science and the fact ""we're in this together"". The 45-second video drew more than half a million viewers in less than 48 hours, reflecting the popularity of Gates. The last time I heard Gates speaking in person was at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, in December. His views on climate change and global public health have been widely applauded. His commitment to developing a malaria vaccine and eradicating polio, too, has been praised, especially by people in the developing world. Last week, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it would focus its ""total attention"" on containing the pandemic, and it is investing and donating money to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The vicious attack against such a great cause, mostly by Gates' fellow Americans, is beyond belief. On my Twitter account, many have accused Gates of promoting ""eugenics"", ""depopulation"", ""vaccine profiteering"" while some have called him a ""traitor"", seemingly because he praised China's effective containment measures while lamenting the US' poor response. That many Americans nurse an eternal hatred toward Gates is obvious. For example, during a recent rally in Austin, Texas, against the stay-at-home orders, hundreds of protesters, led by far-right radio host Alex Jones, demanded that businesses be reopened and shouted ""arrest Bill Gates"" slogans. Gates is not the anti-lockdown protesters' only target. They have also targeted Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to every US president since Ronald Reagan, in Texas and other places. A member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Fauci is regarded as the most authoritative voice in the US in the fight against COVID-19. Both Fauci and Gates have advised caution in reopening businesses and factories, in contrast to the US president's call to reopen the economy. Gates has also criticized the US administration's decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization. The attacks on Gates and Fauci come at a time when the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US have exceeded 1.17 million and 62,000(as of Thursday), the highest in the world. The US boasts some great scientists and public health institutions, but their expertise has sadly not been welcomed by some, largely due to the nasty domestic election year politics. Juan Cole, a professor of history at the University of Michigan, said that ""when people let their ideologies overrule reason, they are digging their own graves"".

"COP25","China","COP25_China95","Madrid offered as host of UN meeting amid Chile strife","November 2, 2019 Saturday","China Daily","MADRID - Spain's interim leader has offered to have Madrid host an international United Nations climate conference next month that was originally scheduled to be held in riot-struck Chile. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Wednesday canceled plans to host the Dec 2-13 climate gathering, as well as a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, to focus on restoring security in his country, where at least a dozen people have died. A statement on Thursday from Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's office said he offered the space because he understands why the Chilean government needs to prioritize its ""national social agenda"" and how pressed organizers of the COP25 meeting are, given the last-minute switch. Sanchez is trying to stay in power as Spain holds a general election on Nov 10. Spain said UN officials will consider Spain's proposal next week at their meeting in Bonn, Germany. It wasn't immediately clear on what scale the conference would be held if Madrid is chosen as an alternative. Last year's climate conference in Katowice, Poland, was attended by more than 20,000 people. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said Spain's offer would allow organizers to host the summit on its original timetable. ""It is encouraging to see countries working together in the spirit of multilateralism to address climate change, the biggest challenge facing this and future generations,"" Espinosa said. Other options could be shifting the UN conference to a different month. Other possible host sites include major UN venues in New York, Geneva, Vienna, Bonn or Nairobi, Kenya. The annual Conference of the Parties meeting is a key event which allows representatives from around 200 nations to monitor and discuss the world's warming climate and the event usually attracts thousands of delegates along with journalists and climate activists. The COP25 Speaking on Thursday in Santiago, Pinera called Sanchez's offer ""generous"" and said it would allow climate experts to put together ""all the progress that had been achieved"".

"COP25","China","COP25_China96","Last decade ""almost certain"" to be warmest, says UN agency","December 4, 2019 Wednesday 1:19 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","MADRID, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Average temperatures of the past decade are almost certain to be the highest driven by greenhouse gases from human activities, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said Tuesday. The WMO released a report on the sidelines of the ongoing 25th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid. According to the report named ""Provisional Statement of the State of the Climate 2019,"" this year is ""on course"" to be the second or third warmest on record, with the global average temperature around 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial era. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a record level of 407.8 parts per million in 2018 and continued to rise in 2019. CO2 lasts in the atmosphere for centuries and the ocean for even longer, thus locking in climate change, according to the report. Sea level rise has accelerated since the start of satellite measurements in 1993 because of the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and seawater is 26 percent more acidic than at the start of the industrial era, says the report. ""If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing,"" Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO said in a statement. ""We are nowhere near on track to meet the Paris Agreement target,"" Taalas added. The Paris Agreement 2015 stipulates that all parties are committed to making sure global warming stayed ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Participating countries agreed to ""pursue efforts"" to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The WMO's report echoed the annual emissions gap report by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) released last week, which said that countries must make an unprecedented effort to cut their levels of greenhouse gases in the next decade to avoid climate chaos. Over 26,000 participants took part in the two-week COP25 to discuss the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, amid an unclear future of the global efforts. On a daily basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and ""abnormal"" weather, Taalas said. Heatwaves and floods which used to be ""once in a century"" events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries ranging from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia. Enditem \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China97","Interview: Commitments made to earlier agreements need to be evaluated, says UN climate chief","December 9, 2019 Monday 6:07 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","MADRID, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- It is important to evaluate the commitments for supporting developing countries agreed in various climate conferences before the Paris Agreement, says UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa during the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference COP25 here in Spain. It is a key element to assess ""not only how we have progressed in reducing emissions, but also how progress has been made in fulfilling the commitments regarding the support to be granted to developing countries for their climate actions,"" said Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in an exclusive interview with Xinhua. On the sidelines of COP25 in Madrid, Espinosa made this observation in reference to the UNFCCC, which was approved in 1992, and the 1998 Kyoto Protocol. Together with the 2015 Paris Agreement - the first universal, legally binding global climate agreement - these are the three most important documents on climate change. She indicated that with respect to what is known as the pre-2020 agenda process, there is a whole process that includes the entire COP25 , the inter-governmental discussions on the pre-2020 agenda, as well as a review and summary on the fulfillment of obligations and commitments. ""The evidence we see every day convinces us of the need to take decisions more quickly and to tell the truth,"" she said. ""Things have changed compared to the negotiations we had just a couple of years ago, and the delegations that come to the conference are very clear about the importance of trying to find answers and of finding points of convergence in order to move forward."" She explained that climate change multiplies any other type of crises or problems, adding that those with greater resources will always be able to escape affected areas and count on support from other family members. However, those who are already in vulnerable situations will be the worst affected. ""This means climate change is not just about limiting emissions, it is also related to critical situations at social and political levels,"" said Espinosa, a former diplomat for Mexico. SUPPORT FROM CHINA ""China has been an active participant in our process for many years. And in the last three conferences, which I have attended in my role as Executive Secretary of the Convention Secretariat, China has been vital in helping us reach a successful last-minute agreements over several issues,"" she noted. Commending China for reaching, even exceeding, the climate goals it had originally set, the UN climate chief expressed the hope that China would be more ambitious in the fight against climate change. Espinosa said China has undergone a fundamental change in its model of consumption, which has not only benefited China but also the entire world. Meanwhile, the large Chinese market for renewable energy technology has helped reduce the price of this technology to a level which is now competitive with fossil fuels, which is vital to make the necessary transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Regarding South-South cooperation, Espinosa said that it was a ""generous policy of China to be able to help and reach out to other developing countries that are in need."" ""It is important because we are not yet at a level of aid that corresponds to the needs (of developing nations), and that is why China's support is particularly valuable,"" she explained. U.S. WITHDRAWAL With regard to the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Espinosa said she hoped there was ""time for rectification, for them to reconsider this decision."" She reiterated that the U.S. remains an important actor and a key partner. It is ""good to keep on working with them."" Within the U.S., Espinosa noted, there are ""many actions and commitments which are being carried out at local and regional government levels, by companies and civil organizations to fight against climate change."" \"

Outside the building, a huge banner with the sign""#VDLCommission"" has replaced the one with ""#TeamJunckerEU"". Inside, Juncker was praising the quality of the first woman president of the European Commission. ""I think I can say you are lucky to have Ursula von der Leyen as president of the commission,"" said Juncker. ""She will do everything she can, and she knows to do many things, to serve Europe."" Von der Leyen, a former German defense minister, has started her busy schedule after a month's delay in taking office following European's Parliament's rejection of three of her commissioner candidates. Last Tuesday, she spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the two leaders said that ""despite the current difficult period in relations between Russia and EU, it is in the common long-term to find a common ground on key topics of the European and international agenda, to develop a direct dialogue,"" according to a Kremlin statement. They discussed the upcoming Normandy Format meeting in Paris, where Russian and Ukrainian presidents will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron to push for a peace plan to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Last Monday, Von der Leyen was in Madrid at the United Nations Climate Change Conference where she announced that her commission will present the European Green Deal in 10 days. ""Our goal is to be the first climate neutral continent by 2050,"" she said, adding that the EU will propose the first-ever European Climate Law in March 2020 to make the transition to climate neutrality irreversible. She has also laid out priorities to make Europe an economy that works for people, fit for the digital age and has vowed to build a stronger Europe in the world. Her challenges are also many. Member states like Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Poland are still skeptical of the Green Deal. While most members of the European Parliament are supportive of the Green Deal, it is the first time in decades that the two major party groups, the centerright European People's Party and center-left Socialists & Democrats, lost their majority in the parliament. Von der Leyen, a member of the EPP, needs to make more compromises to win support in a more fragmented parliament. Brexit will be an immediate major challenge after the EU spent much of the past two years and a half struggling with plans to cope with the United Kingdom's impending departure, which has been postponed time and again to Jan 31, 2020. The EU leaders are watching closely how the UK national election on Dec 12 will play out. Von der Leyen will inherit a tough job of dealing with the EU's migration and asylum system that has divided some member states over distribution quotas. She also faces increasingly strained transatlantic relations after United States' President Donald Trump ditched Paris Agreement, Iran nuclear deal and multilateralism. Just a day after her taking office, US trade officials announced on Monday a new wave of tariffs on some $2.4 billion of French goods in retaliation to a new French tax on digital services, a tax that will affect large US tech firms such as Google and Facebook. This is in addition to the US tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods announced in October after the US won a WTO case over EU subsidies to Airbus, the world's second-biggest aerospace and defense company. The EU is also outraged at the US blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO Appellate Body. It has reached interim appeal arbitration arrangements with Norway and Canada in case the WTO's supreme court ceases function on Dec 11.

"COP25","China","COP25_China99","Official: Latest temperature goal is illogical","November 23, 2019 Saturday","China Daily","It will be ""impractical"" to lift the world's target of limiting global temperature rise this century to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, considering the huge costs in doing so and its negative impact on the global economy, a Chinese climate change official said. Many developed countries have yet to meet their emission reduction targets It will be ""impractical"" to lift the world's target of limiting global temperature rise this century to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, considering the huge costs in doing so and its negative impact on the global economy, a Chinese climate change official said. Lu Xinmin, deputy director general of climate change in the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, also said the fact that many developed countries have yet to fulfill their emission reduction targets before 2020 is also a reminder that such an increase is irrational. Lu made the remarks during a news conference on Friday in response to some countries calling for more intense climate action by raising the targets included in the landmark Paris Agreement before this year's United Nations climate change conference , which is set to be held in Madrid from Dec 2 to 13. They made the appeal against the backdrop of a special report published by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the impacts of global warming in October 2018. The report highlighted a number of effects that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 C. In addition, some countries are also looking to achieve global carbon neutrality - limiting the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally - by 2050. While acknowledging that it is better for the world to have a smaller temperature decrease, Lu said it is more realistic for the world to stay on the track of the consensus reached in the Paris Agreement. ""We have been in negotiations for so many years and reached a global consensus (in the Paris Agreement) after repeated reviews and arguments, but it has yet to be implemented,"" he said. The Paris Agreement, which will be implemented after 2020, aims to keep the global temperature rise well below 2 C and to pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5 C. The deal sets the goal of realizing carbon neutrality between 2050 and 2100. Lu also warned that the cost will make the more ambitious target unrealistic. ""The cost to reach the 1.5 C target will be three to five times that of a 2 C target,"" he noted. ""You are promoting an impractical targe...on this issue, we should be clear-minded."" China does not oppose any countries, either developed or developing, who want to beef up their carbon reduction targets, but you cannot force all the nations in the world to walk toward such a more ambitious goal because it will have a huge negative impact on the global economy, he added. Lu said developed countries' failure in fulfilling their current targets also adds to the difficulties in curbing temperature rise. The upcoming UN climate change conference will check to see how developed countries have worked to fulfill their compulsory targets before 2020. So far, however, the targets of many developed countries have not been reached, he said. ""Under such circumstances, some of the developed countries put forward a higher target to show their stronger proactivity (in enhancing climate action),"" Lu said. ""They might do that on purpose to mislead the international community and the media to build positive images. The fact is, however, the inadequate contributions from developed countries are resulting in upward pressure on curbing global warming, he stressed.

[Photo/Agencies] The fact that the UN climate change conference, known as COP25 , is still yet to finish, two days after its scheduled closing date, shows how hard it is for all countries to look beyond their own immediate interests for a pragmatic action plan to save the world from the fatal threat of extreme weather conditions. There is no time left for the international community to turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the warnings by scientists about the havoc climate change will wreak. The continuous rise in global temperatures in the past decades, which has resulted in the much higher frequency of extreme weather events around the world, should be enough for the international community to be convinced about how urgent it is for all countries to take immediate action. The whole world is waiting, hoping that the negotiations in Madrid will deliver a feasible solution, by which all countries, big or small, rich or poor, do whatever they can to cut greenhouse emissions in a concrete manner to implement the Paris agreement to the letter. However, it is likely that the world will be disappointed again. Whether poor countries will be supported both in funds and technology by developed countries is still a hard nut to crack. What they view as intransigence on the part of some richer nations remains to be overcome. And the call by the European Union and a coalition of developing countries for others to come forward with more ambitious plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions will be hard to materialize. Research published during the talks found that emissions have risen by 4 percent since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, and cuts of more than 7 percent a year will be needed in the next decade to avoid dangerous levels of heating. Whatever the result of the negotiations from this conference, China will continue to attach importance to whatever it can do to cut carbon emissions. Its annual report on policies and actions to address climate change published by the end of November shows that its carbon dioxide emissions per 10,000 yuan ($1,420) of GDP decreased 45.8 percent since 2005, which is equivalent to a reduction of 5.26 billion tons. It means that China has realized its 2020 target of reducing carbon emissions ahead of schedule. China has raised the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to 14.3 percent, on track to meet its target for 2020. The volume of its forest stock volume rose by 1.7 billion cubic meters, which is more than four times its 2020 target. With concrete actions, China is demonstrating its determination to fight against climate change. \"

[Photo/Agencies] Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was named Time magazine's Person of the Year last week, was forced to apologize on the weekend for appearing to call for the execution of world leaders. During a speech in Turin, Italy on Friday, the 16-year-old Thunberg said that leaders should be ""put against the wall"" but, after a backlash from people who were outraged by the comment, insisted on Saturday that she had not meant anyone should be shot. She said the phrase, which in English is used to describe execution by firing squad, has a different meaning in Thunberg's first language, Swedish. ""That's what happens when you improvise speeches in a second language,"" she said on Saturday. Thunberg had made the initial comment during a speech at a Fridays For Future protest she attended after being at the COP25 United Nations climate summit in Madrid, Spain. The BBC reported that she told the crowd in Turin that governments did not seem to be moving quickly enough to tackle warming and said: ""World leaders are still trying to run away from their responsibilities, but we have to make sure they cannot do that. We will make sure that we put them against the wall, and they will have to do their job to protect our futures."" She later tweeted that she was not calling for violence. ""Yesterday, I said we must hold our leaders accountable and unfortunately said 'put them against the wall',"" she wrote. ""That's Swenglish: £tt stalla nagon mot vaggen' (to put someone against the wall) means to hold someone accountable. Of course, I apologize if anyone misunderstood this."" She said Swedes take the phrase to mean putting someone on the spot with tough questions. Several right-wing media outlets criticized Thunberg before she issued her clarification. The far-right online publication Breitbart said she had gone ""full Fidel Castro"", the Independent newspaper noted. Thunberg said in her tweet: ""I cannot enough express the fact that I  as well as the entire school strike movement  are against any possible form of violence."" Thunberg has been traveling extensively to share her environmental message and to rally young people to join the fight against global warming but is now understood to be heading for home by boat and train, so she can take a break from campaigning. On Thursday, United States President Donald Trump said she needed to ""work on her anger management problem"", to which Thunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to read: ""A teenager working on her anger management problem.

"COP25","China","COP25_China104","Climate talks must solve 'double count' issue to progress, experts say","November 25, 2019 Monday","China Daily European Edition","Although last year's United Nations climate change conference was tasked with setting rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement, the parties failed to reach consensus on guidelines for market-based climate change mitigation mechanisms, leaving part of the process to be dealt with at this year's conference. However, the issue remains a hard nut to crack and will be one of the most challenging problems to resolve in the climate change conference scheduled for Dec 2 to 13 in Madrid, Spain, experts said. The mechanisms laid out in Article 6 of the agreement allow parties to realize greenhouse gas emissions targets through cooperation. One mechanism establishes a global market for trading polluting carbon emissions, through which richer countries can buy emission credits from other countries' programs. However, at the conference last year in Katowice, Poland, a rift between two groups of nations led largely by the European Union and Brazil impeded the work of establishing rules for the global market. A major concern for the European Union was Brazil's proposal of counting its emissions that get absorbed by land use, land-use change and forestry in the country as credits that could be sold, which could result in double counting emissions reductions, said Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China. Germany's state secretary for the environment, Jochen Flasbarth, for example, said in an interview with Bloomberg early this year that his country wants a completely new system with a ""clean and uniform"" design. Zou said the rift between the two groups is rooted in an issue that the academic community has yet to reach consensus on - approaches to calculating and monitoring the amount of emissions absorbed by forest. As to the management of such emission reductions, there is little agreement on which reductions should be counted as credit. While Brazil's and the EU's proposals are both to some extent amenable, they both tend to turn to approaches that serve their own interests, Zou said. ""If you want to address the academic disputes in the negotiation, it will be impossible. Scientists have failed to settle the disputes over the past dozens of years, right? Only after reaching a compromise... can the result be accepted by everybody and can the negotiations over Article 6 be completed,"" he said. Zhang Jianyu, founder and chief representative of the Environmental Defense Fund's China program, said it is critically important to establish the global carbon market despite the challenges arising from the complicated political and economic relationships of different parties and the huge differences in their positions on how to avoid double counting. Double counting could potentially result in ambiguity in margins of carbon credit and conflicts that make the operation of the carbon market inefficient, he said. Roberto Castelo Branco, the Brazilian Environment Ministry's secretary for international relations, said last month, at a news conference for the 29th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change in Beijing, that Brazil is open to negotiation and that he expects the carbon credit system could be built by taking developing countries' concerns into consideration. He highlighted the importance of developed countries fulfilling their commitment to offering support to developing countries, saying it is only after the commitments are in place that ""we can have confidence in this system"". ""It's through the eradication of poverty that we will be able to address the climate change challenges. Therefore, we want the carbon credit system to be built taking into account the need to preserve the development and growth of developing countries,"" he said. Li Gao, director-general of climate change at China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said the rules for Article 6 should be established to avoid double counting while taking into consideration the ""specific concerns of each party"". If technical solutions can be reached in this way, that will help promote parties' proactive participation in global climate progress and the growth of that progress, he said. ""We encourage major related parties to conduct deep discussions from the technical points. The work has been going on. I think we are hopeful of reaching a solution.""

International leaders to share insights, discuss green energy at key event China's efforts in promoting sustainable development through efficient use of green energy resources have been recognized by the world, according to delegates to the Taiyuan Energy Low Carbon Development Forum, held from Oct 22 to 24. The 2019 Taiyuan Energy Low Carbon Development Forum is one of the major international events held in the capital city of Shanxi province. Taiyuan had hosted three editions of the forum before this year's event. The event includes a summit forum during the opening ceremony, an energy industry exhibition and six sub-forums. During the six sub-forums, delegates will discuss the latest development in the areas of efficient use of coal resources, natural gas exploration and utilization, internet for energy, pressing challenges for new energies, nuclear power and hydrogen energy. According to Sun Yuejin, deputy secretary-general of the event's secretariat, the Taiyuan forum aims to build ""a high-profile and authoritative dialogue platform for the world's top brains in the industry to share their visions and talk about cooperation for sustainable development"". ""The forum is also expected to make China's voice heard in the international community, so as to contribute its intelligence, experiences and visions for building an environmentally friendly society across the globe,"" Sun said. Jiri Paroubek, former prime minister of the Czech Republic, was among the world leaders who signed the Paris Climate Agreement during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. Paroubek commended China's efforts in ""assuming its responsibility for global climate governance and actively participating in the negotiation of the Paris agreement"". ""It is heartening to note that the solar power plants put into operation by China by 2017 have accounted for one-half of the world's total number,"" Paroubek said. He added he has noticed China's efforts in gradually restricting coal mining, supporting green innovation, reducing solar and wind power prices and creating new jobs. Delegates also hailed the Taiyuan forum as an important platform for people from all sides to speak freely, exchange experiences and promote cooperation. U Ohn Win, Myanmar's minister for natural resources and environmental conservation, talked at the forum about his country's experience in dealing with climate change by developing ""resilient and low carbon energy, transport and industrial systems for sustainable growth"". He noted that, along with renewable energy, energy efficiency will also play a key role in promoting low carbon development in Myanmar. He said he expects to use the Taiyuan forum as an opportunity for investment cooperation, guiding funds to Myanmar's renewable energy and energy efficiency-related industries. Tohmei Takekawa, president of Japan's Global Consortium for Energy and Environment, said he hopes Shanxi, the host province of the forum, can expand exchanges and cooperation with Japanese enterprises as the province is rich in coal-to-hydrogen resources and is very likely to become a demonstration area for China to promote a low carbon economy. Kou Wei, chairman of State Grid, talked about the importance of emerging technologies in improving the efficiency of energy utilization. He mentioned the use of internet of things in electricity, hailing it as an important way for improving efficiency in the power industry. Due to its efforts in using clean energy and reducing emissions, Taiyuan, capital city of Shanxi province, has seen substantial improvement in its air quality.Provided To China Daily Focusing on energy revolution and international cooperation, the 2019 Taiyuan Energy Low Carbon Development Forum is one of the major international events in Taiyuan.Photos Provided To China Daily Delegates visit an industrial exhibition during the Taiyuan forum.Photos Provided To China Daily (China Daily 10/23/2019 page6) HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/18/157179160651.jpg http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/18/157179160651.jpg 000c295d7b6f1f19e43448.jpg HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/8/157179160664.jpg http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/8/157179160664.jpg 000c295d7b6f1f19e42745.jpg HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/4/157179160684.jpg http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/4/157179160684.jpg 000c295d7b6f1f19e42b46.jpg HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/73/157179160697.jpg http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/73/157179160697.jpg 000c295d7b6f1f19e42f47.jpg \"

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said his government decided to cancel the events after nearly two weeks of sometimes violent protests rocked the nation. Pinera said in a televised address he would focus on restoring security and move ahead in the coming days with an attempt to satisfy popular demands for better social services and a lower cost of living. It is the first time a country has pulled out of hosting the conference since APEC, the intragovernmental forum, was established in 1989. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that China understands and respects Chile's decision to cancel the APEC meeting, and that he believes that the Chilean government and people will restore order as soon as possible. As this year's host country, Chile had done much work to prepare for the meeting, he said. APEC is an important platform for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and has made important contributions to regional development and improving people's lives, Geng said. China considers APEC cooperation to be very important and hopes to work with all related parties to make sure APEC continues its important role in economic cooperation in both the Asia-Pacific region and the world, he added. The APEC Leaders' Meeting was scheduled to be held on Nov 16 and 17 in Santiago, the Chilean capital, and the United Nations climate meeting was scheduled for Dec 2 to 13. The APEC Secretariat said in a statement on Thursday that it supports Chile's decision as the safety and welfare of Chile and its member economies are APEC's ""utmost priority"". ""We thank Chile for tirelessly advocating more-inclusive growth throughout its host year, including by prioritizing the economic empowerment of women and small businesses,"" the statement said. No further details were given on whether another country would attempt to host the meeting this year, although the statement mentioned that Malaysia will host APEC in 2020. Media reports also said the United Nations is now looking at alternative venues for the Conference of the Parties, or COP25 , to discuss the implementation of the Paris climate accord - a landmark international agreement first signed at COP21 in December 2015. As for the APEC meeting, He Yun, an expert at Hunan University's School of Public Management, said it might be possible for organizers to skip a year given that it would not be easy to immediately make the necessary security arrangements. ""The APEC Secretariat should have further discussions on its rotating host mechanism and alternative hosting country mechanism, so as to cope with such incidents in the future,"" He added. Zhu Zhongbo, deputy director of the Latin American and Caribbean institute at China Institute of International Studies, expressed his regret over the canceled meeting. ""Amid the backdrop of slowing global economic growth, especially when trade protectionism and unilateralism are becoming rising trends, the scheduled APEC meeting was expected to be conducive for countries to discuss promoting regional and global economic growth cooperation"".

"COP25","China","COP25_China109","Developed countries should take more responsibility in addressing climate change, says scientist","December 8, 2019 Sunday 8:46 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","MADRID, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries should take more responsibility in addressing climate change, and developing countries should be allowed to transform to the fossil-free economy, a leading scientist has said in an interview with Xinhua. ""We are on the same boat, and we share the same atmosphere, so that everyone has to decarbonize. But we can go at different paces,"" said Johan Rockstroem, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the sidelines of the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid. Rockstroem said developing countries like China should be allowed to transition slower than richer countries, because the developed and industrialized countries have larger responsibility for the historical emission, so that should also take larger responsibility for the phasing-out of fossil fuel. Rockstroem believed that people's lifestyle is not fundamentally locked into fossil fuels. The future for everyone is in renewable, smart and modern fossil-free energy systems. However, there is no doubt that coal-dependent developing countries will have to transition in a slower way. He also noted that looking at the long term, China has already made plans to achieve fundamentally sustainable ecological society, showing that China is now actively undertaking the climate-friendly transition. COP25 kicked off. It's the moment when diplomats have exhausted their mandates and look searchingly to the arrival of their ministers next week to break the deadlock. According to some of the participants, developing and developed countries have different views on the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, especially Article 6 about the market mechanisms, the focus of this event. Developing countries also have different opinions, as some climate-vulnerable countries hope to raise the global ambition of climate change mitigation, while others want to stick to the Paris Agreement's goal of containing the global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, rather than 1.5, over pre-industrial levels. The Germany-based Swedish scientist added that the phasing-out of fossil fuel should be carried out in a more realist path, because the differences among countries should be taken into consideration, especially the fact that poverty alleviation that also has to occur at the same time in developing countries. Rockstroem's words echoed the principle of the Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that acknowledges the different capabilities and differing responsibilities of individual countries in addressing climate change. In addition, Rockstroem said,""I would argue that the EU has the biggest responsibility as the climate change leader in the world. This is the world's largest economic unit that now needs to show decisive action."" ""EU must go very fast towards delivering responsibility to the Paris Agreement. It will signal other large emitters that it is not a sacrifice, but can make sense economically, create new opportunities,"" said Rockstroem. Enditem \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China112","Policymakers should listen to young activists","December 16, 2019 Monday","China Daily European Edition","Two years ago, while in Nanjing, China, I attended an environment-themed fashion show organized by students from Nanjing University, Chinese University of Hong Kong and Taiwan University. The students mimicked a type of fashion walk down the aisle, wearing clothes made from reused materials. It was great fun for the audience, for the participants and for everyone involved. It also indicated a sense of connection and purpose, an environmental binding that crossed borders. Each of these universities has had active environmental advocates and shared concerns about such issues as air pollution, pesticide contamination, and food and material waste. While climate change has not been as prominent, there have been indications that a small but determined core of climate youth activists have become visible in all three places. At the same time, climate youth activism has taken hold globally in the past few years and has become a major backdrop at the various global climate gatherings, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference meetings in Madrid this year. What the cross-border climate youth activism has yet to accomplish is more dramatic policy action and commitments from governments and institutions to reverse the trend toward a climate catastrophe. The climate youth activists, buttressed by scientific reports and studies, warn that such an imminent crisis is at hand. Meanwhile, global greenhouse emissions increase each year. By championing global action, young activists are demonstrating that the climate crisis needs to be addressed not only locally and nationally, but globally across borders. Right now, that's not happening. ""Countries are exceedingly late for achieving pathways to close the emissions gap, with most measures so far having been incremental and gradual,"" says a 2019 UN ""Emissions Gap"" report. It argues that ""deep transformations are now needed to peak global emissions immediately and commence the rapid decline toward net zero emissions by 2050"". This would necessitate emission reductions by 50 percent every decade, a core target identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The actions of the United States and China are a case in point. The administration of US President Donald Trump has reversed modest climate policies undertaken by the previous administration. Trump himself has been a leading climate denier, even arguing at one point that climate change was a hoax perpetuated by China. Climate-related policies and actions undertaken by the US state of California have helped, but have not been sufficient to reverse the nearly 3 percent rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the US in 2018. The 2019 emissions are on track to decrease in the US by about 1.7 percent, largely due to the collapse in coal-fired energy generation, but not enough to offset the 2018 increase and nowhere near the ability to reach a 50 percent reduction by 2030 and thereafter. To meet the IPCC goals requires far greater changes and a far deeper commitment to action in the years to come. China has been able to slow the rapid increase in carbon emissions that took place during the 1990s. The country has established important climate-related policies and actions such as governmental support for renewables, a decline in the number of coal-fired plants, expansion of public modes of transportation, and a commitment to meet goals it established in the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. Yet China's emissions will continue to increase through 2030. Together, the US and China account for more than 40 percent of global emissions. If present trends continue, the two countries alone could create a worldwide temperature rise of 2 C or greater that could have catastrophic consequences. What can happen to change that dynamic? For one, a shift away from the cold war environment between the US and China and toward a goal of cooperation and collaboration would be an important first step. Growing public concern could be another factor. Such concern is lower in the US and China than in most other countries, though it is increasing, especially among young people. In the US, 59 percent now see climate change as a major threat, up 19 points from 2013. And 71 percent of those ages 18 to 29 say climate change is a threat, compared with half of Americans 50 and older. There are fewer studies about climate change awareness in China, though the most recent studies, including one published in China Quarterly in August, point to increased concerns, especially among young people. The global climate youth movement has the potential to influence the course of events, both due to the growing number of participants and the recognition that climate impacts have a generational dimension. If policymakers would begin to listen to their young people, the ability to change course to avert a global crisis may still be realized. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201912/16/5df6c70da310fb3d4c21ef7f.png Link to Image \~ \~ \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China113","Yearender: 2019 witnesses China throwing full weight behind multilateralism","December 20, 2019 Friday 7:01 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Xinhua writer Wang Jiangang UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Unilateralism and protectionism have been eroding the global governance system throughout 2019, prompting widespread concern among members of the international community. Braving such headwinds, China has been doing its utmost to defend multilateralism, via concrete actions such as paying in full all it owes for the 2019 UN regular budget, actively participating in climate action, strongly backing UN peacekeeping operations, and vigorously promoting dialogue and consultation so as to resolve global and regional hotspot issues. PILLAR OF MULTILATERALISM Eyeing surging unilateralism, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed his concern on a number of occasions that the world might be suffering from a ""great fracture."" China, playing an increasingly active role in world affairs, has been trying all it can to fulfill its international responsibilities and obligations in an earnest manner. In December, China participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference , making a positive contribution to the outcome of the meeting. As a co-lead of the 2019 Climate Action Summit's Nature-Based Solutions action area, China called for a systematic understanding of the relationship between human beings and nature, a full recognition of the ecological value of Earth, reliance on natural forces to deal with the risks posed by climate change, and fostering a low-emission and climate-resilient society. China urged incorporating nature-based solutions in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and giving consideration to the potential of natural systems to facilitate mitigation and adaptation. Also in the year, the United Nations was hit hard by the worst financial crisis in a decade. As one of the founding members of the UN, China has never defaulted on its dues to the organization. UN officials said that despite a substantial increase in China's contribution to the UN, it still managed to pay its 2019 contributions in a timely, full and unconditional manner. ""Safeguarding multilateralism has become an urgent must,"" said Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, president of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), while highly commending China's firm commitment to multilateralism, which is vital to the stability, security and healthy development of the entire world. DEFENDER OF WORLD PEACE Throughout the year, China has been making full use of the UNGA, the Security Council and other major multilateral occasions or venues to promote the resolution of such issues as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and other issues through dialogue and consultation. China has also taken an active part in UN peacekeeping. Meanwhile, Chinese peacekeepers have continued to carry out armed patrols and humanitarian relief operations in Lebanon, Mali, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other troubled countries or regions. More than 2,500 Chinese peacekeepers are currently on duty in seven mission areas, as well as the UN headquarters. ""China has played a very critical and very important role in UN peacekeeping operations,"" said Atul Khare, UN under-secretary-general for operational support. He added that China is not only the largest contributor of peacekeeping personnel among the permanent members of the UN Security Council, but also the second largest financial contributor to the budget of peacekeeping operations. CONTRIBUTOR TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT As the world's second largest economy, China has contributed more than 30 percent of world economic growth for more than a decade, becoming a major driver of global growth. China has always been a contributor to global development, firmly upholding the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, and remains committed to building an open world economy. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched six years ago, has received a positive response from the international community. At the UN, almost all staff are familiar with the initiative. For June Sappakit, a waiter working at the UN Delegates Dining Room for 19 years, what has intrigued her recently has not been celebrities dining here with UN officials, but China's BRI. The BRI has become a buzzword in recent years at various events held in the dining room by UN member states and non-UN organizations and companies. ""What interests me is that China is seeking to connect many countries by helping build railways, highways and other infrastructure facilities in related countries,"" Sappakit said. ""It is a very good program catering to the interests of people in countries along the Belt and Road."" UNGA President Espinosa lauded China's achievement in lifting over 700 million people out of poverty over the past several decades, calling it a miracle and an excellent example for other countries struggling with poverty. Guterres, in his congratulatory message on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, said ""China has been a key participant in the work of our organization and has played a central role as a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism."" ""China and the United Nations are continuing to work together to address pressing global issues,"" he said. Enditem \"

[Photo/Agencies] A vital climate summit that offered the world a chance to address the pressing problem of global warming will not happen as planned, because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The United Nations gathering, which was set to begin on Nov 9 in the Scottish city of Glasgow, is now tentatively slated for the first half of next year. The event, known as COP26, was expected to attract world leaders and more than 26,000 delegates to Glasgow, along with hundreds of journalists and thousands of environmental campaigners. The BBC says the decision to delay the event was widely anticipated. The exhibition center that was to have hosted the gathering, the Scottish Event Campus, is being refitted to serve as a temporary hospital for people stricken by the virus. Alok Sharma, the United Kingdom's business secretary and the summit's president-designate, said: ""The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting COVID-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule COP26. We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis, and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference."" The Guardian newspaper says the talks would have been ""the most important climate negotiations since the Paris agreement in 2015"" and notes they offered an opportunity for nations to get back on track and avoid irreversible global warming. Preliminary meetings The decision to postpone the event was made by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It also pulled the plug on preliminary meetings, including one scheduled for Bonn, Germany. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said, despite the postponement, the battle against global warming must be won. ""COVID-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term,"" she said. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian newspaper nations must not be allowed to use the delay as an excuse to retreat from climate commitments. ""The decision to postpone the climate talks in Glasgow was inevitable given the health emergency the world is currently facing,"" he said. ""But while the summit has been delayed, the climate emergency can't be put on hold."" Some climate campaigners, though, are hoping the delay will have a silver lining. With the United States presidential elections set for November, they have noted that Donald Trump, who is withdrawing his nation from the Paris Agreement, could be replaced by a president who is more committed to climate action. The Bloomberg news agency said that climate change was top of policymakers' agendas at the start of the year. It said the world's six or seven largest publicly traded oil and gas companies' executives had even set environmental targets, and executives attending the Davos gathering discussed investor pressure to behave responsibly. But the agency noted that leaders around the globe now ""are focused on a single issue: how to stop the virus"".

In China, many companies have long been engaged in saving energy, recycling and making the best of waste. Yu Honghui, General Manager of the China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (JIN ZHIXIAO) Energy-efficient buildings The sci-tech museum at the Hangzhou Energy and Environment Industrial Park, developed by the China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP), in Zhejiang Province, east China, is a prime example of passive-house construction. A passive house, a specially designed building that can retain heat from the sun, lights, the human body and electronic appliances to maintain constant temperature, humidity and oxygen, is an advocated solution to saving energy. The museum, which opened in 2009, saves one fourth energy per square meter with its unique shading system, ventilation, and electricity and water reuse. However, while passive houses save energy compared to normal buildings, the cost per square meter is 1,000 yuan ($142) higher. While the high cost is a deterrent in implementing them widely, the government is subsidizing developers to introduce energy-efficient construction. Also, since a passive house is highly energy saving, the cost of maintenance is lower, Liu Ming, an executive with the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division, said. In 2014, 11 passive house projects were launched in Shandong Province in east China with the provincial government providing as much as 60 million yuan ($8.5 million) in subsidies. ""Passive houses are emerging in China as developers become optimistic. As more domestically developed building materials enter the market, the price of passive houses will go down,"" Liu said. Ahead of COP25 , China published the Report on China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change 2019, detailing its work in addressing climate challenges in 2018, including policies and measures. It was the 11th consecutive report since 2009. An exhibition hall at the China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group headquarters in Beijing showcases the company's technologies (JIN ZHIXIAO) Waste to resources Domestic waste is another growing environmental issue as China's urbanization deepens. More than 150 million tons of household waste is produced in cities per year and the volume is increasing by 8 to 10 percent year on year. The value of wasted resources is nearly 25-30 billion yuan ($3.5-4.2 billion). Linyi is the most populous city in Shandong. Its downtown area alone produces about 3,100 tons of domestic waste a day, along with sewage, livestock carcasses and sludge. In 2006, the CECEP undertook the work of dealing with the city's domestic waste. The Linyi Ecology Recycle Industrial Park was established to deal with all kinds of waste. It burns the combustible waste to generate power. Solid waste that can be recycled is reused as well as by-products generated by chemical or physical reactions. From the garbage, the park provides steam to 141 factories nearby and supplies heating and electricity to the city. ""It's a decent way to address waste, which is also a symbol of civilization,"" CECEP General Manager Yu Honghui told Beijing Review in a recent interview. Leading enterprises like state-owned CECEP have cutting-edge technologies, operational expertise and a long-term vision to plan and invest. So they can create public benefits and meet economic interests, which makes environmental protection more sustainable. ""State-owned enterprises undertake political, economic, social and environmental responsibilities. It's our mission to be actively involved in energy conservation and environmental protection,"" Yu said. ""When you are witnessing waste turning into valuable resources, you know you are doing good. Both the company and the country will win respect and gain more opportunities."" \"

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature added 1,840 new species to its catalogue of plants and animals that risk extinction. The list now contains more than 30,000 species under threat of disappearing.  Climate change is adding to the multiple threats species face and we need to act urgently and decisively to curb the crisis, said IUCN acting director-general Grethel Aguilar.  This update reveals the ever-increasing impacts of human activities on wildlife. The IUCN said it had witnessed genuine declines in 73 species since its last assessment. The group this year released a devastating look at the state of wildlife on Earth. More than 1 million species are now at risk of vanishing as insatiable human demand puts them in danger of habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution and climate change. Releasing its Red List update in the middle of COP25 climate talks in Madrid, the IUCN said yesterday it was increasingly clear that climate change on its own was a growing threat. Rising temperatures have already contributed to the declines of several freshwater fish and sharks. The latest update showed 37 percent of Australia\' s freshwater fish species were threatened with extinction. Stocks of the short-tail nurse shark have declined around 80 percent in the last 30 years. Its shallow water habitat is being degraded as the ocean warms. Dozens of species of birds and plants are now also threatened by rising temperatures. The IUCN did highlight a small handful of conservation successes, including the recovery of the Guam Rail, a bird previously listed as extinct in the wild. \"

The equivalent of 1.75 Earths would be required to produce enough to meet humanity\' s needs at current consumption rates.  Earth Overshoot Day falling on July 29 means that humanity is currently using nature 1.75 times faster than our planet\' s ecosystems can regenerate. This is akin to using 1.75 Earths, the environmental group, which is headquartered in Oakland, California, said in a statement.  The costs of this global ecological overspending are becoming increasingly evident in the form of deforestation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, or the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The latter leads to climate change and more frequent extreme weather events. Calculated since 1986, the grim milestone has arrived earlier each year.

The Global Climate Risk Index, which was published by Germanwatch on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid ( COP25 ), showed that in 2018, industrialized countries like Japan and Germany, ranking top and the third respectively, were hit hardest by heatwaves and severe drought. Based on database of the reinsurance company Munich Re, as well as the socio-economic data of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the index found that Germany was in the third position as its hottest-ever April-July period resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 people and widespread drought in 2018. The long-term index also noted that from 1999 to 2018, poor countries had to face much higher impacts: Seven of the ten countries most affected in this period are developing countries with low or lower middle income per capita. Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti were most affected. Recent science has confirmed the long-established link between climate change and the frequency and severity of extreme heat. In Europe, for example, extreme heat spells are now up to 100 times more likely than a century ago. Furthermore, due to a lack of data, impacts of heatwaves on the African continent may be under-represented, according to the index. In the past two decades, globally nearly 500,000 fatalities were directly linked to more than 12,000 extreme weather events, with the economic damages amounting to about 3.54 trillion U.S. dollars.

[Photo/Xinhua] A study by the United Nations meteorological agency WMO, published last month, states that heat-trapping greenhouse gases \- carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide \- have reached an unprecedented level in the atmosphere. The global average of carbon dioxide concentrations reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018, a figure 2.3 ppm higher than the previous year. Similarly, the concentration of nitrous oxide and methane swelled to 331.1 parts per billion (123% above pre-industrial levels) and 1,869 parts per billion (259% of the pre-industrial levels). The results came at a crucial juncture when extreme weather conditions due to climate change are turning into a new normal, impacting marine and land ecosystems. On the one hand, monstrous wildfires are frequently wreaking the havoc in regions such as Brazil's Amazon rain forests, Australia, and the U.S., while on the other hand, the rising temperatures are rapidly melting-down the glaciers of polar regions such as Greenland and Antarctic peninsula. Already, climate scientists have started raising the red flag of ""the point of no return"" and the approaching sixth mass extinction of life as a result of the human activities on the planet. Thus, it is vital for the ongoing 2019 U.N. climate change conference, known as COP25 , in Madrid, Spain, to achieve its target of effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. In 2015, more than 200 nations under the Paris Agreement, pledged to keep the planet's temperature rise between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius from 2005 levels. Since then, China, as one of the major stakeholders of the accord, has been pushing hard towards achieving its climate targets much earlier than promised. It has been deploying massive resources on numerous fronts to not only get rid of the environmental challenges domestically but also to help other parts of the world achieve their climate goals. For instance, under the Paris Agreement, China pledged to cut down its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from 2005 levels while increasing the percentage of non-fossil fuels up to 20% of its total energy consumption by 2030. An aerial photo of the Bianshan wind farm in Changxing county, east China's Zhejiang province. [Photo/Xinhua] It has already cut down its carbon emissions under this measure by 46% from 2005 levels. Meanwhile, a recent study published in Nature Energy journal hailed ""substantial emission reductions from Chinese power plants after the introduction of ultra-low emissions standards,"" and projected that it could achieve the Paris targets well ahead of schedule as a result of rapid reduction in the power-plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and PM2.5 and 10. Notably, between 2014 and 2017, these three significant pollutants shrunk by 65%, 60%, and 72% respectively. Also, the share of non-fossil fuels from 2017 to 2018 increased from 12% to 14.3% as the country's primary energy source. Investment in China on renewable energy accounts for 45% of total global investment in this regard. Already, China has surpassed all other nations to become by far the world's largest producer, exporter and installer of wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles. It is not just investing more than the U.S., the EU, and India combined, but also innovating significantly in the field of clean energy. For example, China filed more than 150,000 renewable energy patents by 2016, almost 29% of the total patents filed worldwide in the sector. Additionally, China launched a Green Development Coalition along with the other stakeholders under the Belt and Road Initiative in April this year, which is in line with the United Nation's sustainable development goals of 2030 and based on the principle of ""construction and sharing."" Since 2014, China has invested heavily in the wind and solar PV projects with combined 12,622 MW capacity in the regions along the Belt and Road. Moving on, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report, published in early November, highlighted that the global temperature has already swelled to 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and at this rate the planet's temperature could be higher by 3.2 degrees Celsius in 2100, dramatically exacerbating problems such as food, water, and land shortage. This scarcity could, in turn, trigger major social unrest. Therefore, by looking at the critical climate situation and the alarming future projections, it is essential that clear deadlines and roadmaps for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement be achieved in the ongoing COP25 conference. \"

""GEI provides a technically advanced, cost-effective, viable and scalable solution to global climate governance, playing a key role in advancing the implementation of the Paris Agreement and winning the race against climate change,"" Liu Zhenya, chairman of the Beijing-based GEIDCO, said at a thematic event of the ongoing United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ). ""It is estimated that GEI can get a comprehensive benefit of 9 U.S. dollars for every 1 dollar invested between 2020 and 2050, which has a significant advantage,"" said Liu. According to the report, by 2050, cumulative investments in the energy system under the GEI 2-degrees Celsius and 1.5-degrees Celsius scenarios will be 78 trillion dollars and 92 trillion dollars respectively, lower than any other global scenarios, boosting economic development and reducing carbon emissions at the same time. Power grid interconnection can take advantage of differences in resources, seasons, time zones and power prices among countries and regions to significantly improve the investment efficiency of clean energy, the report said. The report also suggested that the fundamental way to address climate change is to accelerate clean development and ""de-carbonization"" of the energy system. Exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels are the root causes of climate change, it said, adding that from 1970 to 2018, fossil fuels caused 1.1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, accounting for over 70 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. At the thematic event, GEIDCO also signed an agreement with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization on deepening cooperation of researches and projects and taking positive measures to support countries in delivering their nationally determined contributions. Founded in March 2016, GEIDCO currently has 756 members from 106 countries across five continents. Enditem \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China134","Action leader for emissions reduction","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","China Daily European Edition","Strong governance capacity of China has resulted in better-than-expected pace in transition to carbon neutral economy The 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference , being held in Madrid from Dec 2 to 13, once again puts the spotlight on the climate challenge that the world faces. Especially since the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, the international community is now looking to China to exert global leadership by cooperating with major economies such as the European Union and Japan to ensure the targets agreed in Paris are met. Recently, Nature Communications published a study assessing China's performance in implementing the Paris Agreement. The results show that China is expected to reach its Paris Agreement target ahead of schedule, as its carbon emissions will peak before 2030. The reduction of the intensity and total amount of carbon emissions from China is being done in three stages. The first stage is the continuous reduction of carbon emissions per unit of GDP, to reduce the growth rate of carbon emissions. The second stage is zero growth in carbon emissions (less than 0.5 percent), and the third stage is absolute emissions reduction, meaning that the total carbon emissions will decline. Two important indicators, the energy consumption per unit of GDP and carbon emissions per unit of GDP, have been incorporated as binding indicators in the 11th, 12th, and 13th five-year plans, which sent strong signals that governments at all levels have to shoulder the responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save energy, and promote the development and application of clean energy. The strong motivation and effective measures activated by these five-year plans have delivered better-than-expected results, fully reflecting the strong governance capacity of the Chinese government. It can be said that the Chinese government has not only set clear goals, but also made substantial achievements, because China is able to achieve political consensus and mobilize effective actions from the whole society, which makes impossible missions possible. And by doing it as promised, China has won a solid reputation both at home and abroad. What concerns the international community now is whether China can realize the absolute reduction of its carbon emissions in advance? Our comprehensive research shows that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2020-25), China can enter the third stage of absolute emissions reduction. In this stage, a complete decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions can be attained. China already possesses the basic conditions and is implementing important measures to realize the goal. First, energy demand will decline as China transforms into a modern service economy. The proportion of industrial added value in GDP will continue to fall from 34 percent in 2018 to 25.5 percent in 2030. This will lead to a remarkable cutback of the proportion of industrial energy consumption, which is already occurring, from 72.5 percent in 2010 to 65.7 percent in 2017, a decrease of 6.8 percentage points. It is expected that this figure will decline below 60 percent in 2025. Therefore, a lower growth rate of total energy demand and carbon emissions is foreseeable. Second, as China's economy has entered a stage of medium-speed growth, not only has the elasticity of energy demand declined, but also the elasticity of coal demand, and that of carbon emissions demand is decreasing. Fourth, China has established the world's largest carbon trading market, which provides a strong incentive for the development of green energy. By the end of 2018, the total volume of carbon emissions traded was close to 800 million tons, the value of which was more than 11 billion yuan ($1.6 billion). Relevant State departments have issued guidelines on carbon accounting reports for 24 industries and designated 13 national standards, compulsively requiring large national energy consumers (industry, the electricity sector, transportation sector, and large and medium-sized cities) to enter the carbon trading market and encouraging voluntary accession to the market. Climate change is one of the major challenges facing all countries and is also one of the major issues for China's development. As the United Nations Environment Program reports, if the emissions of greenhouse gases don't decrease 7 percent per year from 2020 to 2030, the world will lose the chance of realizing the goal of controlling the temperature rise to below 1.5 degree Celsius. China has the advantage of its strong national governance to achieve its emissions reduction goals. It will set clear goals and detail concrete actions to reduce its greenhouse emissions during the 14th Five-Year Plan. China will also continue to set the reduction rate of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP as an obligatory national target. The plan will encourage China's developed regions to take actions to reduce their absolute emissions, and industries, especially the energy industry, will be required to take actions to become carbon neutral. Carbon dioxide emissions reduction will be implemented in the whole process of energy production, energy storage and energy consumption. The Chinese government has announced that China will continue to participate in global climate change governance. At the same time, China will strengthen South-South cooperation and continue to offer support and help for other developing countries. China is also participating in global climate change governance more positively and is strengthening cooperation with the international society. Therefore, China is on course to attain the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, which means it will have explored a low-carbon path that others can follow.

""We are taking this big leap forward and toward the future,"" he added, noting that ""outside China, Santiago is the city with the most electric buses."" Santiago's drive towards sustainability has been turbocharged as the city prepares to host a landmark international climate change conference in December, the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Chinese government is doing its part by donating 20 electric buses to help shuttle conference participants during the gathering, Chilean Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications Gloria Hutt told Xinhua. ""Borrowing China's experience, we adopted the same kinds of solutions, and they have been very successful,"" said Hutt. Hutt's ministry is now working to introduce electric mass transit to other major cities with Chinese-made buses, which ""are very efficient and of very good quality,"" she said. In Santiago, the infrastructure is already in place. Buses can recharge every 260 km at the Los Espinos electric terminal, where solar panels supply the energy. It takes just three hours to recharge a bus. Prior electric bus fleets had gone into operation in the capital between December and March, bringing the total number of electric buses serving local residents to 386. According to government figures, switching to electric mass transit has led to significant savings in operating costs, with conventional diesel burning buses costing over 300 pesos (about 0.42 U.S. dollars) per kilometer run compared to just 77 pesos (0.11 dollars) per kilometer for the electric buses.

Chile. Madrid 2019. UN Climate Change Conference"" during the opening day of the UNFCCC COP25 climate conference in Madrid, Spain, December 2, 2019. Photo/VCG Many experts agree the sixth mass extinction is currently underway. Not since the dinosaurs have species been disappearing as rapidly as they are today, and what's happening now is the only extinction event ever to be caused by a species: Homo sapiens. As with many of the world's ills, biodiversity conservation, or the maintenance of the huge variety of species on Earth, has its own UN convention. This time next year China will be hosting the 15th Conference of Parties (COP) for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province. Many are calling it the ""Paris of biodiversity,"" imagining it will be a breakthrough moment for the conservation community to set goals and gain public awareness of the one million species now under threat of extinction from human behavior. Environmentalists are hoping it will be like Paris in other ways as well, namely that the agreement will consider climate change and not just biodiversity. The CBD was first agreed upon in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Every 10 years, the 196 countries party to the agreement decide on a new set of conservation targets for the world. 2020 will be the next time such goals are be established. However, the last two rounds have not seen the desired results. Of the 20 Aichi Targets agreed upon in 2010, only a few are on track to be met. Meanwhile, there has been a 60% decrease in animal populations worldwide since 1970. This does not just put obscure ecosystems at risk, but threatens our own food supply and way of life. There are several major issues on the table for Kunming. The first is setting targets for the next 10 years, as well as a mid-century target for 2050. One proposal is to set the goal of protecting 30% of the world's land by 2030, an increase from the 17% specified in the Aichi Targets. Delegates also have to discuss how to implement these goals, including financing and aid for developing nations. Additionally, negotiators will discuss transparency and accountability, such as how to measure countries' progress towards their goals. China currently has 18% of its land in protected areas, and it has even more marked under the new ""red line"" system that prevents economic development in ecologically significant areas. These are encouraging developments given that China, home to 10% of the world's plant species and 14% of its animals, is considered a ""mega-biodiversity country."" China needs to move beyond its domestic achievements, however, and act as a champion of biodiversity globally ahead of the Kunming conference. As host, China has the power to set the tone for the conference and to encourage other countries to raise their level of participation. Traditionally, CBD COPs have been attended by environmental ministers and other lower-level government officials, but for significant progress to be made, world leaders need to show their support for conservation. President Xi Jinping can lead by example, and his diplomats can directly encourage other nations to make biodiversity protection a priority. France provides a good example of how to train the spotlight on a major UN conference, as they did in the years leading up to the Paris Agreement. But the biodiversity community can learn more from the Paris process than just how to increase ambition and garner attention. The biodiversity and climate worlds have long been siloed, with climate change receiving the majority of the attention in the last several years. The two issues are irrevocably connected, however, and in order to effectively address them, we must conceptualize them as such. For one, they have overlapping causes: land use change, which leads to habitat destruction, is the number one driver of biodiversity loss. Land use change also releases CO2 into the atmosphere when trees are cut down and prevents future emissions from being captured. As the climate crisis deepens, extreme temperatures and weather events will make irreversible changes to habitats that will push those species unable to move or adapt to extinction. Fortunately, the links between the causes of the two problems mean that solutions to one often apply to both, a win-win situation China is well aware of. Nature-based solutions (NBS) to climate change can look like everything from reforestation to using natural wetlands as flood mitigation, or any other measure that helps protect and regenerate key habitats for an array of species while mitigating or adapting to climate change. According to an influential recent study, NBS have the potential to make 30% of the emissions reductions necessary to meet the Paris Agreement by 2030. China was asked to chair the NBS workstream at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September and share their considerable experience with reforestation and other solutions. Between 2005 and 2018 China increased its forest reserves by 4.56 billion cubic meters to reach 23% of its land, an effort that has lowered the country's net emissions by acting as a carbon sink, prevented erosion, and to some extent helped restore degraded habitats. The country has also implemented projects to improve the efficiency of farming practices to conserve water and nutrients and increase the potential of soil to act as a carbon sink. China by no means has a perfect track record on biodiversity protection. Pollution, deforestation, and poaching have pushed species like the Chinese white dolphin, pangolin, giant panda, South China tiger, and one-horned rhino to the brink of extinction. Reforestation efforts have been criticized for creating monocultures instead of thriving habitats, and Chinese consumer demand for products like ivory is infamous for driving poaching around the world. Nevertheless, COP15 provides an opportunity for China to begin a new era of biodiversity conservation, one defined by coordination with climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, as well as ambition and high-level engagement.

"COP25","China","COP25_China138","All countries must take concrete actions to stop and reverse global warming","December 16, 2019 Monday","China Daily European Edition","The fact that the UN climate change conference, known as COP25 , is still yet to finish, two days after its scheduled closing date, shows how hard it is for all countries to look beyond their own immediate interests for a pragmatic action plan to save the world from the fatal threat of extreme weather conditions. There is no time left for the international community to turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the warnings by scientists about the havoc climate change will wreak. The continuous rise in global temperatures in the past decades, which has resulted in the much higher frequency of extreme weather events around the world, should be enough for the international community to be convinced about how urgent it is for all countries to take immediate action. The whole world is waiting, hoping that the negotiations in Madrid will deliver a feasible solution, by which all countries, big or small, rich or poor, do whatever they can to cut greenhouse emissions in a concrete manner to implement the Paris agreement to the letter. However, it is likely that the world will be disappointed again. Whether poor countries will be supported both in funds and technology by developed countries is still a hard nut to crack. What they view as intransigence on the part of some richer nations remains to be overcome. And the call by the European Union and a coalition of developing countries for others to come forward with more ambitious plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions will be hard to materialize. Research published during the talks found that emissions have risen by 4 percent since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, and cuts of more than 7 percent a year will be needed in the next decade to avoid dangerous levels of heating. Whatever the result of the negotiations from this conference, China will continue to attach importance to whatever it can do to cut carbon emissions. Its annual report on policies and actions to address climate change published by the end of November shows that its carbon dioxide emissions per 10,000 yuan ($1,420) of GDP decreased 45.8 percent since 2005, which is equivalent to a reduction of 5.26 billion tons. It means that China has realized its 2020 target of reducing carbon emissions ahead of schedule. China has raised the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to 14.3 percent, on track to meet its target for 2020. The volume of its forest stock volume rose by 1.7 billion cubic meters, which is more than four times its 2020 target. With concrete actions, China is demonstrating its determination to fight against climate change. \~ \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China139","Initiative on sustainable fishing carried out in Spanish town","November 29, 2019 Friday 5:38 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","MADRID, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- As the Spanish side has been working hard to prepare for the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference COP25 , some initiatives to save the oceans have been implemented in the country. One of the initiatives on sustainable fishing can be found in the town of Bermeo in the Basque region in north Spain. At the picturesque but busy port of Bermeo where 6,000 of the 18,000 inhabitants work in jobs related to fishing, they know the consequences of overfishing all too well. ""In 2003 stocks of anchovies were slashed and there was a crash in population numbers. There was no anchovy fishing for five years and it was a big wake-up call for the fishing industry,"" Ignacio Serrats, president of Conservas Serrats, a Bermeo-based fish cannery, told Xinhua. Given that anchovies are a baitfish close to the bottom of the food chain, the crash in anchovy population also affected fish such as mackerel which feed on them and larger fish which then eat mackerel, said Serrats. The Bermeo World Tuna Capital agenda focuses on a close collaboration between science and fishing and also the integration of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This involves using a code of ""good practices"" which is revised on an annual basis with the aim of more responsible fishing and reducing the accidental capture of other species and the zero toleration of the capture of whales or dolphins. Nets are also revised to ensure this while fish are tagged and stocks are closely monitored to ensure no overfishing. Much of this is carried out with the help of AZTI, a non-profit foundation based in the Basque region with focus on sustainable fisheries management, protection of an efficient marine ecosystem and combating climate change. ""AZTI is one of the organizations that know the most about the sea. So we follow their indications. They are very important for Bermeo Tuna,"" commented Serrats, adding that ""It's a mix of science and tradition."" He stressed that the oceans have a vital role to play in the fight against climate change, due to their ability to capture carbon dioxide (CO2). ""50 percent of the world's carbon dioxide is captured by plankton. If we do too much damage to the sea we risk losing that. We are killing the reservoirs that can capture CO2,"" warned Uriarte.

"COP25","China","COP25_China140","The Time to Act Is Now","December 12, 2019 Thursday","Beijing Review","People attend a march calling to combat climate change in Chicago, the U.S., on September 20 (XINHUA) Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 25th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) in Madrid, Spain, on December 2, UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres issued an urgent warning about the deepening climate crisis, signaling that our planet is nearing ""the point of no return"" and that all countries should take even more aggressive measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Acting on agreement It has been three years since the landmark Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, but making the deal actually operational has proven to be a major problem. At last year's COP in the Polish city of Katowice, a 256-page rulebook was drafted to facilitate the implementation of the agreement, which marked a step forward. But a prime issue to be solved is determining a commonly accepted timeframe for implementation measures. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which quantify each country's efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, are at the heart of the agreement. Currently, 189 countries have submitted NDCs that are mostly for 2020-30, with a few for 2020-25. With varying preferences and conditions, it is difficult to provide accurate assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the climate policies set by governments. Thus, it is not surprising that it remains a major concern as to how to provide the financial and technical assistance needed to help poorer nations to deal with the impacts of climate change and pursue low-carbon development. Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased for the third consecutive year in 2019, likely ticking up about 0.6 percent to a record 37 billion tons. Therefore, there is heightened pressure on all parties to meet targets. According to the latest UN Environment Emissions Gap Report, even if all current pledged emission cuts are fulfilled, temperatures are expected to rise by 3.2 degrees Celsius, thus a 7.6-percent annual reduction from now until 2030 is essential to meet the agreement's 1.5-degree Celsius target. COP 25 is the final conference before the crucial year of 2020, when many nations are required to submit updated national climate action plans. So far, only 68 signatories have made clear that they will scale up emission reductions, while many countries have failed to deliver on their pledged goals. Cooperation cools down COP 25 focuses on issues left over from last year and aims to build a framework for a fresh round of global climate actions. But various constraints will directly impinge on the prospects of global climate governance. Although climate change is an issue needing a global solution, challenges like the free-rider problem may discourage international cooperation among nations. The effects of climate change vary in different parts of the world. But the benefits of climate policies are diffused, leading to some countries not sharing the costs, only enjoying the fruits of others' efforts. As a formal international treaty signed under the UN framework, the Paris Agreement should have a strong binding force and all signatories should fully comply with it. However, looking at its provisions, some legal responsibilities remain to be clarified, while implementation mechanisms are inadequate even when obligations are explicitly stipulated. For example, emission reductions don't follow the Kyoto Protocol practice of setting specific goals for Annex I parties; instead, by targeting temperature control, the agreement presents a generalized roadmap for the signatories when it calls for ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."" To meet the targets, the legal responsibility of state parties is reduced to ""reaching global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible."" Therefore, the agreement does not have adequate binding force on state parties' relevant policies and actions. Whether the promises are fulfilled depends mostly on their political and moral considerations. Moreover, in recent years, protectionism and unilateralism have been on the rise, pushing down global growth. The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly lowered its forecast for global economic growth for 2019. The latest figure has been reduced to 3 percent, which is the lowest since the global financial crisis of 2008. The world economy is plagued by several issues such as sluggish trade and investment flows, as well as the monetary loosening by central banks around the world. As a result, the desire for international cooperation on climate change action has been adversely affected. China's actions China has overtaken the U.S. as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. That's no surprise, since it is the world's most populous nation. Nevertheless, as the biggest developing country and an emerging global power, it has pursued economic growth, while acting responsibly about addressing climate change. At COP 25 , China actively works with the international community to push forward negotiations in a cooperative and pragmatic way to make positive progress in putting the Paris Agreement into operation and open a new chapter in global climate governance. A week before the opening of COP 25 , China released the 2019 Annual Report on Policies and Actions to Address Climate Change, which showed that its carbon dioxide emissions per 10,000 yuan ($1,420) of GDP decreased 45.8 percent since 2005, which is equivalent to a reduction of 5.26 billion tons. China raised the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to 14.3 percent, on track to meet its target for 2020. Forest stock volume rose by 1.7 billion cubic meters, which is more than four times its 2020 target. China is also addressing climate change through market-oriented approaches, launching its own carbon market in 2017. As a result, most of China's climate and energy commitments tied to the Paris Agreement have been realized ahead of schedule, highlighting the country's push to take on more international responsibilities on global issues. However, multilateral mechanisms are suffering setbacks. The U.S. formally notified the UN in November that it is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. As a major greenhouse gas emitter, the U.S. has played a very important role in moving forward international climate negotiations in the past, and should not shift its own responsibility now or in the future. In order to build a just, fair and win-win global climate governance system, China attaches great importance to South-South climate cooperation. It backs the establishment of a multibillion-dollar annual green climate fund to help developing countries cope with climate change. But a fund alone cannot solve all problems. China is seeking sustainable solutions, like the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition to co-build low carbon economic demonstration zones in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Kenya, to offer support and assistance within its ability.

[Photo/Agencies] The United Kingdom will choose the next head of its central bank in the coming days, before the departure of Mark Carney on Jan 31. The Financial Times says the frontrunners to take over as governor of the Bank of England include Minouche Shafik, an Egyptian-born British-American economist who was deputy governor of the central bank between 2014 and 2017 and who has run the London School of Economics since 2017. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, is also in the running, as is Kevin Warsh, a former senior official at the United States' Federal Reserve. The Treasury, the UK government department that handles financial issues, said on Sunday a decision could be left until after Christmas because the process of finding a replacement was slowed by the British general election, which was held on Thursday and which was preceded by several weeks of campaigning during which political appointments were prohibited. After Boris Johnson's Conservative Party won a landslide victory in the poll, officials will now turn their attention to the question of Carney's successor. The decision will rest with Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the exchequer, who is expected to hang on to his job in an anticipated Cabinet reshuffle later this week. The chancellor's decision will be passed on to the Queen, who will formally make the appointment. The successful candidate is slated to start an eight-year term on Feb 1. Carney will take up a new role as the United Nations' special envoy for climate action and finance, an appointment that was announced ahead of the UN's COP25 annual climate change conference. The BBC said Carney was ""honored"" to have been asked to take on the UN role as the organization grapples with the challenge of bringing ""the risks from climate change and the opportunities from the transition to a net-zero economy into the heart of financial decision-making"". ""To do so, the disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream,"" Carney said. He will not be paid for his UN role, which will see him attempt to secure private financing to tackle climate change issues. His possible successor Shafik has also worked at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the UK Department for International Development, while Bailey, who has long been considered a likely successor of Carney, has worked in a wide range of roles at the central bank. The New York Times says other names are in the hat, including Shriti Vadera, a non-executive chairwoman of Santander UK, Paul Tucker, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Raghuram Rajan, who headed the Reserve Bank of India between 2013 and 2016. \"

These events included the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing on April 29, the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations on May 15, and the second China International Import Expo on November 5. The United States imposed maximum pressure on Iran, escalating tensions in the Gulf region. In contrast, other parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reiterated their commitment to full and effective implementation of the JCPOA. From June 20 to 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at the invitation of DPRK. China worked for progress toward a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue. China and Russia put forward a draft resolution on the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue to the United Nations Security Council on Dec. 17. The United States formally withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia on Aug. 2, giving rise to concerns over a new arms race. On Oct. 19, British parliamentarians delayed a crucial Brexit vote and forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask the European Union for an extension to Jan. 31 next year from the current Oct. 31 deadline. The Brexit crisis posed complex challenges to European integration. On Oct. 30, Chile withdrew as the host of an APEC summit and the COP25 climate summit set for November and December, due to civil unrest in the South American country. 2019 saw a wave of demonstrations and protests sweep across the world.

A special session was held at the upper house to listen to the keynote speech of UN chief, who had arrived in Italy on Tuesday night. ""The climate crisis is no longer a long-term problem... It is here, and it is now,"" Guterres said. He stressed the highest climate-related risks were for people living in some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries that ""were contributing the least to greenhouse gas emission yet were suffering the most."" ""I am disappointed, as I said in the aftermath of the meeting, with the results of the climate talks, COP25 , in Madrid,"" Guterres explained. He referred to the UN Climate Change Conference held in the Spanish capital on Dec. 2-15, during which negotiators failed to reach a deal on global carbon market rules as enshrined in Art. 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""The international community missed an opportunity to show increased ambition in mitigation, adaptation and finance in order to be able to tackle the climate crisis,"" he explained. Nonetheless, the UN Secretary-General said he wanted to send a message ""of hope, not of despair."" ""We will not give up. It was clear at the talks that most countries are still determined to advance more ambitious climate action, and that businesses and financial institutions are moving ahead."" ""The scientific community tells us the roadmap to stay below 1.5 degrees is still within reach, if we act now... The technologies needed are already available, and the signs of hope are multiplying,"" he added. A most important signal on this emergency, according to Guterres, was that young generation were mobilizing and taking the lead in the fight against climate change around the world. Yet, he added more political will was needed, stressing that the next Conference of the Parties (COP26) to be hosted by the United Kingdom in partnership with Italy next year -- would be ""a defining moment."" ""We must meet the expectations of developing countries for resources and support towards climate adaptation and mitigation... we cannot ignore the social dimensions of the transition in energy,"" he said. The second major topic addressed by Guterres was migration. He praised Italy, as well as Greece, for the ""openness, care, and compassion"" showed towards migrants and refugees in latest years, noting that the help so far received from EU partners could have been stronger. ""European Mediterranean countries that receive refugees and migrants -- like Greece and Italy -- are entitled to solidarity and support from their European partners,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, until now, we have not seen that solidarity and support fully materialized."" Once again, the UN chief pointed out migration was a global issue in need of ""collective responses"" that should include more development programs for young people, and an increase in regular pathways for migration and resettlement of refugees. In early afternoon, Guterres held talks with Italian President Sergio Mattarella, while a meeting with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was scheduled in early evening, according to the PM's office.

Named ""The 10 New Insights in Climate Science,"" the report found that climate change is forcing people to reconsider the notion of an extreme event. What was once considered unlikely or rare - is becoming part of a ""new normal."" The record-breaking extreme weather and climate events have continued to dominate the headlines in 2019, with the impact of such events going beyond mere record setting and environmental damage, according to the report. Based on some of the latest findings in climate science and compiled in an easy-to-read guide, the report highlights the most recent advances over the last 12 months in the scientific understanding of the drivers, effects and impacts of climate change, as well as societal responses. The report says that undernutrition will be the greatest health risk of climate change with declining agricultural productivity, particularly in drylands in Africa and high mountain regions of Asia and South America. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide will reduce the nutritional quality of most cereal crops. ""Science must be our common language, and what the science tells us is very clear: we are facing a climate emergency. We must act urgently,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who attended the press briefing of the publishing of the report. The report also notes that climate change is now threatening biodiversity. Failure to address and adapt to climate change would have disastrous consequences for hundreds of millions of people, mainly the very poorest, who are most vulnerable to climate-related disasters like floods and drought. Climate change will also impact on society. The report says that public opinion polls indicated that an increasing number of citizens in various countries are seriously concerned about climate change, and recent massive civil protests are getting close to the thresholds where the society could expect ""tipping"" of some socio-economic systems, according to the report.

Sanitation of public facilities and directing citizens to take person responsibility for hygiene was the original level of what is now escalating caution in Macau. On Wednesday, casino workers were directed to wear masks and the public was advised to don them where people might congregate. Group tours from Wuhan have been banned. The premonitions of the tourism authority cancelling Lunar New Year celebrations in Macau were laughable until they became reality yesterday. In China, Wuhan's public transport services went into lock-down yesterday morning and a quarantine placed over the city at a time of the year with the highest mobility in the country. All this for what? The poor management of and desires for a civet cat or other exotic wild-life meal? Extending this form of uncontrolled avarice to a similar set of objectionable values and entirely poor taste, it would have been healthier, and less damaging and wasteful to import some roast koalas. Having been informed by Wuhan City authorities on 31st December of a cluster of cases of pneumonia and receiving gene sequencing information, the World Health Organization lauded the speed with which the Chinese authorities were able to offer the global community preliminary identification of the new virus. Wednesday, at an emergency meeting, the WHO did not declare the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV a global health emergency due to insufficient information and met again yesterday. So far animal-to-human cases have been identified and cases of human-to-human transmission, which were confirmed this week, appear to be between those in close contact, like family members and health providers. After the first imported case of the virus to Macau was reported Wednesday, the response shifted dramatically yesterday as a second case was recorded. The original position of the government on Wednesday for a system to distribute masks to only local residents was rightly amended. Non-residents make up over 45% of the workforce, often in close proximity to employers in family homes, providing care to the young, elderly, and sick, living in tight living quarters and taking public transport. As such, the health of the entire population would have been compromised had this segment of the community been excluded from the program to curtail the spread of the disease. In such circumstances, the automatic response of prioritizing local residents backfires fabulously. The mask distribution system was to partly alleviate any panic-buying by consumers and the predictable opportunism by retailers.\~ In a show of greed in times of public need, sufficient numbers of pharmacies price-gouged on surgical masks and sanitizers to support such merchants' deservedly poor reputation: individual profit trumps community welfare. This poor show is only matched by enough individuals hoarding these items to create a supply deficit. This, again, only lowers access for other members of the community, thus undermining community-wide health outcomes: short-sighted individual self-interest - which also exacerbated the risk to the public as crowds lined up together grabbing their quotas. Behaviours counter to the common good are easily attributed to ignorance.\~ We have seen in discussions on how to quickly mobilize society to act for both mitigation and adaptation to the climate crisis and other environmental disasters, that those that are most immovable are often the better informed. Perspectives and behaviours are more about values, and less about facts and information as the IPCC has recognized. Professor Maisa Rojas, the COP25 Scientific Coordinator explains that after 30 years of naively assuming scientific facts will speak for themselves, scientists now realise that perceptions, values and storylines are crucial for behavioural change. Social and political transformation towards mitigating crises rely on both facts and community values. Wuhan its causes and responses, Macau and her responses hold interest as case studies on how values drive action and community behaviours.

The top Chinese diplomat said that as a responsible member of the international community, China will honor its promise and be resolute in its action and will continue to take new steps in the course of tackling climate change. ""China is committed to green, low-carbon and sustainable development through the implementation of the new concept for development,"" he said. China will fulfill its obligations under the UNFCC and the Paris Agreement, and achieve the goal of its intended nationally determined contributions, he said, adding that China will also adhere to the co-building of a green ""Belt and Road,"" and pool more resources for international cooperation to address climate change. \"

Von der Leyen determined to make union 'stronger than one we inherited' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen began her first day of work on Sunday by vowing to further strengthen the European Union and making phone calls to high-ranking officials, including Premier Li Keqiang. During the call, Li congratulated von der Leyen on assuming the new post and spoke highly of the current development of China-EU relations, the Foreign Ministry said. Li said that as the world's largest developing nation, China still has a long way to go to achieve modernization. He pledged that China will actively fulfill the commitments made in the Paris Agreement. He also welcomed the new EU leaders to visit China next year for the 22nd China-EU summit. Von der Leyen said she is looking forward to the summit in China next year. She said her call with Li on the first day of her taking office shows that the EU highly values its relations with China. The first female commission president said that the EU and China share broad common interests on such issues as sustainable development and negotiating a comprehensive investment agreement. She said the new commission will prioritize its work on climate change, adding that the EU highly appreciates China's efforts in this regard and is willing to strengthen cooperation with China on issues such as fighting climate change and reforming the World Trade Organization to further promote bilateral relations. Von der Leyen began her first day of work by joining three other top EU leaders - European Council President Charles Michel, European Parliament President David Sassoli and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde - in a ceremony in Brussels marking the 10th anniversary of the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty reformed EU institutions, clarified EU operations and gave the European Parliament a bigger role in voting in the EU's executive body and increasing its legislative power. Von der Leyen was supposed to take office on Nov 1, replacing Jean-Claude Juncker, but the process was delayed after the European Parliament rejected three of her commissioner-candidates.

She also hoped that EU leaders, who will gather for a European Council summit on Dec 12, will agree on a goal of climate neutrality by 2050, something that some Central and Eastern European members still disagreed upon a few months ago. She has made it clear that future trade deals must contain a chapter on ""sustainable development"". Brexit will be a major, immediate challenge for the new EU leadership. The United Kingdom's national elections on Dec 12 will determine how Brexit will play out in the days ahead. The UK is expected to leave the EU on Jan 31 if Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party win a majority. Otherwise, more uncertainty is expected. The EU is also looking to find ways to deal with a United States administration that it does not see eye-to-eye with on issues such as climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and rules-based global trade. The WTO Appellate Body will cease to function on Dec 11 after the US blocked appointments of new judges. The EU is in a trade dispute with the US after the Trump administration announced in October the imposition of $7.5 billion in tariffs on EU goods after winning a WTO case against EU subsidies to Airbus.

"COP25","China","COP25_China162","Concerted drive needed to close SDG gap","January 21, 2020 Tuesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","As global business and political leaders gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum\' s annual meeting, they should ask themselves one big question: Will the world achieve the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals for 2030? Or will the SDGs  with their targets for eradicating extreme poverty, ending preventable child deaths, expanding educational opportunity, and averting a climate disaster  join the long list of enthusiastically endorsed global pledges that go unfulfilled? Those suffering from early new-decade SDG blues might take comfort from Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. Building on the core theme of his influential book  Enlightenment Now, and citing a familiar barrage of statistics on human progress, Pinker has offered an upbeat assessment:  Progress toward [the SDGs] is continuing, he wrote.  It is unlikely to do a sudden U-turn. He is right, up to a point. Since 2000, there have been extraordinary improvements in human-development indicators. Poverty has been decreasing at historically unprecedented rates. So far so good. But here\' s the catch: If progress over the next ten years mirrors that of the last decade, the world will fall catastrophically short of the 2030 targets. Consider child survival. On current trends, there will still be over 4 million child deaths worldwide in 2030. The vast majority of these fatalities could be prevented through improved nutrition and basic health-care interventions. There is a similar yawning gap between current trends and the 2030 targets for education. Although governments have committed to ensuring universal secondary schooling and improved learning, progress toward universal primary education has stalled. In an increasingly knowledge-based global economy, a combination of restricted access to education and abysmal learning outcomes will leave 1 billion children lacking the skills they need to flourish, and that their countries need to drive dynamic and inclusive growth. Likewise, for all the success in combating poverty, past performance is no guide to future outcomes. The pace of progress has slowed, and the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is drifting out of reach. The specter of climate change threatens the SDGs just as surely as it does the receding snow line around Davos. If the 2015 Paris climate agreement held out the promise of concerted international action to limit global warming, last month\' s COP25 climate-change conference in Madrid was a case study in inertia. The emissions gap between current policies and those needed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius is widening, and the world\' s poorest and most vulnerable people are bearing the brunt of the consequences, as the recent droughts in Zambia and the Horn of Africa illustrate. The decade of no return This is the decade of no return for the climate emergency. Failure to price carbon out of the world\' s economies, safeguard carbon sinks, and  critically  protect the world\' s poor against the effects of global warming that are now irreversible will first slow, and then stall and reverse, gains in poverty reduction, nutrition, and health. We cannot allow these challenges\' daunting scale to foster passive acceptance of the inevitability of the SDGs\' failure. Nor should we tolerate the paralyzing complacency that now pervades gatherings like Davos, World Bank-International Monetary Fund meetings, and United Nations summits. There is an alternative. Nothing would do more to bring the SDG targets within reach than a concerted drive to narrow the social disparities currently acting as a brake on progress. Greater equity is the rocket fuel for achieving the SDGs. Instead of issuing vague pronouncements about  leaving no one behind, governments should report on how quickly they are reducing inequalities. International action has a critical role to play. Later this month, Save the Children, UNICEF, and other partners will convene a global forum on pneumonia aimed at expanding access to life-saving interventions. Toward the end of this year, the United Kingdom and Japan will host global summits on climate and malnutrition, respectively. And former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, has developed a proposal for a new international financing mechanism that could boost education spending by US$10 billion. These initiatives represent real opportunities. Galvanizing action on the SDGs would narrow the chasm between the human condition we can achieve and the world we tolerate. We need smart politics, new partnerships, and bold campaigning. Success is not guaranteed  but failure to act is not an option. Kevin Watkins is CEO of Save the Children UK.

"COP25","China","COP25_China163","Feature: Italian students join fourth global climate change strike in thousands","November 30, 2019 Saturday 4:23 AM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Alessandra Cardone ROME, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- From northern Milan to Rome and down to Sicily's Palermo, large crowds of Italian students on Friday joined the fourth global climate change strike called by the Fridays for Future (FFF) youth movement. The new round of rallies was attended by secondary school pupils and university students, who called for more incisive climate policies. Citing the words of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres -- ""There is no time to lose"" -- the movement's Italian organizers had called for days the largest possible participation to the event. In response, peaceful rallies were registered in at least 139 municipalities across the country, according to both FFF Italy and local media. In the Italian capital, demonstrators took off from near Termini train station, marched through the historic center, and reached central Piazza del Popolo at around midday. ""We want to keep living, and we want to make ourselves heard before it is too late,"" one girl shouted through a loudspeaker while the rally started moving. Among the crowd, 15-year-old Marta from Rome's Virgilio high school told Xinhua that ""a turnabout is needed now, and through solid policies... there is nothing else we can do to secure our future."" Marta, who declined to give her surname, added that she has taken part in all the four climate strikes called by Fridays for Future in Italy this year, and with the consent of her parents who shared her worries. The same sense of urgency voiced by the Roman student was palpable among the other young people in the streets. This fourth global climate strike was intentionally called the week before the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) scheduled in Spanish capital Madrid on Dec. 2-13, FFF Italy explained on its website. ""Our aim at a global level is to put pressure on the political leaders meeting in Spain to take immediate and effective measures to fight the climate crisis,"" the group wrote. On its part, the Italian government has been working to have a national climate adaptation plan by the end of the current legislature in 2023, according to a recent declaration of Undersecretary of State for the Environment Ministry Roberto Morassut to Xinhua. Furthermore, earlier in November, Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti announced that Italy would soon add climate change to the science programs implemented in public schools. Starting next September, when public schools reopen, pupils would have 33 hours (per school year) of study devoted to climate change, adaptation, and sustainable development included in their compulsory curricula, according to Fioramonti. PIONEER PROJECT IN MILAN Among various initiatives for climate change adaptation in Italy, one pioneer project involving institutions and professional groups was being carried out in Milan. The project was the first of its kind in the country, and aimed at setting up a climatological information system for Milan and various municipalities in its metropolitan area. ""The key message is that professionals -- engineers, architects, hydrology experts, public administrators, etc. -- have to start using climate data in their work routinely, if we want cities to adapt to climate change,"" Alessandro de Carli with the Milan Association of Engineers told Xinhua. He spoke on the sidelines of the ""General Engineering States in Milan"", organized in the northern city on Nov. 29-30. A first goal was to provide a database of detailed climate data -- with a characterization of specific risks and vulnerabilities of each area and sub-areas within the city, and other indicators -- to public and private stakeholders involved in urban management and planning. After the first year of activity, the database is ready and would be made available online through the project's website in a matter of weeks, said the engineer. Alongside, several meetings with professional categories in Milan were organized (and would be in the future) to help them become familiar with these data and their practical use. ""We have been talking to engineers dealing with energy systems of buildings, architects taking care of insulation, professionals working on the hydrologic and hydraulic system, and so on,"" de Carli explained. \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China166","Whither climate accord and global commitment?","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","China Daily","By OP Rana | China Daily | Updated: 2019-12-18 07:24 Song Chen/China Daily Disappointment seems to have become the norm, rather than exception, of the UN Climate Change Conference, and Madrid has been no exception. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said as much when he echoed the mood of many after the conclusion of the conference on Sunday: ""I am disappointed with the results of COP25 (25th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change). The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up."" Indeed, ""not give up"" has to be the spirit with which we fight climate change. But it seems this spirit is exhibited only by those who want to save the planet and ensure a better future for the next generations, not by those who can actually make this happen. That the longest-ever climate change conference in history could deliver possibly the lamest outcome, and that too after deleting almost everything the big countries were opposed to from the final draft and deferring probably all vital decisions, including the most important one\u-243 framing rules to establish a new carbon market under the Paris climate accord\u-243 speaks volumes of the mockery the rich countries have made of the fight against climate change. Like Guterres, environmental activists and civil society groups, which for long have become major stakeholders in the climate talks, expressed their extreme disappointment mixed with anger at the results of the conference. And for good reason, many civil society members and environmental activists blamed the United States for the weak outcome. The US withdrew from the Paris accord in June 2017 and will cease to be a delegate to the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC from November 2020. Yet it continued to use the age-old tricks at Madrid to get its way. As ActionAid's global lead on climate change Harjeet Singh said, the US ""came here in bad faith, acting only to protect"" US companies' interests ""and those of the polluting industries that caused climate emergency"". The effects of climate change were evident throughout the world this year, as they have been over the last few years, with increased ferocity. Unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, droughts interspersed with unseasonal downpours and flash floods, devastating superstorms, violent snowstorms, melting glaciers and intense cold waves have been warning the world about what lies in store in the future. But big companies, even governments, instead of heeding this warning, continue business as usual, because that is the best way to make more money. What they tend, rather prefer, to forget is money can help address the problem of climate change, but it itself is not the solution to the problem. The Madrid meeting was also expected to direct all economies to intensify their climate actions given that recent studies show the world has failed to do enough to prevent climate change from causing greater harm to the world. Some countries, particularly small island states that are most vulnerable to climate change, demanded that all economies update their climate action plans by next year to reflect the new reality, saying the present sorry state of affairs was the result of developed economies not meeting their targets in the pre-2020 period. But the final agreement only included a call seeking ""the urgency of enhanced ambition"" by all economies without any agreement on updating the developed economies' climate action plans by 2020. Which means the next climate change conference faces the almost impossible task of completing all the unfinished work of the 2019 conference before the transition of the international climate regime from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the 2015 Paris Agreement. But since studies show the international community has to do much more than what the Paris accord mandates, economies have to increase their commitments, which is almost impossible given the present attitude of most of the economies. The outcome of the conference in Madrid has put the UN system under extreme pressure. With the goal to keep the average global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius from the pre-industrial level, the Madrid conference was scheduled to decide the extent to which the national pledges could be raised. But it failed to do so. As long as development means continuous expansion of production and consumption, we cannot expect anything to change, because rising consumption doesn't mean ensuring the well-being of the people but pampering to the greed of the haves. Unless there is a paradigm shift in the definition and execution of economic development, we cannot tackle climate change in the true sense. And as Guterres warned in Madrid on Thursday, failure to tackle climate change could result in economic disaster, and unrestrained climate change would allow only the ""survival of the richest"". The fact that Guterres was forced to say what the rest of the world has known for years shows that we indeed are facing a bleak future. The author is a senior editor with China Daily. \"
"COP25","China","COP25_China167","Banking on action: How ADB achieved 2020 climate finance milestone one year ahead of time","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","China Daily","By Takehiko Nakao | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2019-12-17 16:46 A view of the logo at the front building of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Mandaluyong city, East of Manila, Philippines. [Photo/IC] As developing countries in Asia-Pacific extend their power grids, build more roads and bigger cities, and cultivate forestland, they are increasingly contributing to the global climate change problem. Two of the top three emitters of greenhouse gases are developing countries in Asia. At the same time, five Asian developing countries are among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. Across the region, livelihoods and economic growth are increasingly exposed to climate change impacts and disaster risk. Clearly, Asia and the Pacific must play a strong role in efforts to address climate change. As the region's development bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to remaining the partner of choice for climate action by our developing member countries. In 2015, as world leaders gathered in New York to launch the Sustainable Development Goals, ADB made a bold announcement - a commitment to double our climate investment to $6 billion annually by the end of 2020. Coinciding with the call for action at COP25 , the United Nations' Conference on Climate Change, ADB has proudly reached this achievement one year ahead of time. ADB's climate-related financing for 2019 comprises $1.4 billion for financing adaptation and $4.8 billion for mitigating climate change. The feat is the result of a singular focus to integrate climate actions into our entire operations. ADB has introduced climate risk screening of our project portfolio, undertaken diagnostics on the critical infrastructure at risk in the region, and introduced new financing instruments such as contingent disaster risk financing for financial resilience. ADB is strengthening its investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, sustainable transport and urban development, and climate smart agriculture. This has been accompanied by actions to enhance the transparency of our climate operations by publicly disclosing project-level information of our climate portfolio and enhancing capacity and technical assistance for delivery. The spirit of One ADB has underpinned this achievement, with the collaboration of our sovereign and non-sovereign operations and knowledge departments steering us toward this target. One example of the many that illustrates this is the Pacific Renewable Energy Program, which is providing an innovative blend of loans, guarantees, and letters of credit to encourage private sector investments in renewable energy. ADB's treasury department also contributed to the endeavor by issuing green bonds amounting to $5 billion as an added financing mechanism. In addition to scaling up its own climate financing, ADB has been working on new and innovative co-financing opportunities with public and private partners. For example, ADB has mobilized concessional financing from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for nine projects worth a total of $473 million in grants and concessional financing. Building on the momentum of our climate finance milestone, ADB is pursuing new and ambitious targets on climate change for the coming decade in our Strategy 2030 - cumulative climate financing of $80 billion from 2019-2030 and a commitment to make 75 percent of our projects climate-relevant by 2030. Furthermore, by steadily increasing shadow carbon price, which factors climate costs into our project economic analysis, ADB is reflecting the urgency of shifting to low carbon alternatives. However, given the narrowing window for avoiding catastrophic climate change, mobilizing finance at the necessary speed and scale remains a huge challenge. The Nationally Determined Contributions of many countries have outlined the financing needed to achieve their climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement. According to one estimate, it is $4.4 trillion or $349 billion annually. While there are no robust and comprehensive estimates available for the Asia-Pacific, an assessment by ADB on Asia's infrastructure needs found that $200 billion will be needed annually to address climate actions in energy, water, and transport. Though national governments and development financing institutions should devote more of their financial resources, the bulk of climate financing will necessarily have to come from private investors. This highlights the need to deploy climate financing in a way that enables and mobilizes private sector finance. But the good news is there is a robust, and growing, body of evidence that the benefits of climate action already far outweigh the costs - representing a significant opportunity for the private sector. For example, the New Climate Economy Initiative, to which I have contributed as a Commissioner, has found that investment in low-carbon growth is associated with a cumulative economic gain of $26 trillion until 2030. Meanwhile, a recent report by the Global Commission on Adaptation found that investing $1.8 trillion globally from 2020 to 2030 in five key areas - early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture, mangrove protection, and more resilient water resources - could yield $7.1 trillion in net benefits. The provision of finance is just one part of the climate change puzzle - high technology, policy support, and capacity development to build better institution are also critical. But by further scaling up collective actions on addressing climate change by national governments, development partners, and the private sector, we can greatly respond to the voices of younger generations and vulnerable populations across the world for bolder action that ensures our common future on a healthy planet.

"COP25","China","COP25_China169","Time UN focused on solution providers","September 12, 2019 Thursday","China Daily European Edition","Doing more good better than doing less harm to reduce emissions In a few weeks the UN will con-vene a climate summit in New York. Unfortunately, the event will, again, be problem-focused. While well-intended, the focus on just reducing emissions from companies and countries is an approach we must move beyond in order to ensure a solution agenda for climate change in the future. The current approach by the UN and the World Economic Forum, which is helping it organize the event, is an accounting approach that focuses on commitment from business to reduce emissions. So, when companies, cities and financial institutions attend the UN climate action summit and talk about their contributions, they will focus on their own reductions and how big emitters can reduce their emissions within existing business models, rather than how innovative new products and services lead to reductions in society. This problem approach is not relevant if we are to deliver the dramatic emission reductions that are needed and ensure delivery on the other sustainable development goals. It is time to move beyond a business-as-usual approach where companies and countries only focus on reducing their existing emissions. We need a solution approach driven by companies, cities, countries and accelerators that focuses on accelerated uptake of innovative and disruptive solutions that will bring about significant changes in how we deliver what society needs. Many of the significant emission reductions today have been made possible by companies delivering solutions for nutrition, mobility and buildings in different parts of society, while not simply reducing their own emissions. Companies cite examples such as renewable energy, electric cars, dematerialization and virtual meetings, rather than reducing their own emissions. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (with global connectivity, new materials and new business models, and falling prices for many key technologies) provides ample opportunities that could radically reduce emissions by delivering much smarter solutions for mobility (including virtual mobility), building spaces (including virtual spaces) and nutrition (especially when linked to health and wellbeing). To accelerate emission reductions, companies, governments and the financial sector cannot be driven primarily by cost and risk reductions in existing systems. They must use their capacity to deliver the kind of innovation that delivers the solutions we need. Governments need to be able to set targets that support solution providers. Investors need to be able to identify winners in a low/zerocarbon economy (not just avoid the losers). Cities must assess how much they can help emission reduction. What is needed is a shift in emphasis from ""doing things less bad"" to ""doing good things"", but we will also need tools and methods to quantify and compare the impact of different solutions and potential solutions. HYPERLINK http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/img/attachement/jpg/site1/20190912/a41f726719b21ee3e0305b.jpg Link to Image By embracing a solution perspective, we will also support companies from traditional sectors and move toward sustainable innovation. Mining companies will shift focus from mines to providing materials in society with sustainable recycling. Automotive companies will move from cars to sustainable mobility, including teleworking and virtual meetings. There are positive signs that we are moving in the right direction, but too slowly. A problem focus will slow us down further. A number of studies show that experts now see real leadership among companies that try to deliver what society needs. In the report on the GlobeScan-SustainAbility annual survey, The 2017 Sustainability Leaders, two separate eras were identified. The first leadership era, ""do less harm"", lasted until 2006. The second era, ""sustainable growth"", began in 2007. It is therefore understandable that the UN is lagging behind, but it is time for it to move beyond ""do less harm"". The first era was dominated by big polluters who showed leadership by reporting and focusing on their own pollution, using traditional tools to measure carbon emissions. The UN needs to base future summits on solution frameworks, such as Mission Innovation's 1.5 C Compatibility Framework. Establishing new structures, knowledge and tools that support the move toward a service-based circular economy, where companies can assess their positive contributions, can help accelerate a sustainable transition. COP25 ), will present solution providers with the potential to reduce emissions by more than 150 million metric tons - more than Chile's current emissions - is good reason for hope moving forward. Emerging countries have a special role to play and hopefully we can see new solution initiatives from countries like Chile, India and China, where companies, countries, the finance sector, cities and accelerators commit to help accelerate the uptake of tomorrows' sustainable solutions. Such a solution perspective would also provide muchneeded optimism for the future and turn the existential threat of climate change into our generation's driver of innovation.

He made the ""painful"" decision to cancel the key events after weeks of riots over inequality in Chile that have left at least 23 people dead. ""I must always put the problems and interests of Chileans, their needs, their desires and their hopes first,"" he said. This is a major setback for all APEC members, and the world at large given the issues to be discussed at the meeting and conference have global ramifications. It was also expected that the ""phase one"" deal agreed between China and the United States would be signed, sealed and delivered on the sidelines of the APEC meeting that was due to be held on Nov 16-17. With ""alternative hosting options"" being explored for the meeting, including in the US and Macao, it seems likely that the much desired meeting between the leaders of the two countries - which is widely expected to take some of the heat out of the two countries' falling out - will take place at some point next month. But while an agreement of some description between the world's two largest economies would be a welcome shot in the arm for the global economy, given the underlying reasons for Chile pulling out as host of the APEC meeting and climate conference, the government leaders attending the meetings wherever and whenever they are held must do their utmost to ensure they are not just empty talk and come up with concrete actions to forge a better future for people around the world. While Chile's abrupt pullout has ruined all the meticulously devised plans and arrangements, its decision cannot be used as a convenient excuse to put on hold the difficult trade and climate discussions that were on the agenda. Rather what has happened in Chile underscores the urgency for those leaders that were due to gather in Santiago to work more closely to tackle some of the most pressing issues the world is facing, among them the most important is to address the rapidly increasing wealth gap globally by promoting inclusive growth. An Oxfam report revealed early this year that the 26 richest billionaires are worth as much as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world's population. The growing gap between rich and poor is undermining the fight against poverty, damaging the economies and fueling public anger around the world, which has been evidenced by the unrest in many places around the world, not just Chile.

Apart from the film, internationally famous Taiwan Vox Nativa Children's Choir and Ita Thao Dance Performers who performed in the documentary, were both invited to perform on the event. Mr. Bruce Cheng, founder of Delta and chairman of the Delta Electronics Foundation, said, ""Over the years, our Foundation has contributed to environmental causes through education, including initiatives that utilize Delta's display technologies capable of inspiring our stakeholders with their cutting-edge resolution and vivid colors. In the past, we have cooperated with Taiwan's Public Television Service in the production of the HD film 'Natural Formosa' and also with the late director Polin Chi in the production of Taiwan's first aerial photography documentary 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above', both of which highlighted the environmental damage caused by human activities and climate change with crystal-clear resolution. The 'Water with Life' film underscores the severity of droughts, coral bleaching and other related challenges in unparalleled 8K resolution, so that we all irrevocably understand the gravity of these matters."" Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, vice chairman of the Delta Electronics Foundation, said, ""Our 'Water with Life' film was firstly broadcasted by the Japanese satellite TV channel NHK BS 8K in March this year, and we have also continuously held non-profit screening events in Taiwan, Japan, and Mainland China for almost ten thousand people altogether. Numerous government officials and other prominent stakeholders have praised the film and our initiatives to raise awareness for water sustainability. Today, we are at the film's actual scene, Sun Moon Lake, an area with an incredible wealth in regards to water resources and culture. We hope these incredible 8K images nurture an everlasting bond between the audience and our water resources that encourages all to learn, cherish and safeguard our planet's water resources. We will further bring the film to the UN Climate Change Conference this year ( COP25 ) to raise people's awareness in confronting together the current global environmental crisis. The ""8K Projection at the Sun Moon Lake - Converging Greatness"" event for the ""Water with Life"" film includes the performance of the world-renowned Taiwan Vox Nativa Children's Choir, which played several classics such as ""You Raise Me Up"", and ""Kipahpah Ima"" for Encore. Then, the famous local dancer group, Ita Thao Dance Performers, performed their traditional dance to show their respect to water, which also features in the film. By using Delta's 8K projector with world-leading 36,000-lumen brightness, the revolutionary 8K images from the film allowed the more than 1,000 viewers to experience vividly the horrendous impact on water resources caused by climate change and human activities. At the end of the event, a floating sphere with diameter of 6m, also leveraging projected animation of the tribal legend from Ita Thao Community, symbolized the strong relationship between culture and the protection of water resources. Sponsored by Delta Foundation, the 45-minute ""Water with Life"" production was filmed by Japan's NHK Enterprises and is the world's first 8K environmental feature film. It displays a plethora of water scenery in Taiwan during the four different seasons of the year. More than 50 professionals were involved in the creation of the film during a period of 1 year and 9 months. The unmatched quality and meaningful message of the film were decisive elements for being selected on NHK BS 8K satellite TV channel in March 2019.

"COP25","China","COP25_China176","Swedish teen activist sails across Atlantic for UN climate meeting","August 30, 2019 Friday","China Daily","NEW YORK - Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg sailed into New York Harbor on Wednesday in a zero-carbon emissions vessel, completing her nearly 14-day journey from England to take part in a United Nations climate meeting. The 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl, who set sail from Plymouth, England, on Aug 14, was greeted by cheers, chants and singing as her silver sailboat, the Malitzia II, cruised past the Statue of Liberty through choppy waves and rain to drop anchor in Manhattan's yacht harbor. ""All of this is very overwhelming and the ground is still shaking for me,"" a seemingly bashful Thunberg, clad in a dark blue jumpsuit, told a gathering of reporters and activists who greeted her and the crew of the Malitzia II on land. ""It's insane that a 16-year-old had to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand on the climate crisis. This of course is not something I want everyone to do,"" she said. Thunberg made her trans-Atlantic journey carbon emission-free by traveling on the 18.3-meter yacht, which is equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines that produce electricity onboard, along with a large black sail carrying the message: ""Unite behind the science."" She is taking a year off school to pursue her activism. Her father, Svante Thunberg, crossed the ocean with her. No toilet The ship is built for high-speed, offshore racing, and weight is kept to a minimum. There is no toilet - just a bucket - or fixed shower onboard, no windows below deck and only a small gas stove to heat up freeze-dried food. Thunberg, who first drew international attention last year when she started missing school on Fridays to protest against political inaction on climate change, said she planned to take part in a demonstration outside the UN headquarters in New York on Friday. But first, she said, she planned to: ""Eat fresh food, not freeze dried, not be wet and to clean myself."" Peppered with questions from reporters about her message for US President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic, Thunberg suggested she was not interested in butting heads with the Republican leader. ""My message for him is just listen to the science, but he obviously doesn't do that. No one has been able to convince him of climate change, the urgency. Why should I be able to do that?"" she said. ""So I'm just going to focus on spreading awareness."" But far simpler things took precedence in her first hours in Manhattan. She said she can finally rest, take a shower and enjoy meals of ""fresh vegetables, not freeze-dried food"" like canned beans and corn. In addition to the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Thunberg intends to attend the COP 25 climate change conference in Santiago, Chile, in December, planning to make her way there without using air travel.

"COP25","China","COP25_China177","'Cold war' on a hot planet","December 5, 2019 Thursday","China Daily European Edition","With the run-up to the US presidential election, it is the season for bashing China. The Republicans and Democrats will try to out-do each other in painting China as the enemy of everything the United States stands for. Although some of it can be safely ascribed to the usual pre-election US political theatrics, there are new forces at work this time which should concern us all. There is a risk that China and the US are fast-becoming antagonists in a new cold war. The competition is not just in trade, technology, military prowess and spheres of influence. Hawkish talk about ""decoupling"" is being put forward despite the intricate interlinking of the two economies. Indeed, they have locked horns on pretty much everything. This is unwise and unnecessary. It also misses the biggest global security threat. A US-China ""cold war"" is not going to fix an increasingly hot planet. US politicians should not only work across the aisle but reach out to China for win-win outcomes. After all, the US and China are the principal players in an imminent climate change crisis that will upend the security of many countries around the world. Both have a special global responsibility and need a long-term collaborative and cooperative relationship if the crisis is going to be effectively addressed. The US has been the largest contributor historically to carbon emissions over the past 150 years and it remains the largest per capita contributor today. China, meanwhile, is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases by volume. Together, according to the UN Emissions Gap Report, they contribute nearly 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. The urgency of the situation was highlighted by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said on Sunday that the world's efforts to stop climate change have been ""utterly inadequate"" so far and that there was a danger global warming could pass the ""point of no return"". Speaking a day before Monday's start of the two-week long UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Guterres said the impact of rising temperatures\u-243 including more extreme weather\u-243 was already being felt around the world, with dramatic consequences for humans and other species. He said that the world had the scientific knowledge and the technical means to limit global warming, but ""what is lacking is political will. The point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and hurtling toward us."" Yet, the US, under the current administration, is in denial about the reality of climate change and instead celebrates its pro-oil, pro-coal push for even more greenhouse gas-related energy sources. China, while seeking to pursue more decarbonization strategies at home, remains a signatory to the Paris climate change agreement, but its greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing. It is unlikely US climate policy will change as long as the present administration is in power. If a Democrat wins the 2020 election, would there be a change? Not if the cold war mindset becomes entrenched in the American political psyche. All Democratic presidential candidates agree climate change is a global crisis and domestic policies and regulatory actions need to be substantially ramped up to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions. Elizabeth Warren has even acknowledged that if the US were to reach net-zero emissions as early as 2030, that would contribute only one-fifth to the global zero-emissions target\u-243 about 6 gigatons of the 30 gigatons required. As she has said, other countries will also need to slash their emissions. Other candidates agree that climate change requires a global focus, but frame it as the US assuming the lead role as ""the world's clean energy superpower,"" as Joe Biden puts it. Bernie Sanders adds an additional dimension by arguing that the US should contribute $200 billion to the UN's Green Climate Fund to enable less industrialized countries to shift from fossil fuel to clean energy sources rather than through US exports. In both cases, US action in global terms will be insufficient without Chinese inputs. None of the Democratic candidates identify collaboration and cooperation with China as part of the solution. But if the US wants to avert the worst results of climate change, it cannot just focus on what the US can do; it has to work with China. Collaboration could be accomplished through research exchanges and joint studies, shared technologies, joint development partnerships, climate dialogues, and, perhaps most importantly, joint commitments to undertake major restructuring in areas such as transportation, energy sources and use, land use, and agriculture and food production and consumption. Other initiatives, including decarbonizing shipping and aviation emissions, as well as institutional and subnational partnerships such as the one between UC Berkeley and Tsinghua University established a few months ago, are promising examples of how collaboration and cooperation could lead to changes that would not have happened or would have taken much longer to accomplish otherwise. The US and China are not only the two countries that shoulder the most responsibility at this moment for this imminent crisis; they are also the players most capable of helping reversing these dangerous and planet-threatening trends. Working together makes sense and an attractive political vision could be shaped. Promoting disengagement and all-out ""war"" will be costly. Rather than stoking fear, collaboration would offer security and hope, especially to younger generations who know they will bear the brunt of a hotter world.

"COP25","China","COP25_China178","Climate activist Thunberg to join zero-emissions transatlantic voyage","August 6, 2019 Tuesday","China Daily","Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who inspired tens of thousands of people to join a climate march last year, has begun a world tour that will entail crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a zero-emissions racing yacht. She posted on Twitter on Saturday a photo of herself standing next to a train in Sweden saying she is ""on the morning train to New York and Santiago de Chile"". Her first stop is Switzerland, where she will meet hundreds of climate activists from 37 countries at the ""Fridays for Future"" European summit in Lausanne during Aug 5-9. It was a movement, also known as ""school strike for the climate"", that spurred her to begin protesting outside the Swedish parliament in August last year demanding immediate action to fight climate change. Thunberg will then travel to the United Kingdom to join German sailor Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco aboard their emissions-free racing boat Malizia II to cross the Atlantic. In the United States, she plans to attend the United Nations Climate Action session in New York on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the annual UN General Assembly meeting, as well as climate protests planned for Sept 20-27. US President Donald Trump in June 2017 announced the withdrawal the US from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, dealing a heavy blow to the global cause to urgently reduce carbon emissions, a warning given by many scientists. Thunberg also plans to visit Canada and Mexico before joining the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) to be held in Santiago, Chile, on Dec 2-13. ""We are looking forward to seeing you and many other young people at the #ClimateAction Summit, @gretathunberg! Your generation has grasped the urgency of the climate crisis better than many others - it's time we listen,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, a passionate climate change fighter himself, replied last week on Twitter to Thunberg's trip announcement. According to the German news agency dpa, Thunberg was offered a ride on the 18.3-meter racing yacht to be captained by Herrmann and Casiraghi. Her father, Svante Thunberg, and filmmaker Nathan Grossman, who will document the trip, will also be aboard on the transatlantic voyage. ""I feel humbled that Greta accepted our offer as the lowest-carbon option to cross the Atlantic - despite the lack of comfort for her,"" Herrmann said in a statement. The racing boat is ""outfitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to allow for a zero-carbon, trans-Atlantic voyage,"" said the statement. Thunberg announced in June she would take a year off school to focus on the fight against climate change. She has sparked a climate movement in Europe and beyond. She has spoken at the COP24 in Poland in December, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January and the European Parliament in April. The climate activist was nominated in March as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.

"COP25","China","COP25_China179","Opinion: Negotiating While the World Burns","December 27, 2019 Friday 7:11 AM GMT","Caixin Global","The 2010s may be remembered as the decade when the fight against harmful climate change was lost. In 2015, at the COP21 climate conference in Paris, 196 countries agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have continued to increase, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest levels in 800,000 years, and current policies will likely result in warming of about 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. Moreover, the recent COP25 negotiations in Madrid ended in failure, with governments squabbling over the value and allocation of ""carbon credits"" held over from a discredited previous policy regime. At the same time, however, stunning technological progress during the 2010s makes it possible to cut GHG emissions at a cost far lower than we dared hope a decade ago. The costs of solar and wind power have fallen more than 80% and 70%, respectively, while lithium-ion battery costs are down from $1,000 per kilowatt-hour in 2010 to $160 per kilowatt-hour today. These and other breakthroughs guarantee that energy systems which are as much as 85% dependent on variable renewables could produce zero-carbon electricity at costs that are fully competitive with those of fossil-fuel-based systems. In addition, it is now clear that even the ""harder-to-abate"" sectors of the economy, such as heavy industry (including steel, cement, and chemicals) and long-distance transport (shipping, aviation, and trucking), can be decarbonized at costs which, although significant for any one company acting alone, are trivial in terms of the impact on people's living standards. In May, the United Kingdom's Committee on Climate Change estimated that achieving a zero-carbon U.K. economy by 2050 would reduce GDP that year by no more than 1% to 2%. Back in 2008, the same committee, which I then chaired, had estimated a similar cost to achieve only an 80% reduction in emissions. Lower decarbonization costs and growing awareness of climate risks have in turn prompted an increasing focus on the possibility and necessity of meeting the zero-emissions goal by 2050. In July, the U.K. made a legally binding commitment to meet that objective, and the European Union agreed on the same goal earlier this month. Furthermore, Maersk, the world's largest container-shipping firm, the Swedish steel producer SSAB, and the Indian cement company Dalmia are among the growing number of leading businesses committed to being zero-carbon by 2050 or earlier. To achieve the Paris agreement's climate objective, all developed economies must become zero-carbon by around mid-century, and could do so at a minimal cost to living standards. And such efforts also must include China. How rapidly China reduces emissions is therefore crucial. The country currently accounts for almost 30% of global CO2 emissions, and its per capita emissions are due to overtake Europe's declining figure within a few years. So, if China does not dramatically cut emissions by 2050, whether Europe reduces them by 80% or 100% will have minimal impact on the rate of global warming. China should aim to be not only a fully developed economy by 2050, but also a zero-carbon one. Achieving this will of course require huge investments. The electricity production required to support rising living standards in China, and to achieve widespread electrification of transport, residential heating, and industry, could increase from 6,700 terawatt-hours today to 14,000 to 15,000 terawatt-hours by 2050. That implies a tripling of annual wind and solar investment in order to increase renewable capacity to almost 5,000 gigawatts by 2050, together with 230 gigawatts of nuclear. But as a recent Energy Transitions Commission report points out, even this enormous capacity increase, along with additional investment in energy transmission, distribution, and storage, would require an overall increase in Chinese investment of less than 1% of GDP - and this in a country that saves and invests over 40% of it. Moreover, the total impact on China's GDP in 2050, and thus on consumer living standards, would be a similarly low 1% - and potentially far less, because the zero-carbon commitment would stimulate technological progress and improve productivity. Following the failure in Madrid, attention will now focus on prospects for the COP26 conference in Glasgow next year. That gathering, too, could get bogged down in fruitless disputes as climate diplomats argue over minor tradeoffs in supposed ""burden-sharing."" Instead, governments should concentrate on the huge potential benefits of building a zero-carbon global economy. Developed economies, plus rapidly developing China, should therefore unilaterally commit to achieving zero emissions by 2050, confident that the cost to their economies will be very small. Emerging economies should commit to meeting the same target a decade later, confident that the technological progress involved in reducing emissions in developed countries will reduce the costs of decarbonization over time. In addition, both developed and developing countries should focus on the globally important question that the International Energy Agency highlighted in its latest World Energy Outlook: how to unleash massive investment in renewable electricity in low-income economies. That applies particularly to Africa, a continent with the world's best solar resources but currently less than 1% of its solar photovoltaic capacity. If next year's COP26 can successfully address these big opportunities and challenges, the 2020s might be the decade in which we start winning the climate-change battle.

"COP25","China","COP25_China180","Multilateral forums need to be relevant again","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","Global Times (China)","Nicholas Rosellini Photo: Li Qingqing/GT Editor's Note:Unilateralism is on a global upsurge. As the United Nations (UN) embodies international society's pursuit of multilateralism, what solution can it provide to deal with unilateralism? How can China and the UN cooperate to maintain multilateralism worldwide? Global Times (GT) reporter Li Qingqing talked to UN Resident Coordinator in China Nicholas Rosellini (Rosellini) about the issues on December 4.GT: Since its founding, the UN has contributed greatly to world peace and stability. But given the rise of populism and unilateralism now, how would you describe the situation of multilateral cooperation globally? Is it facing a temporary setback or could it be in retreat for a long run?Rosellini: I think all of us have to accept the fact that at the moment, multilateralism is under a lot of pressure. But at the same time, we see an increasing need for multilateralism. We see the challenge of climate change, inequality in the world, unbalanced development between different countries and within countries, and the challenge of achieving The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). On one hand, the 2030 Agenda needs a global approach. On the other, there is pressure on multilateralism.We have to recreate the coalitions which accept that the global challenges need global solutions. We also need multilateral platforms to deliver these solutions. Indeed, multilateralism is under pressure, but if we reexamine where the demand for these global solutions is, and how to update the multilateral platforms to make them relevant again, I think we can make sure that multilateral approaches can continue to be the choice of countries around the world.GT: UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said, ""The world is fracturing, but no country can repair the cracks in isolation."" As unilateralism raises its head, what is the UN's solution to cope with it?Rosellini: We have to redemonstrate that multilateral platforms can still deliver durable global solutions to some of the challenges we are facing. That means we have to be willing to reform, and we have to be willing to listen to the citizenry of the world. The year 2020 sees the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UN, and Guterres is launching a major worldwide campaign to encourage people to participate in the global conversation about the future of multilateralism, the future of the UN and how we need to change to be relevant in the future.We know there are questions that we need to address as a global community, and we know the UN can contribute to addressing some of those challenges. We just have to make sure that we are relevant to address the challenges.GT: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said during his meeting with Guterres in November that China will continue to uphold multilateralism in the context of complex international situations. How can China and the UN cooperate to maintain multilateralism worldwide?Rosellini: China has already become a very important member of the UN. China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the second-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and the leading contributor to peacekeeping both in terms of money and personnel. So, China really has an important role in the UN. Looking ahead, we want to see that role continue to grow, and we see the importance of collaboration with China.China, as the second-largest economy in the world, has an important development impact on the rest of the world. We want to explore the opportunities in terms of China's South-South Cooperation as well as its investment in developing countries to see how we can support their alignment with the SDGs.If we look at China's engagement with the world, some of it is through the UN, and some of it is with countries bilaterally. It is important that we see how to support both China and the partner countries in terms of using the available resources in a way that supports the implementation of the SDGs. The recent Belt and Road Forum, for example, is a very strong commitment to align the Belt and Road investments with environmental, economic and social sustainability. China plays an important role in politics and peacekeeping in the world. I think it will also play an important role in development.GT: The 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP25 , kicked off in Spain on December 2. It discussed whether the promises of the Paris Agreement would be fully implemented. The US has quit the Paris Agreement, to what extent will this affect the global fight against climate change?Rosellini: There is no doubt that we need a big push in accelerating the global effort against climate change. We really need to understand and take actions in terms of the extent of the climate emergency we are facing, and it really needs the contribution of all countries. The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is well above the limits we are trying to set, which hasn't been seen in 2 or 3 million years. Emissions continue to rise year on year. We are not meeting the Paris Agreement commitments, and we are far away from being able to increase those commitments. The prospect of reaching a global warming stabilization level is quite remote at the moment. This is really worrying for the future of the planet and humanity. As we look ahead, it is important that we do see how we can increase commitments from all countries, in or out of the Paris Agreement.But of course, we have to recognize these differentiated responsibilities, and we have to take into account the relative economic strength of different countries and the historical level of emissions, so that we can have equity in how the reductions are applied. We hope that we can bring all countries in.GT: You said in October that China's vast experience in dealing with agricultural development challenges, increasing income and avoiding environmental damage is a great resource for the whole world. How can China's experience align with UN 2030 Agenda?Rosellini: China has experience in developing the agricultural sector, agro-industry and the whole agriculture value chain, particularly since the country's reform and opening-up. In the UN 2030 Agenda, there are SDGs about eliminating poverty, hunger and ensuring food security for all. China has already made great contributions in these areas. When we look ahead to the next 10 years, we can see how these experiences can help other countries achieve the elimination of rural poverty and food security.The question is how can China's experience be customized to be relevant to other countries? China is a vast country. If things in China are scaled up, they need to be brought down to scale in other smaller countries, with different systems of governance and culture.

"COP25","China","COP25_China181","2020, the year of living dangerously","January 17, 2020 Friday","Global Times (China)","Photo: VCG The beginning of a new decade has a happy ring to it - a feeling of turning a page, of starting anew, of a fresh impetus. Yet, this year of the rat according to the Chinese calendar looks ominous, one in which the world will face many daunting challenges.The gathering storm between the US and Iran brought to the fore by the killing of General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad and the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane over Iran with which the year began is, of course, the most obvious signal of simmering conflicts around the world.How likely is it they will explode, drawing in many other players? Which are the flashpoints to watch? Is it true, as many say, that things will get worse before they get better? Here is my take on some key issues and how they will shape our increasingly endangered planet.Global warming: Climate change is perhaps the defining issue of our time. We only have a small window of opportunity to do the needful to avoid reaching a 2-centigrade increase in temperatures that would be catastrophic. Yet, no substantial progress is taking place in reducing global carbon emissions. COP25 , the big conference held on the subject in Madrid in December, was a fiasco. Some would say that the fires that engulf much of New South Wales and other states in Australia, burning eight million hectares and killing a billion animals, provide a frightening, hell-like preview of what we shall soon see elsewhere as a result of rising temperatures, widespread droughts and climate-change denialist governments.The second cold war: Far from de-escalating, tensions between the United States and China, if anything, increased in 2019, and show few signs of abating in the new year. Yes, the first phase of a truce in the trade war between both countries is in the offing, and some details about what the second phase would entail are emerging. But tensions on the technology front have not diminished, and many seem happy to ratchet up, rather than down, the us-versus-them rhetoric that feeds on itself. In a US election year, this is unlikely to change. The relaunch of the Committee on the Present Danger, once focused on the Soviet Union, and now on China, is not encouraging.An unraveling WTO: Much of the growth and prosperity we have seen in the course of the past three decades, which has led, among other things, to the achieving of the UN Millennium Development Goals, including the drastic, worldwide reduction of poverty, has been driven by high global trade volumes. This slowed down after the 2008-09 financial crisis. Yet, the entity responsible for this open trading system is in crisis. The Doha Round negotiations have stalled since 2008, thus rendering moot one of the WTO's main functions. Now, since December 10, 2019, its other function, that of resolving trade disputes, is also inoperative. Its Appellate Body, normally made up of seven members, has now been left with only one, as the US has blocked all new appointments, leaving it with no working quorum.A go-for-it Brexit: Until the recent UK elections, there was still hope Brexit might be stalled in one way or another, and thus avoid what some consider to be the first step toward the break-up of Europe. With an overwhelming majority won by the Tories in these elections, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the helm, that hope is now gone. For the next few years, both Britain and the EU will be consumed by the protracted negotiations to make that happen, precluding the EU from playing a forward role in global affairs, at a time when it will be most needed.A proxy-war riven Middle East: The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi government, within the confines of its own consulate in Istanbul in 2018, indicated the degree to which all bets are off in a region that jumps from crisis to crisis. The Sunni-Shia conflict within the Muslim world, reflecting the geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, is in full swing. Syria and Iraq stand firmly with Iran, Sunni-majority countries like Egypt do so with the Saudis, and those like Lebanon are caught in the middle. The full break-up of the US-Iran nuclear deal, and Tehran's signals that it now feels free to join the nuclear arms race, add to an already volatile situation.A case can be made that all these issues are long-in-the-making processes that took many years to come to the fore and will not necessarily reach a boiling point in 2020. Touch\'e9. Yet, my point is a different one. It is the combination of such serious global governance issues with trade and technological tensions at a time of increasing disregard for once established norms of international behavior that creates such an international tinderbox.And this is not by happenstance. As Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci put it, ""a crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born. In this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear."" As the unipolar world that emerged at the end of the Cold War gives way to a new one, whose hallmarks are globalization and multipolarity, there is resistance and reaction against the newly emerging order. In many ways, the populist movements in the developed world are a reaction against the decline of the West and the rise of the Rest. Their disregard for the established rules of international behavior is part of the appeal to their electoral base.None of this makes for smooth sailing. But it does put a special premium on the leadership of the rising powers of the Global South to keep the ship of global governance on an even keel as we enter an especially fraught year.The author is a research professor at the Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University, a Wilson Center global fellow and a non-resident senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

"COP25","China","COP25_China185","News Analysis: G20 reaffirms free trade, stresses role of multilateralism amid global challenges","June 29, 2019 Saturday 10:17 PM GMT","Xinhua General News Service","by Dan Ran, Yi Ling OSAKA, Japan, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) economies on Saturday concluded their two-day summit in Japanese city of Osaka, following intense discussions to seek common ground on pressing global issues. G20 leaders issued a declaration at the conclusion of the summit and pledged actions to address economic downside risks and promote free trade. REAFFIRMING FREE TRADE, OPEN MARKET Throughout its G20 presidency, Japan has been keen to put the world's 20 major economies on the same page over pressing global issues, in particular free trade and multilateral system. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged fellow leaders to send a ""strong message for the maintenance and strengthening of free, fair and non-discriminatory trade,"" saying that Japan will continue to promote the improvement of multilateral trading system and consensus on economic cooperation. His call was echoed by many G20 members, including the world's second largest economy China, which renewed its commitment to upholding the multilateral trading system and pledged to further open up its market, expand imports and advance trade talks. According to the leaders' declaration, the G20 economies will ""strive to realize free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open."" Denisse V. Rudich, director of the G20 Research Group London, saw the support for WTO reform and promoting free trade as the most important outcomes of the summit. The commitment pointed to ""how they (G20 members) can scale back protectionism and continue to promote trade liberalization, which is incredibly important,"" she told Xinhua on Saturday. According to Joseph Matthews, senior professor at BELTEI International University Phnom Penh, the right direction for G20 is to ""discuss on equal-footing the issue of trade tariffs and create fair trade and equal opportunity global environment"" where countries have access to the global market ""without being discriminated."" In a major development, China and the United States on Saturday agreed to restart economic and trade consultations on the basis of equality and mutual respect; they also agreed that the U.S. side will not add new tariffs on Chinese exports, and the two countries' economic and trade negotiating teams will discuss specific issues. ""It is a very positive outcome,"" said Jonathan M. Luckhurst, associate professor at Graduate School of International Peace Studies of Soka University. ""It's one of the 'value-added' benefits of these kinds of forums. They provide an opportunity for the leaders to get together to discuss and overcome negotiation problems,"" he told Xinhua. MULTILATERALISM STILL PLAYING CRUCIAL ROLE The world's major economies are not without differences, especially on issues such as trade and climate change, raising concerns about a possible weakening role of multilateral forums such as the G20. At Osaka summit, many leaders and other stakeholders were determined to uphold the multilateral approach in tackling global challenges. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker noted that issues like climate change, sustainable development, terrorism, trade and global economic growth cut across boundaries, societies and economies, and require a concerted, comprehensive response within the framework of a multilateral rules-based system. ""Multilateralism is in the Europe's DNA. By being united and working together, we make ourselves individually and collectively stronger,"" said Juncker in a message to the summit. China, France and the United Nations on Saturday held a trilateral meeting on climate change, one of the key topics on this year's G20 summit, and agreed that all countries should uphold multilateralism, fulfill the Paris Agreement commitments, and help push for fruitful results of the 2019 Climate Action Summit and the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""Multilateralism is the best way of dealing with most of the global problems ... because on many issues, you need a lot of countries to be involved, especially on climate change,"" said Luckhurst. Multilateral approach works better because it gives some of the smaller countries and developing countries more opportunities to be heard and have more influence, he said. Upholding multilateralism is the right direction for G20, said Lee Sang-man, professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies of Kyungnam University, adding that the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative is a way to strengthen cross-border communication and consultation, so as to achieve common development and shared benefits. ""The international community should go towards multilateralism that advocates cooperation, instead of unilateralism,"" he said. FRESH CHALLENGES AMID RAPID DEVELOPMENT At the leaders' declaration, G20 economies agreed to harness the power of technological innovation, in particular digitalization, and its application for the benefit of all. The world economy is facing structural problems, and the way to solve them is to reduce barriers resulting from trade protectionism, and uphold multilateralism, increase technology exchange between countries and find new growth impetus, said Han Jae Jin, manager of the global emerging markets team of South Korea's Hyundai Research Institute. A special session on digital economy was held during the summit, and the G20 leaders adopted the Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy, affirming ""the importance of promoting national and international policy discussions for harnessing the full potential of data and digital economy to foster innovation,"" so as to ""keep pace with the fast-growing digital economy and maximize the benefits of digitalization and emerging technologies."" ""Big data, AI, the fourth industrial revolution, they are progressing rapidly,"" said Japanese Prime Minister Abe at the press conference after the summit, adding that regarding data, there is a need to create new rules. G20 comprises 19 countries plus the European Union (EU). The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, Britain and the United States.

"COP25","China","COP25_China187","The Australian Warning","January 23, 2020 Thursday","Beijing Review","Ruins left by bushfires in the village of Wingello, about one and a half hour's drive from Canberra, capital of Australia, on January 12 (XINHUA) Australia's catastrophic bushfires have been burning across the continent for over the last couple of months, destroying towns and communities. At least 28 people have been killed so far and more than 10 million hectares burned down since September 2019. The economic loss is estimated at about $3.35 billion and the infrastructure has sustained huge damage. Still the fires continue to rage out of control. Across the world, there are prayers for rain for much-needed relief. Underlying causes What are the underlying causes of this unprecedented devastation in the history of Australia? The immediate cause appears to be the extreme weather conditions this summer high temperatures, the super dry air, strong winds and scanty rainfall. A sustained drought, which has gripped the country for three consecutive winters, has made forests and bushes drier and more flammable than ever. Climate change has intricate impacts on the environment in many ways. Though Australia holds one of the best national climate records in the world for more than 100 years, according to historical data, average temperatures have risen by 1 degree Celsius since 1910. The country is currently experiencing one of its driest seasons in the last five decades. The government's climate policy is inadequate, still dominated by fossil fuel interests. The oil and gas industry lobby spent millions of dollars trying to deter the federal government from introducing more clean-energy and positive climate policies. According to the Department of Industry, Innovation, and Science, Australia is expected to surpass Qatar as the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer. LNG production and processing for export has risen rapidly, leading to substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions, especially after the government abolished a national carbon pricing mechanism in 2014. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who came into office in 2018, further reversed the policy for cutting the emissions. The current worst-case scenario predictions suggest that national emissions will increase until 2030 under the current policies. Australia is likely to fall short of its commitments to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The wildfires are the latest climate-change alert for humanity. People still remember the Amazon rainforest fires in Brazil and the California wildfires in the U.S. last summer. Facts show that the pace of climate change is accelerating. Fire trucks work to douse a blaze in western Victoria, Australia, on December 20, 2019 (XINHUA) Act now The landmark Paris Agreement to set out a new global framework to fight dangerous climate change seems to have effected nothing much so far. There is no real cooperation among countries and no meaningful negotiations. The annual UN climate conference, COP25 , closed with a vacuous statement in Madrid in December 2019. Almost 200 countries made little progress in hammering out rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. According to reports from Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks climate action and global efforts, just eight countries have offered pledges to cut emissions sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement to contain global warming rise by 2 degrees Celsius at the most, with a desire for 1.5 degrees Celsius. All others are insufficient, highly insufficient or critically insufficient. Under the current pledges, the world will get warmer by 2.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, close to twice the limit agreed on in Paris. Some governments are even further from the Paris temperature limit in terms of their real-world action, which would see the temperature rise by 3 degrees Celsius. It is not surprising that the Paris Agreement is in jeopardy. Addressing climate change is a collective-action issue, an urgent, complex global challenge, and needs mutual trust and cooperation among the major countries. But the current international situation is complicated. The U.S. has filed paperwork to begin the process of withdrawing from the pact, dealing a major blow to international climate cooperation. Under the Paris Agreement, all member countries agreed to set goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions on a voluntary basis without any monitoring and enforcement mechanism. Each party's pledge known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs is not legally binding. Recent reports have revealed that the current commitments expressed in the NDCs are insufficient to meet the agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. On the contrary, we are using more oil and gas and greenhouse gas emissions have risen by roughly 3 percent each year globally. Green fundraising has become an uphill task. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) established in 2010 had the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020. But it has always been struggling to raise the promised money from economically developed countries, some of which are reluctant to help the people who are the most impacted. U.S. President Donald Trump has since withdrawn $2 billion of the $3 billion that was promised before. Two rounds of fundraising produced less than $20 billion for developing nations. There is still a serious funding gap to support green projects for the 2020-23 period. A man wears a mask on January 2 as air quality deteriorates in Canberra, with the continuing wildfires in many parts of the country (XINHUA) Critical actors Australia's bushfires are a warning to arouse awareness of ecological and environmental protection globally and move international climate cooperation forward. Efforts should be intensified to tap the potential for cooperation among major countries that are not only the biggest carbon emitters but also have global or regional clout. Their stance will have great impact on the global climate change governance system. With the goal of building a community with a shared future for humanity, significant progress has been made in climate and clean energy cooperation between China, Brazil, South Africa, India and the EU. The China-U.S. climate cooperation will exert a great impact globally. China and the U.S. account for around 40 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted in the world today. The two recently signed a phase-one economic and trade deal, which will have a positive effect on stabilizing the overall relationship and could enhance bilateral partnership on clean energy and climate change. Multilateralism needs to be followed with the authority of the UN maintained. There are serious flaws in the Paris Agreement, but we should respect and safeguard the accomplishments so hard won by the international community. All parties to it should speed up settlement of the remaining issues on implementation rules, an important basis for putting the pact into practice. Also, all actors state, sub-national and non-state should be encouraged to play a more active role in taking climate actions like mitigation, adaptation and supporting activities. Local governments, cities and businesses represent a great portion of the global economy and population. In the absence of federal policies in some countries, like the U.S. and Australia, these actors are critical for achieving national goals and the Paris Agreement's goals for reducing emissions.

FRANCOIS LENOIR/REUTERS Anyone who doubted the impact climate change is having on the environment only has to look at Australia and the bushfires that have scorched large parts of the country in recent months for proof that we have a problem. The study warns that the number of climate disasters could double in 13 years, and ""severely damage the environment, socioeconomic progress, and welfare of millions of people worldwide"". Its findings make a strong and urgent case for implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Although the Jan 23 study focuses on just two impacts of climate-flooding and storms such as hurricanes and typhoons\u-243 it is one more ""piece of evidence"" showing just how serious climate change has become, the lead author of the study, Ramon Lopez, said. ""There is little time left to avoid even worse catastrophes for the ensuing decades than the ones that we are now predicting for the next decade,"" said Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile, in Santiago, who has spent much of his academic life examining the economic impact of climate change. He said the time has now come to end the global political debate and promises of policy changes. ""What we need now is real action, especially by the big polluters,"" Lopez said. ""Short of massive social pressure, governments are not going to do much more than make promises\u-243 and while social awareness is rising, effective pressures on politicians that we now observe are just not enough. ""Some leaders simply do not see the need for action, and others are just too much concerned about the short run and lack the courage"" to implement the needed climate action measures, he said. Don Clifton, with the School of Management at the University of South Australia, agrees. ""I don't expect those in the current (Australian) government who deny the human link with global warming will change their minds,"" he said. ""For them it is not a matter of science; it's an ideological issue. No amount of scientific evidence will change this."" High costs Lopez said the cost in terms of human lives, and quality of life, for the people who are and will be affected by flooding and storms will be high. ""The economic cost alone of relocating entire cities or building the necessary infrastructure to protect against flooding is huge,"" he said. As an example, he cited Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans, in the United States, in 2005. ""The cost of partially protecting the city against another Katrina has been $25 billion so far,"" he said. Vinod Thomas, a former senior vice-president with the World Bank, who co-authored the study, said if carbon emissions continue to rise at the current rate ""we can expect to see more intense storms and floods"". COP 25 )"" in Madrid in December that policymakers ""show no urgency to reverse climate change"". The study used climate data from 155 countries\u-243 taken from 1970 to 2016\u-243 and a statistical and econometric approach, rather than climate models, to assess the factors that have contributed to the increase in the frequency of intense flood and storm events. ""The findings show that in addition to socioeconomic factors, the continuous increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the past four decades is significantly correlated with the increase in the number of extreme flood and storm events,"" said Thomas. ""That means human actions have a decisive role in climate change. The results show that global climate conditions significantly affect the frequency of these disasters."" The results of the study suggest that if the CO2 level increases by 1 percent, floods and storms would increase by nearly 9 percent. David Holmes, director of the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Melbourne's Monash University, said the recent bushfires in Australia are ""not just about cyclical drought, ...but about the fact that southern and inland areas of Australia are becoming much drier in a way that is overwhelming typical variability"". ""In the last 15 years, Australia saw eight of its 10 warmest years on record. Climate scientists tell us that, with climate change, weather systems increasingly move poleward,"" he said.

We welcome the Ministerial and other high-level Meetings held this year in the areas of finance, trade, foreign affairs, national security matters, communications, environment, labor and employment, science, technology and innovation, energy, agriculture, health and culture. We also note the Meeting of New Development Bank Board of Governors. 4. We welcome, among other achievements, the establishment of the Innovation BRICS Network (iBRICS); the adoption of the New Architecture on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), which will be implemented through the BRICS STI Steering Committee, and the Terms of Reference of the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform. We also welcome the holding of the BRICS Strategies for Countering Terrorism Seminar, the Workshop on Human Milk Banks and the BRICS Meeting on Asset Recovery. We commend the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding among BRICS Trade and Investment Promotion Agencies (TIPAs), and the establishment of the BRICS Women Business Alliance (WBA). We further appreciate the approval of the Collaborative Research Program for Tuberculosis, and other initiatives promoted by the 2019 BRICS Chairship. Strengthening and reforming the multilateral system 6. We reiterate the urgent need to strengthen and reform the multilateral system, including the UN, the WTO, the IMF and other international organizations, which we will continue working to make more inclusive, democratic and representative, including through greater participation of emerging markets and developing countries in international decision-making. We reiterate our commitment to shaping a more fair, just, equitable and representative multipolar international order. We also underline the imperative that international organizations be fully driven by Member States and promote the interests of all. 7. We recall the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirm the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective, and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN. 8. We express our commitment to sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner. All our citizens, in all parts of our respective territories, including remote areas, deserve to fully enjoy the benefits of sustainable development. International cooperation in this field, as in all others, must respect national sovereignty and domestic legal and institutional frameworks and arrangements, as well as practices and procedures. 9. We reiterate the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and call for redoubled efforts for its timely implementation. We call on developed countries to fully implement their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments and to provide developing countries with additional development resources. 10. We reiterate our commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. We urge developed countries included in Annex II to scale up the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building assistance to developing countries to support mitigation and adaptation action. We expect that the first replenishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) by the end of 2019 will significantly exceed the initial resource mobilization, ensuring that financial contributions by donors match the ambition, needs and priorities of developing countries. We are also committed to working for the success of UNFCCC COP 25 , particularly with regard to achieving a balanced and comprehensive outcome on all remaining items of the Paris Agreement Work Program. 11. We recall the BRICS MOU on Regional Aviation and value the cooperation among BRICS countries in the field of civil aviation. Acknowledging the critical role played by the aviation sector in emerging markets, including in BRICS countries, and considering the potential impacts of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) on the growth of the aviation sector, we reiterate our commitment to work together on the review process of the framework.

Speaking at the Leaders Event of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP 21 , in Paris, President Buhari said climate change has continued to pose a threat to Nigeria's security and development. At the sub-regional level, we are saddled with the challenge of the drying up of the Lake Chad Basin, which is resulting in the total wipe out of livelihoods of many communities surrounding this transboundary natural resource. Regrettably, the world is leaving behind millions of people who depend on the Lake for their survival. The Government of Nigeria welcomes the Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Plan, and the Lake Chad Basin Commission and international partners for designing this climate-based Plan. In all, the experience of countries sharing the Lake Chad further illustrates the mutual challenge we face today and which must be collectively addressed without further delay."" On Nigeria's position on the climate change negotiations, President Buhari said any meaningful and potential agreement on climate change in Paris, must draw extensively on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities."" The President, who shortly before his arrival to Paris approved Nigeria's Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC) to tackle climate change , said for any agreement in Paris to be durable, it must recognize not only the emission right but also the survival rights of the citizens of developing countries."" The President also used the occasion of his address to around 150 leaders, who attended the opening ceremony of the summit, to affirm Nigeria's position of a potential agreement that equitably addresses climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. He said the potential agreement must make provisions for adequate financing, technology transfer and capacity development in the developing countries. The President therefore called for the establishment of an effective means of monitoring, reviewing and verification of availability as well as accessibility of funds to the developing countries in order to address the challenges of climate change. He assured world leaders of Nigeria's readiness to support a legally binding and all-encompassing Paris Agreement, which must be fair to all. \"

Saraki said legislators at the Globe summit had a challenge to go back to their home countries and domesticate the issues raised and share the experiences gathered so as to spread the success recorded in some places and avoid the mistakes encountered in some other countries. ""We must make changes through our parliaments. Parliamentarians are better placed to lead the campaign through legislations and advocacy programmes for the needed change of attitude, required investment and consistent attention necessary to reduce global warming and its dangerous consequence"", he added. Also speaking during the session, Representative Kenza El-Ghali, who is Vice President of the Chamber of Representatives in the Kingdom of Morroco, narrated the consistent laws and policies which the North African nation had initiated since 1992 towards promoting sustainable environment in line with global best practices. She said Morroco had initiated water and agriculture policies which have helped to promote a clean environment and that since 2010 the focus has shifted to having an energy policy focused on solar power through which 16,000 jobs have been created. In his contribution at the session, Dr. Kennedy Graham, who is President of Globe in New Zealand said his country has the specific challenge of earthquake and that the development has tasked the initiative of policy makers on the need to avert disaster and mitigate losses suffered by citizens during disasters.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria9","15 Million Babies Are Born Prematurely Every Year - WHO","November 18, 2015","Leadership (Abuja)","The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that around 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. This means 1 in 10 babies born worldwide. According to the agency in a press statement obtained by our correspondent in New York on Wednesday, of these 15 million premature babies, around 1 million die from complications due to prematurity. More than three quarters of these babies could be saved through better access to quality care and medicines for both mother and baby, WHO further said. The statement pressed further that complications of preterm births are the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, stressing that without appropriate treatment, those who survive often face lifelong disabilities, including learning, visual and hearing problems and their quality of life is greatly affected. In an effort to improve preterm birth outcomes, the statement said WHO had published recommendations for managing preterm births that are designed to save lives and improve the health of preterm infants. Many of these recommendations are simple, proven and cost-effective measures. In a related development, the WHO has called on countries to protect health from climate change, saying that climate change is already causing tens of thousands of deaths every year - from shifting patterns of disease, from extreme weather events, such as heat-waves and floods, and from the degradation of air quality, food and water supplies, and sanitation. The agency said the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP-21 In 2012, WHO estimated 7 million people died from air pollution-related diseases, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps. Not only are ways to combat climate change already known and well-documented, they can bring important health gains. As WHO's new series of climate change and health country profiles illustrate, investments in low-carbon development, clean renewable energy, and strengthening climate resilience, are also investments in health. \"

Stephane Gompertz, France's Ambassador for Climate Change, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Sunday that Nigeria is a major stakeholder in the Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 Paris conference, ( COP 21 ) and was yet to submit it INDCs. COP 21 . ""That document presents the intentions of specific government regarding the fight against climate change as far as what we call mitigation is concerned, limiting or diminishing emission of greenhouse gases. ""The document also contains the intentions of government regarding adaptation, helping people, communities or villages to cope with the consequences of climate change, which are here really,"" he said. Gompertz, however, expressed concern that Nigeria was yet to submit its INDCs after the Oct. 1 deadline, in spite of the extension of the initial deadline from March. According to the French ambassador, Nigeria, as an influential country in Africa, needed to spur other countries into action. ""So far, 150 countries have produced their INDCs, Nigeria hasn't, which I think is a pity. ""Besides, Nigeria is particularly interested because it is affected by climate change, and she is also an oil-producing country. ""Nigeria is a country which has great potential in UN renewable energies. So, Nigeria should set an example for other countries,"" he said. Gompertz pointed out the impacts of climate change in Nigeria is manifesting in the form of coastal erosion, desertification and deforestation, adding that African was more affected than other continents. He, however, expressed confidence in the commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari to climate change issues. ""It is a bit of a paradox because we know that on a personal basis, President Buhari is committed to preserving the environment. ""This, he has said repeatedly to our President when they met with each other,"" he said. The French envoy also said that the late submission of the INDCs had implications on the country. ""There is an implication; recently, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat has set a deadline for the submission of INDCs and that deadline was Oct. 1. ""Why? Because the secretariat has to make a synthesis of all the INDCs received and make a report for COP 21 . They cannot do it in one week. ""That means that there is a risk that Nigeria's INDC might not be taken into account. I hope that if Nigeria's INDCS comes up, let's say this week, it would still be possible to catch up. ""But then, I think it will be a pity because what Nigeria is trying to do might be a reference for other countries. ""But in all respect, I think it will be very good for Nigeria to submit its INDC as soon as possible even if the secretariat cannot use it as it plans to do, it might be very useful in the future,@ he said. Gompertz said the change of government might have contributed to the late submissions but expressed the hope that the INDCs would still be submitted. ""I have heard that technically, the INDCs is almost ready. So it needs the political blessing. ""Obviously, the political blessing at the highest level meaning the level of the President. So I wouldn't be surprised if Nigeria's INDCs will be produced in the forthcoming days,"" Gompertz said. NAN recalls that COP 21 , for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aims to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate and to keep global warming below 2\'b0C. Meanwhile, Dr Samuel Adejuwon, Director, Climate Change Department, Federal Ministry of Environment had explained that Nigeria had prepared the document and had submitted to the presidency to vet. He told NAN that the ministry has prepared the INDCs, saying that it has concluded the technical as aspect of the document. According to him, when you are preparing a document that has financial implication and has some developmental implication, the Federal Government must approve it. ""You must let government buy in into what you are doing otherwise; you cannot be committed to implementing it so we have recommended that the Federal Government look into the document and approve. ""We have asked them to look at it with little considerations of key members of inter-ministerial committee on climate change and make adequate recommendations to Mr President. ""It is only then, that we can submit our INDCs, there is nothing binding about the day of submission what is important is that we submit and we should be able to submit before the conference,"" he said.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, which was webcast live around the world, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary, Christiana Figueres, said that the eyes of millions of people around the world were on the governments meeting in Paris, not just figuratively but literally. She said, ""You have the opportunity, in fact the responsibility, to finalize an agreement that enables the achievement of national climate change goals, that delivers the necessary support for the developing world and that catalyses continuously increasing ambition and action by all."" Meanwhile, Nigeria's president intends to use the opportunity to open discussions with France and other countries towards finding lasting solutions to the growing terrorism that has assumed a menacing dimension in Nigeria and Mali in West Africa, as well as in other parts of the continent. Details of activities in France revealed that Buhari, after presenting Nigeria's statement at the opening session when the conference officially opened on Monday, November 30, will participate in the launching of the International Solar Alliance, an initiative of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. He will on Tuesday, December 1, participate in the summit of Heads of State and Government of the Lake Chad Basin Commission and Benin Republic where issues on security challenges of the region will be discussed and also attend another event of the African Union, tagged 'Conference on Climate Change and Africa Solutions. On the eve of the COP21 conference, 184 countries covering around 95 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions had delivered their national climate action plans to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These pledges constitute a good foundation, but are not enough to keep the world below the internationally agreed maximum global average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius.

A total of 195 countries had in December last year at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, agreed to set a goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees centigrade. The conference had also resulted in calls for zero net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The participating countries had agreed by consensus to the final pact, the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions. Consequently, the United Nations Association of Nigeria (UNAN), a member of the World Federation of the United Nations Associations has called on all countries, including Nigeria, to come up with policies tailored towards combating global warming. In a statement issued by UNAN and signed by its secretary general, Owolabi Ganiyu, the association said it is ""requesting that in the interest of humanity and our future, all countries, including Nigeria that will sign the Paris agreement come up immediately with policies that will deliver on their commitments by ensuring implementation of whatever is contained in the agreement."" \"

The minister, who made this statement during a high level meeting on the Great Green Wall Programme in Africa entitled ""Growing a World Wonder"" as part of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP21 ) in Paris recently, recommended a participatory approach in the delivering of the programme by involving the affected communities in the planning and execution of projects and feedback. She stressed the importance of data gathering and storage as well as the adaptation of appropriate communication strategy and technology in the implementation of the programme. She further emphasized the importance of mainstreaming the GGW initiative into the national development plan as part of the sustainable development agenda and commended the integrated approach of the initiative. The event which was co-organised by the African Union Commission and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was to serve as a vehicle to leverage new public and private investment under a GGW brand supported by a global campaign. The event under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Amedi Camera, Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and Dr. Akinwumi Adeshina, President African Development Bank was in high attendance with representatives from the GGW countries, represented by their relevant ministers, World Bank, Global Environment Fund, European Union Commission, African Development Bank as well as bilateral partners. The Vice President, Sustainable Development Practice at the World Bank, Ms Laura Lou commended the African Union for the Great Green Wall initiative, she noted that the World Bank has been supportive of the programme in Ethiopia through the restoration of degraded areas of about 100million hectares. She informed that a sum of $ 1.9 billion was set aside for programmes and projects all over the world in agriculture, water resources, land restoration including GGW programme. In his own statement, the African Development Bank (ADB) President, Dr. Akinwumi Adeshina, highlighted the importance of the need to revive Lake Chad, create new economic prosperity zones, adopt inclusive approach programmes/project delivering, make agriculture sustainability work, get the support of the finance ministers for the programme in the GGW member countries to ensure its sustainable funding, climate information and Early Warning System and data gathering, storage and management in relation to measurable target among others. He further said the bank has set aside the sum of $ 14 billion for climate change adaptation programmes and projects in Africa. At the end of the event, there was a general consensus among the partners that: - The GGW programme is not about afforestation and reforestation but about food and livelihood, job creation, improvement of grazing facilities, fisheries and farmers - There is the need to mobilise resources for GGW programme and arrest rural-urban drift - Great Green Wall is about the survival of a country through increasing the resilience of countries to climate change and giving life back to the earth. \"

President Buhari, who made the submission on Monday in Paris at the opening of the UN climate change summit, added that, for any agreement in Paris to be durable, it must recognise not only the emission right but also the survival rights of the citizens of developing countries. The President, who, shortly before his arrival to Paris approved Nigeria's Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs), called on world leaders to forge a united front to save Lake Chad's ecosystem from further depletion caused by the adverse effects of climate change. ""At the sub-regional level, we are saddled with the challenge of the drying up of the Lake Chad Basin, which is resulting in the total wipe out of livelihoods of many communities surrounding this trans-boundary natural resource, regrettably, the world is leaving behind millions of people who depend on the Lake for their survival,"" he said.

The minister stated this at a post COP21 interaction with newsmen in Abuja. She said the conference represents a watershed moment for humanity as the world agrees to turn words into actions. The agreement provides a framework for delivering the ambitious emission reductions that the world needs, recognizes the importance of keeping average global temperature below two Degree Celsius (2.00 C) and, crucially, confirms that developed countries must continue to increase their financial support for developing countries as the world embarks on this transition, she said. She said We now have a once -in-a lifetime opportunity to change the way we do things, and Nigeria will be at the fore-front demonstrating what initiatives can work. She said Nigeria is willing and eager to take a regional lead by announcing a bold and courageous Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) that seek to ensure that our economy continues to grow while reducing our carbon emissions. She explained that we have shown that we are willing to work with our neighbours, such as those in the Lake Chad basin to restore the once fertile land and well stocked fisheries so that peace and security can return. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria21","Africa Wildlife Foundation at COP-21: ""Our mission is to protect the wildlife of Africa""","December 3, 2015 Thursday","Ventures Africa","Adaptation, survival and extinction rates among wildlife have been connected to climatic and environmental factors and variability. They rely on seasonal changes for migration and breeding, under which intolerable levels of climate change would account for the disruption of biotic interactions. Currently, animals in the wild are suffering because of global warming, which is reflected in their inabilty to maintain their habitats, or a stable food chain, threatening their existence altogether. In 2012, science researchers in Kenya discovered that the African cheetah is gradually losing its ability to reproduce, and in other parts of Africa, elephants are threatened\~as well because of the pressure put on their space. As represenatatives from different parts of the world gather to discuss the impact of climate change on the world\~at COP-21 in Paris, various animal conservation organisations and concerned individuals are joining them to speak on behalf of wildlife. The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), a renowned advocate for wildlife conservation on the endangered continent, is filled with the hope that they can make a change by lending their voice to the ongoing climate talks. Ventures Africa\~spoke to\~Kathleen Fitzgerald, Vice President of Conservation Strategy for the AWF, for commentary on how advocacy for African wildlife is integral to the conversation at COP-21 . Given that a lot of animals are already experiencing instability in their natural habitats, what do you think we need to do to address global warming? Global warming should be avoided, for both people and wildlife. Making our globe cleaner is better for everyone. What people need to consider in relation to climate change and wildlife in Africa, and globally, is that it is not happening in a vacuum. Already, in Africa wildlife face a series of threat, including poaching and habitat loss, and when you add climate change you see instances in many landscapes where it is already pushing wildlife and people to a tipping point. The AWF's presence at the COP-21 is first to create awareness about the threat facing wildlife and people in Africa, pertaining to climate change, and secondly to advocate for a global agreement that reduces pollution, which would help reduce the impact of climate change. In addition, we are pushing for an increase in funding for Africa, because while Africa is not one of the major polluters globally, it is already one of the most impacted continents for climate change, and that will only get worse. People are feeling the impact of climate change, and they don't have the resources or resiliency to adapt. This is a priority for AWF, and one of our major programmes sees us working with communities that live with wildlife, in order to help them to adapt to climate change. In Southern Kenya, for example, a result of climate change is an increase in human-wildlife conflict, because water is a scarce resource in an arid the landscape. This area is where we have one of the most important populations of elephants, and they have to go to the same source with people for water. What happens next is retaliatory killing of wildlife, and other chain of effects that have an impact on wildlife. Will\~humans be impacted from changes in animal behaviour due to climate change?\~ Africa is growing and changing, with an increase in human population, as well as infrastructure development across the continent. What we have been advocating \- and firmly believe \- is that with good planning, human and wildlife can coexist. And we are trying to implement that in the areas we work in. We look at wildlife and the areas that they need to survive, and we makes plans, with climate change in mind, through a system of modelling. This happens either in a special analysis laboratory, or we project based on the implications of climate change that we are aware of. We also look at the human population, and how they need to survive. The biggest change in animal behaviour has to do with movement, and sourcing for food and water, and the greatest impact is habitat stability. As Africa changes, the weather becomes more radical, and the lands become more arid, putting both humans and animals in a situation where they have to adapt. AWF has spent the last 15 years working on a large landscape scale, and that is one of the greatest mitigation and adaptation mechanisms that we believe that Africa needs to implement. Because, by working on such a scale, wildlife is enabled to adapt to movement, sourcing, and accessing different foods and water sources, which fragmented and isolated lands won't help with. In Africa, habitats are changing because of human impact and plant use, and adding climate change to that basically accelerates these changes. The wildlife then need to move and adapt to new habitats, and without protecting large connections of landscape, they are unable to do that. We need to ensure that there's space for the wildlife to adapt. In your opinion, is wildlife conservation getting enough attention at COP-21 ? No, it's not. And that is part of why we are here; to raise awareness about the implications of climate change on wildlife in Africa, because our mission is to protect the wildlife and wild lands of Africa. As an organisation, the AWF witnesses and feels the direct impact of climate change on the wildlife that we are working with. What do you think it would take for the world, and the representative authorities at COP-21 as well, to show more responsibility towards conserving wildlife? We are starting to see governments recognise the value of ecosystem services in Africa, and it has a direct link to wildlife. Governments have begun to note that the value of the ecosystem goes beyond protecting areas, and revenue for parks, and really has to do with water, air, among other things that have an impact on humans and the economy. If you look at agriculture, for example, it's a major growing area on the continent, and without adequate water and good soils, it's not going to thrive. It's excellent that governments are showing concern now, and we are encouraging it to continue, while considering the broader picture. What would you describe as a 'win' for wildlife in Africa in terms of the talks? The best outcome would be a global agreement, and we are hopeful that the leaders this year would achieve that, by setting targets for reduction in pollution and financial support for adaptation and mitigation in Africa. Another major conversation here also is forestation and conservation, and Africa's forests are critically important for the globe, and for mitigation, and we are seeing that play a central role in the discussions here, and AWF is advocating for an increase in support for the protection of the forests, because that would mean that the wildlife and forest-dependent communities would be helped to come up with ways to thrive in line with forest conservation.

In his remark at the church service, the Senate president, Dr Bukola Saraki, who spoke on behalf President Buhari, eulogised the late patriarch of the Awolowo Dynasty, saying that she had left an indelible mark in the sands of time. He noted that the late HID remained politically relevant since the death of her husband in 1987. He, therefore, urged members of the Awolowo family to keep the flag flying and ensure that the legacies and values left behind by both Awolowo and HID were upheld by them. Buhari later arrived at the residence of the Awolowos at about 2:16pm and headed straight for Efunyela Hall. Journalists were, however, barred from entering the hall by the security personnel at the reception. By 8:45am, the 690-seater church was filled to capacity as people scrambled for space to pay their last respects to Mrs Awolowo. To cater for spill-over, canopies were erected within the premises of the church and television screens were hung at strategic points for people far away from the altar to watch and follow the proceedings in the church. The church service formally commenced at 9am when the white chariot conveying HID's gold-plated casket arrived at the church and the bell on the belfry tolled for the third time. The service, which was conducted by the Primate of the Anglican Communion in Nigeria, Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh, had 36 bishops in attendance. Speaking during the service, Okoh described the late Mrs Awolowo as a great wife who stood by her husband, the late Obafemi Awolowo, throughout his sojourn on earth. Okoh explained that she deserved a rest quite different from the worldly rest everybody thinks of, and prayed that she finds eternal rest after living a worthy life. Eulogising HID further, the Anglican primate lauded her for being courageous even when she lost three of her children, urging the congregation to emulate her strong heart and firm belief in God. Okoh also lamented the inability of Nigerian leaders to check the spate of terrorism in the country, remarking that the menace of terrorism had negatively affected the image of the nation. He further stated that the prevalence of social vices, corruption and mass unemployment had worsened the health conditions of Nigerians, resulting in many citizens going down with various terminal diseases. ""Terror has taken over our power, money, our strength, our resources and degraded our infrastructure. It has also taken our peace. Government must do something about it. Corruption in all ramifications, including indiscipline, has ruined the society. So, if you graduate and you are unemployed at 27, you'll find it difficult to get a job. We have a generation that is pining away. ""What can we classify as the burdens of the society currently? They are kidnapping, armed robbery, baby factories and corruption amongst others. Indiscipline has ruined many nations. Unemployment and cultism have ruined the nation. ""Ill-health such as diabetes, cancer are ravaging the land; it affects everybody - civil servants, businessmen, amongst others. None is at rest here. Is there actually anybody who can exclude himself from these yokes? It affects bishops, politicians, academics; none is exempted here,"" he stated. The ceremony was also witnessed by the former heads of state - Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, General Yakubu Gowon (retd), Chief and Ernest Shonekan, as well as other elder statesmen and ministers.

The Sokoto state Commissioner of Solid Minerals, Alhaji Bello Muhammad Goronyo, disclosed his state's position shortly after a meeting with officials of the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission(RMAFC) in his office in Sokoto. On his part, Osun State Governor , Mr, Rauf Aregbesola, said at the commissioning of the new effluent treatment plant and expansion project of the International Breweries PLC in Ilesa that his administration's  new focus will be on agriculture, solid mineral development and industrialisation . Goronyo said the move became necessary in view of the dwindling oil revenue and the need for the state to look for alternative sources of generating revenue. ""The price of oil has dropped (to) less than 40 dollars per barrel and I don't think any state can continue to rely on monthly allocation to carry out its projects. ""So, the present administration will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop the solid minerals sector to make the Sokoto economically viable so that the issue of poverty will be a thing of the past,"" he said. Aregbesola noted that, given the falling price of oil and diminishing revenue from the oil sector, the state is already looking beyond oil for revenue, sustenance and meeting her obligations to fulfilling his electoral promises. He commended the company for  its vision and forthrightness of the founder, the late Dr. Lawrence Omole and managers of the company for complying with international best practices and the aptness of the commissioning of effluent treatment plant coinciding with the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria25","Nigeria and climate change conference: Matters arising","November 29, 2015 Sunday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Preparatory to the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21 , scheduled to hold in Paris between Nov. 30 and Dec. 11, UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has reiterated the need for an urgent global response to climate chan? First, like any grandfather, I want my grandchildren to enjoy the beauty and bounty of a healthy planet and, like any human being, it grieves me to see that floods, droughts and fires are getting worse, that island nations will disappear, and uncounted species will become extinct. ""Second, as the head of the United Nations, I have prioritised climate change because no country can meet this challenge alone. ""Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. ""It is a threat to lives and livelihoods everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. ""Only through the United Nations can we respond collectively to this quintessentially global issue. ""The negotiation process has been slow and cumbersome. But we are seeing results. In response to the UN's call, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 per cent of emissions, have now submitted national climate plans with targets. ""If successfully implemented, these national plans bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately three degrees Celsius by the end of the century. ""At the same time, we must support countries to adapt to the inevitable consequences that are already upon us. ""The sooner we act the greater the benefits for all: increased stability and security; stronger, more sustainable economic growth; enhanced resilience to shocks; cleaner air and water and improved health. ""The climate change conference in Paris is not the end point. The responsibility now rests with governments to conclude a meaningful, binding agreement in Paris that provides clear rules of the road for strengthening global ambition,'' he said in a statement. Ban also said a meaningful climate agreement in Paris would build a better synergy to end poverty, improve public health, create new jobs and encourage green innovations. In view of Ban's directive, stakeholders in Nigeria have expressed optimism that the conference will provide an avenue for the country to interact with multilateral organisations on climate change. They observed that in an effort to put up a brilliant performance at the conference, the federal government started early preparations to mobilise support from development partners and donors since February. Mrs Nana Mede, the immediate past Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, said she had a strong belief that Nigeria would represent Africa competently at the conference. She urged Nigeria to submit a robust national climate action plan known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs, which should state a clear-cut pathway to reduce emissions from greenhouse gases. Mede also urged the negotiators to give their best at the conference in view of the impacts of climate change on both human and natural resources. She noted that such impacts manifested through increased frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding, droughts, desertification and increased sea temperature, among others. The former permanent secretary recalled that in 1992, the UN member states established the conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. She, however, observed that the UNFCCC and the subsequent Kyoto Protocol in 1997 could not provide enough solution to the challenge of climate change. ""Therefore, during the COP 19 in Warsaw, parties adopted a decision to prepare and submit fresh Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris COP 21 ,'' she said. Corroborating her view, Dr Samuel Adejuwon, Director, Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment, said that INDCs is a document required to be submitted by all parties to the UNFCCC at the Paris conference. According to him, countries signatory to the UNFCCC will negotiate a global climate agreement for the post-2020 period that will be adopted at the conference. He noted that the submission of the document was a major component of the climate change treaty likely to be adopted at COP 21 . In view of this, the federal government, in collaboration with the UN Development Programme, UNDP, engaged the services of international consultants in June to work with national consultants and produce credible INDCs. At the stakeholders' consultative meeting with the consultants in Abuja, the UNDP urged Nigeria to come up with robust INDCs that would address climate change impact on the country. Mr Muyiwa Odele, Team Leader, UNDP Environment Unit, who represented UNDP Country Director, Dr Pa-Lamin Beyai, emphasised the need for Nigeria to meet up with its climate change commitments. ""This process of developing INDCs is extremely important for Nigeria, because of the leadership role that Nigeria plays in the area of climate change negotiations in Africa. ""If Nigeria is serious about taking forward the climate change agenda, it is important that the INDCs be developed in a very robust manner,'' he said. However, some stakeholders suggested that the INDCs should set realistic and achievable targets to reduce the greenhouse gases. They also suggested setting clear targets in some areas such as renewable energy and agricultural projects as mitigation measures. Prof. Daniel Gwary, a negotiator at COP, said as Nigeria prepared for COP 21 , it should announce its preparedness to reduce emissions in line with other countries. ""As the most populous country in Africa, I think Mr President wants Nigeria to be at the forefront not in the crowd. ""So, we must come up with an action plan and we must protect our economy,'' he said. Gwary said agriculture was a very important aspect of the country's economy that had to do with emission of carbon. According to him, agriculture has to do with emissions in the areas of soil management and livestock production. ""If Nigeria is thinking about making commitment to reduce emissions, then the country has to look inwards into the agriculture sector. ""We can cut down our emissions in that sector by improving on agricultural practices in livestock and crop production. ""Apart from the agriculture sector, we need to also cut down our emissions in power, transport, petroleum, solid minerals and manufacturing sectors,'' he said. Gwary, nonetheless, supported the views of some international consultants that suggested 50 per cent reduction of the emissions for Nigeria by 2030. ""It is attainable if key players and Nigerians support the present administration to make things to work to improve agriculture, power and transport sectors and also support good governance. ""For example, it is the political will that government needs to cut down gas flaring,'' he said. Sharing similar sentiments, Mr Bab Atayi, an environmentalist, said that the Nigeria should give itself a target of 50 per cent emission reduction. ""Many countries have targeted 30 per cent reduction of greenhouse gases in their INDCs; specifically, Kenya and Ethiopia, Nigeria should go above 30 per cent,"" he said. But Mr Lawal Gada, a consultant on environment and energy disagreed, insisting that Nigeria should set a target of 30 per cent on renewable energy by 2030. Irrespective of any set target, Mr Lekan Fadina a negotiator at COP, expressed optimism that Nigeria could achieve its target if it had the will to make it happen. He, however, raised concerns over the cost of implementing the target of 50 per cent emission reduction, advising Nigeria to put a cost on implementing the INDCs. ""For example, Kenya, which targets 30 per cent emission reduction, said it would cost 40 million dollars to implement its INDCs and the country is not going to solicit for foreign funds. ""So, how prepared is Nigeria to implement the document, how much of sustainable projects are we going to focus on while implementing the INDCs? ""Also, how is the country ready to access the Green Climate Fund? There are climate funds available globally that can be accessed to implement some of our climate change activities,'' he observed. ""We have prepared the INDCs and we have done our part at the technical level, when you are preparing a document that has financial implication and have some developmental implication, you must let government buy in into what you are doing. ""We have asked the stakeholders to look at it with little considerations of key members of Inter-ministerial committee on climate change and make adequate recommendations to Mr President. ""It is only then that we can submit our INDCs, there is nothing binding about the day of submission; what is important is that we submit and we should be able to submit before the conference,'' he said. In his view, Dr Victor Fodeke, a consultant with African Development Bank, said making logistics arrangement for the negotiators was as good as building their capacity. ""South Africa and U.S. always make accommodation for their negotiators ahead of time so that they can settle and face the task assigned to them squarely. ""This negotiation is a tricky thing. People who you are negotiating with you know when you are weak around the middle of the night and they may take critical decisions that time. ""Training is okay but they need to know the strength and weakness of people we are negotiating with. In negotiation, you get only what you negotiate not what you deserve. ""Africa emission is less than two per cent, the implication of climate change is going to be worse on Africa and if we go on with sentiments, we will never win,'' he warned. Fodeke advised negotiators to be familiar with the articles of climate change conventions for them to be able to negotiate Nigeria's position at the conference. ""You get only what you negotiate; you cannot perform very well unless you acquire the skills, information and strength to do so as to ensure safe climate for Nigeria and Africa.'' ""We should be careful so that we do not go and take commitment that will take about 70 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product while people are hungry,'' he said. By and large, climate change experts opine that with the measures taken by the federal government to prepare the INDCs, the document will be among the best, noting that if the negotiators can focus on the identified issues, Nigeria will shine at the conference.

It began at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 where the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was up for adoption. The framework came into force in 1994 had outlined action to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of Green House Gases (GHGs) to avoid ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" The main objective of the annual COP is to review the Convention's implementation.The 2015 Paris Climate Conference was expected to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2C. UN Secretary General, Ban ki Moon, in his opening statement, stressed the need to seize the opportunity of the Paris meeting because a political moment like it may not come again.""You are here today to write the script for a new future, We have never faced such a test. But neither have we encountered such great opportunity. You have the power to secure the well-being of this and succeeding generations,"" he told the about 150 world leaders, who gathered for the opening of the meeting. President Barack Obama of the United States of America said in his remarks that the UN climate conference in Paris could be a ""turning point"" in global efforts to limit future temperature rises. HE wanted the negotiators from about 195 countries to deliver a meaningful deal, because the ""next generation is watching.""On the eve of the opening of the Paris Conference, President Buhari approved Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) that is, the country's plan to tackle the issue of climate change while promoting sustainable development and delivering on government priorities. The document is a requirement by COP-UNFCC in preparation for the Adoption of Climate Change Agreement at the Paris COP21 conference. The document, which has already been submitted to the UN,was prepared by the Ministry of Environment in recognition of the fact that significant challenges such as food insecurity, lack of access to energy and high unemployment, among others, remain principal constraints on economic development in Nigeria and are of primary concern to the government. It focuses on the delivery of direct development benefits and sustainable growth of the economy.The Executive Summary of the INDC points out that in addition to these challenges, the country is considerably impacted by climate change. It notes that the North of the country, for example, is highly vulnerable to drought, highlighting a recent Pew Research Center global attitudes survey which found that 65 per cent of Nigerians are very concerned about the threat climate change poses, ahead of global economic instability which is a worry to about by 48% of the citizens.Nigeria's INDC was submitted as an expression of its determination to contribute to the success of the Paris climate summit and to grow its economy sustainably while reducing carbon pollution. While it promotes sustainable development and delivering on government priorities, government is hoping that the policies and measures included in the Nigeria INDC will deliver immediate development benefits and do not compromise sustainable growth.Buhari's statement at the conference centered mainly on the devastating effect climate change is having on the Lake Chad region, which he noted poses a threat to food security in Nigeria as extreme events such as flooding and drought are on the increase. While he warned that such factors have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures, he also made a connection between the insurgency in the North-East and climate change as he observed that the drying up of the Lake Chad has deprived many communities of their means of livelihood. President Buhari therefore told world leaders at the event that they had a historic chance to save the planet by coming up with binding resolutions for sustainable development.Noting that the conference must work to make Paris a global landmark in the history of climate change negotiations, Buhari advised that nations must scale up their commitment to ensure a successful outcome and contribute to transforming the world through sustainable development.During a high-level meeting on Climate Change Challenges and Solutions in Africa, at the sidelines of the COP 21 , Buhari made an impassioned appeal to developed countries to make strong financial commitments to the $14 billion urgently needed to revive the Lake Chad and save communities dependent on the lake from extinction. No fewer than five million people living in the Lake Chad Basin countries, he pointed out, have been displaced by the depletion of the lake due to climate change. \"

Akinwumi Adesina, President, AfDB Adesina made the call while speaking to a delegation of Ministers representing more than 40 nations spanning the globe in Paris recently. A statement from AfDB obtained by our correspondent in Abuja showed that the audience included the host of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, COP21 , Laurent Fabius, Minister of Foreign Affairs, France; as well as Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Minister of Environment, Peru; Khalid Fahmy, Minister of Environment and Chair of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN), Egypt; and leaders representing European governments, the G7, the G20 and other nations. Adesina also called for a binding agreement toward limited carbon dioxide emissions at the forthcoming COP21 . He outlined the importance of the Paris Climate Conference, as presenting a unique opportunity to reach a lasting agreement on limiting carbon dioxide emissions and charting the way for transformative partnerships to address the adverse effects of climate change. To this end, he stressed, Africa's voice is crucial for a successful outcome at COP21 . ""We need to support initiatives that address risks associated with climate change, and build disaster-response capacity and recovery programs for those who are most affected. This includes building their assets, providing catastrophic bonds, weather index insurance schemes, and crop/livestock insurance for farmers and rural populations,"" said Adesina. Adesina called for strong political will, sharply focused partnerships, and ambitious financing programs to address climate and its impact on the millions of people whose livelihoods are under threat, especially in small, fragile, and island states, and the Sahel region. The Bank's new President also highlighted three sectors for urgent action: building integrated and resilient energy systems, including both conventional and renewable energy; smart agricultural, land use and forestry systems; and boosting urban renewal \- creating more resilient cities, with efficient water systems and smart, climate-friendly infrastructure. While endorsing Africa's position on the need for more resources to address climate change adaptation and mitigation, Adesina assured world leaders of the Bank's strong support for Africa's transition to inclusive and green growth. He affirmed that the Bank will champion the implementation of the polluter pays principle and work with member countries and partners to support governance reforms, continental risk transfer and risk-sharing schemes, and building institutions that will support greater social and economic resilience in the face of climate change. He also announced that the Bank will expand its support to African countries to solve their energy and food security challenges, while ensuring inclusive and green growth. ""Together, we must end Africa's energy crisis and unlock Africa's enormous energy potentials \- both conventional and renewables,"" he said. ""This is why the African Development Bank strongly supports the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and will cooperate with all stakeholders to launch a New Deal on Energy for Africa that will accelerate energy supply and access across the continent.""

A statement by UNFCCC said, ""The Paris Agreement for the first time brings all nations into a common cause based on their historic, current and future responsibilities."" The universal agreement's main aim is to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5 degree Celsius limit is a significantly safer defense line against the worst impacts of a changing climate. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability to deal with the impacts of climate change. To reach these ambitious and important goals, appropriate financial flows will be put in place, thus making stronger action by developing countries and the most vulnerable possible, in line with their own national objectives. ""The Paris Agreement allows each delegation and group of countries to go back home with their heads held high. Our collective effort is worth more than the sum of our individual effort. Our responsibility to history is immense"" said Laurent Fabius, President of the COP 21 UN Climate change conference and French Foreign Minister. The minister, his emotion showing as delegates started to rise to their feet, brought the final gavel down on the agreement to open and sustained acclamation across the plenary hall. French President Francois Hollande told the assembled delegates: ""You've done it, reached an ambitious agreement, a binding agreement, a universal agreement. Never will I be able to express more gratitude to a conference. You can be proud to stand before your children and grandchildren."" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said: ""We have entered a new era of global cooperation on one of the most complex issues ever to confront humanity. For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and join in common cause to take common climate action. This is a resounding success for multilateralism."" Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said: ""One planet, one chance to get it right and we did it in Paris. We have made history together. It is an agreement of conviction. It is an agreement of solidarity with the most vulnerable. It is an agreement of long-term vision, for we have to turn this agreement into an engine of safe growth."" ""Successive generations will, I am sure, mark the 12 December 2015 as a date when cooperation, vision, responsibility, a shared humanity and a care for our world took centre stage,"" she said. ""I would like to acknowledge the determination, diplomacy and effort that the Government of France have injected into this remarkable moment and the governments that have supported our shared ambition since COP 17 in Durban, South Africa,"" she said. The Paris Agreement and the outcomes of the UN climate conference ( COP21 ) cover all the crucial areas identified as essential for a landmark conclusion: Mitigation - reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; A transparency system and global stock-take - accounting for climate action; Adaptation - strengthening ability of countries to deal with climate impacts; Loss and damage - strengthening ability to recover from climate impacts; Support - including finance, for nations to build clean, resilient futures. As well as setting a long-term direction, countries will peak their emissions as soon as possible and continue to submit national climate action plans that detail their future objectives to address climate change. The new agreement also establishes the principle that future national plans will be no less ambitious than existing ones, which means these 188 climate action plans provide a firm floor and foundation for higher ambition. \"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria35","Buhari Asks Developed Countries to Raise U.S.$14 Billion to Save Lake Chad","December 02, 2015","This Day (Lagos)","President Muhammadu Buhari on Tursday in Paris France, asked developed countries to make strong financial commitments to the $14 billion urgently needed to revive the Lake Chad and save communities dependent on the river from extinction. A statement by the Special Adviser to the president, Mr. Femi Adesina, said Buhari made the call while addressing a high level meeting on ""Climate Change Challenges and Solutions in Africa,"" on the sidelines of the on-going United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21 . Buhari said no fewer than five million people living in the Lake Chad Basin countries had been displaced by the depletion of the lake due to climate change. The president said the shrinkage of Lake Chad, a former island sea, had resulted in increased social conflicts, high rates of migration and cross border movements. ""Nigeria has a large population of over 170 million people and in some parts of Northern Nigeria, a farm land that used to belong to 10 people now belongs to over 100 people. They have no other place to live and no land for cultivation,"" he said. Buhari recalled that a research conducted by a professor in a London university and published more than three decades ago had predicted that unless one or some of the rivers from the Central African region were diverted to empty into the Lake Chad basin, the river would dry up. He noted sadly that the prediction had become reality as the lake which covered over 25,000 square kilometers in 1925 have shrunk to 2,500 square kilometres. ""The amount of resources required and the high technological expertise and infrastructure needed to be undertaken to revive the Lake Chad has to be mainly financed by the G7 and the United States. ""The cost is great and more than $14 billion is needed to revive the Lake. ""But if that is achieved, at least five million people from Central African Republic to the Lake Chad Basin countries (Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroun) will be rehabilitated. ""When this is done, those who are daring to cross the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean to Europe will remain at home because they have land where they can cultivate and earn a respectable living,"" he said. On Nigeria's plans to tackle climate change, Buhari told the meeting attended by the French President, UN Secretary-General and several African leaders that the country was blessed with natural gas to boost the country's energy needs. He said although the technology to optimally utilise natural gas in the country was expensive for the country to maintain, Nigeria would welcome international partnerships and initiatives for lower carbon in the oil and gas sector that focused on reducing natural gas flaring and capturing the product for commercial use. Recognising the acute threats that climate change posed to Nigeria's development, Buhari said his administration was ready to embrace several opportunities presented by the challenges posed by climate change. Saraki in a statement issued yesterday by his Special Adviser (Media and Publicity) , Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, stated that contrary to report published by an online medium, he has never had anything to do with purchase of security equipment because in his entire political career he never served in any committee or body which has any link with defence or national security. ""As a member of the seventh Senate, Saraki was not a member of any of the committees which have oversight function on the Ministry of Defence or the intelligence and national security apparatus. If he was tagged the leader of the opposition to the Jonathan administration, how then will he be privy to arms purchases and have the influence to blackmail any government agency or institution over the release of funds. ""The senate president would like to alert members of the public of to this new plot by this particular online medium to tarnish his reputation as the medium and its sponsors pursue the singular objective of removing him from the office of the senate president, an objective they have since failed to achieve within and outside the National Assembly."" This time around, the medium and its sponsors chose to drag the senate president into this reigning and current issue of arms purchase by insinuating that he once blackmailed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to give him and other senators the sum of N250 million as a way of covering up the arbitrary withdrawal by the NSA from the security fund approved by the former president. First, there is no logic in the medium's claim as Saraki who was persecuted by the last administration could not have had the influence and good standing to walk up to the central bank to demand for any money having exposed many atrocities of the past administration. Again, on what ground would the senate president blackmail anyone for N250 million? It must be emphasised here that Saraki will never engage in any sharp practice or issue which will warrant him to blackmail any individual or government institution. ""Therefore for record purposes, Saraki did not collect any money from any official of the CBN in respect of any arms deal. The senate president also challenge the online news medium or any official of the apex bank, senator, serving or past, who witnessed or participated in any sharing of the alleged money purported to have been received by him, to come out with evidence. ""It should be recalled that the medium believes it can continue to disparage and defame people claiming that it is operating outside the country. The medium cannot operate above the law. ""This same medium had falsely published the data page of a forged passport it purportedly claimed belonged to Saraki. The Home Office in the United Kingdom has since written to confirm that the said passport, does not belong to the senate president. Also, the online medium once claimed that Saraki bribed some judges using a former Chief Justice of Nigeria as a front. The claim has since been proven to be false. Anybody who knows the reputation of the retired justice in question knows that he cannot be used to pervert the cause of justice. "" It also claimed that Saraki tried to cover up the case of $20 billion missing NNPC fund and indeed collected ""cash and gifts"" from former President Goodluck Jonathan through Mr. Gilbert Chagoury when in actual fact the senate president was the only member of the Senate committee who refused to sign the majority report of the Makarfi committee because he disagreed with the report which he believed did not address the matter. It is strange however that a man who dissociated himself from the probe report because he believed it amounted to a cover up was later accused by the same online medium as supporting attempts to hide the issue of the missing funds. This is not only completely false, but also a fiction concocted to defame Saraki. ""The game being played by the news medium and its sponsors is clear. As they have done in previous cases involving the on-going trial of the senate president at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), they are targeting the Appeal at the Supreme Court coming up on Thursday, December 3, 2015. They want to prejudice the Supreme Court as they have done when they blackmailed a judge of the Federal High Court to withdraw from the case and also published false reports, which compelled the Court of Appeal to postpone its judgment at the last minute. ""Whatever the motive of the online medium, it is high time we employed the instrument of the law to stop this act of impunity aimed at publishing false reports believing the victims will not go to court or be frustrated by its dubious claims that they are domiciled outside Nigeria.""We urge all Nigerians and other well-meaning individuals across the globe to ignore this absolutely false claim by it. Like we earlier stated, this false claim shall not go unchallenged. We shall meet in court. ""We have allowed the medium enough latitude to indulge in their unscrupulous and mischievous method of journalism. However, enough is enough. We have no option than to commence legal action against the medium in all relevant jurisdictions, particularly on the issue of fake passport, false claim of bribery and the recent one on blackmail, all aimed at tarnishing the image of the senate president. ""We need to put an end to this concerted mischief of defaming the person and good reputation of Saraki. We will vigorously defend the integrity of the senate president. We believe law and global best practices should guide these cyber-warriors. They have abused the docility of the law for too long. Enough is enough."" \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria36","Airports, UNFCCC Enter Deal On Climate Neutrality","December 14, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","A partnership to cut emissions from airports and take the industry towards climate neutrality has been launched. The partnership was signed at COP21 in Paris by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Airports Council International (ACI), which developed the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. Emissions reductions will be achieved through use of energy-efficient lighting, cooling and heating systems, solar energy, climate-friendly ground transportation and a wide range of other measures aimed at climate neutrality. ACI will support the UNFCCC's initiative, while the UNFCCC secretariat will support airport carbon accreditation, whereby airports measure, report and reduce their emissions. The two organizations will develop a common work programme and communications plan promoting carbon neutrality. UNFCCC will join the advisory board of the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, which aims to increase the number of airports graduating to carbon neutral status. In the past 12 months, 137 airports worldwide, representing 31 percent of global passenger traffic have earned ACI's ""airport carbon accredited"" status. There are currently 20 carbon neutral airports. The partnership announcement follows the commitment by the European airport industry last week at COP21 to increase the number of carbon neutral airports to 50 by 2030. ""It is immensely encouraging to see an industry as visible and strategically relevant as the airport industry being so proactive on climate action,"" said John Kilani, Director, Sustainable Development Mechanisms programme, UNFCCC secretariat. ""What ACI has achieved through airport carbon accreditation over the past six years is inspiring - to mobilize 137 airports in the journey towards carbon neutrality is an example that many other industries could learn from."" Angela Gittens, Director General ACI WORLD and Olivier Jankovec, Director General ACI EUROPE in a joint statement said ""Today is a very big day for ACI and Airport Carbon Accreditation. To gain the support of an organization as authoritative as the UNFCCC is something we consider a major achievement and a genuine recognition of the contribution of the airport industry to the climate action through Airport Carbon Accreditation. We are delighted to be partnering with UNFCCC and look forward to their input in the Advisory Board of the programme."" Launched at Climate Week in New York in September 2015, Climate Neutral Now encourages countries, industries, organizations and even individuals to measure their emissions, reduce what they can and offset the rest with quality projects in developing countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global CO2 emissions. Of that figure, airport operations account for up to 5 percent.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria38","Climate Saviours: Sani Ayouba Abdou is all about change with a voice","December 11, 2015 Friday","Ventures Africa","A climate change affects all the continent's development sectors and enormously reduces the development efforts. Agriculture and livestock considered as the main economic activities of the continent are heavily affected. The question becomes more a problem of survival than a development issue.\~Africa needs strong agreement and not argument here in Paris. -\~Sani Ayouba Participants at the COP21 now expect a final deal tomorrow, December 13, as opposed to today when the summit was initially billed to end. A 27-page draft of the deal is however available which stipulates that temperature rises must be kept ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C"". \~According to Laurent Fabius, French Foreign Minister and COP21 Chairman, ""things are moving in the right direction"". The signed deal will become effective in 2020 Despite the laudable progress witnessed so far, certain issues are yet to be met with a resolution. Top on the list is what negotiators have termed ""differentiation"", and it involves climate finance and the demarcation between developing nations and developed ones. The anticipation for a mutually beneficial and sustainable agreement has never been higher. As the final stages of negotiations steadily approach, Africa is still not out of the clear, and now is the most crucial of times to band together, speak with a united voice, and not settle for anything less than is attainable. As the world has come to agree, the job of fighting of change is not that of representatives and negotiators in Paris alone. Individuals from different walks of life have lent their voices to advocate for the salvation of the planet throughout the talks. Sani Ayouba Abdou is one of these distinguished set of ""climate saviours"". Since 2009, he has devoted his energy to Jeunes Volontaires pour l'Environnement (JVE) [Young Volunteers for the Environment], an NGO that encourages youth involvement in environmental issues. He talks to rural communities in Niger to raise awareness on environment issues and sustainable development. He holds a Master's degree in Project Management\~and\~has already been active in his community for a number of years. He was a leader in the Nigerien scouting movement from a young age. ""People used to say that Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate change. This situation is increased by its poor state of economic development and low adaptive capacity as well as extreme poverty,"" Sani told Ventures. \~""Also, the absence or weakness of modern technologies in all sectors frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods, and heavy dependence of agriculture on rainfall further increases the continent vulnerability. In analyzing the situation, it was established that the continent is not responsible for climate change but unjustly suffered the consequences of this phenomenon."" Sani is very engaged in climate change and renewable energy movement. He is strongly involved in the Beyond 2015 agenda (the transition of the MDGs to the SDGs), and the UN Negotiation on Climate Change ( COP21 ).\~Sani is a\~2014 YALI Mandela Washington Fellow\~and attended a six-week Civic Leadership institute at the University of California at Berkeley. The Mandela fellowship honed his skills and reaffirmed his advocacy for the promotion of sustainable development by including youth and women. He was\~re-elected as Observer for Africa CSO to the\~World Bank Climate Investment Fund\~in Washington DC. According to him, the 21st UN Conference is an opportunity for Africa to demand climate justice for the benefit of its population and its strategic orientation towards development. ""Africa must develop and climate change unfairly slows this drive,"" he told us. \~""For us as a young [population], this is our future and the future of Africa. This is why by participating in the 11th Conference of Youth Africans, we expressed our desire to be associated \~[with], and for an effective participation in all initiatives in the fight against climate change on the continent. Young people contribute to promote solutions for sustainable development through the education and behavior change to affirm their eco citizenship."" For Sani fighting climate change is about balancing the need to adapt to the change that will most certainly come while also working towards mitigation of further effects. This requires a financial commitment that \~is respected and clearly explained in addition to technology transfer that can help in both adaptation and mitigation. Sani is urging African leaders to stay united and strong in Paris climate talks in the interest of the continent:\~""As young activist that work directly with communities, we are here in Paris to advocate and push for a strong agreement and not arguments. We hear more arguments and now it's time for action, for a commitment and leadership that saves our planet in the benefice of humanity."" \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria39","President Buhari's Foreign Trips Not Frivolous - Lai Mohammed","December 05, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has justified the many foreign trips of the President, saying that such trips by President Buhari since assuming office are critical to the implementation of his administration key policies of enhancing security, jump-starting the economy, creating jobs and fighting corruption. In a statement issued on Friday in Abuja and signed by the Special Assistant to the Minister of Information and Culture, Segun Adeyemi, the Minister said all the trips have started yielding fruits in terms of turning the tide in the fight against the insurgents, attracting investments in the range of billions of dollars, and securing global support for the administration's anti-corruption fight. ""Nigerians, whether in the ruling or the opposition parties, have a right to ask questions about the activities of their President, but it is absolutely important that they do so from an informed, rather than partisan or sensational, standpoint,"" he said. The Minister explained that most of the President's trips to Nigeria's neighbouring countries of Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger, as well as to Germany, the US, France and the UN - were devoted to rallying regional and global support for the war against terrorism. ""He was in Germany at the invitation of the G7 to solicit support from the Industrialized Nations for the war against terrorism. No one who has witnessed the killings and maiming in the past seven years by Boko Haram will call such trips frivolous. After all, the security and welfare of the citizens are the reason for the existence of any government. ""The President's visit to South Africa was to attend the regular summit of the African Union; the trip to Ghana was aimed at fostering better relations with a brotherly country; the trip to India was for the India-Africa summit that provided the opportunity to explore ways of enhancing Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) from Indian investors."" On the trip to Iran, he also explained that the President represented Nigeria in the forum of Gas Exporting Countries, a veritable platform for discussing how to better harness Nigeria's abundant gas resources for industrial/domestic consumption and export, at a time of dwindling oil prices. ""The President also travelled to Malta to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, from where he travelled to Paris for the UN Conference on Climate Change . The President's second trip to South Africa since assuming office is for the China-Africa forum. On the few occasions that the President has embarked on a State Visit, he has tied that to an agenda that will further the quest for support for the war against terror and the efforts to enhance FDIs, thus stimulating economic growth and creating jobs,"" he said. He said that apart from rallying global support for the country's wars on terror and graft or seeking foreign investments, it is important that Nigeria leverages President Buhari's brand, a high integrity quotient and an embodiment of committed and dedicated leadership, to further Nigeria's relevance and visibility on the global stage. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria40","A fair, efficient, and feasible climate agreement","December 21, 2015 Monday","Business Day","How should one evaluate the agreement reached in Paris this month at the United Nations climate change conference ? No sooner was the deal announced on December 12 than the debate erupted. Some avid environmentalists were disappointed that the agreement did not commit firmly to limiting global warming to 1.5\'ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050. But such a commitment would not have been credible. What emerged in Paris was in fact better, because the negotiators were able to agree on practical steps in the right direction. Individual countries pledged to limit their emissions in the near term, with provisions for future monitoring and periodic reviews of targets. This is far better than setting lofty goals for the distant future while giving little reason to think that they would be met. The important thing is to get started. In four key respects, the agreement is a good one for those who regard global climate change as an important problem and want to take feasible steps to address it. First, and most important, participation is comprehensive, with 188 countries offering individual commitments, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). In the past, only rich countries were expected to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions; developing countries were explicitly spared that within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. That had to change, partly because it is in developing countries, not the advanced economies, that emisssions are growing the fastest. Furthermore, countries like the United States would not agree to limit their emissions if they feared that carbon-emitting industry would simply migrate to developing countries. Second, the agreement includes a process of future assessment and revision of targets. Every five years, the parties will take stock and renew the commitments. Targets can be adjusted in light of future developments to be more or less aggressive, (probably more, if the scientists' predictions are borne out). Negotiations on the INDC revisions are to begin in 2018, even though the first set of targets is scheduled to take effect in 2020. Third, the Paris deal takes steps toward transparency in monitoring, reporting, and verifying countries' progress. Starting in 2023, countries are to report every five years on compliance with their emissions targets. The US and Europe had to push China and India to agree to this. But without transparency, the INDCs would not be credible. Fourth, the agreement contains mechanisms to facilitate international linkage, including scope for residents of rich countries to finance emissions reductions in poor countries. This is important because it is cheaper to pay a poor country to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants than it is to shut down an existing plant in a rich country. And achieving the first period's INDCs at low cost will be an important determinant of countries' willingness to take further steps in future periods. Achieving more aggressive environmental goals, particularly limiting warming to 1.5\'baC, or zero greenhouse-gas emissions in the second half of the century, would of course be desirable in terms of minimizing the risk of disaster scenarios. In fact, the first INDCs, by themselves, are nowhere near enough even to limit warming to 2\'baC (the global goal that was agreed in Canc\'fan in 2010). But proclaiming ambitious targets is very different from achieving them. It is almost beside the point that the economic cost of pursuing a goal of 1.5\'baC would be very high. In any case, leaders can't make credible commitments 35 years into the future. And the plan needs to be credible if it is to influence myriad business decisions made today. Some developing-country leaders may be displeased for another reason: the figure of $100 billion in finance from rich countries does not appear in the legally binding body of the agreement. The rich countries did admit their moral responsibility to help small island states, for example, cope with 'loss and damages' from sea-level rise. But they rejected demands for formal acceptance of legal liability. This was a reasonable outcome in a difficult situation. Rich countries can't deny that their past emissions have inflicted harm on the world. In a domestic legal system, an entity whose land was, say, flooded would have a claim to compensation from the entity that had caused the damage. But sovereign countries are not operating in such a system. The $100 billion in finance has always seemed problematic. The developing countries fear that the rich countries won't deliver the money, at least not cash; and they are right. The rich countries fear that such 'reparations' would disappear into the pockets of local elites; and they, too, are right. So it is better not to make promises. The poor countries do have a strong case. The average American still accounts for ten times the emissions of the average citizen of India, and India should not be deprived of the right to develop economically. But the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets. The efforts that richer countries promised should be - and generally are - greater than the efforts of poor countries. The richer a country is, the earlier the date at which its emissions should peak. The richer it is, the more sharply its target should cut emissions relative to the baseline. With targets that take into account their stage of development, poor countries can be paid for additional emissions cuts under the international linkage mechanisms. In such ways, the Paris agreement ensures both fairness and efficiency. Achieving it was a daunting challenge, and more challenges lie ahead. But the negotiators' success in converging on a plan that offers hope of practical progress is an unambiguous triumph. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria41","UNDP - We Need Strong Legal Framework, Clear Rules to Tackle Impacts of Climate Change in Africa","October 13, 2015","This Day (Lagos)","As next month's date for the climate change conference in Paris draws near, the Country Director, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Dr. Pa Lamin Beyai has called on African negotiators to ensure they are able to incorporate in the new deal a strong legal framework, clear rules, among others to enable the continent tackle the impacts of climate change, reports Bennett Oghifo African negotiators have been urged to deliver on some critical milestones for the benefit of the continent, during the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) that will take place from November 30 to December 11, in Paris, France. According to the Country Director, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Dr. Pa Lamin Beyai, ""We need to develop a strong legal framework, with clear rules, a central role for equity and with very strong linkage to the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Hopefully, with these elements in the new deal, we are well on our way towards tackling the impacts of climate change on the continent."" Beyai said, ""As the day moves closer, with about 196 countries getting ready to sign a new climate change agreement, we in Africa and especially Nigeria would need to ensure that a favourable outcome is obtained as a befitting reward for Nigeria and in recognition of the efforts of the Permanent Secretary (of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Mrs. Nana Mede) and her team, who all have been working round the clock."" Beyai stated this in his opening remarks at a training organised for Nigeria's negotiators that will be at the Climate Change conference in Paris. The training was supported by the UNDP in partnership with the Department of Climate Change, of the Federal Ministry of Environment, under its Climate Diplomacy programme, which the Country Director said, ""Is aimed at increasing Nigeria's presence and influence on international politics, notably within the UNFCCC framework, in a way that actively contributes to building the key conditions for successful mitigation and adaptation in the country."" The UNDP's desire, he said was that the training would increase the awareness of the strong linkages between climate change and sustainable development policies in Nigeria and specifically result in; The establishment of a gender balanced core group of national negotiators, with increased capacity to support Nigerian climate negotiations. ""Secondly, that it will foster deeper dialogue and cooperation across a network of national and sub-national technical experts and leaders in the field of international relations, economic development, forestry, natural resources management, green economy, national development and financial planning. ""And thirdly, that it would provide an enduring platform for national discussions that will in turn define Nigeria's position and contribution to the UNFCCC COP21 in Paris."" A strong deal, Beyai said would not only help Nigeria meet her international obligations, eliminate poverty, improve health and the living standards of the people, make agriculture a flourishing sector, but that it would also help increase investment opportunities, especially in clean and renewable energy solutions, and as well as develop the much needed human and institutional capacities to undergird these progress. He reminded the trainees that ""the current emissions on the greenhouse gas runs out in 2020, but what happens in the decade after that and beyond is the big question we need to ask ourselves. For us here, we would like to see Nigeria along with other African countries develop a common position to address climate change challenges and its adverse effects on her population's livelihood."" He said the membership of the trainees in the core team ""is vitally crucial, in ensuring that Nigeria plays its leadership role in climate change negotiations, effectively. This is why you all have been carefully selected to become the foundation and bedrock of a revitalised national climate change negotiation team and we are quite confident that collectively, you are up to the task."" Beyai congratulated the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Mrs. Nana Mede ""on the timely completion of the draft Nigeria Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), developed with the support of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and to assure of our continuing support."" Mrs. Mede, who declared open the training, said it was timely considering that the world was expecting a new climate change agreement to be adopted during COP21 in Paris. Nigeria, she said has been part of the negotiation within the context of the African group in the climate change process right from the onset of the UNFCCC adopted in 1992. ""We participated in the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol and we remain active in the potential climate change agreement expected in Paris, France later in the year."" She said, ""Nigeria's position in terms of the UNFCCC negotiation and along that of the African Group suggests a scheme based on equitable multilateral rules with a strong link to fair access to sustainable financing. Nigeria wishes to see a global objective for adaptation and a mitigation objective in the 2015 agreement to limit global warming to below 20C compared with pre-industrial levels."" The Permanent Secretary said the African Group proposes the use of a reference framework to reflect mitigation actions and adaptation measures taken by the countries that would lead to equity. ""We will, therefore, continue to stress in our negotiation the necessity for the developed country Parties in the climate change process to come forward with ambitious scale of emission reduction both in the pre- and post-2020 Agreement."" The training, she said was also expected to strengthen the technical capacity of Nigeria in the development of actions that allow the mainstreaming of climate change into national and sectoral development goals by continuing the institutional and technical capacity strengthening process."" Thereafter, she launched the National Policy on Climate Change and the Department of Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment's Improved Website. The Director, Department of Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment, Dr. S.A. Adejuwon presented a 'Brief Overview on the Status of Negotiation Towards UNFCCC COP 21 : From Durban, South Africa enroute Paris, France.' Dr. Adejuwon said the training was for experts, including people from the Academia; government; non-governmental organisations about the art of negotiating, especially climate change issues to enhance their capacity. The main negotiators would be drawn from the experts present at the training. He stated that the Nigerian team would strive to arrive at the conference early so that they can take part in the negotiation from the beginning, stressing that ""It is important to be there on time, because if you are not there during the Regional Group/African Group meeting/G77 Group meeting then you will be completely lost as per the position that is going to be negotiated. Those are the Groups where you also have to ensure that your position is negotiated. You have to ensure that what the African Group is passing on to the G77 contains your position and what G77, as a bigger Regional Grouping, is passing on to the Main Plenary also reflects your position."" The key issue that would be on the table at the conference, he said is the consideration of all Thematic Areas highlighted in the Co-chair Text that would lead to the adoption of another climate change agreement in Paris. He said Nigeria wants the new agreement to address the inadequacies of the previous Treaties in terms of why have the two existing Treaties become inadequate. ""For instance, under the Convention, have we been able to meet the target or have the developed countries been able to meet their target or their commitment under the Kyoto Protocol? These have not been met; so we regard them as inadequate; then we have to make sure that all these are properly addressed. We need an ambitious scale of emission reduction to help the climate. Therefore, the contribution of the developed countries to be submitted should be ambitious enough to help the climate."" He said it was important for this to happen because if at the initial stage we discover that all those emission commitments under the INDC are not going to be helpful to the climate then there is no point in having another agreement because we already have two existing agreements that are not adequate in terms of their emission reduction, in terms of finance and capacity building. Whichever one we are coming about in Paris must address all these inadequacies."" Adejuwon said the good news about the Paris agreement was that it would not become operational until 2020, ""meaning that even if the INDC submitted now are adequately addressing the problem of climate change, there will be room for review of the INDC by various Parties before 2020 and maybe have something that will be very adequate to help the climate."" Legal Perspective of the outcome in Paris was presented by Mr. Huzi I. Mshelia of Clean Energy Consult. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria42","Waiting for doomsday","January 6, 2016 Wednesday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Belated action on gas flaring heightens Nigeria's climate risks Decades of pollution have pushed the world to the verge of monumental disaster, with global warming sending distressing signals of an imminent doom around the globe. The year, 2015, has been adjudged the warmest on record but experts warn that 2016 would even be hotter. Over the past 100 years, 14 of the hottest summers have occurred since the year 2000 and the world is already suffering from rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, increased droughts, erratic storms, among others. In Nigeria, 2015 has been adjudged the warmest on record, although experts warned that 2016 would even be hotter. Global effort to save the dying world led 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to a unanimous pledge to speedily curb emissions, strengthen resilience and take common climate actions. This was the highpoint of two weeks of tireless negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), held between November 30 and December 12, at Le Bourget, Paris, France. The leaders set a target of keeping global temperature rises below 2C (35F) and a five-year aim to increase ambition on cutting emissions. At the conference, the world agreed with one voice that the warning signals of climate change were harbinger of doom, and constituted one of the biggest threats of our time. The Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Magdy Martinez-Soliman, had in an urgent message at the event warned that climate change has exacerbated existing economic, political and humanitarian issues around the world. ""Hard-won gains that have helped communities increase access to food, health, education and other needs are at risk. In particular, for the poorest and most vulnerable, climate change can undo decades of development,"" he said. Investigation by Daily Sun revealed global average temperature of 14C (57.2F) rose by 0.72C and could be up by 0.96C in 2016. The African Development Bank identified the acute climate risks facing African continent from global warming. The President, Akinwumi Adesina, said concerted global action on climate change matters profoundly for Africa. ""Of all of the world's continents, Africa is the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. With so many Africans living close to poverty line, climate change could roll back"", he stressed. The AfDB warned that climate change is likely to reduce yields of major cereal crops across Africa. In Namibia for instance, climate impacts on agriculture would reduce the annual GDP by between 1% and 6%. The Bank said the continent's energy deficit could be solved through renewable energy, and took up the challenge to invest massively to increase energy access while avoiding emissions. Its investment in renewable energy projects has already totaled $2.1billion. Confirming the worries of the African Development Bank, research by the UNDP revealed that climate change impacts had already brought severe losses in agriculture among African countries. Deaths from malaria rose from 429,000 to 772,000 in 2010, a trend that was climate driven. Annual temperature increases and reductions in precipitations would reduce water availability, exacerbate the vulnerability of agricultural systems and increase climate-relevant health impacts. It has also brought increase of severe stunting in children, with UNDP report putting it at 31% to 55%. Like the devil on the loose, climate change unleashed 711 natural disasters on Africa, that killed 40,000 people and affected 137 millions others from 2005 and 2014, as disclosed in UNDP and Climate Change- Zero Carbon, Sustainable Development report. In African continent where 388.8 million people live on less than $1.90 a day, the impact of acute climate change could hardly be imagined. Although the UNDP had invested $611m in 41 countries across the region, the impact of such huge intervention is yet to be seen in cushioning the growing threat of climate risks. In Nigeria, this global scourge has already left devastating impact on the people. Investigation revealed an increased threat to food insecurity, as well as an increase in malnutrition among children. Agrarian communities that once boasted of being the food basket of the nation now struggle to feed themselves. In many rural communities in Enugu State, residents lament the death of orange trees, cashews and other cash crops in large numbers. Coupled with this is the gradual depletion of livestock in many farms. A local farmer, Ugwu Ajogwu from Abbi community, Uzo-Uwani LGA, said several families in rural areas that depended on agriculture for survival were going hungry because of consistent low yields of cassava, yam, cocoyam and other crops in the farm over the years. ""We were asked to use fertilizers but that never improved the crop yield. I find it difficult to get one barn of yam. Many years ago, I got as many as five barns after the harvest. We are discouraged because after the planting season, we harvest little or nothing"", he said. Aside the failure of crops in these agrarian communities, investigation by Daily Sun further revealed that climate change induced flooding in many states, especially in 2012 when Anambra, Kogi, Benue and other states were submerged in flood, and farmland eroded. The unfortunate incident displaced over one million families across the country, resulting to poverty, disease, migration and increased social tension. Coupled with this is the rising sea level, which has become a serious threat to many coastal communities, including Lagos, River Niger and Benue areas. Reports indicate that Africa's biggest cities, including Lagos, Accra, Dar es Salaam, Maputo located on the coast could face worse scenarios in years ahead. With an estimated 20 million people in Lagos, the impact of heavy flooding would better be left unsaid. Also 10 million people are reportedly at grave risk from flooding in Cameroon, Mozambique, Senegal and Tanzania. As if these weren't enough, climate experts warn that changes in rainfall could reduce water availability in some regions, which could put as many as 90 million people across Africa at risk of having no access to water. This could arise if rainfall drops to the point at which ground water resources becomes non-renewable. Despite these glaring threats, most African countries, including Nigeria, have continued to handle climate change issues with kid gloves, with little or no framework to cut local emissions. Although Nigeria ranks among the biggest polluters in the oil and gas sector, the country is yet to sign the zero gas flaring initiative of the World Bank, which already had endorsement of 45 countries. Investigation by Daily Sun revealed that about 140 billion cubic metres of natural gas released yearly during oil production is burned (flared), and wasted in thousands of oil fields around the world. This unhealthy practice results in the emission of 300 million tons of C02 into the atmosphere, equivalent to the emission of 77 million cars. If this gas had been captured and used in the production of electricity, it would provide 750 billion kilowatts, higher than the current consumption need of the whole African continent. Sadly, Nigeria is numbered among the offenders in the oil and gas sector. In his book, African: Crude Continent, The Struggle for Oil Prize, Duncan Clarke, said Nigeria exports 3.5BCM daily, while flaring amounts to 2.5BCM daily (domestic market supply is only about 0.5BCM daily). The flared gas amounted to $2.5billion annually. ""The carbon dioxide and methane emissions have had enormous impacts on noise and natural habitat as well as the adjacent communities. Human Rights Watch has claimed more alarmingly that 40% of the Delta will be uninhabitable within 30 years"", he warned. The Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed, had promised recently that Nigeria would join the other 45 countries pushing for an end to gas flaring by 2030, with an ambitious target of reducing gas emissions by 20%, with a projected rise to 45 per cent with the support of the international community. But experts warn that such promises were made in the past but never fulfilled. Speaking at the Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ) official side event, a stakeholders meeting convened by the Government of Norway, the Minister was ambashed by the pressure mounted on Nigeria and promised, on behalf of the Federal Government, to embrace the global partnership. She said Nigeria would bind herself to the latest initiative. She lauded the World Bank initiative for cleaner oil and gas operations, noting that the group put emphasis on the partnership needed to achieve good results. In attendance at the crucial meeting were the President, Environmental Defence Fund, Fred Krupp, Eldar Saetre, Chief Executive Officer, Statoil, Non Dudley, CEO British Petroleum, Karen Florini, Deputy Special Envoy for Climate Change, State Department, United States, Time Sundtoft, Minister of Climate and Environment, Norway, Anita Marangoly George, Senior Director, Energy and Extractive Global Practices, World Bank Group, among others. ""This is a multi- sector approach. We have to take ownership from the power sector, from petroleum and the environment and it is incredibly important that we are on the same page, pulling at the same direction. We will try to get the policy framework and the plan in place, so that there will be coherence and coordination in place among the sectors that are involved"", the Minister said. In one of key presentations at the climate conference, Mohammed explained how climate variability aggravate social unrest and provide a breeding ground for conflict and mass migration in Nigeria. ""For example, Lake Chad in the North east of our country is today a mere 10% of its original size, having shrunk from 2,500sq.km in 25 years and livelihoods have been lost, thus exacerbating poverty"", she said. Although Nigeria had aligned herself to achieving a zero emission target, her successive failure to achieve cleaner oil and gas operations has continued to indict her before the eyes of the world. Reports indicate that Africa contributes about 4% of global emission, while Nigeria ranks among the highest emitters of greenhouse gases in Africa and also on the list of CO2 polluters in the world. In a report titled, Eyes on Nigeria, which x-rayed the environmental degradation of Niger Delta areas, Amnesty International said Nigeria prohibited gas flaring since 1984 but the poisonous flames have continued to roar in oil producing communities. The government repeatedly announced various deadlines for the cessation of flaring, but each deadline has passed without achieving any result. Amnesty International, in its report, said: ""When oil is pumped out of the ground, the gas produced is separated and, in Nigeria, most of it is burnt as waste in massive flares. This practice has been going on for almost five decades. The burning of this ""associated gas"" has long been acknowledged as extremely wasteful and environmentally damaging"". The group explained that gas flares, which burn as long as 24 hours everyday in many areas, had brought serious discomfort to people living near the flare sites. ""When gas is flared, the combustion is often incomplete, so oil droplets fall on waterways, crops, houses and people. In recent years, communities, NGOs and some health professionals have raised concerns about the impact of gas flaring on human health. The health risks may be particularly high for people with underlying health problems, for young children and the elderly and for pregnant women. Despite these repeated expressions of concern, neither the government nor the oil companies have carried out any specific study to look at the impacts of flaring on human health. This serious failure leaves [thousands]of people facing unknown short- and long-term risks. ""Given the potential for serious negative impacts on human health, as well as on livelihoods, the Nigerian government should conduct investigations into the effects on health and agricultural production. Such investigations are necessary in order for the government to properly discharge its international legal obligation to protect the human rights of the people of Nigeria,"" the group advised. Further investigation revealed that Nigeria exceeded the world average for natural gas flaring by 72% in 1991. In that year, while the world average for gas flared as a percentage of total production was four percent, Nigeria flared 76 percent of that total production. Flaring of gas in Nigeria for about 50 years has also been estimated to constitute a waste of $12.5 million annually, an amount that would have been earned if the oil-associated natural gas was captured, sold, or used as a local energy source. In an interview with Daily Sun in Paris, the Senior Director, Energy and Extractive Industries, World Bank Group, Anita Marangoly George, confirmed that gas flares at oil production sites around the globe burn approximately 140 billion cubic metres annually, which cause more than 300 million tons of carbon dioxide to be emitted to the atmosphere. She decried the poor utilization of wasted gas around the globe, which she said could be put to productive use to generate power for the entire African continent. An estimated one billion people in the world have no access to electricity. George said people living around gas flaring sites could also face health risks, as she urged other countries, with a special appeal to Nigeria, to show commitment to the pact. A research titled, Environmental Conflict and the Politics of Oil in the Oil-bearing Areas of Nigeria's Niger Delta by Abosede Babatunde revealed that the total emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas flaring in Nigeria amounted to about 35 million tons per year and it is on record that Nigeria flares the highest amount of gas in the world (World Bank, 1995, 2000/2001). According to the report, the percentage of gas flared in Nigeria, which is about three times the OPEC average, is about 16 times the world average. Despite decades of foot dragging, Nigerian delegation at the conference responded to the urgent call for global action with a renewed promise to end gas flaring in oil production sites in 15 years time. Without any clear framework in place to achieve this ambitious target, the Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed, endorsed the clean energy initiative and pledged that Nigeria would sail with 45 countries of the world that had already endorsed the World Bank pact on 'Zero Routine Flaring by 2030'. The toxic impact of gas flaring in oil producing communities could be seen in a joint study titled, Environmental Impact analysis of Gas Flaring in the Niger Delta Region, which was published in the American Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research by E. C Ubani and I. M Onyejekwe, from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri. The study revealed that the oil flare sites studied emitted 2525000.00 tonnes of carbon per day. The scholars had embarked on several visitations to the neighbouring communities adjacent to most gas flare locations to ascertain any existence of common environmental hazards. The result obtained in this research shows a marked trend as all the parameters considered showed a gradient away from the flare point in all the flow stations such as soil pH changing from acidic (4.0-4.2) to near neutral (6.4-6.6) away from the flare points and the average low soil moisture content of (17% -23%) as against 40% for the (10m and 20m) and control distance. These values, no doubt, portrayed a bad omen for the communities where these gas flares were located. Further investigation revealed that pollution from domestic and industry sources, over-exploitation of oil and gas resources and poor coastal developments and near-shore activities are resulting in a rapid degradation of vulnerable land, coastal and offshore habitats and shared living marine resources of the Niger Delta. This, no doubt, puts the economies and health of the populace at risk. Report from the IPCC suggests that 25% of global warming came from anthropogenic methane emissions. Findings revealed also that methane is over 25 times more potent that CO2 over a 100-year time horizon and over 80 times more potent over a 20- year horizon. Faced with these grim realities, the world looks on Nigeria to urgently heed the 2015 IEA report, Bridging the Gap, which stated clearly that reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector remains one of the five key opportunities to help meet the 2C emission goal set by the world.

Membership of the Senator Schwarzenegger 'Regions of Climate Action' (R20) Organisation was conferred on Ogun State on the occasion.Other dignitaries from the partnering institutions at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference included Mr Peter Hoddinott, Area Manager South and West Africa LafargeHolcim Mrs Adepeju Adebajo, CEO, Cement, Lafarge Africa Plc Richard Eckrich, Head, Infrastructure Fund, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and Dr Henry Neufeldt, Head, Climatic Change Unit of the World Agro-forestry Centre.Commenting on the Ogun State's participation at the climate conference, Governor Amosun said: ""The Forest Landscape Restoration project is a well thought out initiative, in partnership with two responsible institutions, NSIA and Lafarge Africa.""He noted that almost 70 per cent of Ogun State is arable land. There is therefore a significant potential for improving lives and livelihoods.Governor Amosun stated that the agro-forestry project is a win-win opportunity for companies and citizens, offering a range of benefits: it will reduce CO2 emissions by increasing vegetation and eliminating the current negative slash-and-burn practices it will create employment for young graduates and will help to diversify Nigeria's economy.Governor Amosun insisted on the absolute importance to address simultaneously, the short-term job creation necessity while preparing the climate change mitigation long-term challenge.Commenting on its commitment to the realisation of the project, Mr Peter Hoddinott, who is also the Group Managing Director/CEO Lafarge Africa Plc, said, ""as a responsible organisation we are working to minimise the impact of our activity on the climate. Lafarge Africa plans to replace 30 per cent of its fuel use from fossil to biomass by 2020. We need to put in place a solid structure to move into renewable energy, which is clearly what this partnership offers.""Speaking at the event on behalf of Mr Uche Orji, MD/CEO of NSIA, Richard Eckrich, said: ""The NSIA recognises the importance of agriculture to the economy a sector which employs around 70 per cent of Nigeria's population. We are, therefore, committed to supporting this initiative by helping to raise funds and leveraging our expertise in public-private-partnerships, in particular in terms of establishing a ""best-in-class"" project governance to enhance the scheme.""Eckrich added that NSIA's intervention was consistent with its strategy and echoed Hoddinott's hope that the project could be replicated if successful. \"

Gompertz told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Sunday that Nigeria had a lot to gain from the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP ) 21 , which is scheduled to hold from Nov. 30 to Dec.11 in Paris. The French envoy raised an alarm over the rising global temperatures, saying further rise could put the whole world in jeopardy. COP 21 , for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aims to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate and to keep global warming below 2C. Gompertz warned: If we don't reach an agreement in Paris, it is likely that temperature will continue to rise rapidly. Hence, the international panel on climate change found out that if temperature rises by four degrees by the end of the century, the average sea level could rise by one metre before the end of the century. Now Nigeria has a coast and you know what it means. Lagos could be wiped out. I mean, what I think the interest of Nigeria should be is to keep Lagos and the people living there and other coastline. We've seen example and there are other examples that Nigeria seashore could be wiped away. I have seen that in Senegal as well. In Senegal, I had examples of Beaches, touristic villages which have just disappeared, replaced and taken over by the sea,"" he said. Gompertz also noted the effect of climate change on the northern states, emphasising the need for Nigeria to contribute to the success of the panel. The envoy noted that the same threat applies to deforestation in the North. So I won't say Nigeria has direct immediate interest but this is a long-term interest for its entire population. He pointed out that Nigeria, like all countries, especially African countries, should show keen interest in the success of Paris conference. According to him, the idea of COP 21 is that we all share the same objective and we are confronted by the same threat. He emphasised that all of us, with different degrees, obviously should make efforts to contribute to that panel. Gompertz also reminded stakeholders on the need to bury their differences by turning our difference to responsibility."" There is no Plan B' as Ban Ki-moon says. Therefore, if we succeed, we will all succeed together. If we fail, we will all fail together,"" he said. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria45","Inclusive Growth and Global Justice","November 16, 2015","Daily Independent (Lagos)","As France and the world mourn the terrorist slaughter of innocents in Paris, the leaders of the G-20 are meeting in Antalya, Turkey.Terror will now vault to the top of the long list of pressing issues that will be discussed. The G-20, whose members account for about 85% of the world economy, has an important responsibility to respond to challenges that affect the lives and prosperity of millions of people around the world. It cannot risk falling into complacency and inaction, whether regarding terrorism or the fragile state of the world's economy. Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014, our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organization's members. This effort has been built on three pillars: decisive implementation of past commitments, boosting investments as a powerful driver of the global economy, and promotion of inclusiveness so that the benefits of growth are shared by all. When it comes to implementation, great strides have been made. By promoting sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and implementing solid, structural reforms, we have made significant progress toward our objective of expanding the G-20's collective GDP by 2.1% by 2018. The global financial system is now more resilient than it has ever been. Financial capacities are being rebuilt, and new growth targets are being met. But there remains much more to be done. G-20 members should expedite efforts to deliver on their commitments to boost productivity and eliminate structural bottlenecks to investment, competition, trade, and jobs. We must also cement the fundamental reforms to the global financial system that the G-20 has delivered over the past seven years. Our focus on investment - a key driver of growth, jobs, and development - is also beginning to pay off. There is a huge investment gap in the global economy, both in advanced and developing countries. That is why we need developed-country strategies that bring together concrete policy actions and commitments to improve the investment ecosystem, support small and-medium-size enterprises, and promote the construction of efficient, high-quality infrastructure. If the G-20 members fully implement their commitments under these strategies, their collective GDP is expected to increase by another 1%. Economic growth must be strong and sustainable; but, above all, it must be inclusive. Inequality is rising in many G-20 countries; in some cases, it has reached historic highs. This is a dangerous development, one that can retard growth, threaten the cohesion of societies, and jeopardize people's wellbeing. It is imperative that the G-20 tackle inequality head on and demonstrate its determination to ensure that all of its member countries' citizens enjoy the fruits of economic growth. Reducing unemployment is central to the fight against inequality. There are about 100 million jobless people in the G-20, and another 200 million young people who are neither working nor studying. Significantly reducing youth unemployment is one of the G-20's most important commitments. Inclusiveness cannot stop at the borders of the G-20. We must work to ensure that the benefits of growth and prosperity are shared by people all over the world. In Antalya, we will discuss how we can align our efforts with the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and increase our engagement with low-income, developing countries. As politics and economics are increasingly intertwined, the G-20 must also work together to confront our era's geopolitical challenges. This year is an important one in the fight against climate change. We must send a strong political message from Antalya in support of a successful outcome at the United Nations Climate Change Conference that takes place in Paris from November 30 to December 11. Meanwhile, the terror attacks in Paris have brutally reminded us, once again, that global challenges - such as terrorism, the war in Syria, and the refugee crisis - require truly global responses. The G-20 is an ideal forum in which to address them. The Syrian civil war - now well into its fourth year - must be brought to an end, and a fair and sustainable political transition must be ensured. The conflict and the brutal state terrorism of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime is not only the cause of terrible suffering in Syria and the death of more than 360,000 people; it is also the root of the refugee crisis and the emergence of Daesh - a threat to all countries. Turkey is a member of the coalition against Daesh, and we are seeking to degrade and destroy this terrorist menace in our country and beyond our borders. At the same time, we must not allow ourselves to forget the plight of those fleeing the brutality of the Assad regime and Daesh. The international community that shuddered at the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian toddler who was found dead on a Turkish beach, must be made to remember that many more like him are dying every day in the cold waters of the Mediterranean and the Aegean. Turkey is currently hosting some 2.2 million Syrian refugees, and we have spent more than $8 billion over the last three years caring for them. The international community must agree on a mechanism that ensures that the burden is fairly shared. Finally, it is important to note that Turkey continues to confront the threat of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organization listed as a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union. Turkey has implemented a large number of reforms and made major investments to the benefit of our Kurdish citizens. And yet the PKK has refused to disarm, instead amassing weapons and attacking civilian and security targets across the country. As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country, we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris, but to reject terrorism in all of its forms. The G-20 Summit in Antalya will address these and other major issues confronting the world. Whether the subject is economics, finance, climate change, or politics, the guiding principle must be equality and justice for all. \"

Buhari spoke while presenting Nigeria's position at the ongoing Conference of Parties 21 ( COP21 ). According to him, the challenges were also threatening human lives, adding that they have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures. Also speaking on the devastating effects of insurgency in the country, the president also remarked the drying up of the Lake Chad Basin was consequent upon the effect of climate change. He said: ""Like many countries, Nigeria continues to witness the adverse effects of climate change in all its ramifications. Presently, we are reeling under the challenges of climate change as the frequency and intensity of extreme events like floods and drought are on the increase. ""These challenges have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures and more worryingly, threatening our national food production and security.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria47","Training the next generation of African experts to tackle climate change","December 17, 2015 Thursday","Business Day","Ahead of COP21 The potential benefits of increasing Africa's renewable capacity are significant. It has been predicted, for example, that solar power could become the continent's most significant power source by 2050. This requires substantial financial investment and the development of local technical capacity. Unfortunately, there is a significant skills shortage in the areas of climate monitoring, reporting, mitigation and adaptation on the African continent. As a result, it is of paramount importance that African governments build capacity at community, academic and institutional levels to produce actionable knowledge-based strategies which address the many and varied problems of climate change. Due to climate change, Africa has been heavily hit by droughts, rising sea levels and new weather patterns. The decreasing levels of rainfall in Africa are undermining harvests and contributing to food shortages. These issues are compounded by Africa's often marginalised voice in matters of climate change on the world stage. If concrete actions are not taken, more than 43 million people could fall into extreme poverty by 2030. In the face of the associated disaster risks, complex and transdisciplinary solutions are required. Such measures must be supported by careful planning, building and sharing of scientific knowledge and early warning systems. The technical aspects of each process must be underpinned by a rigorous research agenda which is directly applicable and usable for governments and policy makers across the continent. In light of these overarching trends, the role of the Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences (PAUWES) is of vital importance in pooling resources and coordinating research and training in Africa to navigate the risks brought by climate change. The discussions at COP21 will undoubtedly highlight the need for capacity building in the form of educational training in Africa, and PAUWES sits at the nexus of such efforts. PAUWES is a trilateral project between the African Union, Algeria and Germany. Algeria is proud to host the Institute, which is situated on the campus of the University of Tlemcen, as it aligns with the new national programme of development of renewable energy launched by the Algerian Government to horizon 2030. Translating academia into policymaking, PAUWES is collaborating with African and European experts to design and implement a research agenda which will support governments across Africa in making strategic decisions and facing climate change head on. For example, one area that PAUWES is focusing on is growing technical capacity related to green growth, water management and security. This gives PAUWES a critical position in contributing to a more environmentally, politically and commercially sustainable outlook on the continent. PAUWES has a specific responsibility and assigned role to implement research programmes identified in the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa 2024 (STISA-2024) published by the African Union. This highlights the pan-African significance of the institution and its role in contributing to a lasting change in Africa in the area of climate change policies and strategies. Given PAUWES' focus on water and energy sectors, the institute is in a position to provide specialist insight and research on these vital areas for the continent. In particular, it will consider ways in which to facilitate much greater innovation, entrepreneurship and technology transfer that could raise the quality of research and higher education in Africa. Ultimately, the institute's underlying aspiration and role is to train students, equipping them with the skills that they need to translate ideas into reality. PAUWES is building the next generation of scientists and policymakers who will help support and shape Africa's policymaking in water, energy and climate science. Africa is currently paying a heavy price for the actions of industrialised countries, but through the talent and commitment of its young people, it can also play a definitive role in overcoming climate change in the years to come. \"

Beyai commended the Federal Government for taking some measures to implement the environmental remediation in Ogoniland as proposed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). MEDIA reports that the UNEP report on Ogoniland was released on August 4, 2011. In 2015, agreements were reached at the Ministry of Environment on the implementation of the report and we were involved in the assessment process.

According to WHO, of the three billion people worldwide that cook and heat their homes using open fires, coal and simple stoves burning biomass - wood, animal dung and crop waste; a total of 4.3 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels. The report further revealed that more than 50 per cent of premature deaths among children under five are due to pneumonia caused by particulate matter (soot) inhaled from household air pollution; while 3.8 million die prematurely annually from non-communicable diseases, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer are attributed to exposure to household air pollution. Of the 4.3million that die yearly due to domestic pollution, the world body noted that 12 per cent deaths are due to pneumonia; 34per cent from stroke; 26 per cent from ischaemic heart disease; 22per cent from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and six per cent from lung cancer. Nigeria ranks high in the use of kerosene, firewood and coal as domestic sources of energy. Despite local and global interventions to address the problem of Nigeria's local under-utilisation of LPG as domestic fuel, the country has remained one of the lowest consumers of the product in sub-Saharan Africa and the highest consumer of firewood, kerosene and other dirty fuels. The World Bank and the World LP Gas Association (WLPGA) had in 2003 developed a strategic roadmap for the country but this measure could not promote the growth of LPG market due to lack of a deliberate policy on the part of government to promote the use of the product. The poor utilisation of LPG degenerated to the extent that by 2007, the product was virtually disappearing from the Nigerian market, following the collapse of the refineries, the country's main supplier. The development forced an intervention by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who directed the Nigeria LNG Limited to set aside a certain volume of its production for the local market. This step, which was government's greatest intervention in the history of the LPG sector in Nigeria, successfully resolved the supply challenges as NLNG initially set aside 100,000 metric tonnes yearly for the local market. However, it has failed to encourage the use of LPG as the government has continued to promote the use of other dirty fuels, particularly, kerosene. While other countries such as India, Indonesia and several others have sincedeveloped actionable policies to switch over their citizens from the use of dirty fuels to LPG, the federal government has continued to pay subsidy on kerosene to encourage the use of the product at the detriment of LPG, which is safer, cleaner and a more environmental-friendly product. Even the LPG supplied by the NLNG is sold in the domestic market at international market price, despite the fact that it is Nigeria's natural endowment that is produced locally. Buhari's commitment on greenhouse gas emission However, as the country's contribution to address the issue of climate change, which has become a global issue, President Buhari recently committed to cut its greenhouse gas emission by 20 per cent from year 2020. The Presidential spokesman, Mr. Femi Adesina had also revealed that President Buhari had approved the submission of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to address climate change to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), during the recent meeting of the world leaders in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change conference , or COP 21 . The action plan reaffirms President Buhari's commitment to an economic transformation which places inclusive, green growth as key priority for this administration, the statement said. He said President Buhari was fully aware of the acute threat that climate change poses to Nigeria's development through flooding, desertification and insecurity, stressing that many of these accrue from weather-related natural disasters. Reduction of GHG emission Though the role of LPG in the INDC prepared by the federal government to address the issue of climate change could not be ascertained, it is evidently clear that the promotion of the use of the product above other fuels will help the government to realise its 2020 aspiration of reducing GHG emission by 20 per cent. The dirty smokes from coal, firewood and kerosene causes health hazards and alters the natural composition of the climate, thus causing climate change. Also the felling down of trees for firewood has resulted to desertification and other weather-related disasters. So, any measures adopted by the government to encourage the use of LPG and discourage the use of kerosene and other dirty fuels will contribute significantly to reduce greenhouse gas emission as committed by President Buhari. At the recent fifth annual conference of the Nigeria LPG Association held in Lagos recently with the theme ""LPG: The Future is Here,"" the President of the Nigerian LPG Association, Mr. DayoAdeshina insisted that LPG would play a significant role in realising President Buhari's commitment in Paris. ""LPG plays significant role in achieving that if we can make that switch from the dirty fuels like kerosene, firewood and coal to LPG. Nigerians need to be aware of the role LPG plays. We have been saying it for years but nobody listens. But the time has come for the government to take control; and to take charge of the awareness campaign to switch people if they truly want that 20 per cent reduction,"" he said. He urged the federal government to adopt the Indonesian model by providing cylinders to help Nigerians to switch over to the use of LPG. In his speech, Director/Head of Import and Export Operations at Borkir International Company Limited, Mr. SahadiTukurhowever said for LPG to penetrate deeply into the Nigerian market, the problem of logistics should be addressed. ""If you have LPG but you don't have logistics to deliver it, it is as good as not having the product. We have to agree that logistics is the key in the business. Nigerians are very resilient. Roads are bad and we are having difficulty accessing money from the banks but we should keep on moving. We will be there one day,"" Tukur said. Also speaking, Mr. Femi Fanoiki of Longview Gas called for the construction of LPG terminals in other parts of the country to reduce over-dependence on Lagos and the attendant risks and costs of trucking product from Lagos to other parts of the country. ""We had expected additional terminals in other parts of the country but everybody still comes to Lagos to load LPG,"" he added. In his remarks, Mr. DitanOyekan of TSL Logistics said investment in infrastructure was key to the growth of LPG consumption in the country. ""We have now learnt that it takes eight days to do a complete cycle from Kano to Lagos. The Apapa problem will not go away in three months. Railway is another option but the rail infrastructure is dilapidated. So, how are we going to prevent these challenges from stopping our business? Even though it may take time to pay back but investment in infrastructure is the way to go,"" Oyekan explained. Removal of kerosene subsidy In addition to the challenges of getting LPG cylinders and accessories, the subsidy paid on kerosene by the federal government to encourage the use of the product by subsidising the cost is also one of the greatest threats to the use of LPG in the country. To encourage the use of LPG, Adeshina has also cautionedthe government against subsidising kerosene when the country has cheaper, cleaner and safer alternative fuel. Also speaking at the recent Nigeria LP Gas conference, a Professor at University of California, Berkley, Dr. Kirk Smith, said that ailments related to dirty fuel like kerosene and firewood would kill more Nigerians if nothing is done to encourage the use of cleaner fuel for cooking, powering machines, fuelling vehicles, among others. Delivering a paper entitled: ""LPG and the Health of the World's Poor,"" Smith revealed that when firewood is used as domestic fuel, it produces smoke that is equivalent to the amount produced by 400 cigarettes per hour. Challenges of cylinders/accessories About 10 years ago, the only source of supply of LPG in this country was through the refineries. About the same time, the only LPG terminal in Lagos was the one built by Pipeline Products and Marketing Company (PPMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). But other investors have since built more terminals - NIPCO Plc has 4,500metric tonne-capacity terminal in Lagos. Techno Oil Limited, Navgas, Forte Oil and other private investors have also built LPG terminals and invested heavily to grow the domestic market, thus effectively resolving the supply challenges. Techno Oil for instance, has distributed 20,000 units of gas stoves at discounted prices in the last two years. Though LPG is available in Nigeria today, access to cylinders and accessories has continued to hinder the growth of domestic consumption. The cheapest standard 12.5kg cylinder in the market is sold at N8, 500. When Nigerian companies were manufacturing cylinders within the country, the cost of cylinder was below N2, 000. But the two companies that manufactured cylinders locally have collapsed due to inadequate supply of electricity. The cost of importing cylinders and accessories is very high due to the high tariff and this has hindered LPG development. The President of the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Marketers (NALPGAM), Mr. Basil Ogbuanu has noted that the country is not even consuming up to 10 per cent of what it is supposed to consume. ""Algeria is about 20 million people. By world LPG record, Algeria consumes more than Nigeria that is over 160 million people,"" he added. Ogbuanu called on the federal government to remove the tariffs paid on imported cylinders and accessories to make them affordable for people to switch over to the LPG. It is therefore time for the present administration to develop a policy to discourage the use of kerosene and encourage the use of LPG, thus saving Nigeria from the dangers of indoor pollution and effectively contributing to the global effort to reduce GHG emissions, in addition to channeling the huge kerosene subsidy funds on the development of critical infrastructure. \"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria55","World Bank to mobilise $25b to fight climate change","April 8, 2016 Friday","The Nation (Nigeria)","The World Bank has promised to mobilise 25 billion dollars in private financing for clean energy by 2020 to fight climate change in developing countries. This is contained in a Climate Change Action Plan, released by the bank on Friday in Washington, with a promise to add 30 gigawatts of renewable energy to the world's energy capacity. Jim Kim, World Bank Group President said the plan was designed to help countries meet their Paris COP21 pledges and manage increasing climate impacts. He disclosed that to complement the World Bank's efforts, the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, promised to expand its climate investments from the current 2.2 billion dollars a year to a goal of 3.5 billion dollars a year. Kim said it would also lead on leveraging an additional 13 billion dollars a year in private sector financing by 2020. The president, said under the plan, the Bank would quadruple funding for climate-resilient transport and integrate climate into urban planning through the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities. He said it would also boost assistance for sustainable forest and fisheries management. Kim said this has become imperative because climate change threatened to drive 100 million more people into poverty in the next 15 years. ""Following the Paris climate agreement, we must now take bold action to protect our planet for future generations. The president said the bank is moving urgently to help countries make major transitions to increase sources of renewable energy and decrease high-carbon energy sources. Kim said it would also include developing green transport systems, building sustainable and liveable cities for growing urban populations. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria56","On the global climate deal and Nigeria's pledged actions","December 21, 2015 Monday","Business Day","This is a year of big global events, of multilateral negotiations and regime formation. I have followed these global talks closely because I have intellectual and professional interests in the legal and political economy aspects of global governance. I believe the multilateral negotiations reveal the potential for cooperative action in global governance, but they also tell us something about the self-interest and game-theoretical considerations that stop nations from cooperating. For me, three of these multilateral events stand out this year. I have written about two of them in this column; the third is the subject of this piece. Unarguably, the first major global diplomatic event this year was the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, held in New York from 25 to 27 September, when world leaders adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The summit itself was preceded by the Third International Conference on Financing for Development held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from13 to 16 July. Then, last week, as I wrote on these pages, the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC10) took place from 15 to 18 December in Nairobi, Kenya. However, a week before the trade summit, the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention in Climate Change (UNFCCC) had taken place in Paris from 30 November to 11 December. These global events are important because of the linkages and synergies between them. The development, environmental and trade issues are complementary, which is why the three summits make reference to one another in their agendas. For instance, the Sustainable Development Agenda strongly emphasises the role of climate action (goal 13 of the SDGs) and trade (goal 8) in meeting the development objectives and targets. However, while negotiating the SDGs was relative non-contentious, securing new agreements in the trade and climate regimes have usually proved difficult. This is why the conclusion of a climate treaty at COP21 in Paris is remarkable. The climate agreement has been described superlatively as 'the first universal climate treaty ever', a 'major leap for mankind' and a climate deal that will 'change the world'. The rhetoric has, indeed, been stratospheric! But is the agreement truly historic? If so, why and what does it actually say? Furthermore, what's Nigeria's contribution to the Paris deal? I will deal with the systemic questions first, then come to Nigeria's pledged actions. To answer the systemic questions, we should first take a brief tour of the history of climate talks to give us some perspective on what was achieved at COP21 in Paris. Now, the starting point in our narrative is the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. For it was in Rio that the international climate regime was created with the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention in Climate Change (UNFCCC). The convention was signed in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. The UNFCCC was established to tackle global climate change through legally binding climate agreements, negotiated by its supreme decision-making body, the Conference of the Parties (COP). However, since its first COP in Berlin, Germany, in 1995, it constant struggled to produce a universal treaty. While every country agreed that climate change poses severe and even irreversible dangers and needs to be tackled, none wanted to accept binding national carbon production targets. As the Oxford professor, Dieter Helm, puts it in his book, The Carbon Crunch, 'when it comes to climate change, self-interest and collective interest are very different'. However, the Kyoto Protocol made some progress in setting binding carbon productions targets. It was adopted in 1997, entered into force until 2005 and remains in force until 2020. But the protocol is flawed in at least two respects. First, it is expected to cover only 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emission by 2020. Second, the United States, the world's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2), releasing 5.6 billion tonnes (15 per cent of the world's total), did not ratify the Protocol because China did not have a cap. China, of course, is the world's biggest emitter CO2, releasing 9.5 billion tonnes (27 per cent of the world's total). Given these limitations, efforts were made at several COPs to develop a successor to the Protocol that is legally-binding, ambitious and universal. For instance, attempts were made at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009to produce a binding treaty. But those efforts failed after the US and China rejected the EU's call for a legally-binding treaty. However, COP15 was not without some success. While it didn't result in a treaty, it nevertheless produced a political agreement that cleared the path for the Paris agreement. The political agreement, albeit reached by a small set of countries, was to keep increase in long-term average temperatures below two degree Celsius (2C), relative to pre-industrial levels. They also agreed to establish the Green Climate Fund through which $100 billion per year of public and private climate finance would be available to developing countries by 2020. This pivotal political deal was later formalised by 196 countries at COP16 in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, under what was known as the Cancun Agreement. Yet, it subsequently proved difficult to turn the Cancun Agreement into a legally binding treaty. At COP17 in Durban, South Africa, in 2011, the US, China and India continued to resist pressure from the EU to create legally binding emissions targets, and even Japan, Canada and Russia did not want a 'Kyoto plus' agreement. Despite the conference being extended for a couple of days, all that was agreed was an £greement' to try to reach an agreement! Things began to look a little better, however, at COP20 in Lima, Peru, in 2014. In Lima, the countries agreed to communicate their Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDCs), their pledged actions, under a new treaty, well in advanced of COP21 in Paris. It was this heavy build-up to COP21 , coupled with the political will to reach an agreement, which led to the success of the talks. But how historic is the Paris agreement? Well, two things are certainly remarkable about the deal. The first is the scale of the ambition, the second the coverage. On the first, Article 2 of the agreement commits the parties to 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial level'. The commitment to aim to limit average temperature increase to '1.5C' was not envisaged before the conference, but it has been widely welcomed as the level of ambition needed to face the challenges of climate change. The second remarkable achievement is that the Paris deal was agreed by 195 countries, including the big emitters, China, the US, the EU and India. This comprehensive coverage thus, indeed, makes the Paris agreement 'the first universal climate treaty ever'! Yet, despite all that, the treaty is still inadequate in one critical respect: it is not legally binding. It is more or less a statement of promise. For instance, it is stated in the preamble that 'the Agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation'. Furthermore, although Articles 13 and 14 of the treaty creates a stringent monitoring and transparency regime, including a 'global stocktake', which involves a periodic stocktaking of the implementation of the agreement, it is stated clearly in Article 15 that the mechanism to facilitate compliance with the agreement shall be 'non-adversarial and non-punitive'; in other words, the agreement is not enforceable! The truth is that there would have been no agreement in Paris if countries were required to accept legally binding obligations. One interesting incident during the negotiation aptly illustrates this. In the draft Agreement that was presented for adoption, Article 4.4 had stated that the developed countries 'shall' continue to take the lead to reduce economy-wide emission, while developing countries 'should' continue to enhance their mitigation efforts. But the US objected to the word 'shall' and insisted it be changed to 'should'. In other words, the US did not want a legally binding obligation. The developing countries, particularly the Africans, opposed the removal of the word 'shall' from the developed countries' commitments. But without the US there would be no agreement. So, in the end, to prevent the talks breaking down without a deal, 'shall' was changed to 'should'. But, let's be clear, the treaty will not be without some bite. The stocktaking mechanism will ensure that countries are held accountable for their compliance with the agreement. Furthermore, the transparency mechanism will result in countries that fail to fulfil their national pledges being 'named and shamed'. However, although such reputational measures may have some effect of inducing compliance with the treaty, they are not the same as having a legally binding commitment. Now, what about Nigeria's contribution to the Paris climate deal? Well, for a start, I would say that Nigeria's preparation for the Paris talks was shoddy. Nigeria did not submit its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions until almost the last minute, despite two deadlines in March and October. The French ambassador to Nigeria had to make a public plea for Nigeria to submit its INDCs. The Federal Ministry of Environment said it had prepared the document but was waiting for President Buhari's sign-off. Buhari did not approve the INDCs until 26 November, and Nigeria only submitted the document to the UNFCCC on 28 November, just two days before the conference started on 30 November! Yet, President Buhari and the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, made high-profile visits to Paris for the conference. Certainly, Nigeria should be playing a leadership role in such matters, instead of competing with countries like Tonga and St Kitts and Nevis in being the last to meet such a simple obligation as submitting an action plan! Even the INDCs that Nigeria submitted fell short, in my view, of acceptable standards. It read more like an academic paper rather than a policy or strategy document, let alone an action plan. Nigeria's pledged mitigation and adaption actions are largely aspirational, some kind of a wish-list of things it would 'work towards', such as energy efficiency and renewable energy. The INDC document fails the SMART test, in not being sufficiently specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and time-bound. This contrasts sharply, for instance, with Ghana's INDCs, which listed 31 measures with their estimated costs. For instance, Ghana projected that its 31 pledged climate change mitigation and adaptation actions would cost an estimated sum of $22.6 billion, $6.3 billion of which it expected to mobilise domestically while the remaining $16.3 billion would need to come from international support. If Nigeria needs international support for its energy and climate change policy, it would need to prepare a proper and SMART action plan rather than the present high-level document. Of course, Nigeria's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is miniscule, at less than 1 per cent. But Nigeria faces serious climate change problems of its own. Indeed, a Pew Research Centre survey, cited in Nigeria's INDC document, shows that 65 per cent of Nigerians are very concerned about climate change threats. But these threats are not theoretical. Floods, drought, desertification, coastal erosion, deforestation and other harms caused by climate change and global warming are real in Nigeria. Yet all the human causes of climate change are also present in Nigeria. Take, for instance, energy, the production and use of which account for two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Nigeria still largely relies on fossil fuel for its electricity generation, with gas and oil accounting for nearly 80 per cent. And there is a strong clamour for coal to be given a significant role in Nigeria's energy mix, with the minister of power even suggesting 30 per cent of the mix. Of course, it's unrealistic to expect Nigeria to abandon fossil fuels when they are abundant and cheap and when the country has such a dire energy need, but we should also recognise the trade-off. More fossil fuels, particularly oil and coal, mean more carbon emissions and thus greater risks of climate change. Now, when you add the widespread use of generators, the use of traditional biomass for cooking by most Nigerians, the subsidisation of fossil-fuel (i.e. petroleum) consumption, massive gas flaring, and high CO2 emissions from transport and industry, all of which contribute to increasing rather than reducing carbon emissions, then it's clear that Nigeria needs a proper climate change mitigation action plan that can attract international support, including investments in renewable energy generation. At the moment, Nigeria's INDCs shows little sign of seriousness to tackle climate change. To be sure, the Paris climate agreement is ambitious and universal, but it's vague and lacks any binding force. If Nigeria doesn't want to be bound by an international commitment on climate change mitigation, the Paris agreement is good news, even though there is the reputational cost of being 'named and shamed' for non-compliance. Yet, if there are countries that should take voluntary actions on climate change, Nigeria should be one of them because we are affected by it, not least as fossil-fuel country! \"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria60","Gorilla Glue for Buhari [opinion]","December 12, 2015","This Day (Lagos)","It is difficult, indeed impossible, to know what exactly transpires inside the mind of a man. Even psychologists --- those pretty well informed about the infinite variety of the human mind --- may well tell you so. But I'm reasonably certain that President Muhammadu Buhari's mind gladdens exceedingly at every opportune moment to travel outside Nigeria for any event that ranges from the most ridiculous to the least sublime. Since Buhari was sworn in as president about six months ago, one has lost count of the number of official trips he has made overseas. If you factor unofficial trips into the equation, then be prepared to go as far back as when he made that much talked-about unscheduled visit to the United Kingdom (what for? I still don't know) ahead of his swearing-in earlier this year. Now no one begrudges the president of Nigeria his right to travel outside the country for official or unofficial business; that, at the very least, comes with the territory. And boy, Nigerian presidents sure do love to gallop in and out of the country. Remember President Shehu Shagari? Well, the former president gained a jaw-dropping reputation for his nonstop junkets abroad in his exquisitely embroidered babaringa outfits. It did not matter whether the country was burning at the time, the frequency of Shagari's mostly sybaritic foreign trips was not to be interrupted. Self-styled military president Ibrahim Babangida circled the globe in eight years, and in much ostentation, too. The only place he did not visit officially, and please correct me if my memory suffers from cataract here, was the United States where he would have loved to be feted by then President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. Babangida, probably the smartest of Nigerian leaders in the last 50 years, lobbied obsequiously for this trip in such a way as portrayed him as having lost his self-respect and the dignity pertaining to the office he held. In his Second Coming, Olusegun Obasanjo, the irreverent critic, also did what he once lambasted Shagari for. And like Shagari also, Goodluck Jonathan turned his attention elsewhere as his country combusted. Even when a section of the country was under siege by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram with as many as 2,000 victims just slain by the group in Baga village in January, Jonathan, the outsider who cried louder than the bereaved, the Rip van Winkle who would help other men's wives with chores while those meant for his wife remained untouched, still found both the time and sufficient ""reason"" to travel to Paris imaginatively, if not physically, to join the leaders of other countries gathered there to mourn the 12 victims of Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical weekly, who had been gunned down by Islamic terrorists in January. Jonathan came under searing fire for that, especially for his failure to acknowledge the worse tragedy that had just happened in his own country. Nigerian leaders have a large natural propensity for doing outrageous things. It is that same ailment that Buhari appears to be terribly suffering from, and his strain, already so exasperating, threatens to be without precedent and, as a consequence, remedy. As I wrote this, the president was in far-away Paris attending to some universal problems with rather mundane, humdrum significance in comparison with a multiplicity of internal travails in clamorous need of urgent, sustained attention. This is by no means an attempt to discount the importance of safe-guarding our environment from willful human depredation, but shouldn't President Buhari be home at the time looking for that elusive silver bullet to the very heart of Boko Haram instead of being at the United Nations Climate Change Conference where all he was required to do was give one or two presentations and yawn and get some sleep and watch a football match and then jet back home? Buhari must have woken up last Sunday morning in Paris to yet another sad news of Boko Haram attack on yet another northeastern Nigerian town. As is consistent with many of the group's attacks, Sunday's attacks was audacious. The group stormed a military base in Gulak town, Yola, sending soldiers to flight. It fell to the town's civilian population to repel the terrorists and reclaim their town. Why does this have to be so? Why are Nigerian soldiers still impotent under the firepower of Boko Haram many months after Buhari promised to lick the problem? But as seemingly intractable a problem as Boko Haram is, it is only one of many others Nigerians have found so wearisome under Buhari. Government is not working for many. Our democracy remains increasingly fractured with cries of secession issuing forth from parts of the south, cries we may ignore now at our own peril later. Buhari claims to be fighting corruption, but it has been, to use a hackneyed term, all motion with no progressive movement. Whole towns and villages remain without electric power. Millions are either out of job or have been without one in the first place for years. It took Buhari almost a lifetime before he finally emerged with a ministerial list, and when he did they were all men and women that did not justify the eternity he had invested into the search. It all reminded you of Diogenes, that legendary Greek figure who, carrying a lamp in broad day light, went from one Athenian street to another looking for an honest man. He never found any. We can go on and on. The bottom line is these are problems that need the president's laser-like attention at home. He can dispatch his ministers and designated envoys to Paris or Honolulu or Timbuktu or Outer Space to attend to some of the emerging national and universal concerns while he hunkers down back home meditating and acting meaningfully on pressing problems. Unfortunately, that is not the style of this president. His style bears striking resemblance to that of General Sani Abacha who mastered a policy of deceptive indifference to things, including emerging threats. But unlike the late Abacha who would suddenly strike like a cobra from atop its topmost coil where it had sat poised watching, Buhari, instead, is apt to resort to impotent griping about the difficulty of the problems he is faced with. Part of what made Buhari appealing during the last presidential campaign was his ability to sit down and find daring solutions to difficult problems during his First Coming as military head of state. You may disagree with some of his prescriptions and actions then, but at least he was seen and felt to be doing something tangible. We believe he can still do that again, and if his problem is his inability to sit down in his office and do a hard day's work, then we will be left with no choice but to order him some Gorilla glue to keep him adhered to his chair at Aso Rock or wherever he administers this country from.

Okonjo-Iweala, who spoke at the Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (UNFCCC) in Paris, Franc, said Nigeria needs to get the private sector involved in the power sector, adding that government must look at renewable and off-grid solutions like the solar power generation. She said: ""Almost three quarters of infrastructure that Africa needs, we still don't have it. This means that the power we need, the road and the railway, we can still get these infrastructures and have it in a way that is friendly to climate change that lowers emission and puts us on a low carbon growth path. How do we do that? ""We have to get the private sector, we are looking at power, look at renewable energy, we are not saying renewable should be everything because Africa should have a mix. We can still use gas to some extent, but we should increase the renewable. Our companies that are investing should look at off- grid solutions, let our companies get off -grid solar solutions for our people before other people come into it because that is what always happens. Instead of flaring, we can use the gas, we can convert this gas for our use and I know government has the power to do that."" The former minister, who is also the Commissioner, Global Commission on the Economy and Climate spoke at a session titled: Climate Change in Africa: Financing Sustainable Pathways for Development at the ongoing Climate Change talks. She said the solution for climate change lies in Africa because of the opportunity to build renewable infrastructures on the continent. ""Africa should stop playing the victim game. We are not supposed to be going to the West to beg as victims, we should be telling them that the solution is in Africa. Our infrastructures are just developing we have the opportunity to build in a climate friendly way and avoid the mistakes of the developed nations, ""she added.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria62","FG Targets 2030 to End Gas Flare","January 05, 2016","Daily Trust (Abuja)","The federal government has planned to end gas flare in the country by 2030 according to the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), a mandatory but non-enforceable country level commitment to tackle the challenges of climate change submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The commitment submitted by Nigeria contained sets of strategy that would ensure that the country contributes to the successes of the Paris climate summit and grow its economy sustainably while reducing carbon pollution. The climate action plan seeks to considerably address the impact of climate change in the country as the northern part remains vulnerable to drought while sea-level rise, flooding, ocean surge and fluctuating weather patterns are common occurrences in the South. According to the plan, Nigeria aspires to achieve economic and social development by growing the economy 5percent per year, improving standard of living, electricity access for all under a mitigation objective of 20 per cent unconditional reduction in emissions and a 45 percent conditional reduction from business as usual. The INDCs identifies as key measures, the plan to work towards ending gas flaring by 2030, working towards off-grid solar PV of 13GW (13,000MW), deployment of efficient gas generators, and 2percent per year energy efficiency (30 percent by 2030). Other key measures are transport shift car to mass transit means, improving electricity grid and climate smart agriculture and reforestation. The plan reckons that under a business-as-usual growth scenario, consistent with strong economic growth of 5 percent per year, Nigeria's emissions are expected to grow to around 900 million tonnes per year in 2030, which translates to around 3.4 tonnes per person. The identified key measures could potentially reduce emissions by around 45 per cent, compared to business-as-usual. Nigeria's great potential for climate smart development is recognised in the plan with proposed support for implementation. Much of the reduction potential identified has zero net cost or indeed achieves a net economic benefit. The plan, therefore, is optimistic that the measures would benefit Nigeria, even before taking into account the climate benefits. Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed, said recently that following the outcome of COP21 in Paris, government was subjecting the INDCs to review to ensure that it becomes measurable, verifiable and achievable. \"

The Meeting is organised under the theme ""Innovative Financing and Renewed Partnerships to accelerate CAADP Implementation. He said growing pressure from competing demands for water, along with environmental imperatives, mean that agriculture must obtain ""more crops from fewer drops"". But, he added that with the implementation of the measures agreed at the Conference of Practice ( COP21 ) in Paris , France last year that Africa does not need to worry for too long. Speaking later at the opening of the conference proper, the former President said African leaders and the private sectors are now embracing the potential of Agriculture to deliver a more secured and prosperous future. He added "" We are building an effective transformative process that catalysis out shared goals of making the continent good secured."" Obasanjo noted that the former YARA food prize award now christened Africa Food Prize award is a clarion call for innovative solutions designed to take Africa Agriculture to a new height. "" with continue support of Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa and YARA, the prize will continue to grow. ""The prize was inaugurated in Oslo, Norway ten years ago by YARA international, but now moving to Africa by Africans for Africans.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria64","Climate change and Nigeria's energy mix","December 5, 2015 Saturday","Weekly Trust","The on-going Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change also known as COP21 , will, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aim to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'c2\'b0C. The COP is the international political response to climate change that started at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. One of the major topics that delegates and the 142 heads of governments that are participating in the conference would spend much time to discuss is the transition to green energy. For Nigeria, the issue of insufficient energy is one that experts say is retarding the country's progress. Electricity is pivotal to the development of nations. Its use is directly correlated with healthy economic growth. In Nigeria only about 40 per cent of the citizens are connected to the energy grid. The situation has forced people to find their own sources of power hence the introduction of generating sets by households, businesses and offices. According to the Global Energy Network Institute, consistent blackouts have crippled the nation's once vibrant industrial sector. Nigeria's energy grid is arguably in crisis due to lack of development with experts arguing that the key to making a more reliable energy sector was to find and use renewable energy resources, rather than simply relying on the country's non-renewable resources. As part of efforts to solve the problem, government had issued licenses to various stakeholders to explore other sources of energy other than the gas and hydro that is powering the various power generating plants. Three out of the four above resources used for energy production in Nigeria are linked with increasing greenhouse gas emissions: coal, oil and natural gas, with coal emitting the worst of the three. According to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) the importance of sustainability in energy is: the ability to preserve its use, the importance of energy in living standards and for economic development and the significant impacts that energy systems and processes have had and continue to have on the environment. Nigeria needs to invest in sustainable resources because of the obvious signs that it will be strongly impacted by environmental change such as: desertification, droughts, flooding, and water shortages. The biggest blow to Nigeria would be the low lying areas that contain many of their natural resources being flooded if ocean levels rise as predicted, since further development of hydro-electricity does not seem practical because of the dependence on the seasons for amount of water supply. Wind energy has potentials, but is unreliable for consistent energy supply. Nuclear energy could be a viable solution to the energy problem because of its lack of emissions and reliability. Nigeria also has easy access to the uranium needed for the plants but the issue of safety and maintenance as well as community buy-in is still a challenge. The Ministry of Mines and Steel in the last few years granted licenses to a couple of companies to explore coal. Nigeria has a large natural supply of this fossil fuel making it relativity easy to access and it would be the cheapest resource to develop into energy plants but its impact on the environment is terrible. From the NIMET's info sheet, Nigeria is endowed with an annual daily sunshine that is averagely 6.25 hours, and an annual average daily solar radiation of about 3.5 KWm2/day in the coastal area and 7.0 KWm2/ day at the north. Nigeria receives about 4909.212 kWh of energy from sun which is equivalent to about 1.082 million tonnes of oil; this is about 4000 times the current crude oil production per day, and also put at about 13,000 times of daily natural gas production based on energy units. There are indications that electricity production from the mix of conventional fossil fuels will occur in the future at a higher cost to consumers than the current levels. Nigeria is blessed with an abundance of renewable energy both as direct solar energy and indirect solar energy. Indirect solar energy includes water power in the form of hydroelectric power, wind power, bio-fuels derived from corn and other plants, biomass, and biogas from garbage and other biological wastes. Solar energy can be exploited directly in thermal applications (crop drying, water heating, distillation, solar cooking, refrigeration and air conditioning, thermal power generation) and in solar electricity production using photovoltaic converters. Before the beginning of COP21 , President Muhammadu Buhari approved the submission of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to address climate change to UNFCCC. The federal government's policy to address climate change, as espoused in the country's INDC, commits to 20 per cent unconditional and 45 per cent conditional GHGs emission reduction post 2020 and attaining this ambitious goal means the country must as a matter of urgency review its energy mix profile and place more emphasis on renewable energy. The opening of the global conference on climate change last week coincided with the launch of the global coal atlas, composed of a number of articles on mining and use of coal for energy and its socio-economic and environmental impact.

The Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed, led the Nigerian delegation to the crucial discussion to harmonise divergent views and give the continent a common voice in the ongoing negotiation at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP 21 . ""Climate Change may be just one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but without addressing it properly, all remaining 16 goals cannot be fully implemented.

Key officials of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) led by its President, Dr Khaled Fahmy, the Egyptian Minister of Environment, explained the precarious state of African continent buffeted by climate extremes like drought, flooding, landslides, water scarcity and diseases. They warned that rising sea levels would threaten Africa large coastal population, bringing enormous pressure on Agriculture, tourism, health, energy, fisheries, among other sectors. The Ministers admitted that although Africa produces the least carbon emission when compared with other continents, negative climate impact could put modest progress in the region into reverse. The President, African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, had in his earlier statement, warned that Africa was the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, when compared with other continents of the world. He said the shared commitment to a low carbon future that will emerge from the Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ), presents huge opportunity for Africa. "" The move towards a greener and more sustainable development pathway can be a spring ball for economic transformation. Africa has vast potential in clean energy. With the right vision and investments, it can be help lead a global energy revolution, leapfrogging to renewable technologies and improving lives through cleaner, safer energy for household use"", he further explained.

Presently, we are reeling under the challenges of climate change as the frequency and intensity of extreme events like floods and drought are on the increase.""These challenges have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures and more worryingly threatening our national food production and security.""The magnitude of insurgency Nigeria is facing cannot be completely explained away without taking cognisance of the threat of climate change.""Climate change is threatening not only the sustainable development of our social and economic activities but also the totality of human existence in our country as in other parts of the world.""At the sub-regional level, we are saddled with the challenge of the drying up of the Lake Chad Basin, which is resulting in the total wipe out of livelihoods of many communities surrounding this trans-boundary natural resource.""Regrettably, the world is leaving behind millions of people who depend on the Lake for their survival. The Government of Nigeria welcomes the Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Plan, and the Lake Chad Basin Commission and international partners for designing this climate-based plan.""In all, the experience of countries sharing the Lake Chad further illustrates the mutual challenge we face today and which must be collectively addressed without further delay.""He noted the inadequacies of existing climate change treaties, protocols and conventions, reiterating Nigeria's position that for the potential of Paris Agreement on Climate Change to be meaningful, achieve its objectives and eventually become universal in nature and scope, it must draw extensively on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.""Indeed, for the agreement to be durable, it must recognise not only the emission right but also the survival rights of the citizens of developing countries,"" he said, adding, ""The inadequacies of the existing climate change treaties, the Conventions and its Protocol, constitute the driving force propelling parties to reach another climate change agreement as the main outcome of this Conference of Parties.""Nigeria appreciates the efforts and demonstration of flexibilities of all in the run up of discussions since Durban towards evolving the new global climate regime. Yet, we are very concerned at the pace of progress made so far.""This is more important, since the negotiation continues to go back and forth without necessarily addressing the interests and concerns of the developing countries in general and African countries in particular.""In this regard, Nigeria strongly believes that the agreement we reach here in Paris must equitably address climate change mitigation and adaptation activities in terms of the means of implementation with emphasis on adequate financing, technology transfer and capacity development.""It is our fervent hope that these implementation modalities will be explicitly enshrined in the Agreement."" President Buhari gave Nigeria's target on cutting greenhouse emissions arrived at after extensive consultations with stakeholders by up to 45 per cent by the year 2030.He said: ""On our part in Nigeria, we undertook an extensive and participatory process of multi-level consultations with a cross section of stakeholders within the different tiers of government towards determining our national contributions to global mitigation reduction.""Based on national considerations, Nigeria intends to attain the mitigation reduction objective of 20 per cent unconditional and 45 per cent conditional below the Business as Usual level of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2030.""It is our expectation that this nationally-determined ambitious target given our national circumstances and developmental requirements will eventually pass the green test.""Buhari reiterated that the Paris Agreement must be legally binding, all-encompassing and sustainable for it to be universally applicable, result-oriented and in all, effective. ""The Agreement we reach here must also be a fair, multilateral and rules-based regime guided by science with an overall aim of ensuring the right to equitable access of every country of the world to sustainable development,"" he declared.Meanwhile, President Buhari has approved Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) or the country's plan to tackle the issue of climate change while promoting sustainable development and delivering on government priorities. The document is a requirement by Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-UNFCC) in preparation for the Adoption of Climate Change Agreement at the ongoing COP21 Paris conference.The INDC was prepared by the Ministry of Environment in recognition of the fact that significant challenges such as food insecurity, lack of access to energy and high unemployment, amongst others, remain principal constraints on economic development in the country and are of primary concern to the government.The document, therefore, focuses on the delivery of direct development benefits and sustainable growth of the economy.The Executive Summary of the INDC points out that in addition to these challenges, the country is considerably impacted by climate change."" \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria67","Abuja 2016 - Turning Point for Lake Chad Region? [analysis]","May 19, 2016","Daily Trust (Abuja)","The tone and tenor of speeches of Heads of State and government at the Regional Security Summit hosted on Saturday by President Muhammadu Buhari suggest that the countries in the Lake Chad region are looking beyond the Boko Haram terrorism. In all probability, the world would have benefited more from the leaders if the summiteers in Abuja had to say everything on the war situation as it enters its end in their territories but they, instead, chose to dwell on the promise of the future and what can be done to steer the economy and humanitarian situation into better times. While acknowledging the progress so far made, the summiteers who included French President Francois Hollande, Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari and ten other African Presidents, prime ministers and delegates concluded that defeating Boko Haram Terrorist Group will require a sustained comprehensive approach based on clear and coordinated plans of engagement at the regional level. Such an approach, they said, must confront challenges relating to effective security operations, providing civilian security and civil administration, restoring stability, and promoting economic development and job creation to break the cycle of violence in all countries where Boko Haram is active. Among other things, they recommended the enlistment of local community and religious leaders as constantly hammered on by President Buhari; increased intelligence sharing; the prioritization of the public education system and sparing no effort in the continuing search for the Chibok schoolgirls and all those abducted by Boko Haram by pooling intelligence resources. The leaders also agreed to support the victims of sexual violence or forced marriage by Boko Haram, and the need to provide them with appropriate support including reintegration to communities; that defeating the insurgency requires more than a Military solution but that it also requires government-led development action to tackle the root causes of insurgency in the Lake Chad Basin through the development of education and economic opportunities. The summit agreed to address the humanitarian situation affecting millions of IDPs, refugees and host communities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The critical situation of the inhabitants of the newly-liberated towns and villages was also adjudged to be very pathetic. The summit agreed to provide and rehabilitate facilities in the devastated towns and villages with a view to creating conditions for citizens to live without fear of violence and return to conventional life and called for additional support from the international community. They, in addition, took special note of the 20,000 unaccompanied children (below the age of 18 years) displaced by the conflict and over 6000 minors, under the age of five years, and agreed to work together with international organisations to reunite those children with their families. One other major step toward a lasting solution towards permanent peace in the region is identified as coming through the acceleration, specifically within three (3) years, of the implementation of the Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Action Plan as presented on the margins of COP21 in Paris in consultation with communities of the Lake Chad. It is hoped that the accelerated implementation of the Action Plan would go a long way in bringing development to the Lake Chad Basin. As a matter of fact, the summit blamed the impact of climate change for the unemployment and crime in the region and urged the LCBC and other willing partners to pursue the goal of inter-basin water transfer project with a view to restoring its normal level, mitigating drought, re-establishing fishery, irrigation and navigation. For Nigeria in particular, the period of the summit was used to receive an important visitor described as a friend of Africa, Francois Hollande who, in a literal sense killed two birds one stone. He engaged his host, President Buhari in a bilateral meeting in the early part of the day and in the afternoon, joined the other leaders at the summit. The two presidents reviewed the activities of the Multinational Joint Task Force, MNJTF and the progress made since the Climate Change agreement, COP 21 in Paris. President Hollande gave commitment to Nigeria on the resettlement of IDPs as well as his continuing support towards the reestablishment of full security in the Lake Chad region. Five agreements were signed between the Nigerian parties and their French partners. A cultural agreement and a scientific and technical agreement were signed by government ministers. Dangote Group's Dansa Foods Limited signed an agreement with the French company Nutriset for the production of nutritional foods in the North East. The state development commission, AFD of France signed two credit agreements with the Ministry of Finance and one with Zenith Bank for amounts that were not disclosed. In the margins of the security summit, the President also received in audience and at their request, Presidents Macky Sall of Senegal, Patrice Talon of Benin and Idris Deby Itno of Chad. The President also had audiences with the British Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Rt. Hon. Phillip Hammond, the U.S Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and the Deputy President of the European Union Ms Federica Moghereni. President Macky Sall raised concerns about the need for the emergence of a good candidate for the Chairmanship of the soon-to-be vacant African Union Commission in view of the decision of Mrs Zuma not to run for a second term. He told President Buhari that his country has such a capable candidate. He also raised an issue concerning the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan. President Patrice Talon seemed very keen to strengthen the very warm and friendly relations he met on the ground between his country and Nigeria. He intends to pay a State visit to this country in the shortest possible time. President Deby Itno gave important news about some Boko Haram hideouts on the border between our countries against which Chadian troops will soon to be tackling. He was also interested in promoting a railway line linking Nigeria and Chad. Right Hon. Philip Hammond had a lengthy time with President Buhari, their discussions spanning a wide range of issues including, of course Boko Haram, the reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure, and the insecurity in the Niger Delta, corruption and the issue of population growth in the country. Although this summit also discussed a yet-to-be fixed donors' conference on the rebuilding of the LBCD areas, the EU brought the good news of the plan to spend 140 million Euros in that regards in the next five years. President Muhammadu Buhari's just-concluded Regional Security Summit, which was the second after the initial one by President Hollande in Paris two years ago, has produced a communiqu\'e9 unprecedented in terms of the strong words used and the space devoted to fighting terrorism, post-conflict resettlement and rehabilitation as well as ways of bringing social and economic justice, growth and development to a battered part of Africa. It also unveiled an expansive security cooperation agenda that binds the West and Central African states to their U.S., European and Asian partners towards a lasting peace, itself a prerequisite for progress and development in the region and the continent. In spite of the foot dragging by some participants, President Buhari's key takeaways will include a benign consent to a partnership of the willing to recharge the Lake Chad with waters from rivers in Central Africa. On account of these milestones, the leaders had no hesitation is agreeing to make the Regional Security Summit a regular one.

The two-day EU-African summit in the Maltese capital Valletta which begins on November 11 and the UN COP21 climate conference in Paris at the end of the month must tackle long-festering problems in the region, Toby Lanzer, the UN regional humanitarian coordinator for the Sahel, told AFP this week. Both summits address key issues which are keenly felt by countries in the drought-stricken Lake Chad basin, where 2.5 million people have been displaced, some of whom have already crossed international borders to escape the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, he said. ""Asylum seeking, the refugee crisis, the environmental crisis, the instability that extremists sow -- all of those issues converge in the Lake Chad basin,"" Lanzer said. ""So there's a very compelling reason why the international community needs to step up and do more."" The world must help Lake Chad basin countries Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon to not only end the militant scourge but also tackle the effects of climate change, he said. Vast expanses of the lake have dried up and deprived people of their livelihoods of fishing, livestock farming and trade, he added. - 'Going pear-shaped' - Britain, France and the United States already work with the four regional countries to tackle the instability caused by Boko Haram. But there are growing concerns the unrest could spread due to potential links between Boko Haram and like-minded extremists in places like Libya and Mali, Lanzer said. Added to that, economic development and jobs are also badly needed for the region's burgeoning youth population who have few opportunities outside drugs and gun-running, people-smuggling and joining rebel groups. ""It's not only the fact that people are very poor: the fact there is instability, the fact there is tremendous environmental degradation, it's further compounded by a demographic situation,"" he said, citing the example of the Sahel where the population is seen growing by up to 150 million people over the next three decades. With so many problems, it was time for the world to act, ""to nip things in the bud"" to prevent the situation from deteriorating. The expected EU announcement in Valletta of a 1.8 billion euro trust fund for Africa, ""is a very concrete and welcome step,"" he said, expressing hope that other countries such as the United States would join the effort.

This is contained in a document E-mailed to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos. The document stated that the Executive Directors of the AfDB Group approved the institution's 2016-2018 work programme and budget on Tuesday, Dec. 8. in Abidjan, C\'f4te d'Ivoire. Under the budget, the bank envisaged lending of up to US 33.55 dollars billion for some 620 projects. The Board also approved 492 million dollars for its administrative budget for 2016. ""The 'High 5s' include Light up and Power Africa, Feed Africa, Industrialise Africa, Integrate Africa and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. ""This budget will give the Bank the means to implement its work programme and meet the growing needs of its clients, in the context of the challenges articulated through the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2015-2030, COP21 and the Financing for Development conference. ""Under the Programme, the annual lending volume for the ADB window alone is expected to exceed the target of between 4.04 billion dollars and 5.21 billion dollars per year. ""It would enable the Bank to promote stronger partnerships and leverage additional co-financing resources to help its regional member countries (RMCs) meet their development finance requirements. ""Over 2016-2018, it is expected that 517.31 million dollars will be made available as technical cooperation funds to cover costs related to technical assistance personnel, project execution, studies, training and other institutional capacity-building activities in RMCs. ""Overall, the 'Work Programme' is geared towards scaling up the implementation of the Bank's 2013-2022 Ten Year Strategy (TYS). ""It will help the bank sharpen its operational focus and interventions, respond to the new business environment, and strengthen its capacity and effectiveness,"" the bank stated. The 142-page document, which emerged from a year of long formal and informal board sessions as well as interactions between board members and management, focuses on selectivity, operational quality, decentralisation, internal capacity and financial sustainability. The President of the bank, Akinwumi Adesina, was quoted as commending the board for its high-level engagement in the preparation of the programme. ""The 2016-2018 programme and budget will enable the bank to continue delivering strong development results while reinforcing its financial sustainability.

The 2015 index released last Monday in London, United Kingdom, showed that Nigeria dipped in education and rural development since 2011. Nigeria's current demographic trend reveals high percentage of youths who need quality education and bigger percentage of its population living in rural areas that requires government investment for development. Nigeria scored below Africa and West Africa average in the four categories of safety and rule of law, participation and human rights, sustainable economic opportunity, and human development in the 2015 index, though with some sign of hope in its national security-one of the indicators. For the past 15 years, Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born British telecoms magnate, has drawn up an Index for African Governance taking African leaders to task on the need to sustain the gains and check underperformance in overall governance in different countries on the continent. Of the 54 African countries ranked in the index, Nigeria showed most improvement in human development, ranking 39th position in overall governance. ""The improvement in business environment in Nigeria made the difference, whereas business environment has declined in other African countries,"" Christina Nelson, a Senior Programme Manager at the Mo Ibrahim Foundation said in a telephone interview with THISDAY. Across Africa, the progress was very small, slight and stalling with a shift in the landscape that showed that in the last four years, half of the top 10 performing countries registered a decline of their governance performance. The index also revealed that half of the 10 largest improvers over this period include countries which already rank in the upper rungs of the Index, and may well be potential powerhouses. ""The results of the 2015 IIAG revealed that overall governance progress in Africa is stalling. Improvements in participation and human rights, and human development are outweighed by deteriorations in safety, rule of law and sustainable economic opportunity. ""Over the last four years, only six countries out of 54 were able to achieve progress in all four components of the Index. If we drill down a little further, to sub-category level, gains achieved in participation, infrastructure or health are of course heartening, but the drops registered by national security, rural sector, and, most of all, business environment, are cause for concern,"" Mo Ibrahim in his prologue for the index said. The top five highest overall scores are Mauritius, Cape Verde, Botswana, South Africa and Namibia. ""2015 is a milestone year for Africa. The future African landscape will be defined by the new Sustainable Development Goals which are meant to guide us for the next 15 years, and the decisions that will come out of COP21 . What is crucial is that the complexity of Africa is appreciated within these discussions, that the decisions made are based on data and sound information and that their implementation will be closely monitored according to results. In that context, my hope is that this Index can be a useful tool,"" Ibrahim added. At the overall governance level, Southern Africa was adjudged the best performing region in 2014 with an average score of 58.9, followed by West Africa (52.4), North Africa (51.2) and East Africa (44.3). Central Africa is the weakest performing region with an average score of 40.9. \"

The envoy said that the ground breaking ceremony would hold between June and July. "" The solar project for the University of Ibadan is a solar project we have been planning together with Nigeria partners for some time. ""It is part of the Nigeria-Germany energy partnership which has existed since 2008.

""We plan, after all the conditions are fulfilled, the ground breaking ceremony next month or hopefully in July. ""The idea is that the University of Ibadan will, by the end of the day, use only energy produced by solar power."" Zenner also explained that the university would gain several advantages from the solar project, adding that the project would be replicated in the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State. "" This has several advantages, first it is a lighthouse project for solar energy in the framework of the cooperation between Germany and Nigeria in the energy and power sector. ""Secondly, it helps the University of Ibadan save a lot of diesel; and thirdly, it is a training tool for students who study engineering.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria80","Global greenhouse emission drops to 32.1bn","March 30, 2016 Wednesday","SweetCrude Reports","Greenhouse gas emissions. 30 March 2016, Sweetcrude, Abuja \- The environmental threat of oil and gas production and utilisation may be gradually fizzling out as the International Energy Agency, IEA, has put the global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions at 32.1 billion. In its latest report, the agency disclosed that global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) \- the largest source of man-made greenhouse gas emissions \- stayed flat for the second year in a row, according to analysis of preliminary data for 2015. According to IEA Executive Director, Fatih Birol, ""The new figures confirm last year's surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth."" COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate change,"" he added. Birol explained that the latest figures indicated that global emissions of carbon dioxide stood at 32.1 billion tonnes in 2015, having remained essentially flat since 2013. The IEA preliminary data suggest that electricity generated by renewables played a critical role, having accounted for around 90 per cent of new electricity generation in 2015; wind alone produced more than half of new electricity generation. It noted that in parallel, the global economy continued to grow by more than three per cent, offering further evidence that the link between economic growth and emissions growth is weakening. The agency disclosed that in the more than 40 years in which the IEA has been providing information on CO- 2emissions, there have been only four periods in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year. It maintained that three of those \- the early 1980s, 1992 and 2009 \- were associated with global economic weakness. The agency noted that the recent stall in emissions comes amid economic expansion: according to the International Monetary Fund, global GDP grew by 3.4per cent in 2014 and 3.1per cent in 2015. According to the agency, the two largest emitters, China and the United States, both registered a decline in energy-related CO2 in 2015. The agency noted that in China, emissions declined by 1.5 per cent, as coal use dropped for the second year in a row. It maintained that the economic restructuring towards less energy-intensive industries and the government's efforts to decarbonise electricity generation pushed coal use down. It disclosed that in 2015, coal generated less than 70 per cent of Chinese electricity, ten percentage points less than four years ago (in 2011). The agency maintained that over the same period lowcarbon sources jumped from 19per cent to 28 per cent, with hydro and wind accounting for most of the increase. In the United States, it said, emissions declined by two per cent, as a large switch from coal to natural gas use in electricity generation took place. IEA stressed that the decline observed in the two major emitters was offset by increasing emissions in most other Asian developing economies and the Middle East, and also a moderate increase in Europe. It noted that more details on the data and analysis will be included in a World Energy Outlook special report on energy and air quality that will be released at the end of June. The agency indicated that the report will go beyond CO2 emissions and will provide a first in-depth analysis of the role the energy sector plays in air pollution, a crucial policy issue that today results in seven million premature deaths a year. Specifically, it disclosed that the report will provide the outlook for emissions and their impact on health, and provide policy makers with strategies to mitigate energy-related air pollution in the short and long term.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria81","People Must Be At the Heart of Development in Africa - Adesina [interview]","January 04, 2016","Vanguard (Lagos)","D octor Akinwunmi Adesina, Nigeria's former Minister of Agriculture and President of the African Development Bank Group was recently awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree (Doctor of Science, Honoris Causa) by his Alma Mater, Obafemi Awolowe University, Ile-Ife. In this interview with Jimoh Babatunde, he outlined his vision as President of AfDB i n the areas of provision of energy, industrialization, agriculture, integrating the continent and improving the quality of life for Africans. He said Africa Development Bank is investing heavily in infrastructure, ports, rails, air transport facilities that will make it easier to connect countries, land lock countries to coastal countries, adding that at the end of the day development is about people. 'We must put people at the very heart of development"", he said. Excerpt : On leading AfDB Once the election was over for me work started right away. For me it was not really about me but what Africans need quickly . First and foremost, if you take a look at Africa situation today, you have about five million Africans that are living on less than a dollar a day. For me that is absolutely not acceptable. Poverty must not become the comparative advantage of Africa, Africa has no business of being poor. Agric Minister, Akinwumi-Adesina This is a very rich continent. My job is to try and focus on development that make development happen in a faster way in the life of Africans. So I picked five priorities very quickly. One is to light up and power Africa, the second is to feed Africa, the third one is to industrialise Africa, the fourth is to integrate Africa and last is to improve the quality of life for Africans. On importance of the five selected priorities Look at some schools In Sierra Leone , I read story of some kids that actually read with electricity that somebody put a wire outside someone's compound and the kids come there at night to read. Does that make any sense?. So, it is very important for us to realize that today Africa looses three to four percent of its GDP every year for lack of access to electricity. So economic growth is stalled. We can easily be growing as a continent at ten, twelve and fifteen percent with electricity. Africans are very entrepreneurial but without electricity you are nothing. I believe that Africans are tired of being in the dark. So lighting up and power Africa is a great thing, we have to unlock the tremendous amount of renewable energy potential we have. Let me tell you how huge that potential is. Today, Africa only produces electricity the same size as Spain, the same size as Belgium. A whole continent of over 1.2 billion people, but if you look at the size of energy potential we have it is almost limitless. Take solar for example; our sunshine should do more than just simply nourishing our crops. They need to help us power our homes. The big hydros we have should be powering our industries. The numbers are staggering, Africa today in terms of renewable energy potential, take solar, it has 11 terawatts of solar potential all across the Sahara. The sunshine is there all the time You take hydro power, we have 350 gigawatts potential , you take wind power, we have 110 gigawatts potential. You take geo thermal which is very important in East Africa and Central Africa, you have another 15 gigawatts to that, So Africa absolutely has potential in energy, but you can't power industries with the potentials, you cannot light up a home with potentials. So we got to really unlock that particular potential. Second, I am particularly bordered by the fact that seven hundred million Africans today don't have access to basic cooking energy. 600, 000 of them die every year, fifty percent of those are children under the age of five, fifty percent are women. All they are trying to do is basic, just trying to cook. So they rely on fuel wood, on charcoal and so on. Nobody has to die simply trying to cook. So I made a decision that if God allows me to be president of the Bank for ten years, if we are loosing 600,000 people every year, it means for ten years, six million people would have died. I will never be such President. We are going to solve that particular problem and provide universal access to all seven hundred million Africans today that don't have access to cook energy, we will do it in that period of time of ten years. Second, we picked the issue of feeding Africa. 65 percent of all the lands left in the world is to feed nine billion people by 2050 is not in Asia, or Latin America but right here in Africa, but Africa cannot feed itself. If Africa is spending $35 billion importing food that it should be producing and as we do that we weaken our exchange rate. We are also exporting jobs and importing poverty at the same time as well as decimating the rural areas where you should be actually getting a lot of import. No, Africa must not only feed itself, Africa must have a higher level of ambition and actually feed the world because we have got the potential to do that. The third area that I picked which was around the issue of industrialization. You can't create jobs without industries and of course it is linked to the issue of power. If there is no power you cannot really fund industries as well. But industrialization is important. Take the example of the basic thing like cocoa. Nigeria, Ivory coast, Cameron and Ghana account for 75 percent of the total production of cocoa in the world, but we only account for two percent of the total value of the chocolates produced in the world annually and the market for that chocolate is 100 billion dollars in a year. So we are producing, others are getting rich. So Africans should not be at the bottom of the value chain in every thing. We must be at the top of the value chain. We cannot be producing crude oil, exporting the crude and importing Petroleum products. You can't also be exporting whether it is gold, platinum, Zinc, copper, we keep exporting raw materials. I have not seen any region in the world that has become prosperous exporting raw materials, because you are subject to global volatility in these markets. So, we made up our minds in the banks that we need to support African countries to industrialize. Today, African share of the global manufacturing is only 1. 9 percent and it is declining. It used to be 3.4 some years ago, so we are flat and so Africa must industrialize if it has to create jobs, so my position and that of the Bank is that everything Africa produces, we must add value to it. Whether it is oil and gas, whether it is minerals and metals, weather it is agricultural commodities. The fourth area, which is integrating Africa, is big. We have 54 countries which is a huge market. We must be trading more with ourselves. Today the volume of Trade is only about ten percent within Africa. In North America free trade area, it is well over 54 percent. Among the Europeans it is well above 70 percent. In Asia, it is well over 60 percent. No, that is why Africa Development Bank is investing heavily in infrastructure, ports, rails, air transport facilities that will make it easier to connect countries, land lock countries to coastal countries. We are also investing in ICT infrastructure for connectivity among countries, integration is very critical for us. And finally, is improving the quality of life of people. At the end of the day development is about people. We must put people at the very heart of development. They must feel the impact of developments in terms of education, in terms of skills, access to basic things like water, sanitation, health are very important. I don't accept that it is a great thing even when you make bore holes, we are used to making bore holes and sometimes I see when you make bore holes you make a big news about it. For the fact that you are making a bole hole is an indication of government failure. We must have access to pipe born water for people. Water is life and you must have access to it. These are what the Bank is focusing on. So, I have my hands full. On how Nigeria is going to benefits from the energy financing We are going to work with Nigeria big time on the energy sector. Nigeria is actually leading in terms of the reform in the energy sector with the unbundling of the utilities and the privatization of both power generation, power transmission and distribution. I think Nigeria should be highly commended. There are still a lot of work to be done. We have started discussions with the government and I know President Buhari is determined on the energy sector and we are determined to provide strong support. We have started that conversation. You will see it as it happens. On the take away from the recent COP 21 for Africa The COP 21 Africa is the least emitter in terms of green house emissions in the world. Only 4 percent, we are suffering in terms of the negative impact of that climate change. If you want to see the impacts take a look at Lake Chad. It used to be 25,000 kilometres but today it is 2000. The livelihoods are gone, the opportunities are gone. The whole area is taken over by terrorists because there is no livelihoods left there. So climate change not only affect agriculture or food, it decimates livelihoods and makes the degradation of the environment so bad that even terrorist take advantage of it. A lot of great is being done now on how to clean up all of that, but some of the root causes are these things I have just mentioned to you. So the positions of Africa in Paris are as follows. First and foremost, there should be a legally binding agreement that keep the temperature rise in the world to not more than two degree Celsius. In fact it should not be more than 1. 5 degree because right now, it is only one percent that Africa's is suffering. Second, that there has to be more financing for climate adaptation, as Africa needs to adapt to what it has not created and the African Development Bank made a very big case about this in Paris. Third what are we as Africans doing to solve the problem? I announced that AfDB will increase our support for climate financing to $5 billion a year by 2020. That will make us one of the largest financiers of climate change among the development banks in the world. So climate finance in the AfDB by 2020 will represent 40 percent of all of our portfolio as I want greener Africa and the Bank is ready to support that. The last thing I will say about COP 21 is that I am happy about the political will. President Buhari was there. He made a very big convincing point about the need to revive Lake Chad. So many African Heads of State were there too. With that political will, I believe COP 21 at the end of the day should be a success. But let me be clear that if the issue of climate financing for Africa is not sorted out then I will consider COP 21 not being a success. On how AfDB will assist members state to achieve the SDGs The AfDB is to help African countries to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. But for me, I like to simplify complex problems, there can be no development of any kind without electricity. It does not matter what you talk about. If there is no electricity you can't have industries, you can't create jobs, you can't do ICTs, you can't be competitive. Electricity is like blood in the body and without it the body can't function. It all comes down to how you make sure that the big enablers of development are dealt with. I believe that the Hi five we have chosen at the bank will help us in dealing with that. On challenges of leading the Bank It has been quite exciting for me as you know I am a reform minded person. I think the Bank is working with all of the Hi five. We are all working very hard. For me the only thing that ever matters in any thing I do is result. Nothing else matters and I have no doubt that with the support of the African governments, with the support of our partners, the shareholders and support of private sector, I have no doubt we can achieve those things we have set for the Hi five. I am an optimist when it comes to Africa. I believe that Africa's better days are ahead of it. And I think the AfDB has a crucial role to play in that, but we have to keep working and that one I can promise you I do all the time. \"

He made the appeal in Paris, France, on Tuesday, while addressing a high-level meeting on 'Climate Change Challenges and Solutions in Africa' on the sidelines of the on-going United Nations Conference of Parties Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ). The president said the shrinkage of Lake Chad had resulted in increased social conflicts, high rates of migration and cross border movements. ""Nigeria has a large population of over 170 million people and in some parts of Northern Nigeria, a farm that used to belong to 10 people now belongs to over 100 people. They have no other place to live and no land for cultivation,"" he said. President Buhari recalled that a research conducted by a professor in a London university and published more than three decades ago had predicted that unless one or some of the rivers from the Central African region are diverted to empty into the Lake Chad basin, the river will dry up. He noted that the prediction had become a reality as the lake which covers over 25,000 square kilometres in 1925 had shrunk to 2,500 square kilometres. He further said: ""The amount of resources required and the high technological expertise and infrastructure needed to be undertaken to revive the Lake Chad has to be mainly financed by the G7 and the United States. ""The cost is great and more than $14 billion is needed to revive the Lake. ""But if that is achieved, at least five million people from Central African Republic to the Lake Chad Basin countries (Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin) will be rehabilitated. ""When this is done, those who are daring to cross the Sahara and the Mediterranean to come to Europe will remain at home because they have land where they can cultivate and earn a respectable living,"" he said. \"

While commiserating with the French people on the recent terrorist attack in the country, the Nigerian Senate President urged French parliamentarians to push for more support for the Nigerian government towards resolving the Boko Haram crisis which he said poses grave danger to French strategic interests in West Africa. He noted that France could intervene by sharing vital intelligence with Nigerian Defence authorities and providing manpower as well as material support so that the insurgents will be overwhelmed and defeated in a short time. He also solicited for the help of France in assisting the over two million internally displaced people in North East Nigeria adding that the country's leaders are already thinking of how to properly resettle the people and rebuild the area after the end of the on-going military campaigns. ""If we do not start thinking about how to ensure that the people do not return to abject poverty and squalor which contributed to the festering of the hate campaigns by the Boko Haram members, then we will soon face another major crisis after ending the present one,"" Saraki's spokesman Yusuph Olaniyonu quoted the Senate President in a statement.

Speaking to journalists at the ongoing Climate Change Conference in Paris, Governor Ayade said that applying renewable energy as a solution mitigating the effect of climate change will mean that developing countries like Nigeria may have to stop the exploration of its hydro-carbon. Ayade noted that the exploration of hydro-carbon is key to the development of the economies of a good number of African countries. He said that there has been so much talk about measure against the challenges of climate changes but that the commitments to these agreements has been very weak. He was of the opinion that the major resources for African nations are the forests while for the Europeans, it is their technologies. He explained that while Europeans are struggling to sell technologies to Africans, they (Europeans) are telling African to stop deforestation so that carbon can be conserved. ""Renewable energy is not the way for Africans at this point in time, renewable energy means put an end to the sale of your hydro carbon, it means Nigeria should stop exporting crude oil, but they are busy doing research, inventing technology using solar energy and wind power. ""When all of that happens, when the oil price goes down, when you stop producing oil, what are you going to use as an alternative? ""The in balancing of the livelihood that is the alternative to that renewable energy must follow with development, must follow with technology, Africa cannot be in a haste to adopt renewable technology. ""I would rather have you use fossil fuel with mitigate measures than to cap it and focus on renewable energy. ""While that technology works for them, it is harmful for our economy and until we provide an alternative economy for now. We cannot cap it. He advised that African should shut its doors and reinvent themselves. According to Ayade, there has been a growing concern about the reality of climate change adding that adaptation is not the way to go. He explained adaptation is like accepting the situation and learning to live with it. Ayade who led the African Governors Forum to the event said that mitigation as against adaptation is the way to go. He said ""We are here for COP 21 but there is a side event which is very critical for me which is the Governors Forum for Climate Change and I am leading the African Forum for Governors Forum. ""My optimism has since been burnt to cold impotent ash because strong commitments are very weak and the applicability of all the discussions are not seen in the course of time, so essentially, there is this strong feeling that there is so much talk with little work. ""But far more importantly is the growing concern that climate change is real, as real as it is , African must continue to survive and feed. Our key resource is our forest, for the developed country, their key resource is their technology. So while they struggle to send technology into Africa, we are told to stop deforestation and maintain our forest stock so we can conserve carbon."" ""As Africans, we must shut our doors and reinvent ourselves, adaptation is not the way to go because it is adjusting yourself."" ""In all of these, there is very little Africa is doing in terms of technology, in terms of even mechanical cultivation of young plants that have capacity for the assimilation of carbon dioxide. ""We have also been very inefficient. But I ask you as we come here for COP 21 what is Africa's position, what have we brought to the negotiation table, we cannot continue to play the role of a victim, ""Africans own the largest tropical rainforest; we stand at the middle between the West and the East. It is that place that sinks all the carbon dioxide that comes even from the US, Canada, Asia, they all come into Africa. Africa must have a stronger say and have their own pre COP conference before they come to COP. Africa's negotiation must be single, firm, clear. Africa cannot come cap in hand always looking for alms. ""That is what I want to say that Africa must stop coming to the international community to seek funds, we must seek technology, seek equality and relevance, because indeed, it is one of the most blessed continent. ""Today, our black colour is no longer a colour but an attitude, the black man signifies the man who comes and say we don't have money, that has to end we don't have the earthquakes that characterize their environment, so why is Africa always on the international scene seeking fund?

Minister of Environment Amina Mohammed told newsmen during an interaction on the just ended COP 21 meeting in Paris, France that: ""Agreed, the issue of polyethylene is a huge one as it is a menace to the environment but it will be a mistake to ban its use now without putting in place a sustainable alternative plan."" Mohammed noted that the piles of polyethylene that gather at dump sites and other locations across the country had gone from bad to worse and acknowledged that the threat from it was serious but that government was working on the best way to address it. Daily Trust recalls that the former Minister of Environment, Hadiza Mailafia, had set January 1st 2014 as the deadline for the government to enforce a complete ban on the use of polyethylene in the country. The ban however was ineffective and could not be enforced as stakeholders ignored it saying government was unable to provide alternatives for them. A study conducted in Akure by A. O. Akinro et.al of Auchi Polytechnic and published in the Global Journal of Science Frontier Research Agriculture & Biology showed that polyethylene is generated more during the dry season months than the wet season. The result also showed that table water sachet topped the list of cellophane wastes generated. This is because it is cheap and consumed throughout the year with very little seasonal variation. Types of cellophane generation at home and markets also displayed a very interesting pattern. The study showed that in the market, polyethylene for assorted items was the least (51,000), followed by biscuits (50,863), ice cream sachets (81,526) and table water sachets (96,853). Cameroon banned nonbiodegradable plastic bags measuring less than 60 microns (two-thousandths of an inch) in thickness last year. It is one of over 20 African countries to outlaw plastic bags in some way, but the effort to get rid of the bags has been foiled by smugglers who sneak the bags into Cameroon, hidden in legal shipments or hauled across the border on footpaths from neighbouring countries, including Nigeria. \"

As pressure mounts on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government of 11 months to revitalise the ailing sector, rather than adopting abundant harmless renewable alternative energy sources, plan is fully set to augment the dwindling power by investing heavily in coal-fired power plants. A move that betrays the 2015 Paris universal legally binding climate agreements that involved Nigeria's active participation. 'The Ministry of Solid Minerals Development is collaborating the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to ensure that huge coal deposit in the country is explored to meet some of its energy needs,' Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Minister of Solid Minerals Development, was quoted as saying. At the Economic Summit held recently in Lagos, he further said, 'I know there are people who are worried about climate change and the implication of coal on that. But even coal can achieve clean coal environmental standard and we believe that about 1000 megawatts of electricity can be generated from coal by the year 2020.' This is regarded as a deliberate pranks and an attempt to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that coal is environment friendly. At a crucial time when other committed countries are halting new coal projects, and busy closing down existing coal plants while strategising and threading feasible sustainable renewables paths, Nigeria is totally pursuing a contrary devastating archaic project. It should be noted that, as a result of alarming air pollution in China and India, over 1.6 million deaths are recorded annually. In addressing China's air pollution, Chris Wright (Climate Tracker activist) stated: '(China has decided) to close up to 2,000 coal-fired power plants. It also plans to shut down 1,000 coal mines this year.' Despite these facts, if the coal-fired plant is constructed due to government's recalcitrance, past influences on aforementioned countries speak volume of its likely adverse consequences on vast majority of Nigerians, future generations and our dear planet. Nigeria's estimated average life expectancy which currently stands at 53 years could further be reduced. Conscious citizens should be aware of this proposed dangerous adventure that could rob them of quality lives. Rather, the Federal Government should consider massively diverting funds to be channelled in fossil fuels projects into the renewables; hydro, wind, solar and biomass are wide eco-friendly alternatives. Many hydro power projects are abandoned while immense renewables remain unexploited. Ikere George hydro dam situated at Iseyin was built 33 years ago and is a glaring example out of many alternatives. It has the capacity to generate 3750 MW (3/4 of Nigeria's current total output). Unfortunately, it was never completed and is now a shadow of itself. Several abandoned hydro-power projects are languishing and littering every nook and cranny of the nation, while Africa's most populous country of estimated 170 million inhabitants grapples with dilemma of satisfying its ever increasing power demands. One then begins to wonder why Nigeria's power output currently remains at the lowest ebb in 21st century. Positive influence of humongous funds allegedly spent on power over the years by past administrations failed to have meaningful impacts. The failure can unarguably be attributed to financial recklessness and mismanagement of resources by the past anchors. If Nigeria sincerely desires change in the power sector, there is a compelling need for the current administration to radically defy all odds in challenging and addressing the status quo. This is an unconditional choice that may warrant stepping on cartels and corrupt powerful toes. It is high time the Ministry of Environment headed by Mrs. Amina Mohammed synergised with the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and Solid Minerals Development. This to be geared towards working out modalities for initiating projects having harmless long term effects on Nigerian populace while running it in consonance with UN climate agreements.

She lamented that the impacts of the phenomenon were daily threatening the livelihoods of everyday Nigerians, with 70 per cent of Nigeria's population relying on climate-sensitive activities for their income such as rain-fed farming and fisheries. ""Nigeria is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world,"" she said, ""By 2050, it could cost between 6 per cent and 30 per cent of its GDP ($100 billion to $460 billion.)"" These were among the key messages made available by the minister during a news briefing in Abuja, the first since the COP21 held in France last month. She however reaffirmed that this administration was committed to an economic transformation which places inclusive, green growth at the centre, adding that the new leadership is ""extremely well-placed to deliver on this agenda."" Citing the Lake Chad in the North-east, the zone where Boko Haram is located, as an example, Mohammed noted that climate change aggravates regional conflicts. She noted that the body of water known as Lake Chad had shrunk to 10 per cent of its original size as a result of climate change, bringing with it the associated collapse of economic and institutional fabric, making the region a breeding ground for terrorism. ""Boko Haram is now recognised as the most deadly terrorist group in the world,"" she said. ""... Of an estimated 20 million people that lived on the Lake Chad basin circa 2003, about 11.7 million were in the North-eastern region of Nigeria."" She said while seeking to maintain strong growth, the federal government had recognised that its current economic composition was unsustainable. ""The recent fall in oil prices has heightened the vulnerability of its economy to fossil fuel exports,"" Mohammed stated. ""Diversification, especially towards sustainable agriculture, is already a key part of the country's economic strategy."" On the continued pursuit of the use of coal, a highly damaging fuel, for power, she said while the country was committed to renewable energy rather than fossil fuel, she could not sacrifice its economic interest and the well-being of its citizens on the altar of going green. Also, Mohammed said Nigeria can generate 7.5 billion dollars in 15 years if the government can end gas flaring and utilize gas for commercial purposes. The minister made the statement yesterday in Abuja while briefing newsmen on the outcome of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The agreement provides a framework for keeping average global temperature below two degrees Celsius. Mohammed said that the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted by Nigeria as its contribution to the agreement was aimed at reducing emission by 20 per cent by 2030. Reduction of emission, the minister noted, could act as catalyst to achieve economic diversification and assist economic restructuring in a way that would facilitate inclusive growth with vast opportunities. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), she listed some of the opportunities to include substantial increase in the use of climate smart agriculture through irrigation systems, climate resilient crops and broader Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices. ""Given the climate risks that Nigeria faces, this is the only way in which the government ambitious Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) can be delivered,"" she said. Mohammed listed other opportunities to include diversifying the energy mix with emphasis on renewable energy and efficient gas power. ""In particular, we plan to generate around 13GW of off-grid solar power, delivering energy access to the poorest communities in a cheaper, healthier manner with less emission,"" she said. The minister also stated that reducing emission would create greener, more resilient and pleasant cities to live in. ""Nigerian cities are now adopting global best practices with low-carbon transport solutions. ""For example, bus rapid transit system is already in operation in Lagos. ""More can be done and will be done to promote urban transit solution that will reduce emissions and unblocks congestion and provide huge stimulant to productivity,"" she said. To deliver the agenda for change, Mohammed stressed the need for the nation's climate plans to ""align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."" ""This is necessary to enable the plan have ambitious, robust and effective approach that will tackle inequality and address the challenges of climate change.""

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria94","Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala Just Said Africa Can Lead On Climate Change. Here's how.","December 10, 2015 Thursday","Ventures Africa","As the \~ COP 21 Ventures Africa spoke to Nigeria's former Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala who since leaving office has become prominent global\~voice advocating economic solutions for dealing with the impacts of climate Change. Ventures Africa (VA): Dr. Okonjo-Iweala, analysts posit that it is quite difficult to ascertain the long-term economic costs of climate change. Do you agree? If so, is it possible for you to give us a short-term projection? Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (NOI): There have been many studies, including by Lord Nick Stern, that have shown that climate change is real and costly, and that if we do not manage to keep the world, not even at 2 degrees, but at 1.5 \- because this was the chant in Paris, ""1.5 to stay alive"" \- \~some of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Pacific rim would sink. So, the issue the costs have become very prominent, in terms of pollution, which causes a lot of diseases and ill health. Even today in Beijing, the pollution is so high that they have given the highest level of alert. A large number of deaths are caused by pollution and other forms of diseases caused by climate change, loss of productivity of crops and lands, flooding, storms it's catastrophic, and many estimates have been given. Therefore, giving an estimation is a very scientific affair, not something someone gets up and projects. Many years have been spent trying to study this phenomenon and trying to estimate the damage, and if you look at the work done by the new climate economy, you can get various estimates. I've just given you one, about how degraded land leads to more damage to the climate, and it's going to cost $250 billion a year to restore. That's one kind of estimate that you can get. It's a very costly phenomenon. But I think that the essential thing is there are solutions which are being discussed in Paris. First, you have $650 billion a year being spent in fuel subsidies, and fossil fuels contribute to carbon dioxide emission, very heavily. If you were to stop subsidising, it would then help to reduce the amount of carbon emission, and you could even take the $650 billion and invest it in alternative sources of energy, such as renewables, which are friendlier to the climate, and dramatically reduce carbon emission. In fact, the IMF has estimated that if you take the additional indirect costs of subsidies, that figure of $650 per year becomes $5.4 trillion. So, can you imagine such huge an amount of money that is lost due to this fossil fuels subsidy. I think that this is one area where the world can really make a big difference; phase it out; direct the resources to other alternatives that would actually help to manage climate change, and make the world a safer place to live. VA: You recently made the opening remarks at the Global Landscapes Forum in Paris at the COP21 in which you\~emphasized\~the need for public funding and investments in landscape restoration and conservation. Urbanisation has been named a major source of land degradation, but economists agree that there is a positive connection between urbanisation\~and economic growth, especially for developing countries. What is your take on the topic? Does this conflict with\~the agreement that you wish to come to on funding? NOI:\~Urbanisation is not necessarily a form of land degradation. I don't agree with that. I think that if you have a properly planned urbanisation, you can do it without degrading land. The issue is that, very often people migrate to urban land without adequate services, without adequate housing. And then they sometimes convert areas that should not really be used for building housing, into housing and other uses. That is when you begin to get problems with flood, like for example when they settle on the slopes of hills, or on sewer lines, and other areas where they should not. To avoid that form of land degradation, you have to plan ahead. But urbanisation does not have to necessarily result in land degradation, if there's good planning. However, we know that there is a large amount of land degradation going on now, and the New Climate Economy, the Global Commission on Climate and Economy, has estimated that it would cost around $250 billion per year to restore degraded land, and we know we're only spending one tenth of that ($25 billion). Restoration of these degraded land can also contribute to helping with the issue of climate change, while at the same time trying to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. As you restore, you can also take action that would enable storage and mitigation of emission. The same thing with forestation. If you can reforest, you can help with carbon capture with these forests. With regards to the funding, it would take a combination of what we call a structured partnership - not just public sector funds, but you have the public sector coming in to give the governance and the policy cover that is needed to do this, while at the same time putting in some of its money. Also the donor community comes in to put in money and take some risks, so that the private sector can come in and invest because some of these restorations can also be beneficial in a private sector sense. Then, you can have civil society joining in to make sure that this is done in an accountable way. VA: \~Developing agriculture is one of the biggest concerns of the Nigerian Federal Government, and the governments of other African countries. Are there any peculiar immediate impacts that farmers and agriculturists in general likely suffer, in the event of an intolerable level of climate change? NOI: Climate change is already evident, and you can see it in abnormal cycle of floods and droughts. \~Farmers suffer a lot of damage to their crops and livestock. Remember that even Nigeria had abnormal floods two years ago, which caused a displacement of up to two million families at the time, as well as tremendous damage of billions of dollars in terms of crops and livestock. You can measure these damages that are already occurring. Climate change is already here. There are people in the Pacific Islands, such as in Tuvalu and Vanuatu whose islands are going to sink beneath the ocean, completely disappearing due to the impact of climate change, if we go beyond the 2 degrees Celsius that the world is aiming at, and they are even asking the world to look at 1.5 degrees Celsius. We don't have to wait to see the impact of climate change to agriculture and livelihood. Now, there are several solutions that have been coming forward, and one of the best ones was by African countries themselves, in the form of the African Risk Capacity (ARC). So, rather than waiting for other countries to come when there is a flood or a drought, African countries started this organisation to insure countries against damage that comes from weather based events and climate change. There is a model that has been developed where the countries have an insurance premium, and when there is an event, if the model triggers in that country, then money is paid out -that is if the event is caused by an abnormal phenomenon such as climate change or extreme weather. For instance, last year, Mauritania, Senegal, and Niger received pay outs of $26 million from the ARC when they had severe droughts. We need to start thinking of solutions like this. The G7 has said that this is a good approach, and have agreed to scale up the work of the ARC, as well as that of the Pacific and Caribbean Risk Insurance agencies by $100 million. I think that this is a very important development. We are focusing a lot on the problems, but we need to start focusing on solutions. We've talked about other solutions the world can take, such as mitigation measures, and every country has put forward their intended national development commitments. What are they going to do in order to make sure that the world stays at a 2 degrees Celsius? What are they voluntarily committing to? These must be considered for development without damaging the climate. I want to say one thing on the solution front, and that is that Africa provides the greatest opportunities for the solutions. Therefore, beyond looking at Africa as a victim of climate change, also seeing as it suffering from damage caused by others, we need to look at the solutions the continent can proffer, and they are tremendous. Especially if the world really wants to be serious about managing climate change, and mitigating the impact, and adapting to it. Africa presents a clear opportunity where you can build infrastructure, such as power (renewables), and also roads and rails, in a manner that is more environmentally and climate friendly. VA: According to a World Bank report from 2013, even a 1.5 Degrees Celsius warming would put Sub-Saharan Africa at risk of massive food insecurity. Can you explain to us why a lower target could not have been put forward? NOI:\~Because the world is already on a course [towards greater than 2 degrees] due to the way we have used the planet with our activities, we aimed for 1.5 [degrees] to minimise the damage and suffering, mainly in the areas that I have previously mentioned. If the world has the will, they can even try to stick at 2 degrees, not above, and even better, aim at 1.5 [degrees]. I don't know that anybody is talking about going lower at the moment. VA: How far would investments made in climate change solutions go in saving Africa? And what are the general plans for such investments?\~ NOI: Each country has committed to a certain level of action that it would take to mitigate climate change, but what African countries are saying is, since the impact of climate change is caused primarily by the developed countries, they are asking that of the $100 billion per year that has been pledged, a significant amount should go to them [Africa] to help to mitigate the damage. The developed world should stick to its promise and deliver. I believe that, from what we have heard in Paris, the $100 billion commitment by 2020 is becoming real. But I think that African countries need to find other solutions that would draw in and trigger private sector investments - because I'm not sure that the $100 billion per year would be adequate. That is why we advocate solutions like the ARC to help source additional funding. What can we do ourselves? We shouldn't wait for the $100 billion, even though it is a promise that must be delivered. We definitely should push for it, but we need to find alternative solutions to make sure that keep climate change in check. VA: Thank you, Dr. Okonjo-Iweala. NOI: Thank you very much. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria95","Climate Change Threat to Food Security in Nigeria - Buhari","December 01, 2015","Leadership (Abuja)","President Muhammadu Buhari has warned that climate change poses a threat to food security in Nigeria as extreme events such as flooding and drought are on the increase. Stating Nigeria's position yesterday at the Conference of Parties 21 ( COP21 ) ongoing in Paris, France, he disclosed that such factors have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures. According to him, the insurgency in the north east and climate change which he observed has resulted in the drying up of the Lake Chad, are depriving many communities of their means of livelihood. President Buhari told world leaders gathered at the event that they had a historic chance to save the planet by coming up with binding resolutions for sustainable development. He also noted that the conference must work to make Paris a global landmark in the history of climate change negotiations. Buhari advised that nations must scale up their commitment to ensure a successful outcome and contribute to transforming the world through sustainable development. ""Like many countries, Nigeria continues to witness the adverse effects of climate change in all its ramifications. Presently, we are reeling under the challenges of climate change as the frequency and intensity of extreme events like floods and drought are on the increase,"" he said. Explaining further he said these challenges have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures and threatening Nigeria's food production and security. ""The magnitude of insurgency Nigeria is facing cannot be completely explained away without taking cognizance of the threat of climate change."" He decried that climate change is threatening not only the sustainable development of ""our social and economic activities but also the totality of human existence in our country as in other parts of the world."" ""In all, the experience of countries sharing the Lake Chad further illustrates the mutual challenge we face today and which must be collectively addressed without further delay."" He noted the inadequacies of existing climate change treaties, protocols and conventions, reiterating Nigeria's position that for the potential of Paris Agreement on Climate Change to be meaningful, achieve its objectives and eventually become universal in nature and scope, it must draw extensively on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. ""Indeed, for the agreement to be durable, it must recognise not only the emission right but also the survival rights of the citizens of developing countries,"" he said, adding, ""The inadequacies of the existing climate change treaties, the conventions and its protocol, constitute the driving force propelling parties to reach another climate change agreement as the main outcome of this Conference of Parties. ""Nigeria appreciates the efforts and demonstration of flexibilities of all in the run up of discussions since Durban, towards evolving the new global climate regime. Yet, we are very concerned at the pace of progress made so far. ""This is more important, since the negotiation continues to go back and forth without necessarily addressing the interests and concerns of the developing countries in general and African countries in particular. ""It is our fervent hope that these implementation modalities will be explicitly enshrined in the agreement."" President Buhari puts Nigeria's target on cutting greenhouse emissions arrived at after extensive consultations with stakeholders at 45 per cent by the year 2030. He said: ""On our part in Nigeria, we undertook an extensive and participatory process of multi-level consultations with a cross section of stakeholders within the different tiers of government towards determining our national contributions to global mitigation reduction. ""Based on national considerations, Nigeria intends to attain the mitigation reduction objective of 20 per cent unconditional and 45 per cent conditional below the Business as Usual level of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. ""It is our expectation that this nationally-determined ambitious target given our national circumstances and developmental requirements will eventually pass the green test."" Buhari reiterated that the Paris Agreement must be legally binding, all-encompassing and sustainable for it to be universally applicable, result-oriented, and in all effective. ""The Agreement we reach here must also be a fair, multilateral and rules-based regime guided by science with an overall aim of ensuring the right to equitable access of every country of the world to sustainable development,"" he declared. \"

Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, said the stolen money did not belong to him. He also said he did not know the owner of the money who is said to be a Bureau De Change operator. ""The Senate President was in Paris attending the Globe COP 21 Conference for Legislators on the Climate Change when we read an online medium's version of the report on a statement issued by the spokesperson of the SSS. ""The initial reaction of the Senate President when his attention was drawn to the story in Paris was that the owners and the sponsors of the online medium simply wanted to draw him into a needless controversy and therefore should be ignored. However, on his return to Abuja on Monday night when many of his friends and well wishers expressed concern over his silence on the report, it became necessary for him to make clarification on it. ""We want to say categorically that Saraki is not the owner of the stolen money. He does not know the owner who is said to be a Bureau de change operator. The police that investigated the robbery incident and the DSS, which issued a statement on it can confirm that there is no link between the Senate President and the ownership of the money. ""Unfortunately, two of the suspects in the case are said to be part of the men attached to the security team of the Senate President. As anybody could confirm, the DSS selects its officers who are attached to top officials. In most cases, the principal does not select who work in his security team. ""In fact, the first time the senate president heard about the incident was when the Commissioner of Police, Abuja, requested the Aide-in-Camp to get his permission for the SSS agents to report to his office in connection with an on-going investigation on a robbery incident. ""To further put a lie to the claims by the medium, Saraki hereby requests that the security agencies involved in the investigation should make further public clarification on the case so as to enlighten members of the public. ""The senate president, just like any interested Nigerian, followed the police investigation as it progresses, believing that justice will be done at the end of the day.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria97","Climate Change - Don Urges FG to Announce Its National Action Plan","October 19, 2015","Leadership (Abuja)","Prof. Daniel Gwary, a climate change negotiator, has called on the Federal Government to announce its national action plan to curb climate popularly known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Gwary made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. According to him, Nigeria should announce its preparedness to reduced emissions a head of the Paris Climate Change Conference in December. ""As Nigeria prepares for Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ) on Climate Change in Paris; it should announce its preparedness to reduce emissions in line with other countries. ""Nigeria as the most populous country in Africa, I think Mr President wants Nigeria to be at the forefront not in the crowd. ""So, we must come up with an action plan and we must protect our economy,"" he said. NAN reports that total of 146 countries, representing almost 87 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have submitted their intended national climate action plans to the UN. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said the response by countries in submitting their climate action plans to the Paris agreement over the past few months had been unprecedented. According to UNFCC, this means that so far over 75 per cent of all member countries UNFCCC have responded. It noted that the submission included all developed countries under the Convention and 104 developing countries, or almost 70 per cent of UNFCCC developing member states. Gwary, a Professor of Crop Protection, University of Maiduguri, said that agriculture is a very important aspect of the country's economy that has to do with emission of carbon. According to him, agriculture has to do with emissions in the areas of soil management and livestock production. ""If Nigeria is thinking about making commitment to reduce emissions, then the country has to look inwards into the agriculture sector. ""We can cut down our emissions in that sector by improving on agricultural practices in livestock and crop production. ""Apart from the agriculture sector, we need to also cut down our emissions in power, transport, petroleum, solid minerals and manufacturing sectors,"" he said. Gwary, however, supported the views of some international consultants that suggested 50 per cent reduction of the emissions for Nigeria by 2030. According to him, the 50 per cent is an ambitious target but attainable. ""It is attainable if key players and Nigerians support the present administration to make things to work, to improve agriculture, power and transport sectors and also support good governance. ""For example, it is the political will that government needs to cut down gas flaring. ""I am hopeful that the country can achieve the target but anything more that will be too ambitious,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, Mrs Fatima Mede, also said recently at ECOWAS Regional Climate Change Finance Workshop in Abuja that the INDCs would be submitted by October, ahead the Paris conference. Mede, who said that the document was ready and was only awaiting the blessing at the highest level, also said Nigeria was being meticulous in preparing its commitments. (NAN) \"

Jega, a professor of Political Science, exuded much professionalism in the election that got the All Progressives Congress, APC, then opposition party in Nigeria, winning the centre as well as many states of the federation. The party also currently has the majority in the National Assembly thus relegating the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, which had ruled since 1999, to the background. Chatham House, also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs and founded in 1920 to engage governments, the private sector, civil society and its members in open debate and confidential discussion on the most significant developments in international affairs, said Attahiru Muhammadu Jega is nominated for his professionalism, determination and integrity as chairman of Nigeria's electoral commission, which, in 2015, ensured the conduct of Nigeria's most credible election since the country's return to civilian rule in 1999. Other nominees include Laurent Fabius and Christiana Figueres for their pivotal role in delivering a global climate agreement at the COP 21 meeting in Paris in December 2015 and John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif both nominated for their crucial roles, throughout 2015, in successfully negotiating the historic nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1. Jega, it would be recalled braced the heat of the 2015 tension-soaked election and shrugged off a lot of pressures from desperate politicians whose parties were in the race for the presidential and governorship elections. On several occasions leading to the election, he was accused by top officials of the PDP of being partial, but never bulged. He refused to seek a second term in office in spite of pleas by Nigerians. Since he retirement from INEC, the professor from Kebbi State has received many international awards including being the winner of the 2015 edition of the Charles T. Mannat Democracy award organised by the US-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems, IFES. He was honoured alongside US Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Ed Royce. He (Jega) deserves full credit for his efforts to increase the credibility and transparency of the electoral process under extreme logistical challenges, such as terrorist threats from Boko Haram, where failure could prove the catalyst for predicted election violence, IFES had said of the reason for the honour. Also in October 2015, Jega was honoured with two international awards, the 2015 Charles Manatt Democracy Award by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, in Washington and an integrity award by US-based Nigerian Higher Education Foundation at Waldorf Astoria, New York for his role in the 2015 general election. While receiving the award, Jega said he was humbled and will also like to recognise my colleagues at INEC for their dedication to a credible and transparent electoral process. Over the last five years, we've come a long way in the conduct of elections in Nigeria, and I think the outcome of the 2015 elections speak directly to this work. All my colleagues at INEC share the credit for this success. The mood in my country presently is extremely upbeat, following the first democratic transfer of power in our history. \"

Oscarline Onwuemenyi 25 December 2015, Sweetcrude, Abuja \- The Federal Government has revealed that ending gas flaring would yield over $7.5 billion benefits to the national economy. The Minister of Environment, Mrs. Amina Mohammed, disclosed this in a document detailing some of the highlights and agreements reached at the recently concluded Conference of Parties on Climate Change, otherwise known as COP 21 , which was held in Paris, France. In the document, which was obtained by our correspondent in Abuja, the minister also stated that the Federal Government plans to develop about 13,000 megawatts of off-grid electricity from solar energy. The Minister said government had resolved to reduce gas flaring, adding that Nigeria could generate as much as $7.5bn worth of benefits if it could put an end to the flaring of gas. According to her, ""By ending gas flaring and using the gas for commercial purposes, including power generation, we could generate as much as $7.5bn worth of benefits."" She stated that government was also working to diversify the country's energy mix, stressing that particular emphasis was on renewable energy and efficient gas power. Mohammed stated that it had been established that Nigeria was willing and eager to take a regional lead by announcing a bold and courageous Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) that seek to ensure that the Nigerian economy continued to grow while reducing its carbon emissions. She said, ""Nigeria's ambitious INDCs aim at reducing emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2030 with support from the international community. This will support the restructuring of the economy in a way that will facilitate inclusive growth with vast opportunities to diversify the energy mix, with emphasis on renewable energy and efficient gas power. ""In particular, we plan to develop around 13GW of off-grid solar power, delivering energy access to the poorest communities in a cheaper and healthier manner with less emission. We also plan to create a more efficient, lower carbon oil and gas sector."" She noted that the government would substantially increase the use of climate smart agriculture through irrigation systems, climate resilient crops and broader sustainable land management practices.

Mohammed said these opportunities would not only reduce emissions and improve climate resilience, but that the approach would unlock economic opportunities. According to her, the World Bank has projected that a combination of low carbon activities could provide a boost to the Nigerian economy and add as much as two per cent to the country's Gross Domestic Product.

The minister, yesterday, said the Federal Government was working on the possibility of diversifying the country's energy mix and laid emphases on renewable energy and efficient gas power in meeting the energy needs of Nigerians. Mrs. Mohammed, according to a document she issued to the media, containing some of the highlights and agreements reached at the recently concluded Conference of Parties on Climate Change, otherwise known as COP 21 , which was held in Paris, France, said that ""in particular, we plan to develop around 13GW of off-grid solar power, delivering energy access to the poorest communities in a cheaper and healthier manner with less emission."" The minister also noted that the government would increase the use of climate-smart agriculture through irrigation systems, climate-resilient crops and broader sustainable land management practices, ""given the climate risks that Nigeria faces, this is the only way in which the government's ambitious Agriculture Transformation Agenda can be delivered,"" she added. She disclosed Nigeria's eagerness to take a regional lead by announcing a bold and courageous Intended Nationally Determined Contributions that seek to ensure that the Nigerian economy continues to grow while reducing its carbon emissions. ""Nigeria's ambitious INDCs aim at reducing emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2030 with support from the international community.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria103","Nigeria must break free from fossil fuels","April 11, 2016 Monday","Business Day","On May 29, 2015, Nigeria's new president Muhammadu Buhari in his inaugural speech promised to join the international community to combat climate change and other challenges head-on. Environment enthusiasts were happy when Nigeria's new minister submitted the country's INDC to UNFCC. At the COP21 conference in Paris, Nigeria made an unconditional offer to end greenhouse gas emission by 20% and provide access to electricity by the year 2030. Nigeria joined majority of the 161 countries in support of the 1.5 degree ceiling of carbon exposure against the 2.0 degree promoted by most developed nations. The signing of the Paris Agreement purportedly marked the beginning of the end of environmental rascality and the commencement of a new sustainable environmental pathway. Few months after the euphoria and emergence of the new government, it was shocking to hear from the Minister of Power that Nigeria will revert to the use of coal as source of fuel to improve its electricity generation. Similar announcement by the Emir of Kano and Aliko Dangote to build coal powered plants has clearly shown that Nigeria is towing a dangerous and decelerating course in an era propelled by clean and sustainable energy. Will the additional coal and petrochemical powered plants reduce the amount of carbon exposure as agreed in Paris? Is there no other better alternative to power than outdated fossil powered plants? What is the cost implication of choosing dirty energy against renewable alternatives on the long run? Coal fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made carbon emissions. A third of all carbon dioxide emissions come from burning coal. This makes coal energy the single greatest threat facing climate change, from mining to combustion. Apart from climate change coal also causes irreparable damage to the environment, people's health and communities. According to experts, if more coals are used around the world, carbon emission from coal will rise 60% by 2030 thus undermining the international agreements to tackle climate change. In 2014, Nigeria's renewable energy improved following private input and government initiatives. That same year a study by Pew Research survey indicated that 65 percent of Nigerians were very concerned about threats of climate change despite economic stability. Nigeria produces over 2.5 million barrels of oil daily. Yet it cannot generate enough electricity for its people. It boasts of the highest concentration of small-scale generators in the world. Petrochemical has contributed enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere especially in the South East region where gas flaring has continued unabated. The numerous oil spills in the Niger Delta has rendered farmlands useless and the waters toxic further impoverishing rural dwellers who are mostly fishermen. Crude oil has done enough damage to our environment and economy. The abandoned coal mining sites left several years ago were not properly managed and they constitute serious health hazards to the surrounding communities. Diversification can play a critical role in reducing vulnerability not only to supply disruption and oil price hikes but also to climate change. Many factors may be taken into account, such as costs, pollutants, energy demand, land use system and distribution. The Buhari government can determine what constitute its mix of energy sources in order to quick-fix the power problem but should not ignore the impact of such technologies to the environment and health of the citizenry. Yes, Nigeria holds large coal reserves estimated to be over 2billion metric tons. It is also true that Nigeria is located in the equatorial zone and can receive over 85% of sunlight proportionately across the states. Our landmass of over 900,000 sq.km still has more unused areas where enormous solar panels can be deployed to tap the sun energy for power generation. Nigeria has the capacity to achieve 100% renewable energy (solar, water and wind) before 2040, if a master-plan is judiciously pursued. Morroco, Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa and Algeria are already leading the race to sustainable energy in Africa. South Africa has established itself among the top 10 countries in the world harnessing renewable sun energy with over 15 solar plants providing electricity to 80,000 houses. Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina, Bauchi can collectively harness solar power for all the northern states while Lagos, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Cross River can harness onshore wind power. The area being encroached by the Sahara desert can be used for utility-scale solar farms which can also act as artificial soil covers thereby protecting the area from further drought. Germany has been able to produce 78% of its total electricity needs from renewable energy. The German Energy Transformation is a master plan to significantly shift from fossil fuels. Germany consumes more power than Nigeria. All the relevant factors are favourable to Nigeria and each geographic zone can harness those renewables (biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, hyro) more prevalent in the area as clearly stated in our national Renewable Energy Programme. Renewable energy will not only provide clean and sustainable energy it will provide job opportunities for youths. We can move from zero megawatt to 100% renewable energy. Let us break free from fossil fuels. The Minister of Power and the current government should as a matter of urgent importance terminate the idea of using coal to power our electricity and pursue a more environmental friendly alternative which are readily abundant. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria104","Govt to Submit National Plan On Climate Change to UN","July 02, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","The Federal Government said on Thursday that its Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) would be submitted in September. Dr Samuel Adejuwon, the Director, Climate Change Department, Federal Ministry of Environment, made this known in an interview with newsmen in Abuja. Adejuwon said that Nigeria was taking its time to develop solid INDCs that would help address the impact of climate change without jeopardising its quest for development. He said that the ministry would look at the country's economic and development interests while developing the INDCs. ""The whole exercise (INDCs) will consider some priority sectors, look at the baseline and look at our needs too for development and see what we can put on the table that we are going to strive to mitigate in terms of Green House Gases. ""And it is not something you just rush into without understanding because you are never too sure whether the potential agreement in Paris will be legally binding."" Adejuwon said that Oct. 1 had been fixed as the deadline for countries to submit their INDCs to enable UNFCCC to study the documents before the Conference of Parties ( COP ) 21 in Paris in December. According to him, the requirement for countries to submit their commitments ahead of the conference is to see if they will be able to address the impact of climate change. The director, however, said that the ministry had held series of workshops to fulfill its commitment to climate change conventions and protocols as well as exploit opportunities as a party to the protocols. He said that the country had also looked at ways of taking advantage of some funding opportunities available such as the Special Climate Change, Adaptation and Green Climate Funds. ""When you see funds, to access it can be problematic. And that is part of the negotiation and that is part of what we use to do in negotiations that you (developed countries) are creating these funds then you put a condition that makes it very much difficult to access. ""Look at the Adaptation Fund, it was part of Kyoto Mechanism; before you can access it, you need to identify National Implementation Entity. ""We've been in this process of identification of National Implementation Entity for the past three, four years. ""By the time you solve this problem, they will come up with another issue and if you don't fulfill that condition, then it becomes very difficult for you to access."" Adejuwon, however, explained that there was the need for the Federal Government to put some structures on ground before these funds could be accessed. He, therefore, stressed the need for government to invest in research, designs and mappings as a means of reducing the impacts of climate change on the country. ""There is the need for government to look at climate change from another perspective and be proactive. ""For example, looking at the 2012 flooding, we should map our flood plains in Nigeria and see how vulnerable they are to the impact of climate change. ""After identifying the vulnerability, we also need to put other things in place to minimise the impacts of the climate change,"" he said. INDCs are a requirement to be submitted by all parties to the UNFCCC as a major component to climate change treaty to be adopted in Paris later in 2015. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria105","What you need to know about distributed renewable energy markets in Africa","December 11, 2015 Friday","Ventures Africa","For African countries, accessing sources of renewable energy is still a challenge, even as the rest of the world is gradually turning towards them. Renewable energy is mostly\~distributed through mini-grids and isolated systems. Recently, the mini-grid distribution sector has grown considerably, particularly in developing countries in Africa where centralised grid systems are unable to reach people in remote\~locations. Although urban migration\~is common in Africa, about 59 percent of the continent's population is still rural. Mini-grids are expected to contribute 45 percent of the additional generation capacity for universal access to energy by 2030. Based on this, they are expected to play a major role in enabling countries to meet the objectives set by the United Nations Secretary General's Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative. Investment in distributed renewable energy in Africa is witnessing significant support from governments, public and private investors, even though there is a level of skepticism about its\~new and evolving nature. Ventures Africa (VA): How accessible is distributed renewable energy technologies market is and what is the current attitude towards the market in Africa, both on the public and private fronts? Dr. Rose Mutiso (RM):\~Renewable technologies such as solar are mature and costs have dropped significantly. This is not just an environmental consideration, the economic drivers for renewables are also strong as more than two-thirds of Africans lack access to electricity. Renewables will play a major role in closing this energy access gap. In particular, distributed renewable technologies such as off-grid solar and mini-grids will be crucial for reaching the millions of Africans who live in rural areas where conventional grid-extension may not be cost-effective or timely. The markets for these off-grid technologies are growing, but there is still more to be done in order to give them stronger legitimacy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that over 60 percent of energy investments need to go towards these solutions, if universal energy access goals are to be met, so we have to embrace them. African governments and global development partners are starting to recognise the role of renewable technologies and distributed solutions, which is a welcome change. Through the efforts of programs such as\~International Finance Corporation's Lighting Africa\~program, markets for off-grid solar lighting and charging products are growing rapidly. More needs to be done enable these technologies to reach more people and also allow\~them move up the energy ladder beyond providing electricity. I co-lead the Clean Energy Ministerial Global Lighting and Energy Access Partnership (Global LEAP)\~initiative, which works with partners across the world to catalyse commercial markets for affordable, high-quality and high-performing clean energy products and services in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. We just announced a new effort in collaboration with UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4All) at COP21 known as the\~Efficiency for Access (E4A) Coalition, which aims to harness energy-efficient technologies to enable delivery of energy services to off-grid populations faster and at the lowest\~cost. Meeting the ambitious SDG7 (Sustainable Development Goal 7) \~targeting universal energy access by 2030, will need a major paradigm shift away from business-as-usual approaches and explore more innovative technologies and service delivery models.\~Distributed renewable technologies are at the heart of this strategy. VA: Besides funding, what other technical or operational challenges exist with distributed renewable energy on the continent? RM:\~Technologies are largely mature, but more needs to done to bring down costs of some key components such as batteries and end-use technologies. A sound regulatory and policy environment is also needed. Off-grid energy companies face many challenges in attracting private investment due to the high risks, both real and perceived, so the public sector actors need to step in to help de-risk these investments. Companies are still experimenting with different business models and some sectors, such as mini-grids, are yet to see some really successful examples, so we need more resources to enable experimentation and risk-taking in this sector. Do you think that Africa is capable of building infrastructure to support distributed and/or renewable energy generation, as well as their necessary technologies? Yes, as long as we have a stronger political 'buy-in', prioritisation of distributed renewables as an important part of the energy mix, enabling policies and regulatory frameworks and mobilization of substantial public and private sector finance. Developed countries need to play a stronger role in support of Africa as it undertakes this task of working towards universal electrification in a way that side-steps the many pitfalls of the mainstream approaches to electrification such as environmental degradation. This is a great opportunity for the whole world to learn from Africa's experience in a massive roll-out of renewable and distributed technologies and there is also a huge opportunity for Africa here by bypassing some of the challenges of dealing with legacy infrastructure that other countries face. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria106","Nigeria's obsession with fossil fuel","April 15, 2016 Friday","The Sun (Nigeria)","By Emeka Ulor The year 2015 was the hottest year ever in the history of the earth's climatologically By Emeka Ulor The year 2015 was the hottest year ever in the history of the earth's climatologically chronology. This increased temperature can be attributed to global warming resulting from the selfish activities of man especially carbon emitters. As nations scramble to attain global supremacy, nature tends to suffer inadvertently. The consequences of prolonged carbon exposure into our atmosphere have gradually begun to manifest across the globe. From tsunamis to hurricanes, from droughts to erosion, from new disease to abrupt death; the negative impact of climate anomalies could become worst than the present predicament if left unchecked. Air is the most vital need of any living organism, without it, there will be no life. Any distortion in its natural composite harms organisms that inhale it including human beings. Air is basically made up different gases such as oxygen (21%), nitrogen (78%), argon (1%), carbon dioxide and other molecules. Most air pollution results from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, gasoline, wood and vehicle fumes. When fossil fuels are burned they pollute the fresh air which may cause various health predicaments. Burning fossil fuel creates smog which makes the air cloudy and dirty. This can make people sick if they spend too much time outdoors. Foreign particulates in the atmosphere can trap the sun rays thereby making it warm. This could be one of the reasons we are witnessing heat waves across the country including Lagos. This is the major cause of global warming. Result from pollution monitoring and data keeping shows that Delhi, Patna, Gwalior, Raipur, Karachi, Peshwar, Rawalpindi, Khoramband, Lucknow are the most polluted cities in the world. Although, none of China's cities are among the top five most polluted, 94% of the people believe air pollution is a problem that needs to be tackled imminently by its government. The report ranked almost 1600 cities in 91 countries for quality of their air. In the case of Nigeria, we cannot truly understand the negative impacts of carbon pollutants in our major cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja, due to lack of data. The World Health Organisation (WHO) report measured particles less than 10 or 2.5 microns. These particulates are very tiny and harmful; they can cling to the lungs triggering diseases. According to the WHO, outdoor air pollution kills about 3.3 million people every year, more than HIV, malaria and influenza combined. In Delhi, for example, fumes from coal powered plants, cars and small generators have caused lung infections in over five million children such that they cannot fully recover. Interestingly, in 2015 the city of Delhi's Chief Minister had to undergo rehabilitation in a clinic located south of India to treat his lung infection. Air pollution from power stations, mainly coal-powered plants causes one in seven deaths globally. It is the single factor in the U.S, causing a third of the 55,000 annual deaths, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom. These countries, despite their high quality health systems, still face such challenges. What will become of the poor Nigerians who do not have access to basic healthcare? Prevention is better than cure. China is shutting over 2,000 small coal mines in order to reduce the negative impact on air pollution. Coal use is declining as China's government has made policies towards renewable energy-hydroelectric, solar and wind power. Beijing also aims to take measures such as closing polluted companies and cutting cement production capacity to clear the city's air. Nigeria flares about 17.2 billion metric tonnes of natural gas annually into the atmosphere. This flaring equals one quarter of the power consumption of the entire African continent. The government is not interested in the health, environment and social problems surrounding such reckless activities. They are more focused on making more money at the detriment of the environment and poor inhabitants. The agencies saddled with related responsibilities are either complacent or incompetent. Otherwise why has the flaring continued unabated? Gas flaring has a direct impact on the immediate environment; it releases pollutants into the air thus making it dangerous for breathing. The particles or gases can significantly alter the weather and climate pattern of the area over a period of time. The affected areas will witness acidic rainfall which is no longer suitable for drinking. The acid rain contains sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, it corrodes roofs and kills plants thus creating economic hardship for inhabitants who will need to spend more to buy potable water and food produce which should normally yield from their farms. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report in 2011 discovered that most of the water bodies in the Niger Delta areas were contaminated with high levels of dangerous hydrocarbons like benzene. Although Shell agreed to clean up the spills, it claimed that an extensive clean-up could take 30 years. The entire ecosystem has been lost and restoring it to its original state is impossible. Fossil fuel does not just pollute our environment; it is a major cause of ill health around the world. We do not need coal-powered plants. This is one of the major reasons Nigeria must break free from fossil and this is why I am not an advocate of coal-fired plants. Renewable energy is the way to go in line with the Paris climate Conference, otherwise known as the 21st Conference of the Parties or COP21 , and global pathway to sustainable energy. We have favourable factors to explore solar, wind and water energy in order to attain 100% renewable energy by 2040.  Ulor writes from Lagos. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria107","Buhari's Foreign Trips - My Takeaway - Babatunde Fashola [opinion]","April 18, 2016","Vanguard (Lagos)","Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola on Monday disclosed his thought on how the series of foreign trips made by President Muhammadu Buhari will benefit Nigeria as a country. Fashola who made the disclosure in his report titled, ""PMB's Foreign Trips,My Takeaway"" which he made available to the media said, ""I hope every Nigerian who cares about our country will have some information about what their President is doing about the things that concern them"" Read the statement in full PMB's Foreign Trips - My Takeaway In making this public intervention, I seek to highlight the benefit of global relationships and cooperation in a world that is changing daily as a result of globalization and transborder economics, social and even criminal activities where no one is safe, except all are safe, and to leave the dispassionate observer his opinion after deep reflection on the value, or lack of it, of the President's foreign trips. This way I hope every Nigerian who cares about our country will have some information about what their President is doing about the things that concern them. First I will start with context. Barely 2 decades ago (between 1994 and 1998) we would not have quarreled with the description that we were a pariah nation. We were ostracized from global events because of bad governance. We had lost the respect accorded Nations like ours were they well-led and well-run. I recall that not a few Nigerians complained that the green passport was becoming, if it had not already become, a burden. That was at the height of the dictatorial government that broke the rules of international relations. It was from there that we started to heal. Investors entered our country. Many brands that we sought after abroad started coming to set up shop in our country. The tourist footfalls in our country increased slowly but surely, but again we began to slide. That was when Buhari declared at a meeting in Lagos during his campaign in 2015, that if elected, he would make us proud about our country again. Proud to be Nigerian again. That is the context in which I view his foreign trips and the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Foreign Relations which promised to: Make the Nigerian national interest the overriding factor in its foreign policy and international relations. Work to reform global governance in multilateral institutions and agencies. Work to strengthen the African Union to become a more effective organization on global affairs. Engage the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) on the basis of equality. Play a leadership role to develop a MINT (Mexico, India, Nigeria, and Turkey) as a counterforce to BRICS. I will limit my takeaways to 4 (Four) trips that I attended with the President namely: the G7 Summit in Germany, the Oil and Gas Summit in Iran, the Renewable Energy Conference in Abu Dhabi and the State visit and Business Forum in China; and 2 (Two) trips that I did not attend, but whose deliberations I followed, namely: Paris for the COP 21 and USA for the Nuclear Energy Summit. G7 in Germany This is a club of eight of the most industrialized, economic and technologically advanced nations. For the benefit of those who do not follow international politics it was originally the G8 comprising the USA, Britain, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Russia, who were later suspended and had sanctions imposed on them to make it G7 as a result. It was formed in 1975 as a club of 6 (Six) before Canada and Russia were admitted. They look after each other, and the rest of the world to put it simply. They have gone to war together if you remember Iraq and Libya in recent memory and they are all largely collaborating to fight terror. (Most recently the FBI was rendering assistance to Belgium in the aftermath of the terror attacks in that Country). Why G7 one might then ask? Answer: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as host, invited PMB on his inauguration to be their guest along with some three or four other African countries. Apart from the personal aides of the President, Governor Shettima of Borno, General Dambazau and myself were the only ones who accompanied PMB. I recall that upon our arrival in Germany they expressed surprise that our delegation was small and asked if others were still coming. In the pre-departure briefing, in addition to highlighting how the security and economic agenda of the G7 coincided with 2 (Two) of his campaign promises, security, (corruption) economy, PMB stated the reasons 3 of us were invited. Governor Shettima was in the front line of terrorists and criminal activities in the north east; General Abdulrahman Dambazau, was a former Chief of Army Staff, and also a faculty associate of Harvard University Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; I had run the single biggest economy of a state within Nigeria for eight years and was in the frontline of Ebola. Without ministers, one week after taking office, he felt we were the ones best suited to assist, if he needed it, on the issues of security, economy and health on the G7 agenda. In the event, he did not need us. He held his ground admirably. He was the first person called upon to speak at a Summit in which Nigeria was not a member. I was proud to be a Nigerian. At global summits we usually got to speak when others had spoken and the hall has emptied. President Obama was the first G7 member to speak after PMB and he said that Nigeria has elected a President that brings a reputation of scrupulous integrity to the table. I was proud to be a Nigerian. The opening session was robust and welcoming, we saw some of the world's most powerful men and women take off their jackets, call each other by their first names in a club-like setting while addressing the world's most serious problems. Problems that affect you and I daily. I was proud that my President was in a room where decisions concerning my planet were being deliberated upon. Prime Minister Cameron, Chancellor Merkel and others also spoke in similar vein about our President's reputation and our nation's strategic position in Africa and the world. They pledged support for Nigeria on Terror and the Economy. Importantly, I learned that their scientists were worried about increasing resistance of strains of infections to antibiotics; and that they were committing enormous resources into finding out why and what to do. They highlighted the difficulty of time and resources that it will take to develop new antibiotics and the risk to global health. If we all appreciate how vulnerable we can be without effective antibiotics, especially our children, and if we remember how low life expectancy was and how poor global health was before the discovery of Penicillin after the World War, we will appreciate the seriousness of the platform to which Nigeria was invited. I was proud that our President was there. If the seven most powerful nations stand with you, who can stand against you? I need not say more except that I can attest that PMB has been following up on these matters, and the progress on security is visible, while results on the economic front will manifest soon enough. Iran Oil and Gas Summit For those who are not aware, one of the reasons why oil prices went up, and from which we benefited in the past, was that Iran, the world's 7th largest producer of oil, was facing global sanctions from which she was due to emerge in 2016. Because Iran was soon to be selling oil, the likelihood of a further crash of oil prices that had drastically fallen was a threat to Nigeria's economy if oil prices crashed further.(Our 2016 budget proposals had just been formulated on a $38 per barrel assumption) I was witness to PMB's persuasion to Iran to come to the market slowly instead of pushing out large volumes which will raise supply and crash prices, even though Iran also needed the cash. You can't do that type of diplomacy by letter or by phone, in my view, not when the major players were all there in person. I witnessed the meeting with the Venezuelan prime minister, who was leading the South American producers to sell more and get cash even if the prices were lower. PMB's logic was different. Recorders of history will recall that the Venezuelan government suffered a major political defeat in Parliament, while PMB's logic has at least steadied oil prices. It might interest you to know that all European nations sent their oil ministers, except Russia, where Vladimir Putin came in person, because having been suspended from the G8 and facing sanctions, this was the meeting where his country's interests were best served. For the record, Russia pledged a $5 Billion state support to Iran, and if the purpose of this is lost on anyone, I interpret it to mean, ""Take cash, don't pump out your oil. It will hurt me."" This is the reality of international politics. Finally on Iran, PMB told us, how when he flew to Iran in his days as Petroleum Minister, he noticed how much gas they were flaring and now he returned as President, all the flares were gone. We found out that all the gas had been harvested and piped to every home for heating, cooking etc. His mandate: ""If they can do it, we must do it."" Abu Dhabi Renewable Energy Apart from seeking cooperation to recover Nigeria's stolen wealth stored in the UAE [His anti-corruption commitment pursued in person], PMB addressed a renewable energy summit where we learned about initiatives to bring solar power price down to 5 (Five) US cents per kilowatt hour, (approximately N10) as against the price of 17 (seventeen) US cents (N34) per KW/h tariff in Nigeria fixed at privatization by the last Government. PMB's mandate was for us to explore collaboration for the manufacture of solar panels in Nigeria to bring down the price and deploy it to the sunlit areas of Nigeria, especially the North that is most prolific for irradiation. We are currently working on the Energy Mix for Nigeria which is the implementation process of the energy policy that will take us there. Hopefully we will soon be signing the first set of solar deployment agreements for Nigeria. In this way, more solar and hydro will be used in the North, more coal and hydro in the Middle Belt, and more gas in the South; so that we take power generation closest to the most prolific source of fuel to bring down the cost and make it more affordable. On the trip to China (which I will comment on) we met a few Chinese solar manufacturers (who recognized us from Abu Dhabi) who want to set up business of manufacturing solar panels in Nigeria. China Investment Forum and State Visit This is the visit that provoked this write up, because I had bottled what I knew. But it was time, I believe, to share some of it. China is the second largest economy in the world with a per capita income of $8,000 which they are planning to raise to $12,000 by 2020. By her own assessment, according to President Xi Jinping, they are still a developing nation seeking to achieve what he described as ""initial prosperity"" by 2020. If you look at the back of your phone, your TV, your watch, your I-Pad, your Mobile Charger, many other accessories that you use, you are likely to find these three words ""Made in China"" printed somewhere. For such a nation, (with trillions of dollars in reserves, that plans to spend $2 trillion on imports in the next five years and earn $100 billion annually) who still sees itself as a developing nation, such modesty in the face of success, assiduous hard work and productivity is a destination to seek cooperation in the pursuit of economic development. This is where PMB led an array of Nigerian investors including Erisco Foods, (who now makes our tomato paste at home and employs people locally including farmers who supply the tomatoes), Power operators (DisCos and GenCos), and the Dangote Group, to meet with and address their Chinese partners. During the meeting with the Chinese President, 6 (Six) collaboration agreements were signed including for agriculture and food production improvement techniques, rail and power infrastructure development, for funding the Dangote group to continue to expand and create jobs at home and keeping some of our reserves in the currency of the richest nation in the world. This last mentioned agreement was a legitimate coup by PMB because the intelligence was that some West African countries were going to sign before us. PMB seized the moment. Of course he had to apologize for our previous failures on our agreement made to part-fund 4 airport projects in Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt and Abuja-Kaduna rail project. The Chinese had provided their agreed part of 85% but the remaining 15% Nigeria did not honour during the last administration. Some of the recent revelations about financial scandals estimated at $2.1 billion in the office of the National Security Adviser alone during the last administration suggest how impactful such funds would have been in delivering these critical infrastructure ; but we all know what happened. This is why PMB is traveling. To repair our reputation severely damaged by the last government, and to assure our partners that Nigeria has CHANGED. And from there to re-negotiate an existing funding agreement to complete critical Transport infrastructure. Because of his reputation, President Xi Jinping believed him, and to quote him, he said: ""It is better late than never. "" Through him China literally opened the door to Nigeria in areas of infrastructure (power, railways and roads), agriculture, education and manufacturing especially in our Free Trade Zones. To paraphrase the Chinese President, ""ask us for whatever support or partnership and we will be happy to respond."" ""We wish to see you take your rightful place and we are happy that you are the first African president visiting China, after my visit to Africa last year to pledge a $60 billion support for the Development of the continent."" If this was not initiative I doubt what is? As for the trips to Paris, COP 21 and the USA, Nuclear Security Summit, I will only say this: a) The threat of climate change, global warming, desertification in the north of Nigeria and coastal erosion in the Atlantic (Bar beach in Lagos) and in the south, affecting Rivers, Bayelsa and other coastal states, the clear scientific evidence lays the blame at the door of the world's most industrialized nation for their pollution. b) Since the Kyoto protocol they have paid lip service to remedying the situation, which unfortunately affects developing nations more adversely. c) COP 21 was the first serious commitment that these leaders made to ensure that global temperatures do not rise above 2\'b0C and indeed are reduced to 1.5\'b0C. I am proud that Nigeria was not missing at this historic moment. When the planet is saved, the next and future generations of Nigerians will recall that PMB was present, when all of the world leaders were present to save the planet. d) In the aftermath of COP 21 , the commitment of these nations is to increase production and technology for renewable energy and to reduce the use of carbon fuels. One way they plan to achieve this is increased deployment of nuclear energy. The world leaders must trust you for you to partake. At that summit, in the group photograph, PMB stood on the second row along side Britain and Turkey. In the past, we used to be on the last row. This is CHANGE. As he meets with world leaders outside Africa, he has not forgotten the home front. He is regularly visiting and receiving his sister and brother presidents on the African continent. PMB has earned their trust for all of us and I am proud to carry my green passport. Yes, some results are not yet manifest, and may take a little while to do so, but a solid foundation for a sustainable, respectable and prosperous future is being laid, block by block. This is how to build a solid ""home"" from whence we can project respect abroad with confidence. How many of us will do business with total strangers without a reference or a good reputation in this age of due diligence? PMB is building affiliations everywhere that if well-managed in future, will develop into a global network of friendships, trust and respect for Nigeria and Nigerians. I once heard that the role of a leader, like that of the head of a family, is that of an aggregator, opening doors and opportunities, breaking down barriers and forging alliances. I agree. This is my Takeaway on these trips. Babatunde Raji Fashola, SAN \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria108","Nigeria's obsession for fossil fuel and its health impact","April 21, 2016 Thursday","Business Day","The year 2015 was the hottest year ever in the history of the earth's climatologically chronology. This increased temperature can be attributed to global warming resulting from the selfish activities of man especially carbon emitters. As nations scramble to attain global supremacy, nature tends to suffer inadvertently. The consequences of prolonged carbon exposure into our atmosphere have gradually begun to manifest across the globe. From tsunamis to hurricanes, from droughts to erosion, from new disease to abrupt death; the negative impact of climate anomalies could become worst than the present predicament if left unchecked. Air is the most vital need of any living organism, without it life ends. Any distortion in its natural composite harms organisms that inhale it including human beings. Air is basically made up of different gases such as oxygen (21%), nitrogen (78%), argon (1%), carbon dioxide and other molecules. Most air pollution results from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, gasoline, wood and vehicle fumes. When fossil fuels are burned they pollute the fresh air which may cause various health predicaments. Burning fossil fuel creates smog which makes the air cloudy and dirty. This can make people sick if they spend too much time outdoors. Foreign particulates in the atmosphere can trap the sun rays thereby making it warm. This could be one of the reasons we are witnessing heat waves across the country including Lagos. This is the major cause of global warming. Result from pollution monitoring and data keeping shows that Delhi, Patna, Gwalior, Raipur, Karachi, Peshwar, Rawalpindi, Khoramband, Lucknow are the most polluted cities in the world. Although, none of China's cities are among the top five most polluted, 94% of the people believe air pollution is a problem that needs to be tackled imminently by its government. The report ranked almost 1600 cities in 91 countries for quality of their air. In the case of Nigeria, we cannot truly understand the negative impacts of carbon pollutants in our major cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja, due to lack of data. The WHO report measured particles less than 10 or 2.5 microns. These particulates are very tiny and harmful; they can cling to the lungs triggering diseases. According to the WHO, outdoor air pollution kills about 3.3 million people every year, more than HIV, malaria and influenza combined. In Delhi, for example, fumes from coal powered plants, cars and small generators have caused lung infections in over five million children such that they cannot fully recover. Interestingly, in 2015 the city of Delhi's Chief Minister had to undergo rehabilitation in a clinic located south of India to treat his lung infection. Air pollution from power stations, mainly coal-powered plants causes one in seven deaths globally. It is the single factor in the U.S, causing a third of the 55,000 annual deaths, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom. These countries despite their high quality health systems still face such challenges. What will become of the poor Nigerians who do not have access to basic healthcare? Prevention is better than cure. China is shutting over 2,000 small coal mines in order to reduce the negative impact on air pollution. Coal use is declining as China's government has made policies towards renewable energy - hydroelectric, solar and wind power. Beijing also aims to take measures such as closing polluted companies and cutting cement production capacity to clear the city's air. Nigeria flares about 17.2 billion metric tonnes of natural gas annually into the atmosphere. This flaring equals one quarter of the power consumption of the entire African continent. The government is not interested in the health, environment and social problems surrounding such reckless activities. They are more focused on making more money at the detriment of the environment and poor inhabitants. The agencies saddled with the responsibilities of stopping gas flaring are either complacent or incompetent. Otherwise why has the flaring continued unabated? Gas flaring has a direct impact on the immediate environment; it releases pollutants into the air thus making it dangerous for breathing. The particles or gases can significantly alter the weather and climate pattern of the area over a period of time. The affected areas will witness acidic rainfall which is no longer suitable for drinking. The acid rain contains sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, it corrodes roofs and kills plants thus creating economic hardship for inhabitants who will need to spend more to buy potable water and food produce which should normally yield from their farms. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report in 2011 discovered that most of the water bodies in the Niger Delta areas were contaminated with high levels of dangerous hydrocarbons like benzene. Although Shell agreed to clean up the spills, they claimed that an extensive clean-up could take 30 years. The entire ecosystem has been lost and restoring to its original state is impossible! Fossil fuel does not just pollute our environment; it is a major cause of ill health around the world. We do not need coal-powered plants. This is one of the major reasons Nigeria must break free from fossil and this is why I am not an advocate of coal-fired plants. Renewable energy is the way to go in line with COP21 and global pathway to sustainable energy; we have favourable factors to explore solar, wind and water energy in order to attain 100% renewable energy by 2040. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria109","Why Nigeria Must Invest Heavily in the Forest Sector - Stakeholders","February 09, 2016","Vanguard (Lagos)","Stakeholders in the forest sector, have urged governments at all levels to invest heavily in the sector because of its huge potential in addressing the nation's emerging environmental, social and economic challenges. They made the appeal last week at the 14th Annual Chief Shafi Lawal Edu Memorial Lecture, organised by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, NCF in collaboration with Chevron Nigeria Limited, in Lagos. The stakeholders expressed dismay that Nigeria is blessed with a large expanse of land and different vegetation types that are not sustainably used or managed, with the attendant impact of climate change. Impact of climate change Those who spoke at the lecture which had Valuing Nigeria's Forests: Issues and Context as its theme were the Chairman, National Executive Committee, NCF, Chief Ede Dafinone; Director-General, NCF, Adeniyi Karunwi and the President, Board of Trustees, NCF, Izoma Asiodu, among others. The guest lecturer and President, Forestry Association of Nigeria, FAN, Prof. Labode Popoola said Nigeria with a total land area of 923, 678km square has a forest area that has been on a continuous decline owing to its increasing population among other factors. According to Prof Popoola, heavy demand for construction, wood and other purposes by the wood-based industry encouraged logging which led to large scale deforestation of Nigeria's forest. He noted that non-forest policies, particularly, energy policies, continue to pose grievous threats to the forest sector. The don however noted that in Nigeria, forest statistics are appallingly unreliable, even when available. He said: ""The last major forest resources assessment in Nigeria took place between 1996 and 1998 through a $4m grant provided by the African Development Bank. The database established from that assessment was expected to be updated frequently through a Forest Information System, FIS in each of the 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, with a terminal at the Federal Department of Forestry. ""The gains of the Forest Resources Assessment of 1996-1998 have been completely lost. As of today, there is nothing on ground in this regard. Also, there has not been any updating since then. Forest cover remains under pressure as a result of human activities such as agricultural development where vast lands are cleared without conservation considerations, large-scale per-urban housing project development, fuel-wood generation, uncontrolled forest harvesting, including poaching for logs and poles and urbanization."" Prof. Popoola who highlighted the environmental, socio-economic, socio-cultural services forests provide, however, lamented that the deforestation rate in Nigeria is about 3.5 annually, adding that this translates to a loss of about 350,000-400,000 hectares of forest land annually. Citing paucity or lack of data/information, obsolete forest laws, poor funding, governance issues, education and research, corruption, among others as factors militating against valuation of Nigeria's forest, Popoola said: ""Moving forward, Nigeria will need to invest heavily in the forest sector because of its continuing topicality in the global discourse for sustainable development and the inherent huge potentials the sector has in addressing emerging environmental, social and economic challenges. ""Forests remain Nigeria's most under-valued resource, and as long as planners and policy makers continue to disregard the economic importance of the forest sector, as well as those of sectors and activities that depend or impact it, so will forests continue to be degraded and lost, and their potentially vast economic opportunities will be lost. We can no longer afford the business as usual approach in the forest sector."" Earlier, the Director-General, NCF, Adeniyi Karunwi said the NCF has been successful in implementing projects such as restoration and conservation of dry lands and wetlands habitat in the Sahelian region to wetland and coastal restoration for improved livelihood in the coastal region of the country, noting that this has made NCF the foremost leader in conservation efforts in Nigeria. He however, added that the Memorial Lecture also serves as the platform for the presentation of awards to grantees of the Chief S.L. Edu Memorial Research Grant for PhD studies, pointing that the grant has been sponsored by Chevron Nigeria Limited for over a decade and has tremendously strengthened research in biodiversity conservation in Nigeria by building the capacity of young conservation professionals. On his part, Asiodu said valuing Nigeria's forest, as well as investing heavily in the sector has become imperative in the country's economic history. He said: ""With the downward fall of crude oil prices, Nigeria's leadership is at last beginning to show a determination to diversify Nigeria's economy. There are great opportunities in agriculture and solid minerals both which depend on environmental sustainability. It is our responsibility therefore to guide decision makers on the economic valuation of forests so as to justify the necessary investments for the protection and restoration of these fragile forests and their ecosystem services."" Dafinone who spoke at the event said ""as part of NCF's efforts aimed at domesticating climate change actions, we intend to respond to the clarion call for the vigorous pursuit of the implementation of the reforestation programmes in order for Nigeria to meet the Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) recommended 25 percent forest cover of total land area. ""Our decision to bring out our collective consciousness the need for proper economic valuation of Nigeria's forest is not only timely but very appropriate as part of the efforts after the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), to strategically position the country for the real climate change action."" \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria110","President Buhari's Welcome Address At 48th Summit Of ECOWAS Heads Of State And Government","December 16, 2015 Wednesday","PM News","President Buhari with H.E. Mr. Michel Kafando the Transitional President of Burkina Faso at the State House, Abuja, Nigeria on Wednesday, 16 Dec., 2015 I am pleased to welcome you all to Abuja for the 48th Ordinary Session of the Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Allow me, your Excellencies, to pay tribute to President Kafando and the entire members of his Transitional Government for the laudable efforts they deployed in the implementation of the Transitional Charter and the conduct of successful elections in Burkina Faso. This is yet another demonstration of the Community's commitment to the principle of democracy and good governance. While we wish President Kafando every success in his future endeavours, we congratulate, once again, President-elect Roch Marc Christian Kabore and wish him well in the governance of his country. Let me recall that the election in Burkina Faso completed the cycle of 2015 presidential elections in the region, successfully conducted in my country-Nigeria, Togo, Guinea, and Cote d'Ivoire. This remarkable achievement reflects our collective resolve to entrench democracy and good governance in the region. As we prepare for more general elections in the coming year, I assure Your Excellencies that Nigeria will remain steadfast in its commitment and support to democracy and good governance. We believe that a politically stable West Africa can only be strong and prosperous. The convening of this Summit in Abuja is a great honour and privilege for the Government and people of Nigeria. I sincerely thank my brothers, Heads of State and Government for accepting Nigeria to host this unique Summit, which is taking place as we celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the founding of our Organization. I would like to express my warm appreciation to my brother, H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal and Chairman of the ECOWAS Authority for his statesmanship and able leadership since he took over seven months ago. Let me also thank the President of the ECOWAS Commission, the Commissioners and staff members for efforts deployed in the preparation of this Summit. Over the years, our Organization has recorded concrete achievements which loudly speak for themselves. ECOWAS has indeed been universally acclaimed as a model regional economic community. In spite of the significant achievements, our Community still faces numerous challenges. While some militate against the integration drive, others continue to pose risks to peace and security, as well as political stability in the region. There are also structural and administrative challenges in running the Commission that equally require serious attention. Security challenges persist in our region as we continue to be confronted with the daunting scourge of transnational organized crime including arms trafficking, drug trafficking, as well as piracy and criminality at sea. Equally worrying is the rising scourge of violent extremism and terrorism. All this constitute serious threats to peace and security in the region, and therefore require our urgent and concerted actions. Regional and indeed global solidarity is vital in our efforts to counter these threats. To this end, we must continue to enhance our system of governance and, working with our partners, accelerate the implementation of our joint initiatives and mechanisms created to address these daunting but not insurmountable risks. As we do so, we should not relent in our effort to engage with member states coming out of crises, in order to help them to consolidate on the achievements made. The catastrophic consequences of climate change are manifest in our region. A number of fragilities, conflicts and environmental degradation that affect our countries today with serious negative impact on peace, security, economy and livelihoods are either directly or indirectly triggered by climate change. Alone, we will not be able to reverse or stop some of these consequences, as it requires huge investment of resources far beyond our capabilities. We should therefore continue to press for international assistance and to work with the rest of the world to protect the environment. We should do so without loosing focus on our industrial development objectives. Our efforts to fast track regional integration should also be informed by the requirement for clean source of energy. In this regard, I welcome the agreed outcome of the just concluded COP21 in Paris, which aims at reducing global warming and providing for financial support to developing nations. We must also continue to cooperate with our development partners, and take advantage of their willingness to support our initiatives to address all these challenges in the most appropriate and beneficial ways to our region and to global peace and security. Nigeria would like to see that on-going reforms in ECOWAS institutions are concluded and firmly entrenched to ensure greater effectiveness in leading the integration process. We would like to see that the resources of the Community are devoted to the implementation of economic programs that would enable us build a prosperous region. Let me conclude by expressing my strong belief in the vast potentialities of our region. I remain confident that under the leadership of the Chairman of the Authority of Heads of State and Government, H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, our Community will continue to make steady progress towards achieving the goals for which it was founded a community that gives hope to the present and future generations. I also express deep gratitude to our bilateral and multilateral partners for their continued support and cooperation. I wish us all fruitful deliberations. And please accept my best wishes for a happy festive season. I thank you. This speech was delivered on Wednesday, 16 Dec., 2015. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria111","Shipowners Express Concern Over Imo's 2016 Climate Deadline","October 26, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","European shipowners have expressed concern over the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) effort to eliminate the emission of carbon dioxide from vessels by 2016. This is coming ahead of the European delegation to the Paris COP 21 meeting in December, and issued a warning for all Parties to work through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to develop a global policy framework to enable an effective response, and to take measures to set adequate targets before the end of 2016 for achieving the necessary reductions in the light of the 2 \'b0C target. Commenting on the resolution, Patrick Verhoeven ECSA Secretary General said: ""We are happy to see that the European Parliament recognises the importance of a global solution for international shipping and gives a vote of confidence to the IMO, which should be allowed to pursue its efforts. ""We are however also concerned by the deadline adopted by MEPs. 2016 is right around the corner and as such it is rather unrealistic to expect the IMO to come up with a solution in a matter of months. A unilateral European push for a hard deadline may be counterproductive."" continued Patrick Verhoeven, referring to the need for global rules for the shipping, an industry as international as few others. The IMO's track record in developing technical CO2 energy efficiency measures for the maritime sector is impressive. Following the adoption of the amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which came into force worldwide in 2011 and which now apply to about 95% of the global merchant fleet, international shipping is the only industrial sector already covered by mandatory and binding global measures. The IMO also recently adopted the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which requires all ships constructed after 2025 to be 30 percent more efficient than those built in the 2000s, with further efficiency improvements going forward. Finally, the shipping industry itself, prompted by an increase in bunker prices, has made strides in increasing its energy efficiency and curbing its CO2 emissions. As a result of recent efforts, the contribution of shipping to global CO2 emissions has in fact dropped. According to the latest IMO Green House Gas study, published in 2014, international shipping (while transporting about 90% of world trade) produces about 2.2% of the world's total CO2 emissions. This figure was 2.8% in 2007, and the total CO2 emissions from shipping reduced by over 10% between 2007 and 2012. This was despite continuing growth in maritime trade which means that shipping is already delivering carbon neutral growth. ""The 2016 deadline is not consistent with the steps already taken at EU level"" commented Benoit Loicq, ECSA Safety and Environment Director. ""By pushing for an extremely tight deadline, the EU would essentially undermine the IMO procedure. If the EU would then focus on regional measures, it would be backtracking on its own policy."" Indeed the EU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Regulation is intended to be the first phase of a stepwise approach geared towards a global solution by allowing it to determine the real contribution of shipping to global CO2 emissions. ""The course of action that has been agreed is to start with an accurate picture of the shipping industry's CO2 emissions in 2018 (i.e. two years after the MEP-backed deadline). If we now backtrack and skip the data collection phase altogether, how would it be possible to set realistic and fair targets?"" asked Benoit Loicq. ""A global CO2 monitoring and reporting instrument is already being developed in IMO and we believe it is essential to encourage alignment of the EU MRV Regulation with the IMO tool"" he concluded \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria112","The Burden of Climate Change","March 22, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","The rise in global temperatures will impact Nigeria in a big way, and the House of Representative's Committee on Climate Change has a big task at hand, in terms of cushioning the country against the consequences. In December 2015, the largest ever single-day gathering of heads of state was achieved in Paris, France. About 150 presidents and prime ministers, from every part of the world, had come to attend the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 21 ), to rub minds on a particularly distressing issue - climate change. At the end of conference, history was made, as nations of the world came to a consensus to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius. Interestingly, the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, was part of the historic conference. Although Nigeria is not one of the top emission producing countries in the world, the impact of climate change means that the country has to pay attention to what happened in Paris. Currently, the country is experiencing adverse climate conditions with negative impacts on the welfare of millions of people. Persistent droughts and flooding, off season rains and dry spells have sent growing seasons out of orbit, on a country dependent on a rain fed agriculture. Alarm bells are ringing with lakes drying up and a reduction in river flow in the arid and semi arid region. The result is fewer water supplies for use in agriculture, hydro power generation and other users. For example, Lake Chad used to provide means of livelihood for over five million people, either for fishing or irrigation farming. But over time, due to the inaction and lack of determination to confront the problems that was staring its dependants in the face, nations allowed Lake Chad to continue to dry up. The effect of that drying up is that farmers, fishermen, other artisans that previously depended on Lake Chad for means of livelihood now poured into nearby cities like Maiduguri and some cities in Yobe, looking for a way to survive. But these people were not equipped to live in cities. And to live, anybody who gives them food became their master, their god. That was how these individuals became murder weapons in the hands of terrorists. The encroaching Sahara Desert that is racing down around one mile per annum has also depleted the grazing area previously depended on by herdsmen for feeding their cattle. These areas have dried up, as desertification kicks in. And the country has not been able to arrest these things. The result is that the herdsmen are moving southwards, looking for areas where they can graze and feed their stock. Now, instead of grazing areas prepared for that purpose, they now come to graze in the farms. They destroy crops that took farmers months and years to prepare. This has led to the regular violent confrontations involving Fulani herdsmen. This is why it has been said that climate change has varied implications, among which are national security, health, famine, and even malnutrition; because if people cannot get what to eat, they eat things that are not good for them. In January 2016, President Buhari addressed the World Future Energy Summit at Abu Dhabi and pointed out some of the tragic effects of climate change. ""Africa is already suffering from the consequences of climate change, which include recurrent drought and floods,"" he said. ""In the middle and southern part of Nigeria, land erosion threatens farming, forestry, town and village peripheries and in some areas, major highways. Constant and abrupt alteration between floods and droughts prove that climate change is real and therefore a global approach and cooperation to combat its effects are vital if the human race is not to face disaster in the 21st century."" The problems that are caused by Climate Change, as outlined above, are numerous and complicated. This was why a Committee on Climate Change was created at the Federal House of Representatives. The Committee's jurisdiction covers the provision of oversight for structures, institutions, laws and policies that make up Nigeria's response to Climate Change; ensuring accountability on Climate Change issues, and ensuring legislatives scrutiny and oversight over treaties and agreements that are likely to arise from the coordinated efforts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change The committee is headed by Hon. Sam Onuigbo, who represents Ikwuano/Umuahia North/South Federal Constituency. In an exclusive interview he granted THISDAY in Lagos, recently, Onuigbo noted that it was time to focus on the impact of climate change. ""We have a responsibility as a nation to act fast to arrest this situation,"" he said. ""Today, we have come to some kind of agreement that we must be proactive in containing the negative effects of climate change, and where possible, go ahead to take advantage of the opportunities that abound. ""That is why we came up with the National Policy on Climate Change which is to guide the different sectors affected by climate change, so that each sector is able to prepare to face the impending threats and, where possible, to benefit from the problems. For example, if we want to grow a green economy, we will have to invest in solar and hydro energy. ""We encourage each sector to do a sectoral variability assessment, for each sector to know how variable they are. When they do this, they have a scientific basis for taking action, for moving ahead. But if this is not done, we continue to move in the dark. That's why we encourage different sectors to do this and get prepared."" Onuigbo, who was also at the COP 21 in Paris, noted that challenges in combating climate change are multiple. ""The first one is finance,"" he said. ""We need finance to be able to contend with the problems and execute solutions. And another challenge is how to create the needed awareness for people to know that this is a genuine threat. We would like to see the Ministry of Information using the National Orientation Agency, to create awareness and sensitise the public on the effects of climate change."" Also, the Committee is at loggerheads with some federal government MDAs (Ministries, Departments and Agencies), who are dragging their foot in fighting climate change. For example, a ministry, which is directly impacted by climate change, made a massive provision in its 2015 budget for climate change, when Nigeria had not even made a national commitment to the problem. But after the country had made a national commitment to climate change, the same ministry now inexplicably slashed its climate budget from 12 per cent in 2015 to 0.43 percent in 2016. ""Such a scenario is disturbing, and we have to take action,"" Onuigbo said. ""We have seen the devastation in Ogoniland and in Bayelsa. The impact of gas-flaring is visible in the South-south. These are things that we are screaming about; that we must take action. We do not have to wait until the negative effects of these things catch up with us. There is a provision to stop gas-flaring in 2030, but that's a long time. We must really take action. ""We have not seen the political will to take far reaching productive actions. That's why we are hoping that as we go forward, with the kind of passionate leadership that has been shown by leaders of the National Assembly, we will be able to get in place laws to really push the executive into action."" And President Buhari regularly reinstating the country's commitment to the climate change fight, Onuigbo is worried that the MDAs, who are saddled with the responsibility to implement policies to match the President's commitment, are not doing enough. ""This is one of the reasons why my committee has held several interactive sessions with climate change impacted MDAs,"" he said. ""This is why we invite them over and over again. During our interactions, some of these MDAs even admitted that they had not been doing anything regarding climate change. Some ministries that are negatively impacted by climate change do not have a climate change department or unit. But, through our interactions with them, we are correcting this malaise. ""We would like to see verifiable, practical actions, taken by these MDAs, to match the commitment that Mr. President has made on behalf of the good people of Nigeria. Mr. President has repeatedly talked about climate change and how Nigeria must fight it. If Mr. President is taking the pains to make these pronouncements, those saddled with the responsibility of taking action must do so. We are very optimistic that we will continue to record progress going forward."" \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria113","Prospects for West Africa as climate change questions relevance of fossil fuels","February 24, 2016 Wednesday","Business Day","A world without fossil fuels, may not be the stated intent of the 195 countries that gathered at the Paris climate change conference ( COP21 ) in December 2015, and adopted the first ever universal legally binding global climate deal, but there is little doubt the thought has crossed their minds. Tom Burke, in an article for Huffington Post stated 'For a long time the fossil fuel industries have lived in a comfort zone. It was built on three key beliefs: the world would always need their products; energy technologies change slowly, governments will not act decisively to tackle climate change.' The Paris Agreement seems to have put paid to that belief. Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change impact by limiting global warming to well below 2 C. It will enter into force in 2020. Governments agreed to a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. They also committed to limit increase to 1.5 C to reduce the risk impacts of climate change. Governments also committed to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science. There were also commitment to meet every 5 years to set more ambitious targets as dictated by current science, report to each other and to the public on how well they are doing to implement their targets and track progress towards the long-term goal through a robust transparency and accountability system. While these are ambitious targets, the sticking point in past agreements has been getting countries to domesticate the policy provisions by having their legislatures approve them. Also, big business lobbyists give legislatures incentives to encourage inaction. However, West African countries should not operate under the assumption that the Paris Agreement will go the way of the other 20 protocols that have been signed towards checking climate change. It would be a move as risky as betting the house on the lottery. For one, the political resolve that gave birth to the Paris Agreement is forged upon the crucible of stern realities. Tsunamis, ozone depletion, acid rains and irrational weather have forced governments and big businesses to take seriously the threat of climate change. This has taken the will out of the voices of dissent. Unlike the 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference that collapsed into chaos, the Paris Agreement saw political will from the countries. They even made provisions to finance poor nations in order to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects extreme weather. Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International told the Guardian UK what he thought of the agreement. 'It sometimes seems that the countries of the UN can unite on nothing but nearly 200 countries have come together and agreed a deal. The human race has joined in a common cause.' Another significant fact about the Paris Agreement is that businesses are now urging governments to take urgent action. Burke noted businesses now want governments to move faster to tackle climate change. Other companies such as those making clean energy technologies see huge opportunities in a decarbonising world. According to United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) global trends in renewable energy investment report for 2014, green energy investments worldwide surged 17 percent to $270 billion at the beginning of 2014 and before the year ran out, it peaked at $339 billion driven mainly by investments in solar and wind energy. 2015 preliminary reports indicate that renewable energy technologies for the first time, attracted more investment globally than fossil fuels! What is even more significant is that users of oil are now seeking alternatives. The media reported that 13 chief executives from the car industry led by Renault have committed themselves to decarbonising transport over the next 'two to three decades'. While they anticipate about 2 billion vehicles on the road by 2050, they would not rely on fossil fuels to power them. Electric cars is seeing a revolution by Tesla. Weaning Africa from fossil fuel The dip in crude oil prices to less than $30 dollars per barrel is hurting West African economies. Ghana introduced a 30 percent hike in prices of petroleum products in January barely a month after increasing electricity tariffs by 59 percent and water tariffs by 67 percent. Nigeria even presents a grimier picture with an import dependent economy and crude oil as the country's key foreign exchange earner. The country ran into troubled waters when crude oil prices fell below $30 and the country's 2016 budget benchmark was set $38 per barrel. To make a bad problem worse, Nigeria's apex bank introduced unorthodox methods to curtail the fall of the naira leading to acute shortage of foreign exchange and further weakening the naira to nearly N400/$. Over half of the value of the stock market has been erased, now the country struggles to pay teachers. The UNEP report on investments in renewable energies has some of the lowest figures from Africa. But what Africa needs is to, as a matter of national urgency, wean itself away from fossil fuels. South Africa recorded the highest investment of over $5 billion dollars in 2014 far below China's over $80 billion worth of investments. Egypt and a few other African countries are making significant investments in renewable energy. West African countries have to rethink their engagement with fossil fuels. West African markets can see billions of dollars' worth of revenue by adding value to the raw materials in their domain and grow agro allied industries. There is also a critical need for advanced technologies in manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign imports. A future unchained to fossil fuels is indeed possible, Africa has to decide if it will follow or be dragged along. \"

Oscarline Onwuemenyi 23 April 2016, Sweetcrude, Abuja \- Power Africa, a U.S. Government-led initiative, has signed an agreement with FMO, the Dutch development bank, to spur investment in renewable energy across sub-Saharan Africa. CIO targets medium-size renewable energy projects of between 25 MW and 75 MW, and shares Power Africa's goal to add 30,000 megawatts (MW) of new power generation capacity and 60 million new business and household connections across sub-Saharan Africa. ""Power Africa's support of the Climate Investor One is indicative of our continued investment in renewable energy technologies throughout sub-Saharan Africa,"" said Power Africa Coordinator Andrew Herscowitz. ""From wind parks in Kenya, to solar arrays in Rwanda, and geothermal generation in Ethiopia, Power Africa and our partners are putting the continent's vast renewable resources to work. This agreement with CIO will not only help deliver new access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity, it will help our African government partners boost economic development and tackle climate change at the same time."" High energy demand and the challenges presented by climate change have advanced renewable energy solutions in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries have established or are strengthening supportive policy and regulatory frameworks for private investment of renewable energy infrastructure activities. CIO combines three innovative investment funds into one: a Development Fund to reduce development times and improve bankability of projects; a Construction Equity Fund to provide a single source of equity finance to fund construction and progress projects to an operational stage; and a Refinancing Fund to provide long-term and low risk debt during operations. The three funds together allow CIO to help early-stage climate mitigation projects achieve bankability while providing an end-to-end public-private financing solution. Linda Broekhuizen, Chief Investment Officer of FMO, said ""We are proud of our cooperation with Power Africa to accelerate and simplify the financing of renewable energy projects in Africa. CIO is an innovative climate financing structure that fits very well in our work to empowering entrepreneurs in a sustainably responsible manner"". USAID's funding of $5 million will go directly toward renewable energy projects financed by CIO in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, the Government of the United Kingdom and the Dutch government have also contributed to donor funding. Andrew Johnstone, CEO of Phoenix InfraWorks, and co-founder of the CIO concept said ""Basic infrastructure is a necessary foundation stone of any healthy, vibrant society, and climate change is an unavoidable truth. Climate Investor One brings together the need to address climate change on a global basis with the provision of power in geographies where development is most needed. With the collaboration of Governments and the private sector Climate Investor One points the way to mobilising sustainable capital in a manner that affects people's lives positively. We are excited about the potential that the combination of Power Africa and Climate Investor One offers to the power deficient regions of Africa."" Power Africa's support of the CIO follows a recent MOU with the Government of Canada, and agreements with the Governments of Norway and the United Kingdom signed at COP 21 in Paris. Power Africa is a U.S. Government-led initiative launched by President Obama in 2013. Power Africa's goals are to increase electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa by adding more than 30,000 megawatts of cleaner, more efficient electricity generation capacity and 60 million new home and business connections. Power Africa works with African governments and private sector partners to remove barriers that impede sustainable energy development in sub-Saharan Africa and to unlock the substantial wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, biomass, and geothermal resources on the continent. To date, Power Africa has leveraged nearly $43 billion in commitments from the public and private sectors, including more than $31 billion in commitments from the private sector. Public sector partners, including the African Development Bank (AfDB), the World Bank Group (WBG), the Government of Sweden, and the European Union (EU) have collectively committed nearly $12 billion in support of sustainable energy activities across the region.

This is even as the Coordinator of Nigerian-German Energy partnership, Dr. Jeremy Gaines, has lauded the Federal Government's 13,000MW plans for electricity through solar energy over the next decades. Speaking at the just held Conference of Parties on Climate Change, otherwise known as COP 21 , in Paris, France, the minister said: ""In particular, we plan to develop around 13,000 gigawatt of off-grid solar power, delivering energy access to the poorest communities in a cheaper and healthier manner with less emission. Lower carbon oil and gas sector We also plan to create a more efficient, lower carbon oil and gas sector. By ending gas flaring and using the gas for commercial purposes, including power generation, we could generate as much as $7.5bn worth of benefits."" According to her, given the climate risks that Nigeria faces, this is the only way in which the government's ambitious Agriculture Transformation Agenda can be delivered ""Nigeria's ambitious INDCs aim at reducing emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2030 with support from the international community. This will support the restructuring of the economy in a way that will facilitate inclusive growth with vast opportunities to diversify the energy mix, with emphasis on renewable energy and efficient gas power,"" she added. However, Dr. Gaines commended the government for the ambitious, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs, which have been set for Nigeria. He further added that promoting renewable energy as a primary sustainable development strategy for socio-economic inclusion that is good for the global environment, but is even better for ordinary Nigerians, while at the same time simply making business sense, the so called triple bottom line. ""A massive roll-out of on and off-grid solar power is one of the areas that the Nigerian German Energy Partnership and Germany's GIZ (through its Nigerian Energy Support Plan) has consistently advocated. ""Through GIZ the German government has been busy supporting Nigeria with getting all the homework done to enable a strong rise in off-grid solar PV systems. The Paris climate summit has put longer-term financing mechanisms in place to assist here. Such a roll-out is especially meaningful if integrated with the deployment of agricultural facilities (irrigation pumps, etc.) as this could be a key to unlocking socio-economic growth in particular in the North of the country. ""It is probably too early to set concrete targets for the volume of off-grid solar until the various technical and financing challenges have been overcome. But the Minister's determination to push the development of such systems shows the administration's welcome resolve to embark down this path,"" he added. The managing director, Zaphnaah Nigeria Limited, Mr. Debo Adefolaju, added that, ""It can be done, but a lot of things are attached to it. ""Is not just about clearing land and installations or putting the panels on a roof, it has to be attached to industries for it to be worthwhile. ""Meaning, either we are going to be using it for irrigation or we are going to set-up a plant to be manufacturing solar panels or batteries nearby, so that for the purpose of illustration, everything we are doing should be gear into employing our youth. ""Everything will have a value chain, either the installation; we have to train our boy and girls to install, to do the wiring, to maintain the system after it has been installed. As far as am concern it all about employment,"" he stated. He further said ""Nigeria is blessed with everything. We get between 12 and 14 hours of sunlight, our business should be first in the six geopolitical zone to start manufacturing solar panels."" , NIMASA is doing it in Nigeria, we also need to be producing battery in Country, we cannot afford to be importing everything."" ""We need to get people who will be willing to set factory. In Ghana, such factories exist, if we can bring those guys here to come and work with our boys and girls here, and start manufacturing solar panels, wire, and battery and have a quality in place to recycle battery when they run down and be able to adopt a culture of maintenance."" \"

Ban made the call at the UN Headquarters in New York, USA, where speakers of parliament met while the world is being gripped by multiple crises, including huge displacement of persons and growing threat of climate change. President of the Senate in Nigeria, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki was also at the global event. Speaking at the recent Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Fourth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, which ran from August 31 to September 2, the UN scribe said, ""We are being challenged to strengthen our collective resolve to promote peace and security, sustainable development and human rights around the world,"" adding that, earlier this month, UN Member States took a bold step in this direction by concluding negotiations on the ""ambitious and transformative"" agenda for the next 15 years. The global parliamentary summit is held every five years. The current meeting featured addresses from Mr. Ban, IPU President Saber Chowdhury, UN General Assembly President Sam Kutesa, and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Special Envoy for Peace and Reconciliation, Forest Whitaker. In his remarks, the Secretary-General said the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that form the basis of the new UN agenda are people-centred and planet-sensitive. They provide a plan of action for ending poverty and hunger, and a roadmap for building a life of dignity for all and they promise to ""leave no one behind."" Commending the parliamentarians of the world, and the IPU, for the valuable role they played in shaping the new framework, Ban underscored that their contribution to its implementation would be equally critical in ensuring that the agenda is translated from the global to the national. ""People will look to you to hold your governments accountable for achieving the goals, and to write the laws and invest in the programmes that will make them a reality,"" he said, noting that while democratic principles also run through the entire document ""like a silver thread,"" Sustainable Development Goal 16 addresses democracy by calling for inclusive and participatory societies and institutions. At the same time, the UN chief said the task of implementing and monitoring these goals is huge. ""It requires States to work in strong and close partnership with civil society of all stripes. This has never been more important"", he said. However, according to a UN release, for civil society, freedom to operate is diminishing - or even disappearing. Dozens of Governments have adopted restrictions that limit the ability of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to work, or to receive funding, or both. ""As we embark on this new agenda, the State and civil society can and should be partners in building the future we want,"" he said, emphasising that the declaration the parliamentarians will adopt at the conference outlines their responsibilities in translating the voices of the people into meaningful action. For his part, General Assembly President Kutesa said given their role as pillars of democratic governance, parliaments will have an important role in the implementation of the new development agenda. ""Parliamentarians should continue to ensure that the voices of the people are heard and included in the development process. This will enhance ownership of the new agenda and its implementation on the ground, which will be vital for its success,"" he said. Meanwhile, Kutesa said it would be essential to carry forward the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which have been incorporated in the SDGs. In particular, greater attention would be needed in the areas of education, health, water and sanitation, advancing gender equality and women's empowerment, and creation of employment, among others, he said. Parliamentarians would be essential to that effort, the Assembly President said, also spotlighting the critical role they must play in the protection and preservation of the environment, including through enacting appropriate legislation. ""As we work toward reaching a new, universally-binding climate change agreement at the Conference of the Parties on Climate Change ( COP 21 ) in Paris this December, bold commitments that will protect our planet for generations to come are needed,"" said Kutesa, stressing that parliamentarians and other stakeholders should remain actively engaged in collective efforts towards this noble goal. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria117","Breaking free: Keeping fossil fuel in the ground","May 20, 2016 Friday","Business Day","Ogoniland occupies an area of about 1,000 square kilometres of the Rivers Landscape. It has the third largest mangrove system in the world. That ecosystem has been irreparably polluted by incessant oil spills. Ibeno boasts of the largest fishing settlements on the Nigerian coastline. Located in Akwa Ibom state on the east side of the famous Kwa Ibo River, it has one the longest sand beaches in sub Saharan Africa which attracts both national and international tourists. In 2010 there was an oil leakage contaminating this pristine shoreline; Also in 2014 another spill was recorded which further polluted the coast, poising aquatic life thus disrupting fishing activities and economic life of the people. Globally, there are records of human activities especially in the extractive industry which have caused severe damages to the environment and rendered inhabitants impoverished. The Deepwater Horizon of 2010 is a glaring example. Gas flaring, fracking, mining, oil drilling, dredging and quarrying have proven to impact humans, animals and habitats negatively. Coal mining and oil drilling are the dirtiest form of energy contributing immensely to climate change. The greenhouse gases released by burning this energy are warming the planet resulting in widespread drought, flooding and massive population displacement caused by rising sea level. There is an international consensus to embrace a new pathway to a clean and efficient energy system. The Break Free campaign underlines the urgent need to end the use of petrochemicals, coal and carbon emitting substances in our daily activities especially for energy purposes. Governments can stop this energy usage by adopting renewable energy mix and making policies that will hasten the transition to renewable energy before 2030. Break Free Campaign is an awareness programme to draw attention to fossil fuel and climate change around the world. Various organizations and civil society groups are synergizing to drum support for energy transition following the COP 21 Paris Agreement. Climate Tracker which is comprised of a group of environment activists and writers has been able to create significant impact by spreading the Break Free message across thirty three countries in nine different languages. Strategically, the action targets key fossil fuel producing countries, communities and infrastructure, putting pressure on decisionmakers to keep fossil fuel in the ground and offering renewable energy as a cleaner alternative in order to protect the planet from further damages. Now that the oil prices have continued to plummet, it should be the best period to diversity revenue generation and energy production in tandem with Sustainable Development Goals. Break Free from fossil fuel campaign is a twoweek global wave of accelerated action to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground.' Actions are happening in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Nigeria, New Zealand, Philipines, South Africa, Turkey, UK and U.S In Nigeria, actions are taking place in Oloibiri, Ogoni and Ibeno all in Niger Delta. The area has witnessed environmental and social damage even at the peak of oil boom. Despite being the source of the country's huge revenue, the region is largely underdeveloped and tainted. What will happen when oil finally dries up or become less valuable? Nigeria might be the largest oil and gas producer in Africa making it the biggest economy'. Nigeria is also the largest oil polluter in world with the destruction of natural creeks, swamps, mangroves and waterways in the Niger Delta. Oloibiri, Ibeno and Ogoni are thus symbolic in the quest to break free from oil calamities. More significantly the Ogoni campaign will reincarnate the same struggle by Ken SaroWiwa who passionately campaigned against oil pollution in Nigeria's Delta region forcing one of the world's biggest oil companies to leave the zone in order to end incessant and reckless spill outs. According to UNEP the Ogoni cleanup is the biggest in the world. It requires about $1billion for the initial five years for the remediation to have any meaningful impact. The clean up could take up to 30years to restore the land and water to its near natural state. We are still grappling with the destructive impact of oil and the Nigeria government is proposing to build coalpowered plants to generate electricity. No doubt, coal is worst pollutant followed by oil and natural gas. If we are witnessing such challenges from oil then how can we survive dirty coal? India and China are litmus papers of what may happen. To prevent similar manmade catastrophes around the country and across the globe, the way forward is to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground and pursue a consistent transition towards 100% renewable energy. The earth is the only planet we have, let us ensure total break from fossil fuel to save it. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria118","Paris Climate Confab and Petro - Economies [opinion]","November 28, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","The annual Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations global treaty on climate change starts on Monday, November 30 to December 11, 2015 at Le Bourget in beleaguered Paris in the aftermath of the multiple terror attacks where 129 people were killed a fortnight ago. The COP is the supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to make nations have a legally binding and universal agreement on climate to keep global warming below 2p C. The French President Francois Hollande, addressing security concerns on the Paris COP 21 with expected 50,000 participants (including government official and civil society delegates ) in a joint session of his country's parliament, assured it would go ahead to show that the world must stay united against terrorism. Growing concerns on global warming have led to calls for reduction of greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases act like blanket around the earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm. This warming of the earth's surface as a result of atmospheric pollution by gases is the greenhouse effect. Although the greenhouse isnecessary to support life on earth, rising global temperatures have caused polar icecaps melting, oceans warming and sea levels rising with changes in rainfall resulting in floods, droughts or intense rain as well as frequent and severe heat waves. Warm climate affects water supplies, agriculture, power and transportation systems, health, safety and environment. From the United States Environmental Protection Agency human activities over the past century have released a lot of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases into the atmosphere with dangerous effects on human health and ecosystems and indeed the ozone layer depleted. Scientists discovered the hottest years of the last century came after 1990 with the hottest being 1998. A lot of greenhouse gases come from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) to produce energy. Industrial processes, deforestation, solid waste, and some agricultural processes also emit gases into the atmosphere. The international climate negotiations are to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases linked to climate change. The discourse is the reduction of fossil fuels for energy and replaced with renewable energy sources to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy like biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel), biomass, geothermal, solar, hydropower and wind are naturally generated energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2030, renewable energy could become the world's largest source of electricity ahead of conventional sources of coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear power. The Group of 7 (G7) industrialised nations summit in Bavaria, Germany on June 8, 2015 pledged to rid the global economy of fossil fuels by the end of the 21st century. German Chancellor and G7 summit host Angela Merkel had told reporters they are committed to the decarbonisation of the world economy. Observers believe the joint declaration may not have the bite considering the scramble for global oil by super majors from countries discouraging petroleum energy usage. Would the United States yet to sign the 1997 Kyoto Protocol ratify any treaty to reduce carbon dioxide emissions? Three heavy global emitters of carbon dioxide: China (27.6 percent), United States (14.5 percent), and India (6.7 percent) have not accepted the Lima 2014 legal framework that would obligate them to pay for CO' emissions. However, natural gas with low carbon dioxide emissions is now preferred to coal. China which heavily relies on coal, is now bowing to internal pressure on the dangers of smog in Beijing and 15 major cities making her to increase renewable capacity in solar energy. Last June, Norway reacted with plans to divest its $890 billion sovereign wealth fund from coal assets. Technologies developed in energy sources including renewables may soon render liquid fossil fuels useless. One's concern is on climate change but one's greater worry is the socio-economic implications on economies that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Some OPEC members' survivals hang on petroleum with some respected global institutions using global warming reduction as bait to push for fossil fuel subsidies withdrawal. These may fuel global political destabilisation owing tensions if not properly addressed. The United States is already producing flexible fuels vehicles E85 and M85 that run on (ethanol 85 percent and gasoline 15 percent) and (methanol 85 percent and gasoline 15 percent) respectively. Saudi-led OPEC oil embargo of 1973/74 destabilised American economy that in four decades she developed technologies that are reducing production costs thus culminating in present oil glut. U.S. researchers are recording breakthroughs in artificial photosynthesis that seeks to mimic the action of plants in capturing energy from the sun to produce biomass by breaking down water and combining it with carbon dioxide to power vehicles, planes and ships, reports Darrell Delamaide of Oilprice.com. Number one auto maker, Toyota plans to transform its product line with the goal of selling very few if any conventional gasoline vehicle by 2050. \"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria120","The future drivers of power projects in Africa","February 8, 2016 Monday","SweetCrude Reports","Sources of renewable energy. 08 February 2016, Sweetcrude, Abuja  Available data on power access in Africa is really gloomy. Kofi Annan, in his foreword to the Africa Progress Panel Report 2015 said ""On current trends, it will take up to 2080 for every African to have access to electricity"". Electricity consumption in Spain exceeds that of all Sub-Saharan Africa (except South Africa). Only one in six persons living in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity. And a whopping 600 million live without electricity completely. Globally more than 1.5 billion people lack access to electricity and this number is likely to remain the same until 2030 according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This sad global reality continues to drive research efforts towards improving human access to energy. Although Africa is not leading in the inventive efforts to improve energy and power access, it remains one of the most viable markets for power and energy systems in the world. Heightened stakeholder awareness has led to closer collaborations between the public and private sectors. African governments are chiseling existing power regulations and policies to reflect new realities. These concerted efforts have lowered the political risks, involved in power investments in many countries; making way for the needed private sector enthusiasm. Recent progress includes President Obama's Power Africa Initiative and the recent passage of the ""Electrify Africa Act"" introduced by US Congressman Ed Royce. Across many energy markets in Africa, investors and consumer alike are increasingly reaching a consensus. The recognition that three elements are critical for success in Africa's strides for better power access. The triangular forces of power reliability, affordability and green concerns have emerged to be the framework for success in many power projects. Reliability Reliability of power depends on the state of the associated infrastructure, power generation mix and management skills that exist between the plant and the meter. With unreliable distribution assets and poor generation capacity, revenue streams for both the generating firm and the distribution firms (where it is split) is threatened. Aging transmission and distribution infrastructure in many countries is the major source of unsteady supply and its related revenue losses. Power sector players that are unable to offer reliable supply undermines their very existence. Profitable firms are firms that will be able to build reliable systems through a mixture of the right generation and distribution infrastructure, as well as sterling management skills. Affordability Power systems that are not affordable will not be attractive for many African electricity markets. This include all state owned national grids, independent power plants that sell to private or public distribution companies, dispatchable & non-dispatchable mini grids and off grid solutions. Even if these solutions are attractive in other markets (with higher purchasing power and energy consumption behavior) they will often require some cost modification to sell in Africa. Rolake Akinkugbe, Vice President for Energy and Natural Resources at FBN Quest (in a recent publication) made a good example based on Tesla's Powerwall home-storage battery. Although they can provide renewable power (for 24hrs) above the daily need of an average rural home in Africa (6hrs), their cost at $3000 for a 7 Kilowatt hour (KWh) capacity battery makes it somewhat prohibitive in its current form. They may however appeal to other markets. And now Green! Renewable energy is now the word in everyone's lips. Even prior to the agreement of COP 21 Paris, renewable energy was increasingly contributing to the generated capacity of many developing and developed nations. It's the future! Experts say. But the best has not been seen in Africa, as fossil fuel-fired plants continue to come on-stream throughout Africa. On renewable energy in Africa, Kofi Annan remarkably noted ""Africa stands to gain from developing low-carbon energy, and the world stands to gain from Africa avoiding the high-carbon pathway followed by today's rich world and emerging markets"" Because significant power infrastructure is yet to be built and majority of Africa's existing plants are fossil-based; Africa has a compelling need to promote clean energy alternatives. Africa's unique vulnerability to climate change means that investors and governments will be tasked for greater environmental responsibility. Non-green energy sources will be increasingly scrutinized, making it difficult for ""dirty energy"" to be supported. Some countries in regions outside Africa are making good progress. In Asia, Sri Lanka with analogous economic indices to many African countries has made good success in green energy generation. Of its 2,681MW installed power generation capacity (2010) 50% comes from hydropower and conventional renewable sources. In South Africa, combined generation from solar power exceeds 510 Megawatts. Elsewhere in Africa many renewable energy projects are being promoted, from Grand Inga in DRC, to Zagtouli Solar Photovoltaic plant in Burkina Faso. With Kenya and South Africa averaging $1 billion Foreign Direct Investment in renewable alone in 2014. To neglect the trio elements of reliability, affordability and green concerns could significantly spell doom for many projects and initiatives at least in the medium to long term.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria121","Why climate change mitigation is not the end of the world for global investors","December 10, 2015 Thursday","Ventures Africa","Discussions at COP21 highlight the crucial position of\~economic investors in helping to work\~towards a better planet.\~Although the attitude of investors towards issues surrounding climate change is becoming\~more positive, a good number\~of them are still battling with whether or not to\~prioritise the good of the planet over how it\~will\~most likely affect their investment returns. Fossil fuels [dirty fuels] are a major asset to numerous investment companies, especially for those that have built their portfolio around\~the sector. Advocating for clean energy and carbon emissions regulation puts them at a risk of losing this. However, to achieve a significant reduction in carbon emissions and improved management in global warming, big investors around the world will be required to decarbonise their assets, ultimately. Greg Murray, Co-Founder and Managing Director of CleanStar Ventures, talks to Ventures Africa about investing around climate change and how investments in Africa - and globally - can still thrive, especially if investors do the right thing to save the planet. Ventures Africa (VA): What would you say is the biggest worry that investors have when it comes to climate change as it affects investment returns in Africa Greg Murray (GM): I suppose it would be agriculture. That's the most affected sector, followed closely by the energy sector. Aside from the political issues surrounding\~foreign ownership of land, the major concern that foreign investors have is around primary agriculture risks and that translates to climatic risks. The seasons are all over the place and there's not a lot of predictability in many countries around rainfall patterns and droughts. You end up with people who play more of an agro-processing and source-trading role, rather than a primary production one, offloading the climate risks onto small farmers. It sounds great from a political economy, land ownership and community involvement point of view when taken at face value. However, it\~can be problematic, because small farmers are obviously the least prepared to handle the climatic variability associated with\~climate change. (VA): Do you think that understanding the risks of climate change on financial stability will push investors to make smarter choices to improve their business environments? (GM):\~There are favourable situations\~created by the increase in\~awareness around the need to act on climate change, as well as a huge growth in renewable energy opportunities, whether it's in energy generation or in the huge market that exists for cooking fuel. The current deforestation and climate changes are all linked to the charcoal market, for example, and it creates a significant opportunity to replace that fuel with a more sustainable alternative\~and that's something that wasn't really possible five years ago. Thus, whilst climate change presents risks, it is\~also an opportunity to do things in a more sensible way. In terms of how people are assessing risk, I do not know if there's a sufficient integration of climate risks into investment decisions, such as with renewables investors or climate-related investors, which is our primary function. Perhaps agriculturists are thinking about dams and hydro-plants and would be aware of the risks associated with drought periods and the impacts on their business, but that is as far it goes for investment decisions. For example, the oil and gas/coal industry is promoting\~awareness for\~the donation of stranded assets within huge reserves found all over the place. If a global agreement is reached to have emissions not rise above 2 degrees Celsius then it's quite likely that a majority of the existing reserves are not going to be utilised. Some people [investors] are taking this very seriously, while others\~are not and they are trying to divert attention away from this fact. I really doubt that the notion of unburnable reserves is factored into the decisions of the guys doing coal-mining on the continent or going after oil and gas. Particularly given as the African countries are not likely to be at the forefront of enabling regulation of emissions, I'm not sure that it is being concluded in investment decisions in the same way. (VA): How prepared would you say investors are to undergo a structural change under which fossil fuels as a source of energy for economies is no longer viable? (GM):\~Investors want to make money. So once the alternatives are cheaper and we have factory technologies that enable us really compete, the money will flow. I think that it's a matter of taking a moral decision. In terms of focus, existing energy assets are to be protected and we can expect them to behave, to fight tooth and nail to protect those assets and fight regulation on emission and so on. We've seen this behaviour before and I don't think many people will suddenly change their. On the continent too, the mentality, at least from developed countries, is to use any means necessary \- including energy \- to grow as fast as humanly possible. Looking back historically, this is not necessarily good. Frankly, I don't see any regulation with 'teeth' coming up soon, at least not in the East African countries that we operate in, acting to limit emissions. There might be governments that will position themselves for the climate finance, for example, to track some of that. (VA): What financial strategy do you think investors should adopt as the global energy sector evolves? (GM):\~I think that they should hunt down renewable energy and climate-friendly technologies, because they are going to be the future with the amount of capital being poured\~into them. Going after coal and fossil fuel-mining or generation would be against them as it takes time for the regulation on emissions to trickle down. We're already seeing it in the destruction of value of coal stocks globally. (VA): Institutional investors tend to play a powerful role in determining how some of the biggest companies around the world decide on economic issues. What are your thoughts on how they can influence the necessary response to the 2 degrees Celsius scenario being discussed presently in Paris? (GM): Recently, the investment community is leading the charge in terms of taking an active role in pushing for the adoption of certain standards. I don't see the institutional investors being the intransigents here, it's more of the companies themselves that have sunk capital into a particular strategy. Institutional investors can trade out of companies easily, it's much harder for the companies themselves to divest fossil fuel assets because they won't find a buyer to sponsor the financial trade, particularly in the public market. Institutional investors can take a stand or a strategy decision on climate risks and decide that they want to go underway on dirty fuel or energy assets. It's easy to implement, but less so\~to undertake the structural challenge required. For example, E.ON, in Germany, has basically separated itself into the\~'good bank' and 'bad bank'\~where\~all the dirty energy assets are in the bad utility and the new distributed energy assets are situated in the good utility. As a result of this, they have to try to delink the forward-looking from the residual, dirty energy asset portfolio that has to be protected and I think we're going to see more of that. It's harder to do than the institutional investors simply summing down a particular stock because they decide that the climate risk premium has increased. I actually see institutional investors as being part of the solution. We've seen it with various declarations and with institutions signing on to the need for greater disclosure on climate risk and carbon risk. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria122","Former US Ambassador to African Union, John Simon, talks about strategising towards a tolerable climate future for Africa","December 4, 2015 Friday","Ventures Africa","If African nations want to have any sort of influence in these types of talks, they need to band together behind the AU, as well as behind the countries with which they have shared interests. It used to be the G77 representing the developing world, but now it's different because different countries have diverse interests, and one voice for the developing world doesn't quite work. However, you can create communities of interest. According to John Simon, a former US Ambassador, Africa has a distinct set of interests. Right now, the biggest impediment to Africa's development is the lack of power- but some of the best power sources for Africa are fossil sources. Fossil sources are a hot topic at the climate talks, based on their natural tendency to cause environmental harm but they are crucial to the continent's development. Africa has tremendous renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal energy. However, rather than prioritising one energy source over the other, it seems a symbiotic approach would be the most useful. The aforementioned debate is just one of many that underscores the need for African nations to be strategically positioned at the COP-21 . As an expert in strategy and public policy, Simon shared his thoughts on what the continent's leaders should focus on in Paris, with Ventures Africa. Ventures Africa (VA): You worked with the African Union between 2008 and 2009. Can you give us a brief history on how African nations have handled climate talks in the past? John Simon (JS): In my experience, climate wasn't very high up there on the list. Africa faces a lot of consequences of climate change, so there was concern about climate mitigation. But, Africa uses a tiny amount of the greenhouse gases in this world, and so it's not as if African countries have a significant imperative to reduce their greenhouse gases, it's really more about how they develop going forward. Africa was kind of used as a prop in the old formula. Not much was asked of poor Africa, who had nothing to cause these problems, but was bearing a big part of the consequences, and votes were advocates for stronger control in the developed world. Now that there is a chance to get the developing world to share more of the burden, I think that Africa needs to be wary of restrictions on what sources of power they can use that would ultimately inhibit their development. And of course, the best way for countries to become more environmentally responsible is for them to be more developed. So in the past, Africa didn't need to have a robust voice at these climate talks, and some countries like Mauritius paid serious consequences of climate change, because, again, we're held out as props of the impact if we don't do something. Now, Africa needs to make sure that it can bring some of the leverage that it has to the world, like significant renewable resources, and say, ""look, we have a lot of resource, and you can help us develop it, and we'll help reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the future. But that can't be at the expense of us being able to use other sources of energy where it makes sense.""\~Most important is for African countries to realise that their voice is stronger if it's united, and that they need to rally behind a negotiating strategy that should be articulated behind the AU. VA: What can you say about the 2006 Adaptation Fund that was established for developing nations, following attempts to help them cope with climate change? JS: If I remember correctly, it was more of an aspirational thing. I don't know that the fund ever really deployed any capital at all, to tell you the truth. Do you? VA: Not at all. And after that there was another effort made in form of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2011. Do you think that the AU played a strong enough role in ensuring that it was distributed accordingly? I honestly don't think that those funds have done a lot to make a difference, such as increase renewable energy, or mitigation. I'd be happy to be proven wrong. VA: You've just made an interesting point about words being more than action in these situations. There have been comments about how the conference in Paris is already tilting away from the vocal commitments initially made by world leaders. What do you think that African leaders should anticipate as a result? JS: It's probably a bit too early to tell, but I can categorically state what they should guard against. They should guard against control over their use of practical power solutions, as while it has a marginal global impact, it also has an impact on the ability of countries to develop. They should also make alliances that are convenient with other 'like-minded' blocs and countries that are also interested in seeing a certain amount of latitude given for them to be able to develop, while at the same time making sure that they are not overly res \"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria124","Transcendental Nigeria and Revolution 4.0","March 12, 2016","Vanguard (Lagos)","Inspiration remains an imponderable force in cultural and technological development.This has again driven the world to contemplate what experts believe is a technological agenda called the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industrial Revolution 4.0. We do not know when the Fourth Industrial Revolution would take off, but as anticipated it would go beyond the Third Industrial Revolution which started in 1969 with a kernel belief that may never waver in electronics, information technology and automated production model in digital technology, personal computing and the internet. Again for record sake the First Industrial Revolution of 1784 had the steam power, mechanical production and equipment as development models with machine replacing human muscle. The Second Industrial Revolution of 1870 had division of labour, electricity, mass production as key development model in internal combustion engine, aero plane and moving pictures. The proposed Industrial Revolution 4.0 is in congruent with the philosophical doctrine as proposed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in his 17th century Leibnizian universe that ours is ""the best of all possible worlds"". It was a time when his pessimistic contemporaries thought it was impossible for machine to replace the human muscle. Transcendental pessimist leader of the 19th century philosophical movement, Henry David Thoreau whose quote was: ""Thank God men cannot yet fly and lay waste the sky as well as the earth."" A few years after the air plane came in the second industrial revolution. As the world look forward with optimism the Industrial Revolution 4.0 it is hoped it would develop a cyber-physical system that may have innovations in driverless smart cars, artificial intelligence and robotics in hospitals, world's first solar powered air plane, biotechnology, nanotechnology, mobile banking, and 3.D printing. The World Economic Forum has become a global think tank for economic advancement. The World Economic Forum on Africa (WEFA) holds in Kigali, Rwanda on 11-13 May 2016 with theme: Connecting Africa's Resources through Digital Transformation. It would improve investment climate and macroeconomic policy reforms for foreign direct investment flows to grow economies.Nigeria hosted the 24th WEFA in May 2014 in Abuja days after the horrendous, terror-striken Nyanya bomb blasts like those in Paris in November 2015 before the COP 21 . The Forum has been a model of world corporate governance founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a holder of two doctorate degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Economics. As a nonprofit organization, the WEF is a foremost international institution for public-private cooperation with values as important as rules. Legitimacy, accountability, transparency and concerted action are the guiding principles of the Forum that engages political, business, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. President Barack might have initiated processes of the Revolution 4.0 in his very last state of the union address to Americans in January.Obama said priority would be to invest in the future and avoids subsidizing the past. He meant America would use solar and wind energy to solve the challenges of climate change. That meant fossil fuel subsidies is now a thing of the past and renewables as the future; It is an American dream he may however not implement as he leaves office in January 2017 with fossil fuels still playing dominant roles in global economies. But what lessons have Nigeria learnt as the Fourth Industrial Revolution beckons? To the Group of Seven (G7) nations it is a knockout of fossil fuels but should we tag along?We must strive to be in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 party, irrespective of whether the industrialised world ruminate an abandonment of fossil fuels. It is a wake up call for Nigeria as one believes that divinely a Nigerian would stumble across solution to our liquid fossil fuels for our own industrial take off. We must not for now abandon petroleum; our goose that lays the golden egg. What we have been shying away from is what others are benefiting from and we import. We will continue to have comparative and competitive advantages in petroleum to invest in process plants. As the Federal Government convenes an economic summit next week, Petroleum should be seen as our takeoff commodity to heavily invest in. We spend $1490.59 importing 80 percent of products in the value chain of petroleum if we were to refine one metric ton of crude. For every metric ton we sell, we make less than $280. We buy back 80 percent of the byproducts at $1490.59. Adding the remaining 20 percent of byproducts and derivatives it means we buy back what we sell for less than $280 for over $2000. Our national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) should now brace up to the challenge and invest in refineries. The developed world is thinking ahead, we should follow but tread carefully to achieve our desires. We must start from wherever to be in the revolution. Our lads and lasses are ready for the much talked about fourth industrial revolution. We must harness their potentials in the information and communications technology for the petroleum industry. Who would have thought the Nigerian genres of music would be reckoned with globally; ditto the films?It is a must do spirit for Nigerians. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria125","Draft Climate Change Agreement Forwarded to Paris","October 27, 2015","This Day (Lagos)","After five days of dedicated work in Bonn, the draft text of the new, universal climate change agreement and its accompanying decisions will be dispatched to Paris, where a final agreement will be reached in December. The draft text of the agreement enjoys full ownership by the governments of the world and represents a balanced text that will constitute the starting point for the final round of negotiations. This is contained in a statement by the UNFCCC COP 21 Paris office. Negotiations will resume in Paris when governments meet at the Paris Climate Change Summit from 30 November to 11 December 2015. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with 196 Parties, has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol has been ratified by 192 of the UNFCCC Parties. For the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, 37 States, consisting of highly industrialized countries and countries undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, have legally binding emission limitation and reduction commitments. In Doha in 2012, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, which establishes the second commitment period under the Protocol. The ultimate objective of both treaties is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Christiana Figueres said that the draft text includes additional options that reflect the concerns of all countries. ""We now have a Party-owned text that is balanced and complete. The challenge for governments is to bring it down to a much more concise and coherent form for adoption in Paris."" French Climate Change Ambassador Laurence Tubiana said: ""We have a manageable text for further work in Paris. While much work remains, the text is a good basis for negotiations and negotiations need to start from the first day of the conference."" Both Ms. Figueres and Ms. Tubiana agreed that the political process between now and the beginning of the Paris Summit will be central to the success of the meeting. A Pre-COP Ministerial meeting will take place in the French capital in early November to further address the high-level political issues relating to the draft agreement, the statement said. The G20 Heads of State will meet in Turkey in mid-November, followed by the Heads of State meeting of the Commonwealth in Malta just before the Paris Summit opens. Meanwhile, a total of 146 countries, representing almost 87 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have submitted their intended national climate action plans to the United Nations. A statement by the Paris conference media team said ""This means that so far over 75 percent of all member countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have responded. This includes all developed countries under the Convention and 104 developing countries, or almost 70 percent of UNFCCC developing member states. ""Over 80 percent of the plans include quantifiable objectives and also over 80 percent include intended actions to adapt to climate change."" Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC said: ""Over the past few months, the number of countries submitting their climate action plans to the Paris agreement has grown from a steady stream into a sweeping flood. This unprecedented breadth and depth of response reflects the increasing recognition that there is an unparalleled opportunity to achieve resilient, low-emission, sustainable development at national level."" ""The INDCs can be seen as an impressive portfolio of potential investment opportunities that are good for each individual country and good for the planet,"" she said. The UNFCCC secretariat, as requested by Parties to the Convention, will provide a synthesis report of all these plans, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), on November 1. More countries will continue to submit their plans ahead of the Paris UN climate change conference from 30 November to 11 December, 2015. The European Union is also counted as a separate ""Party"" to the UNFCCC in addition to all its members, which means that a total of 147 Parties to the Convention have submitted plans. National Level Planning Across Diverse National Circumstances The Paris agreement is to be a turning point that puts the world on track to the low-emission, climate resilient and sustainable future that is the only way to keep global average temperatures from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius, the internationally-agreed defense line against the worst impacts of climate change. In a paradigm shift towards a truly national response to climate change, countries facing many diverse circumstances, from poorest to richest, from largest to smallest, have presented INDCs which are national in scope and with the increased focus on quantifiable objectives. Many INDCs also take a long term vision of climate action, underlining a growing understanding that unlocking the opportunities from ambitious climate action will require a transformation of how power is produced and consumed and how environments are managed now and over decades to come. In addition, many countries from all continents, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable to climate change, have presented INDCs that include necessary action to adapt to climate impacts to protect continued sustainable development. Cooperative Effort to Complete Climate Action Plans Developed world governments, UN agencies and intergovernmental organisations, have been providing assistance to developing countries to prepare their plans. ""The impressive number of INDCs is only matched by the unique process that has underpinned their submission, with many developing countries having been assisted by developed country governments, the United Nations system and others to prepare them in detail and on time,"" said Ms Figueres. ""In addition, many countries have engaged in an unprecedented dialogue across government ministries, sectors of their economy and often involving other stakeholders in order to finalise their contributions. This intense engagement and reflection within nations provides a good foundation for current and future ambition,"" she said. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria126","Buhari - Let's Fix Nigeria Together","May 29, 2016","Daily Trust (Abuja)","President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to all Nigerians to continue to support his administration's efforts towards fixing the country. President Buhari made the appeal Sunday morning in his Democracy Day nationwide broadcast. The president acknowledged that despite the many years of hardship and disappointment, Nigerians had proved ""inherently good, industrious, tolerant, patient and generous."" President Buhari said his administration's first year in office had been a year of triumph, consolidation, pains and achievements. According to him, by age, instinct and experience, his preference is to look forward, prepare for the challenges that lie ahead and re-dedicate his administration to the task of fixing Nigeria. ""But I believe we can also learn from the obstacles we have overcome and the progress we made thus far, to help strengthen the plans that we have in place to put Nigeria back on the path of progress,"" he stressed. Buhari, who noted that his government purposely set out to change the country from day one, said he had reinforced and galvanised the armed forces with new leadership and resources. ""We marshaled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram. By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants had been routed by our gallant armed forces,"" he stated. Buhari said his administration's immediate focus was on a gradual and safe return of internally displaced persons in safety and dignity and for the resumption of normalcy in the lives of people living in those areas. The president said apart from giving the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the freedom to pursue corrupt officials, his administration had also alerted the judiciary on what Nigerians expected of it in the fight against corruption. The president said the government's plan was to save foreign exchange by fast tracking repair of the refineries and producing most of our fuel requirements at home. He said the nation would save billions of dollars in foreign exchange and drastically reduce its food import bill by growing more food in Nigeria, mainly; rice, wheat and sugar. He said the economic misfortune the nation was experiencing in the shape of very low oil prices had provided an opportunity to restructure the economy and diversify. ""We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestocks, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce. ""Central Bank of Nigeria will offer more fiscal incentives for business that prove capable of manufacturing products that are internationally competitive. We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria. ""Meanwhile, the first steps along the path of self-sufficiency in rice, wheat and sugar - big users of our scarce foreign exchange - have been taken. The Labour Intensive Farming Enterprise will boost the economy and ensure inclusive growth in long neglected communities. Special intervention funds through the Bank of Agriculture will provide targeted support. Concerns remain about rising cost of foods such as maize, rice, millet, beans and gari. Farmers tell me that they are worried about the cost of fertilizers, pesticides and the absence of extension services,"", he said. He added: ""I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the increasing role that our women are playing in revitalizing the agricultural sector. Modern farming is still hard and heavy work and I salute our Nigerian women in sharing this burden. In this respect I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict. ""With respect to solid minerals, the minister has produced a roadmap where we will work closely with the world bank and major international investors to ensure through best practices and due diligence that we choose the right partners. Illegal mining remains a problem and we have set up a special security team to protect our assets. Special measures will be in place to protect miners in their work environment. ""For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimizes the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom. A society that fails to recognize that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen "" poverty is not just lack of money. It is not having the capability to realize one's full potential as a human being."" President Buhari reassured of his administration's commitment to rescuing the over 200 abducted Chibok schoolgirls. He said to the delight of all, two of the abducted Chibok girls had regained their freedom. ""During the last one year, not a single day passed without my agonizing about these girls. Our efforts have centred around negotiations to free them safely from their mindless captors. We are still pursuing that course. Their safety is of paramount concern to me and I am sure to most Nigerians. I am very worried about the conditions those still captured might be in. Today I re-affirm our commitment to rescuing our girls. We will never stop until we bring them home safely. As I said before, no girl should be put through the brutality of forced marriage and every Nigerian girl has the right to an education and a life choice,"" he said. The president paid a special tribute to ""our gallant men and women of the armed forces who are in harm's way so that the rest of us can live and go about our business in safety. Their work is almost done. The nation owes them a debt of gratitude"". He added: ""Abroad, we want to assure our neighbours, friends and development partners that Nigeria is firmly committed to democratic principles. We are ready partners in combating terrorism, cyber crimes, control of communicable diseases and protection of the environment. Following on the Paris Agreement, COP 21 , we are fully committed to halting and reversing desertification. Elsewhere, we will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which I referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report. ""We are grateful to the international community notably France, the US, UK and China for their quick response in helping to tackle the recent Ebola outbreak in our sub-region. We also acknowledge the humanity shown by the Italian and German governments in the treatment of boat people, many fleeing from our sub-region because of lack of economic opportunity. We thank all our partners especially several countries in the EU. ""We appreciate the valuable work that the UN agencies, particularly UNICEF, ICRC, the World Food Program have been doing. We must also appreciate the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund and Educate A Child of Qatar for the excellent work in our health, education and other sectors."" \"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria128","Assessing Ogun's Diversification Drive","May 18, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","The Ogun State Investors' forum was an opportunity to showcase efforts being made by the state to become an economic force in Nigeria. Following the significant drop in funds from the federation allocation as a result of the slump in crude oil prices, economic diversification has become an anthem with most states looking inwards to attract investments. Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, said the state would continue to focus on agriculture. The theme of the forum was: ""Agriculture, Environment and Transportation."" Amosun said: ""Agriculture plays a significant role in economic development of our state. The state is endowed with favourable climate and good vegetation for all year round cultivation of various cash and food crops as well as livestock rearing. In the south, we have the evergreen forest vegetation and soil most suitable for the cultivation of cash and food crops like oil palm, rice, kola- nut, cocoa, cotton, cassava, cocoyam and vegetables. ""While in the north, we have a vast grazing savannah land that is very proper for animal husbandry. In addition to this, there are forest reserves, rivers and lagoons. Other natural resources include forest and large quantities of mineral deposits, such as limestone, phosphate, granite stone, gypsum, bauxite, bitumen, feldspar, clay, glass sand, kaolin, quartz, tar sand and gemstones."" Speaking on environment, he said: ""Environment is a new theme this year, but as demonstrated during the COP21 Climate Change Summit in Paris in December 2015, we are aware that we cannot ignore our environment while pursuing our developmental initiatives. Ogun State has one of the last remaining virgin rain forests in West Africa. ""Found within J4, a forest reserve located 66km from Ijebu Ode, of which 20 per cent is protected by the United Nations. Yet, unless surrounding communities can see how preserving the forests can help them earn a decent living, they are likely to collude with illegal loggers, threatening the world's ecosystem. To demonstrate how agro-forestry can generate wealth for local communities, Ogun State has entered into an ambitious collaboration with LaFarge Holcim Africa Plc and the Nigeria Sovereign Wealth Fund for the restoration of the Aworo and Imeko Forest Reserves."" Furthermore, on transportation, he said: ""The strategic location of Ogun State offers immense benefits for investors in the area of logistics, distribution and retail, which emphasises the need for infrastructural development in the state. Ogun State is a natural transportation hub for Nigeria, as the flow of goods and people from the commercial capital Lagos via land must and does pass through our state. ""Indeed, whether going into or out of Lagos from any other part of Nigeria, one must pass through Ogun State. We believe that an inter-modal transportation network is essential in order to maximize economic growth. The development of strategically placed airports and railways is integral to the Ogun State development plan."" ""Now, more than at any time in our history, industries and entrepreneurs from within Africa and around the world are choosing Ogun State as their preferred investment destination. For example, just last month (April, 2016), our Administration attracted $2.1 Billion dollars of Investment from China, directed mainly towards the development of our railways and Free Trade Zones. ""Yet, more investment is needed to realise the full potential of the State. Our State Master Plan, which is the statutory policy of government, guiding the physical development of the State, captures the many areas where the discerning investor may wish to put his or her money to secure attractive returns."" Agriculture and Economic Diversification Presently, agriculture has been embraced as the major plank for governments' economic diversification drive. Speaking at the forum, the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh described agriculture as the soul of nations, saying that any nation without a vibrant agricultural sector is already deprived of its essence and its soul. According to the minister, it was in recognition of the strategic importance of agriculture to national transformation that President Muhammadu Buhari is giving the revival of the agricultural sector the priority it deserves in the on-going national development efforts. ""So what are our priorities over the next four years? The first priority is the achievement of self-sufficiency, and excess, in our local staples namely: cassava, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, wheat, fruits and vegetables, poultry, honey, sugar, beans, soya, oil-palm, fish, milk, vegetable oils. ""Through the cooperative efforts of all key stakeholders in the agricultural sector that we expect to key into this vision and help us to actualize it, we are confident that over the next four years, the huge import bill that we are incurring presently should gradually be a thing of the past while we conserve foreign exchange for deployment to areas of strategic importance, and improve on our employment generation capacity, especially for youths, which invariably will help to guarantee shared prosperity and enhance national security,"" the minister added. He also urged participants to enhance agro products for export in the areas of Nigeria's comparative advantage namely: Cocoa, Coffee, Kolanut, Cotton, Cashew, Tea, Sesame, Soya, Fruits & Vegetables, Banana, Onions, Pineapples, Ogbono, Gum Arabic. He recalled that at independence, Nigeria was a world-leading exporter of many cash crops including groundnut, palm oil, cocoa and cotton till the subsequent period of petroleum resource dominance that overshadowed the agricultural sector for many decades. Then, the South-western geo-political zone of the country financed most of its development programmes with earnings from the agricultural sector which made the region a pace setter in many areas of human endeavour in the country. To this end, Ogbeh, said there was need to recover lost grounds in these areas given the realisation that Nigeria controls a sizeable share of the global market for crops in the past. ""We believe that the various measures that we are putting in place to re-energise the production of these crops in larger volumes, both as raw materials for home industries, and as exports, will help to restore our market share within the next two to four years. ""Given its proximity to Lagos State and the investment-friendly disposition of the State which has attracted more corporate organisations and industries into it lately, it is evident that Ogun State will be a key beneficiary of this policy drive of enhanced agro production and export in our areas of comparative advantage,"" he added. Ease of Doing Business An array of investors who were discussants at the forum, all agreed that the state accessibility to Lagos, which is the largest market in Africa, as well as its Ease of Doing Business, have all helped their businesses positively. The Managing Director Unilever, Mr. Yaw Nsarkoh hailed the state for being a people-focused state. He said: ""It is a reality that whilst it is one of the states that make up the federation of Nigeria, it is also competing in the international sphere. The reason I define the contest that way is because I feel that Ogun is setting apart a thought-leader when it comes to people centred development and thinking about development in a very integrated way. ""There are specific attributes of competitiveness in Ogun state which is the roads, infrastructure, and the fact that there is a government that is accessible, and aside from giving priority to the private sector, it gives priority to people. ""People are at the centre of Ogun state development effort and at the end of the day; those of us at the private sector understand that there is no way to build an enduring business module without putting the people first then the community would thrive. That is the most distinguished feature of Ogun state which should be an example for many states not just in Nigeria, but for many communities elsewhere in Africa and the world. Also, Managing Director MD Rites Food, Mr. Saleem Adegunwa said: ""We have been in the state for 2 years now and by virtue of location, the state is actually statically perfect. It is an hour from Lagos and to get across the country it is much easier than you would actually realise because we need our products all over the country."" He added that with this ease they experience doing business in the state also, they are targeting to employ over 3000 workers once their new plant is up and running. Also, the Chairman Flour Mills, Mr. John Coumantaros said: ""I think Ogun has one of the greatest opportunities because it is at the cross roads of Agriculture and industry. There is an old saying that a factory without a farm is scrap metal and a farm without a factory is a weed. I see tremendous ability here to unite industrious and agricultural sector."" On her part, the Managing Director Larfarge Africa Plc, Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo, disclosed that her organisation had invested heavily in the state. ""WAPCO has been in the state for 59 years so I think we actually predated Ogun state as the heart in western region. We have continued to invest in Ogun state. We have also invested in power, we have currently 90 megawatts and we are looking 310 megawatts by 2017. We have huge social investment which we estimate our total impact at N24 billion per annum. ""We have huge environmental investments which are in line with this conference. And the question is why we continue to invest in Ogun state. I do believe that here, we have one of the most investor friendly and accessible government in the country. ""By nature, cement companies are there for a long time, we tend to invest for 50 to 100 years and we have one of the most peaceful relationships with this state and that gives us the confidence to keep on investing. And of course the state is very close to the biggest market in Nigeria. So we have invested very much in Ogun state and we would continue to invest and going forward,"" she added. Also speaking at the event, the Managing Director, Coleman Technical Industries, Mr. George Onafowokan, said he actually started his business in Lagos and then moved into Ogun state in 2009, saying that he has not regretted his decision because of the proximity to the port which gives you good access to export. Unveiling More Possibilities The state also unveiled the Olokola Free trade zone. The Olokola Free Trade Zone (OKFTZ) is a state of the art industrial zone of about 10,000 hectares located in both Ogun and Ondo State in Nigeria. The zone is located about 100 km east of Lagos, the economic centre of Nigeria, and right in front of the new oil and gas deposit discoveries. It aims at attracting a wide range of manufacturing industries including oil and gas based industries, heavy and light industries, manufacturing and logistics as well as residential area. The master plan of the OKFTZ includes a state of the art deep sea port, which will be constructed in several phases up to -18 m water depth and other infrastructures amongst a Liquid Distribution Terminal (LDT). \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria129","Will the force awaken?","February 5, 2016 Friday","Business Day","The Doomsday Clock (created by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists) has been retained at 3 minutes to midnight. Though the Clock has been closer to Doomsday in 1953 - it was two minutes away then when the threat of nuclear catastrophe seemed very real soon after the H-Bomb was first tested by both USA and USSR - the witching hour seems nearer to us than ever before. Things seem a far cry from 1991 when the Clock moved to 17 minutes from midnight - the best time ever, when the Cold War and the communist era ended and it appeared that days of sanity and a climate of hope was once again upon us. However, we are back where we started, and unfortunately, this time around conditions seem just right for a perfect storm with new threats having arisen that makes the pessimists' dire predictions a near certainty. The threat of disease and contagion is never over: the Middle Ages had the bubonic plague and in our times we have all become familiar with acronyms that together have spelt death of millions. I refer to AIDS, SARS, MERS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola and now ZIKA. Just when you think the worst is over (when a new vaccine has been developed and deployed widely), comes some new form of unknown disease. While one can agree that nature has not revealed all its secrets to us and science has not been allowed to shine in its full glory, the fact is that we are still far from achieving the basic universal health standards as enumerated in the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. Medical emergencies are constantly lurking around the bend, threatening to take epidemic proportions and testing mankind's innovative abilities to contain them. Perhaps the biggest danger of all is the leadership bankruptcy across the political divide around the world. 2016 is election year in many parts of the world. All eyes are naturally on a defining election in November 2016: when the free world's most powerful nation chooses its leader in the United States. While the race is warming up, sadly, the candidates in the fray have made headlines for all the wrong reasons. It is all right to pledge to make your country great, but the means one chooses is as important as the goals you have set. Mario Cuomo, the celebrated Governor of New York once famously said that 'You campaign in poetry and you govern in prose'. However, if the words during the campaign are stinging, hurtful and damaging in nature, the divisions and fractures caused in the society are often irreparable. This fact seems to have escaped the notice of all the Republican candidates who currently are destroying whatever little goodwill and credibility the nation has earned in decades. The collateral damage (what an interesting word that attempts to diminish the price of destruction) of the conflict in the Middle East is the wave of immigrants that are testing the patience and friendliness of European hosts. Denmark has already passed a new law in the parliament to make the refugees pay their way in their new setting. While the picture of Aylan Kurdi on the beach tugged at heart strings across the world, the pragmatists in Europe are confronting reality now. The question that they are asking is valid and an awkward one too: why is it that powerful and rich Arab neighbours are not an obvious choice for refugees and migrants when in trouble? With border barriers already up in a few parts of eastern Europe and travel restrictions with increased border scrutiny in at least 6 countries so far, the Schengen visa will soon become history, many analysts believe. Is this the shape of things to come - as the European nations are under strain like never before? Already buffeted under pressure from the Greek economic crisis, EU nations may not have the steadfastness or the resolve to weather the storm caused in their social fabric with a sudden and huge influx of immigrants with a different world-view. Is the crash in oil prices and the overall slide of commodities' prices in general a precursor to a new recessionary phase in the global economy? Some economists are predicting and are talking of a 7 years economic cycle. The truth about the Chinese economy will never be clearly known but has caused enough heartburn across the world. African nations are among the most vulnerable to pain all-around not just because of the over-reliance on commodities but also because of the drying up of Chinese investments. While the Gulf oil producers (chiefly, Saudi Arabia) may have monetary buffers to tide over the present tough times (though this theory is about to be severely tested too), the oil producers in Africa (for instance, Nigeria) and South American countries (Venezuela, etc.) will be the biggest losers in the current phase. Iran being welcomed back on the world stage will be a game changer - they not only have the oil but also a nationwide industrial backbone to help them fast-forward their economic recovery. This will make a significant change in the global geo-political arena. The other big story of 2016 is the speculation that we are seeing the end of BRICs. Sure, Brazil and Russia are in crisis (Brazil more than ever before) - but I would not write them off as they are significant growth economies despite the current challenges. And, then there is Climate change. According to the World Meteorological Organization the truth of global warming is more than evidenced by data that temperatures over the period 2011 to 2015 have been the highest ever seen in the world. The silver lining is that at the COP 21 Paris conference world leaders have finally moved ahead with some commitments, though one could have asked for more. However, it is reassuring to note that 195 countries did get together at Paris to make this a part of their national agenda. Strange as it may seem, despite the litany of woes listed above, I am confident that the Doomsday Clock will be re-adjusted a year from now. We will lurch from crisis to crisis but the deeper forces of survival will bring us back from the brink of any catastrophe. Yes, the Force will awaken to fight the negative elements around us. What is necessary for us is to stay true to the path of humanity (though seemingly in short supply at the moment) and retain faith in a better future. \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria130","Nigeria, 23 Other Members Question IMF Credibility, Effectiveness","October 09, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","The Group of 24 members of the IMF/World Bank made up of developing countries of which Nigeria is a member yesterday expressed deep disappointment in the lack of progress in implementing reforms at IMF and the World Bank Group and urged the United States government to complete the ratification of the agreement reached in 2010. They said ""We reiterate our call for concrete efforts towards greater representation by nationals from under-represented regions and countries in the form of recruitment and career progression to achieve balanced regional representation in the WBG and the IMF. We reiterate the importance of staff diversity and gender balance at all levels, including diversity of educational institutions and background as well as experiences. Members rising from their meeting said in a communique ""We reiterate our deep disappointment with the lack of progress in implementing the IMF quota and governance reforms agreed to in 2010 and strongly urge the U.S. to complete ratification. This remains an impediment to IMF credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness and has considerably delayed forward-looking commitments, namely, a new quota formula and the 15th General Review of Quotas. ""Implementing the 2010 reforms remains our key priority. Nevertheless, we believe that a decision to de-link quota reform from the Board reform amendment, which is the element of the 2010 reforms that requires ratification by the U.S. Congress, would be the preferred option in the interim, as it increases IMF resources and also realigns quotas to reflect the increased economic weight of EMDCs. The alternative option, interim ad hoc increases, can, if properly designed, achieve meaningful progress towards the shifts in representation under the 2010 reforms, although it would increase IMF quota resources only marginally. It is important that any interim measures be designed so as not to lower incentives to complete the 14th General Review of Quotas"". They observed ""We strongly urge the initiation of the 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, without further delays, with a view to meet the December 2015 deadline, as mandated under the Articles of Agreement. We urge that quota reforms at the IMF protect the quota share of low income countries. We reiterate our longstanding call for a third Chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on the IMF Executive Board, provided this does not come at the expense of other EMDCs' Chairs. ""We note the 2015 Shareholding Review of the World Bank, including the proposed roadmap. We call for a timely agreement on a dynamic formula for future shareholding realignment and stress that any such formula must meaningfully increase the voting power of developing countries and move towards equitable voting power, while protecting the voting power of the smallest poor countries. Through the shareholding review, we also call for the strengthening of the WBG's responsiveness to the developing countries and the increase of the developing countries' voice and representation in the Bank's Executive Board. We, the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development, held our ninety-fourth meeting in Lima, Peru on October 8, 2015 with Alain Bifani, Director-General of the Ministry of Finance of Lebanon in the Chair; Mauricio C\'e1rdenas, Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia as First Vice-Chair; and Sufian Ahmed, Minister of Finance and Economic Development of Ethiopia as Second Vice-Chair. ""In the context of uncertainty and increased volatility, we must continue to build strong foundations for growth while addressing unemployment, poverty, and inequality. Strengthened global financial safety nets should be a priority in order to ensure the availability of adequate liquidity support in times of need, and we call on the international financial institutions (IFIs) to step up their efforts in this regard. We recognise the important role of regional, bilateral, and multilateral arrangements that can provide complementary precautionary financing to help countries face potential shocks. EMDCs are disproportionately affected by the influx of refugees and internally displaced populations, including as a result of terrorism and conflicts. We call for strong and timely support by the international community in alleviating their impact, and for enhanced support, including through concessional financing from the IFIs. More broadly, we continue to call on the IMF and the World Bank Group (WBG) to strengthen their support for fragile and conflict-affected countries. They also said ""We welcome the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus strongly on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions and achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social, and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner. We also welcome the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development. Building the foundations for strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth by investing in people, promoting effective public institutions, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and putting in place solid economic policy frameworks and fundamentals will be crucial to achieving the SDGs. ""We stress the importance of country ownership and leadership in the implementation of the SDGs, but the agenda must be underpinned by credible means of implementation and a revitalised global partnership for sustainable development. Mobilising sustained and predictable financing from various sources will be essential to the achievement of our development goals. To this end, we call for scaled-up support from the IFIs, accompanied by peer learning. We recognise the initiatives by the IMF and WBG to support the implementation and financing of the 2030 Agenda, in line with country priorities. We urge their management to define a clear action plan to help countries in the implementation of such complex agenda. We also call for strengthened efforts by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to catalyse private financing. ""We underscore the vital need to increase the quantity and quality of investments in infrastructure to support growth, contribute to poverty reduction, and promote environmental resilience. Efforts by both the public and private sector, at the country and international levels, are necessary given large infrastructure deficits and financing requirements. We call on the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to strengthen their roles in supporting infrastructure development and financing, including at regional levels. We also call on the IFIs to support developing countries to have greater access to external infrastructure financing while maintaining debt sustainability. We look forward to the operationalisation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank (NDB). ""To enhance the ability of MDBs to finance infrastructure investments and support development, we call on MDBs to ensure adequate capitalisation and to optimise their balance sheets, while maintaining financial integrity. In this context, we also call for further work and dialogue to ensure that methodologies employed by credit rating agencies to gauge the MDBs' financial strength, which is the basis of their credit ratings, take into account the specific characteristics of the MDBs and appropriately assess their risks. ""Concessional resources will continue to be an important source of financing for development in the low income countries. Fulfilment of existing commitments from advanced economies and ensuring the best development impact of official development assistance (ODA) must remain key priorities. We note the proposal by the WBG to leverage existing International Development Association's (IDA) resources but we stress that it is critical to preserve its regular replenishments and concessionality as core elements of IDA. This measure should not negatively impact the voice and participation of developing countries in the WBG's governance. Increasing the participation of developing countries in policy setting will help ensure development impact informed by experience of the use of IDA resources. We also welcome the review of IDA's non-concessional borrowing policy for low income countries, with a view to increasing flexibility in their access to financial markets. We look forward to the review of the IMF/WB framework for Debt Sustainability Assessments. We also urge the international community to work with small and climate vulnerable developing countries in finding solutions for improving their debt sustainability, including by enhancing their access to concessional financing. ""We are concerned about the adverse impacts of Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) and harmful tax avoidances, especially by multi-national firms, on the sustainability of public finances, particularly in African countries. We consider policies that combat IFFs as vital to raising revenues and supporting the attainment of the SDGs, consistent with agreement in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This is made even more urgent in the context of uncertainty with respect to future ODA flows and the investments necessary to support the post-2015 agenda. We welcome the proposed work on illicit flows by the WBG and the IMF as well as their commitment to assist countries to build capabilities in developing domestic policies and practices that reduce such flows. International tax cooperation is an important complement to our domestic resource mobilisation efforts. We call for the participation of developing countries on an equal footing in the implementation of G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project and Automatic Exchange of Information initiative. We welcome the commitment of the IMF and the WBG to deepen the dialogue with developing countries and help increase their voice on international taxation issues. We also welcome the U.N. Tax Committee's efforts to encourage dialogue among tax authorities worldwide. Asset recovery and repatriation of funds to countries of origin also represent an important component of global cooperation. ""We are concerned about the unintended consequences of anti-money laundering and combating of financing terrorism standards on the de-risking behavior of banks and loss of correspondent banking relationships in many developing countries. We call on the IMF, the World Bank, and the Financial Stability Board to develop appropriate guidance on how to properly implement the risk-based approach rather than seeking to avoid money laundering and financing terrorism risks by wholesale termination of entire classes of customers through de-risking, which contributes to financial exclusion. ""In order to address incentives for holdout behavior that seriously undermines sovereign debt restructuring processes, we recognize as positive steps the sustained progress with regards to the contractual provisions for debt issuance as well as the recent passage by the U.N. General Assembly of the resolution on the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes. We also encourage sovereign issuers to include enhanced Collective Action Clauses and the modified pari passu clauses. ""We look forward to the outcomes of U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change's 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). We stress the importance of incorporating environmental sustainability into growth and development strategies, while respecting the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. ""We note the ongoing work on the review of the World Bank's safeguard framework. We underscore that the framework should give a greater role to the use of country systems and effectively address the concerns of the borrower countries. Additionally, the consultations should consider the implementability of standards and their implications in terms of cost and time. We call on the Bank to allocate the resources necessary to assist in building countries' capacity to implement the forthcoming safeguards framework. We welcome the Bank's new procurement guidelines and call on the WB to build capacities in client countries to support implementation of the guidelines"". \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria131","6 questions African policymakers must answer now by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala","March 17, 2016 Thursday","PM News","The Africa rising story of the past decade, fueled by 5 per cent average annual growth, is in danger of faltering, due to the impact of global uncertainty, depressed commodity prices, and weakly performing economies like China. Don't be lulled by the IMF's 2016 forecast: yes 4 percent growth will outperform global expectations, but continued commodity price volatility and global uncertainty are giving rise to a fresh bout of Afro-pessimism. To change the narrative, and - more importantly - the reality it describes, African policymakers must urgently answer these six questions. 1. How do we ensure steady financing for our significant needs for sustainable development in an increasingly uncertain global environment? This is perhaps the fundamental question. Slowing growth and low commodity prices will be around for the next few years, causing an inevitable, but hopefully temporary, macroeconomic setback. This increases vulnerability to a retrenchment in external finance. Several African countries have issued Eurobonds (to the tune of $21 billion during 2013-15) and foreign investors hold a growing share of domestically issued debt. Foreign direct investment, which tends to be concentrated in natural resource sectors, is also likely to pull back. A cutback in external funding will put badly-need infrastructure investment and social programs on hold, dealing a blow to long-run growth. African countries need to work with the donor community to avert such a situation. Economic diversification, creating jobs and tackling inequality, which are discussed below, are a vital part of the long-run challenge in Africa and also feed into two key global achievements of 2015: the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September and the agreement on climate change at COP21 in Paris in December. But diversification requires well-developed infrastructure, telecommunications, power, roads, rail, water, etc. The World Bank estimates Africa's infrastructure financing needs alone at US$93 billion annually. Climate-friendly and sustainable infrastructure will cost even more. But Africa offers the best opportunity for low-carbon, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure development because so much is greenfield and still to be built. Directing the necessary financing from international public and private sectors into African infrastructure development can reap important positive externalities for the whole world. Africans rightly argue that they are victims, and not perpetrators, of today's climate-related challenges. So will the international community rise to the occasion? The reality is weak global growth, coupled with domestic challenges on unemployment and immigration, makes it unlikely that developed countries will fully honor promises for additional financing to implement the post-2015 development agenda. Africans will have to mobilize the majority of their own resources. In fact the New Climate Economy estimates that 50-80 percent of the resources required for the development of sustainable infrastructure will have to come from countries' own domestic resources. This means African countries must ensure a quantum leap in domestic resource mobilization (DRM). The opportunity clearly exists to substantially increase tax and other revenue efforts, including limiting tax evasion and illicit financial flows. Across sub-Saharan Africa, tax revenues account for less than a fifth of GDP, while they correspond to over a third in OECD countries. African countries will need to almost double their tax revenues to help finance the SDGs. The good news is that tax revenues on the continent are growing rapidly. Through reforms between 1990 and 2004, Ghana raised tax revenues from 11 to 22 percent of its GDP, for example. Admittedly this is difficult. Raising non-oil tax revenues was something we saw as an opportunity in Nigeria and struggled with. What is needed is a significant improvement in capacity, systems and processes in these countries - a worthwhile investment for governments and a small fraction of aid budgets that donors can support. In addition, DRM should also involve leveraging public resources innovatively to tap private-sector resources. Estimates indicate approximately US$380 billion in total pension assets under management in just 10 African countries, and these resources are growing rapidly. Between 2008 and 2013, Nigeria's pension industry grew from US$7 to US$25 billion. In Ghana, the pension industry is expected to grow 400 per cent between 2014 and 2018. 2. How do we truly diversify our economies? Diversification has become a slogan. Everyone talks about it but the debate on how to truly diversify is shallow. The discourse reflects lazy thinking as if diversification could happen in just a few years. The vision of what needs to be done is often truncated into the short time frame of politicians, instead of carefully laying out the various stages to achieve a truly diverse economy - notwithstanding the abundance of 10-, 20-, and 30-year-long economic plans that are crafted in almost every country, and then gather dust. There are plenty of models to follow: Dubai, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and South Korea are admired by Africans as economies that have managed to transform themselves. But the discussion often stops there without recognizing that Dubai, for example, started more than three decades ago to ask the question: What should life be like after oil? And it set out to implement a step-by-step vision of a services economy, putting infrastructure and incentives in place to build up financial services, tourism, medical services, real estate, media, arts, and culture. Singapore and South Korean are no less inspiring because they had few or no natural resources to rely on. What these countries also had was leadership that was relentless decade after decade in pursuing the diversification and transformation of their economies - either through entrenched but benign dictators or democracies in which generations of leaders and citizens agreed on a vision of a broad-based economy. Sub-Saharan Africa has the foundation for diversified growth that several of these trailblazers did not: value-added agriculture and agro industry, processing and transformation of mineral resources, petrochemical complexes, manufacturing of durable and consumer goods, tourism and entertainment, and an emerging information technology sector. For donors, diversification delivers on several critical SDGs: Goal 1 to end poverty Goal 8 to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 9 to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 10 to reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 13 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts The journey toward diversification is long, but policymakers must start down this road now. 3. How do we improve the quality of growth and create jobs? Recent growth in Africa did not bring a corresponding increase in jobs. Except in a few countries, like Nigeria, where growth actually occurred in the non-oil sectors, growth in most African countries was linked to their commodity sector. And growth benefited only a few, leaving, especially, young people and women behind. In fact inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient (with 0 denoting perfect equality and 100 perfect inequality) rose in several African countries between 2006 and 2013. Country 2006 2013 S/Africa 57.8 63.1 Nigeria 43.7 48.8 Rwanda 28.9 50.8 Ghana 40.8 42.8 Tanzania 34.6 37.6 Source: UNDP World Development Reports for 2006 and 2013 Policymakers should answer this: is growth occurring in sectors that create jobs such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services? Who is left behind? How can taxation and income redistribution redirect resources better, and include those at the bottom of the ladder via social safety nets? These were questions we were starting to ask and answer about our own growth story in Nigeria. The idea was not to question whether we needed growth but to improve the quality of growth. 4. What type and quality of human resources do we need to underpin our development aspirations? As African economies diversify, matching skills to emerging job opportunities will be critical. Many Africans feel that despite the progress made by the continent on health and education indicators under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), our education and health systems are broken and need fixing. On a continent where 70 percent of the population is already under 30, and that is home to half the worldwide total of primary-school-aged children not in school, basic reading, writing and technology skills, followed by vocational, technical, and entrepreneurial training, must be priorities. Nigeria, especially, should act decisively here - Africa's most populous country also has the largest number of children out of school, at 8.7 million in 2010. But we must simultaneously strengthen weak health-care systems to tackle endemic diseases that sap productivity (such as malaria), and to provide preventative care for adults and, especially, for children (through vaccinations and routine immunizations). Stronger health-care systems will also help the world cope with future epidemics: the World Bank estimates the devastation wrought to the economies of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone by the Ebola virus at US$2.2 billion, or 16 percent of the combined GDP (2014) of the three countries. Sierra Leone's growth rate for 2014, for example, was forecast at 11.3 percent prior to the crisis, but fell to 4 percent. The impact on other African economies due to the neighborhood effect was also significant. 5. How do we trade better with each other? African goods and services accounted for just 16 percent of trade within Africa in 2013, and just over 3 percent of world trade. One problem is what we are making. Most African countries produce the same type of commodities, and trade them with very little value added. The continent's industrialization drive, very much a part of the African Union's 2063 development agenda, needs to focus on the issue of specialization to enhance inter-African trade. Industrializing through trade was the focus of the Economic Commission for Africa's 2015 Economic Report on Africa. Countries with the requisite manufacturing base should consider what can be processed or manufactured, and traded with others. One encouraging signal is the growing volume of intra-African investment, which rose as a share of the continent's overall foreign direct investment from 8 percent in 2003 to close to 23 percent in 2013. This could be harnessed to achieve greater industrialization and increased trade of differentiated goods and services between African countries. This can be a virtuous circle which adds value and volume to Africa's trade with the world. But there is another problem to consider: logistics. Policymakers must make it easier to move goods across borders, by improving connectivity between countries, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles and administrative costs. For example, road transport tariffs across Africa are estimated at US$0.05 to US$0.13 per ton-kilometer, compared to the average of US$0.01 to US$0.05 for all developing countries. This must come down so Africans can more easily trade with each other. There are some examples of significant improvements. The East and Southern African regional blocs , COMESA and SADC, have made some important gains in this area. For example, paved roads along the central corridor connecting the ports of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to Bujumbura, Burundi, increased from 57 percent in 2006 to 87 percent in 2010. There have also been efforts to improve rail infrastructure to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The African Development Bank estimates that the ongoing Rift Valley Railway project between Mombasa, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda, would double the volume of trade while reducing marginal costs by 30 percent. 6. How do we focus on good economic management? Africa offers incredible opportunity for diversified economies based on low-carbon, sustainable infrastructure. We can meet the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement - indeed, we must - and we can change the Africa failing narrative. But African leaders must answer these development challenges now.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria132","Buhari - Taking Sambisa, Rescuing Chibok Girls Our Last Major Task","May 15, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","President Muhammadu Buhari stated at the Second Regional Security Summit yesterday in Abuja that the Nigerian armed forces had considerably degraded the Boko Haram terrorist sect. Buhari, however, stressed that dislodging the group from the Sambisa forest in Borno State, where its fighters are currently holed up following heavy bombardment by the military, and freeing the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls were the major tasks still left. This was as the European Union pledged to support the Multinational Joint Taskforce, a sub-regional security outfit, with 50 million Euros. Vice President and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Federica Mogherini, disclosed this at the Abuja summit. The MNJTF was reactivated in the wake of the Boko Haram insurgency to coordinate the fight against the sect and other acts of terrorism within the West African sub-region. The United States Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Anthony Blinken, told the conference that his country had contributed over $250 million to the on-going fight against terrorism, in addition to other resources. The Second Regional Security Summit in Abuja was attended by President of France, Francois Hollande, and seven regional leaders, including the presidents of Chad, Cameroun, Niger, Benin, Senegal and Gabon. Though, other Western countries and institutions were represented at the summit, Hollande was the only Western leader present, underscoring France's crucial involvement in the fight against terrorism in the continent. Hollande had hosted the First Regional Security Summit in Paris on May 17, 2014. Speaking at the summit yesterday, Buhari said he had significantly fulfilled his promise to rout Boko Haram, which has wreaked havoc in the Nigeria's North-east since 2009, and spread its activities to countries within the Lake Chad Basin. He said, ""When I started, our first task was to improve our security infrastructure and strengthen our regional and international alliances. We have degraded Boko Haram and squeezed them into a small enclave in Sambisa forest. What remains is the dislodgement of terrorists from their hideouts from the Sambisa forest and liberate the Chibok girls and others. Boko Haram now resorts to hit and run tactics."" Buhari stated that the country's military operations against terrorists had followed acceptable international standards. ""We have not only observed human rights and international humanitarian law in our military operations, we have also diligently implemented several proactive programmes. Today, we have achieved significant outcomes. Boko Haram is no longer a cohesive force, but a group of self-seeking individuals pursuing personal glory,"" he said. The president listed some of the feats recorded at both bilateral and multilateral levels since the Paris summit in 2014 to include recovery of all the territories occupied by the terrorist group; establishment of special military units by Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon to prosecute the war on terror; admission of Benin Republic to the group to strengthen the regional coalition; establishment of the Regional Intelligence Fusion in Abuja and its operation; and strengthening border security among member states. Buhari said the regional alliance had also set up the Inter-Regional Coordination Centre (ICC), based in Yaounde, Cameroon, under the aegis of the Gulf of Guinea Commission (GGC), to coordinate and disseminate intelligence and security information to all member states. It has reactivated the MNJTF with 8,500 officers and men, drawn from Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin, with headquarters in Ndjamena, Chad, he said. He stressed, ""These achievements would not have been possible without the steadfast support, invaluable contributions and sacrifices of my brothers, the Presidents of Cameroun, Chad, Niger as well as the Republic of Benin. I am convinced that the great solidarity and good neighbourliness that have been displayed by all countries in the region would be a model for other regions faced with similar challenges. ""Our hope, therefore, is that this meeting would be a turning-point for our collective efforts to achieve a conflict free, peaceful and stable region, where development and good governance thrive."" Buhari vowed to ensure that the Chibok girls and others held by Boko Haram were rescued. The girls had been kidnapped from their hotel in April 2014 while they were preparing to write the Senior School Certificate Examination. ""Let me reiterate our firm commitment to safely rescue and re-unite the abducted Chibok girls with their families. Our government will not spare any effort to achieve this important mission,"" he vowed. He said the MNJTF would be strengthened to rid the region of the last vestiges of Boko Haram. On the need to address the root causes of terrorism and articulate a post-conflict development plan, Buhari said, ""Only by bringing development to the areas affected by the insurgency and by protecting the victims and the IDPs and refugees, can we assure genuine recovery for conflict devastated areas."" According to the president, the long-term development of the Lake Chad Region is crucial to reducing the high poverty rate in the basin, a major factor in the recruitment of terrorists. ""Implementing the Lake Chad Development Resilience Action Plan (LCDCRAP), which was submitted to donor countries and organisations at the Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ) side event on the Lake Chad, therefore, remains a vital challenge. The total cost of the short and medium term development of the Lake Chad Region is estimated to be in the region of \€ 916 million,"" he disclosed. Fielding questions from journalists during the post-even press conference, Buhari spoke on the Civilian JTF, a vigilante group helping in the fight against Boko Haram, and the link between the terrorist group and ISIS. He stated, ""Civilian JTF is an initiative of the states where Boko Haram is prevalent. So they have volunteered to assist in stabilising the security situation. Disarming them will not be a problem and for some of them that meet the criteria we can be trained and absorbed in some sort of formal security set up."" The president added, ""Up till now we don't have intelligence if ISIS has been able to send weapons and even money to the Boko Haram."" Hollande, during the press conference, pledged full cooperation with Nigeria and other countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, especially, in the area of intelligence sharing and resources. ""We acknowledged that Boko Haram has been significantly defeated. However, we must be wary as they will increasingly resort to suicide bombing, which will require a lot of intelligence to tackle,"" the French president said. In a similar vein, the president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, called for closer cooperation among the African countries and world leaders in dealing with the terrorism. ""Africa has to close ranks and work together if we are to achieve a conflict free region. Also violent extremism, especially, amongst youths usually found expression in the place of unemployment and social instability,"" Bongo said. The United States Deputy Secretary of State, Blinken, said, ""The fight against Boko Haram is a fight for the future and stability of the region,"" advising that the summit should develop a comprehensive strategy to defeat the terrorists not only in the country but also across the region. He added, ""Liberating the communities from Boko Haram is not enough, we have to stabilise and rebuild them and as well as reviving their economic activities. None of us can afford a lost generation and that is why we have given over $250 million to the region in the last two years."" Blinken said, ""US is also committed to the rescue and return of Chibok girls and others kidnapped by group. Boko Haram can be defeated through the people, by investing in young girls as well as boys."" The British Minister of Foreign Affairs and Common Wealth Office, Phil Hammon, said combating terrorism was a global challenge that required cautious optimism because of its complex nature. Hammon also expressed worry over increasing links and cooperation between Boko Haram and ISIS, noting that both groups do not represent the true teachings of Islam. He said, ""Boko Haram claims that they propagate and proclaim Islam. They do not. It's an alarming of the growing cooperation between Daesh and Boko Haram. This presents a dangerous alliance. We are however, dedicated to cooperate with you to defeat these terrorists that have posed. ""We must be prepared for a long war because defeating Boko Haram extremism could be a complex and long one as we have experienced with Daesh in Iraq. We have trained 1,500 personnels for deployment for the counter-insurgency operations in the North Eats. The UK personnels are also on ground to assist with our experience in dealing with IEDS."" Mogherini said the EU would contribute \€ 50 million to the MNJTF to assist in defeating Boko Haram in the North-east and the Lake Chad region. She stated, ""The national contingents operate bilaterally and as part of the MNJTF have since been deployed and are conducting operations. The force however, needs the necessary infrastructure and transport and communication assets to allow it effectively coordinate and command operations. ""In the context of the EU-AU partnership, as reconfirmed during the donor conference organised by the African Union Commission early February 2016, the European Commission adopted in April 2016, a financing decision setting aside \€ 50 million from the African Peace Facility in support of the MNJTF against Boko Haram."" \"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria133","Buhari shelves publishing looters' list despite pressure","May 30, 2016 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Lai Mohammed to disclose recovered loot this week Leader vows to arrest N'Delta Avengers, sponsors Nigerians who had expected a comprehensive list of the alleged treasury looters as promised by President Muhammadu Buhari were disappointed yesterday. The president failed to make good his promise. However, he directed the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture to publish the list. Later in the night, the Minister of Information and Culture said during a television programme that he would disclose the recovered loot this week. Buhari had, on May 14, during his recent trip to London, the United Kingdom to attend the anti-corruption conference put together by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, pledged in an interview, to avail Nigerians of details of the alleged treasury looters, including where stolen assets were being kept. ""So far, what has come out, what has been recovered in whatever currency from each ministry, department and individual, I intend on the 29th to speak on this because all Nigerians are getting from the mass media is the number of people arrested either by the EFCC, DSS. But we want to make a comprehensive report on May 29"", Buhari said while attending the anti-corruption summit in London. But during a special nation-wide media broadcast to mark his first year in office as president, Buhari failed to give the details, citing the cumbersome nature of tracing the looters, merely repeating his previous position that his administration was grappling with bureaucratic hurdles that make it difficult for stolen assets to be recovered from foreign jurisdictions. His words: ""We are also engaged in making recoveries of stolen assets some of which are in different jurisdictions. The processes of recovery can be tedious and time-consuming, but today I can confirm that thus far: significant amount of assets have been recovered. A considerable portion of these are at different stages of recovery."" Rather than personally speak on the matter and provide specific details as promised, the president only said he had directed the Ministry of Information to periodically publish details on the assets recovered so far. The president admitted that his government had of recent come under pressure to publicly substantiate his claims that billions of dollars have been recovered through the administration's intensified war against graft. He attributed the widespread poverty in the country to what he identified as largely certain policies of the Federal Government which were ""necessary pills"" to swallow in order to have a better future. Buhari who announced the official inauguration of his administration's Social Protection Programme, lamented that the Nigerian society had been neglecting the poor and victimising the weak. He said the social protection programme would seek to start the process of lifting many citizens out of poverty, while at the same time creating the opportunity for many to fend for themselves. ""For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimises the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom. A society that fails to recognise that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen, 'poverty is not just lack of money ' ""So, today, I am happy to formally launch, by far the most ambitious social protection programme in our history.'' He, therefore, expressed optimism that the programme would lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty while at the same time creating the opportunity for people to fend for themselves. Accordingly, he said, N500 billion has been appropriated in the 2016 budget for social intervention programmes in five key areas. He said that his administration was committed to providing job creation opportunities for 500,000 Nigerians to work as teachers and employ 100,000 artisans across the nation. His words: ""5.5 million children are to be provided with nutritious meals through our school feeding programme to improve learning outcomes, as well as enrolment and completion rates. The conditional cash transfer scheme will provide financial support for up to one million vulnerable beneficiaries, and complement the enterprise programme which will target up to one million market women; four hundred and sixty thousand artisans; and two hundred thousand agricultural workers nationwide."" He said this particular programme would target up to one million market women, 460,000 artisans and 200,000 agricultural workers, nationwide. President Buhari further disclosed that, through a education grant scheme, the Federal Government would encourage students studying sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics as well as lay a foundation for human capital development for the next generation. On the Niger Delta, the president said his administration was committed to implementing the United Nations Environment Programme, (UNEP) report, noting that he believed the way forward was to take a sustainable approach to address the issues that affect the delta communities. He noted that re-engineering the amnesty programmes was an example of this. He stressed that the recent spate of attacks by militants disrupting oil and power installations would not distract the administration from engaging leaders in the region in addressing Niger Delta problems, warning that if the militants and vandals were testing the government's resolve, they were much mistaken, saying, ""We shall apprehend the perpetrators and their sponsors and bring them to justice. ""The policy measures and actions taken so far are not to be seen as some experiment in governance. We are fully aware that those vested interests who have held Nigeria back for so long will not give up without a fight. They will sow divisions, sponsor vile press criticisms at home and abroad, incite the public in an effort to create chaos rather than relinquish the vice-like grip they have held on Nigeria."" The president condemned the activities of illegal miners in the country, saying that a special security team had been set up to check the menace. He stressed that the security team was saddled with the task of protecting the nation's mining assets. He also revealed that special measures would be in place to protect miners in their work environment. According to him, the Ministry of Solid Mineral Resources has produced a roadmap where Nigeria would work closely with the World Bank and major international investors to ensure best practices and due diligence in the mining sector. On security, the president commended members of the Armed Forces for their efforts in checking the menace of Boko Haram insurgency in the North Eastern states of the country. ""I would like to pay a special tribute to our gallant men and women of the armed forces who are in harm's way so that the rest of us can live and go about our business in safety. Their work is almost done. The nation owes them a debt of gratitude,'' he said. Buhari described the last one year of the administration as being a year of triumph, consolidation, pains and achievements, adding ""By age, instinct and experience, my preference is to look forward, to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead and rededicate the administration to the task of fixing Nigeria."" On putting the economy back on track, he noted: ""The measures we must take, may lead to hardships. The problems Nigerians have faced over the last year have been many and varied. But the real challenge for this government has been reconstructing the spine of the Nigerian economy."" According to the president, the good news about low prices of crude oil is that it has provided the nation with an opportunity to restructure its economy and diversify. He said: ""We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestock, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce."" He assured the citizens that the ""Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN) would offer more fiscal incentives for business that prove capable of manufacturing products that are internationally competitive. We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria."" To assist the women, the president said: ""I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict."" On the foreign scene, Buhari said: ""We want to assure our neighbours, friends and development partners that Nigeria is firmly committed to democratic principles. We are ready partners in combating terrorism, cyber-crimes, control of communicable diseases and protection of the environment. ""Following on the Paris Agreement, COP 21 , we are fully committed to halting and reversing desertification. Elsewhere, we will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which I referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report. ""We are grateful to the international community notably France, the U.S., UK and China for their quick response in helping to tackle the recent Ebola outbreak in our sub-region. We also acknowledge the humanity shown by the Italian and German governments in the treatment of boat people, many fleeing from our sub-region because of lack of economic opportunity. We thank all our partners especially several countries in the EU. ""We appreciate the valuable work that the UN agencies, particularly UNICEF, ICRC, the World Food Programme have been doing. We must also appreciate the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund and Educate A Child of Qatar for the excellent work in our health, education and other sectors."" He reaffirmed his administration's belief in democracy as the form of government that best assures the active participation and actual benefit of the people, noting that despite the many years of hardship and disappointment the people of this nation have proved inherently good, industrious tolerant, patient and generous. ""The past years have witnessed huge flows of oil revenues. From 2010 average oil prices were $100 per barrel. But economic and security conditions were deteriorating. We campaigned and won the election on the platform of restoring security, tackling corruption and restructuring the economy. On our arrival, the oil price had collapsed to as low as $30 per barrel and we found nothing had been kept for the rainy day. Oil prices have been declining since 2014 but due to the neglect of the past, the country was not equipped to halt the economy from declining. ""The infrastructure, notably rail, power, roads were in a decrepit state. All the four refineries were in a state of disrepair, the pipelines and depots neglected. Huge debts owed to contractors and suppliers had accumulated. Twenty-seven states could not pay salaries for months. In the north-east, Boko Haram had captured 14 local governments, driven the local authorities out, hoisted their flags. Elsewhere, insecurity was palpable; corruption and impunity were the order of the day. In short, we inherited a state near collapse.""

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria134","Buhari to Nigerians - Let's Fix Our Nation Together","May 30, 2016","Leadership (Abuja)","President Muhammadu Buhari has asked Nigerians to join hands with him to fix the nation. In his Democracy Day speech yesterday, President Buhari lamented that despite the years of plenty in which crude oil sold for more than $100 per barrel, economic and security deteriorated in the country. He said, ""It is one year today since our administration came into office. It has been a year of triumph, consolidation, pains and achievements. By age, instinct and experience, my preference is to look forward, to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead and rededicate the administration to the task of fixing Nigeria. ""But I believe we can also learn from the obstacles we have overcome and the progress we made thus far, to help strengthen the plans that we have in place to put Nigeria back on the path of progress."" President Buhari also reaffirmed his belief in democracy as the form of government that best assures the active participation and actually benefits the people. He said that despite the many years of hardship and disappointment, Nigerians had proved to be inherently good, industrious, tolerant, patient and generous. ""The past years have witnessed huge flows of oil revenues. From 2010, average oil prices were $100 per barrel, but economic and security conditions were deteriorating. ""We campaigned and won the election on the platform of restoring security, tackling corruption and restructuring the economy,"" he noted. The president noted that, on his assumption of office, the oil price had collapsed to as low as $30 per barrel, which was aggravated by his discovery that nothing had been saved for the rainy day. ""Oil prices have been declining since 2014 but due to the neglect of the past, the country was not equipped to halt the economy from declining. The infrastructure, notably rail, power, roads, were in a decrepit state. All the four refineries were in a state of disrepair, the pipelines and depots neglected,"" he added. The situation, he further stated, was worsened by huge accumulated debts owed to contractors and suppliers, with 27 states unable to pay workers' salaries for months. The president also recalled that in the North-East, Boko Haram had captured 14 local government areas, driven the local authorities out, and hoisted their flags. He said: ""Elsewhere, insecurity was palpable; corruption and impunity were the order of the day. In short, we inherited a state near collapse. ""Our problems as a government are like that of a farmer who in a good season harvests ten bags of produce. The proceeds enable him to get by for the rest of the year. However, this year, he could only manage three bags from his farm. He must now think of other ways to make ends meet."" Speaking on the strategies his administration had adopted to counter the slide in public governance, he said: ""We reinforced and galvanized our armed forces with new leadership and resources. We marshalled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram."" He also insisted that the EFCC was given the freedom to pursue corrupt officials and the judiciary was alerted on what Nigerians expect of them in the fight against corruption. ""On the economy, in particular foreign exchange and fuel shortages, our plan is to save foreign exchange by fast-tracking the repair of the refineries and producing most of our fuel requirements at home. ""And by growing more food in Nigeria, mainly rice, wheat and sugar, we will save billions of dollars in foreign exchange and drastically reduce our food import bill."" On possible devaluation of the naira, he said, ""We resolved to keep the Naira steady as, in the past, devaluation had done dreadful harm to the Nigerian economy. ""Furthermore, I supported the monetary authority's decision to ensure alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We shall keep a close look on how the recent measures affect the Naira and the economy. President Buhari further revealed that the last 12 months had been spent collaborating with all arms of government to revive the nation's institutions so that they are more efficient and purposeful, adding that his administration had stopped leakages in the system in order to cut the cost of governance. According to him, ""An important first step has been to get our housekeeping right. So we have reduced the extravagant spending of the past. We started boldly with the treasury single account, stopping the leakages in public expenditure ""We then identified 43,000 ghost workers through the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). That represents pay packets totalling N4.2 billion stolen every month. In addition, we will save N23 billion per annum from official travelling and sitting allowances alone."" Speaking on the budget, he said the budgeting system had been restructured and made more transparent and effective. ""I am glad to tell you now we not only have a budget, but, more importantly, we have a budget process that is more transparent, more inclusive and more closely tied to our development priorities than in the recent past. Thirty per cent of the expenditure in this budget is devoted to capital items."" On the hardship faced by Nigerians due to the fuel price increase, he said: ""In respect of the economy, I would like to directly address you on the very painful but inevitable decisions we had to make in the last few weeks, specifically on the pump price of fuel and the more flexible exchange rate policy announced by the central bank. ""It is even more painful for me that a major producer of crude oil with four refineries that once exported refined products is today having to import all of its domestic needs. This is what corruption and mismanagement has done to us and that is why we must fight these ills,"" he asserted. Buhari stated that this step - to remove fuel subsidy - was taken only after protracted consideration of its pros and cons, after it was comprehensive investigation revealed that the former pricing mechanism was unsustainable. On the recovery of looted funds, he said, ""We are also engaged in making recoveries of stolen assets, some of which are in different jurisdictions. ""The processes of recovery can be tedious and time-consuming, but today I can confirm that, thus far, significant amounts of assets have been recovered."" The president did not, however, name the looters as he had promised earlier but he said that the full details of the recovered looted funds would be released by the ministry of information. ""A considerable portion of these are at different stages of recovery. Full details of the status and categories of the assets will now be published by the Ministry of Information and updated periodically. ""When forfeiture formalities are completed, these monies will be credited to the treasury and be openly and transparently used in funding developmental projects and the public will be informed."" On the Niger Delta, he said ""we are committed to implementing the United Nations Environment Programme report and are advancing clean-up operations. ""I believe the way forward is to take a sustainable approach to address the issues that affect the delta communities. Re-engineering the amnesty programmes is an example of this."" President Buhari maintained that the recent spate of attacks by militants disrupting oil and power installations will not distract his administration from engaging leaders in the region in addressing Niger Delta problems.

They will sow divisions, sponsor vile press criticisms at home and abroad, incite the public in an effort to create chaos rather than relinquish the vice-like grip they have held on Nigeria."" He further explained that the policy measures and actions taken so far are not to be seen as some experiment in governance, adding that the economic misfortune the country is experiencing in the form of very low oil prices had provided it with an opportunity to restructure its economy and diversify its economic base. ""We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestock production, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce,"" he explained. According to him, the Central Bank of Nigeria will offer more fiscal incentives for businesses that manufacture products that are internationally competitive. ""We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, the first steps along the path of self-sufficiency in rice, wheat and sugar - big users of our scarce foreign exchange - have been taken. The Labour Intensive Farming Enterprise will boost the economy and ensure inclusive growth in long neglected communities."" He said special intervention funds through the Bank of Agriculture will provide targeted support. ""Concerns remain about rising cost of foods such as maize, rice, millet, beans and garri. Farmers tell me that they are worried about the cost of fertilizers, pesticides and the absence of extension services,"" the president noted, adding that the federal and state governments were on the same page in tackling these hurdles in the effort to increase food production and, ultimately, food security. President Buhari also expressed his appreciation for the increasing role that women are playing in revitalizing the agricultural sector. ""Modern farming is still hard and heavy work and I salute our Nigerian women in sharing this burden. In this respect I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved, to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict."" On solid minerals, he said, ""The minister has produced a roadmap where we will work closely with the World Bank and major international investors to ensure through best practices and due diligence that we choose the right partners. ""Illegal mining remains a problem and we have set up a special security team to protect our assets. Special measures will be in place to protect miners in their work environment."" The president insisted that his government has plans to alleviate the suffering of the poor. ""For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimizes the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom. A society that fails to recognize that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen ""poverty is not just lack of money. It is not having the capability to realise one's full potential as a human being. ""So, today, I am happy to formally launch, by far the most ambitious social protection programme in our history, a programme that both seeks to start the process of lifting many from poverty, while at the same time creating the opportunity for people to fend for themselves.

He assured that his administration will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which he referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report. ""Fellow citizens let me end on a happy note. To the delight of all, two of the abducted Chibok girls have regained their freedom. During the last one year, not a single day passed without my agonizing about these girls. Our efforts have centred on negotiations to free them safely from their mindless captors. We are still pursuing that course. Their safety is of paramount concern to me and, I am sure, to most Nigerians. I am very worried about the conditions those still captured might be in. ""Today I re-affirm our commitment to rescuing our girls. We will never stop until we bring them home safely. As I said before, no girl should be put through the brutality of forced marriage and every Nigerian girl has the right to an education and a life choice. ""I thank you and appeal to you to continue supporting the government's efforts to fix Nigeria,"" he concluded. List of corrupt persons out by Wednesday The minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, yesterday explained why President Muhammadu Buhari didn't not release the list of corrupt persons as he had earlier promised. Mr. Mohammed said the list would be released on Wednesday this week. Mr. Buhari had on May 14 in London promised to provide specific details of stolen asset by former public officials. ""So far, what has come out, what has been recovered in whatever currency from each ministries, departments and individuals, I intend on the 29th to speak on this because all Nigerians are getting from the mass media because of the number of people arrested either by the EFCC, DSS. But we want to make a comprehensive report on the 29th,"" Mr. Buhari had said. \"

Elsewhere, insecurity was palpable; corruption and impunity were the order of the day. In short, we inherited a state near collapse. ""On the economic front, all oil dependent countries, Nigeria included, have been struggling since the drop in prices. Many oil rich states have had to take tough decisions similar to what we are doing. The world, Nigeria included has been dealing with the effects of three significant and simultaneous global shocks starting in 2014: A 70% drop in oil prices. Global growth slowdown. Normalization of monetary policy by the United States federal reserve. ""Our problems as a government are like that of a farmer who in a good season harvests ten bags of produce. The proceeds enable him to get by for rest of the year. However, this year he could only manage 3 bags from his farm. He must now think of other ways to make ends meet. ""From day one, we purposely set out to correct our condition, to change Nigeria. We reinforced and galvanized our armed forces with new leadership and resources. We marshaled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram. By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants had been routed by our gallant armed forces. Our immediate focus is for a gradual and safe return of internally displaced persons in safety and dignity and for the resumption of normalcy in the lives of people living in these areas.

Furthermore, I supported the monetary authority's decision to ensure alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We shall keep a close look on how the recent measures affect the Naira and the economy. But we cannot get away from the fact that a strong currency is predicated on a strong economy. And a strong economy pre-supposes an industrial productive base and a steady export market. The measures we must take, may lead to hardships. The problems Nigerians have faced over the last year have been many and varied. But the real challenge for this government has been reconstructing the spine of the Nigerian state. The last twelve months have been spent collaborating with all arms of government to revive our institutions so that they are more efficient and fit for purpose: That means a bureaucracy better able to develop and deliver policy That means an independent judiciary, above suspicion and able to defend citizen's rights and dispense justice equitably. That means a legislature that actually legislates effectively and Above all; that means political parties and politicians committed to serving the nigerian people rather than themselves. ""These are the pillars of the state on which democracy can take root and thrive. But only if they are strong and incorruptible. Accordingly, we are working very hard to introduce some vital structural reforms in the way we conduct government business and lay a solid foundation on which we can build enduring change. ""An important first step has been to get our housekeeping right. So we have reduced the extravagant spending of the past. We started boldly with the treasury single account, stopping the leakages in public expenditure. ""Furthermore, the efficiency unit will cut costs and eliminate duplications in ministries and departments. Every little saving helps. The reduction in the number of ministries and work on restructuring and rationalization of the MDAs is well underway. When this work is complete we will have a leaner, more efficient public service that is fit for the purpose of changing nigeria for the good and for good. ""As well as making savings, we have changed the way public money is spent. In all my years as a public servant, I have never come across the practice of padding budgets. I am glad to tell you now we not only have a budget, but more importantly, we have a budget process that is more transparent, more inclusive and more closely tied to our development priorities than in the recent past. 30% of the expenditure in this budget is devoted to capital items. Furthermore, we are projecting non-oil revenues to surpass proceeds from oil. Some critics have described the budget exercise as clumsy. Perhaps. But it was an example of consensus building, which is integral to democratic government. In the end we resolved our differences. ""We have, therefore, delivered significant milestones on security, corruption and the economy. In respect of the economy, I would like to directly address you on the very painful but inevitable decisions we had to make in the last few weeks specifically on the pump price of fuel and the more flexible exchange rate policy announced by the central bank.

""We are also engaged in making recoveries of stolen assets some of which are in different jurisdictions. The processes of recovery can be tedious and time consuming, but today I can confirm that thus far: significant amount of assets have been recovered. A considerable portion of these are at different stages of recovery.

""The policy measures and actions taken so far are not to be seen as some experiment in governance. We are fully aware that those vested interests who have held Nigeria back for so long will not give up without a fight. They will sow divisions, sponsor vile press criticisms at home and abroad, incite the public in an effort to create chaos rather than relinquish the vice-like grip they have held on Nigeria. ""The economic misfortune we are experiencing in the shape of very low oil prices has provided us with an opportunity to restructure our economy and diversify. We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestocks, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce. ""Central Bank of Nigeria will offer more fiscal incentives for business that prove capable of manufacturing products that are internationally competitive. We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria. ""Meanwhile, the first steps along the path of self-sufficiency in rice, wheat and sugar - big users of our scarce foreign exchange - have been taken. The Labour Intensive Farming Enterprise will boost the economy and ensure inclusive growth in long neglected communities. Special intervention funds through the Bank of Agriculture will provide targeted support. Concerns remain about rising cost of foods such as maize, rice, millet, beans and gari. Farmers tell me that they are worried about the cost of fertilizers, pesticides and the absence of extension services. The federal and state governments are on the same page in tackling these hurdles in our efforts at increased food production and ultimately food security. ""I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the increasing role that our women are playing in revitalizing the agricultural sector. Modern farming is still hard and heavy work and I salute our Nigerian women in sharing this burden. In this respect I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict. ""With respect to solid minerals, the minister has produced a roadmap where we will work closely with the world bank and major international investors to ensure through best practices and due diligence that we choose the right partners. Illegal mining remains a problem and we have set up a special security team to protect our assets. Special measures will be in place to protect miners in their work environment. ""For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimizes the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom. A society that fails to recognize that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen "" poverty is not just lack of money. It is not having the capability to realize one's full potential as a human being."" ""So, today, I am happy to formally launch, by far the most ambitious social protection programme in our history. A programme that both seeks to start the process of lifting many from poverty, while at the same time creating the opportunity for people to fend for themselves. In this regard, Five Hundred Billion Naira has been appropriated in the 2016 budget for social intervention programmes in five key areas. We are committed to providing job creation opportunities for five hundred thousand teachers and one hundred thousand artisans across the nation. 5.5 million children are to be provided with nutritious meals through our school feeding programme to improve learning outcomes, as well as enrolment and completion rates. The conditional cash transfer scheme will provide financial support for up to one million vulnerable beneficiaries, and complement the enterprise programme - which will target up to one million market women; four hundred and sixty thousand artisans; and two hundred thousand agricultural workers, nationwide. Finally, through the education grant scheme, we will encourage students studying sciences, technology, engineering and maths, and lay a foundation for human capital development for the next generation ""I would like to pay a special tribute to our gallant men and women of the armed forces who are in harm's way so that the rest of us can live and go about our business in safety. Their work is almost done. The nation owes them a debt of gratitude. ""Abroad, we want to assure our neighbours, friends and development partners that Nigeria is firmly committed to democratic principles. We are ready partners in combating terrorism, cyber crimes, control of communicable diseases and protection of the environment. Following on the Paris Agreement, COP 21 , we are fully committed to halting and reversing desertification. Elsewhere, we will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which I referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report. ""We are grateful to the international community notably France, the US, UK and China for their quick response in helping to tackle the recent Ebola outbreak in our sub-region. We also acknowledge the humanity shown by the Italian and German governments in the treatment of boat people, many fleeing from our sub-region because of lack of economic opportunity. We thank all our partners especially several countries in the EU. ""We appreciate the valuable work that the UN agencies, particularly UNICEF, ICRC, the World Food Program have been doing. We must also appreciate the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund and Educate A Child of Qatar for the excellent work in our health, education and other sectors. ""Fellow citizens let me end on a happy note. To the delight of all, two of the abducted Chibok girls have regained their freedom. During the last one year, not a single day passed without my agonizing about these girls. Our efforts have centred around negotiations to free them safely from their mindless captors. We are still pursuing that course. Their safety is of paramount concern to me and I am sure to most Nigerians. I am very worried about the conditions those still captured might be in. Today I re-affirm our commitment to rescuing our girls. We will never stop until we bring them home safely. As I said before, no girl should be put through the brutality of forced marriage and every Nigerian girl has the right to an education and a life choice.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria136","Buhari: Year of triumph, pains, consolidation, achievement","May 29, 2016 Sunday","PM News","May 29, 2016. Here is the full text of the broadcast made by President Muhammadu Buhari made today to commemorate the first anniversary of his administration President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria My compatriots, It is one year today since our administration came into office. It has been a year of triumph, consolidation, pains and achievements. By age, instinct and experience, my preference is to look forward, to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead and rededicate the administration to the task of fixing Nigeria But I believe we can also learn from the obstacles we have overcome and the progress we made thus far, to help strengthen the plans that we have in place to put Nigeria back on the path of progress. We affirm our belief in democracy as the form of government that best assures the active participation and actual benefit of the people. Despite the many years of hardship and disappointment the people of this nation have proved inherently good, industrious tolerant, patient and generous. The past years have witnessed huge flows of oil revenues. We campaigned and won the election on the platform of restoring security, tackling corruption and restructuring the economy. On our arrival, the oil price had collapsed to as low as $30 per barrel and we found nothing had been kept for the rainy day. Oil prices have been declining since 2014 but due to the neglect of the past, the country was not equipped to halt the economy from declining. The infrastructure, notably rail, power, roads were in a decrepit state. Twenty-seven states could not pay salaries for months. In the north-east, Boko Haram had captured 14 local governments, driven the local authorities out, hoisted their flags. Elsewhere, insecurity was palpable corruption and impunity were the order of the day. In short, we inherited a state near collapse. readability=""8 Our problems as a government are like that of a farmer who in a good season harvests ten bags of produce. The proceeds enable him to get by for rest of the year However, this year he could only manage 3 bags from his farm He must now think of other ways to make ends meet. On the economic front, all oil dependent countries, Nigeria included, have been struggling since the drop in prices. Many oil rich states have had to take tough decisions similar to what we are doing. The world, Nigeria included has been dealing with the effects of three significant and simultaneous global shocks starting in 2014: A 70% drop in oil prices. Global growth slowdown. Normalisation of monetary policy by the United States federal reserve. From day one, we purposely set out to correct our condition, to change Nigeria We reinforced and galvanized our armed forces with new leadership and resources. We marshaled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants had been routed by our gallant armed forces. Our immediate focus is for a gradual and safe return of internally displaced persons in safety and dignity and for the resumption of normalcy in the lives of people living in these areas. Our problems as a government are like that of a farmer who in a good season harvests ten bags of produce. The proceeds enable him to get by for rest of the year However, this year he could only manage 3 bags from his farm He must now think of other ways to make ends meet. EFCC was given the freedom to pursue corrupt officials and the judiciary was alerted on what Nigerians expect of them in the fight against corruption. On the economy, in particular foreign exchange and fuel shortages, our plan is to save foreign exchange by fast tracking repair of the refineries and producing most of our fuel requirements at home. And by growing more food in Nigeria, mainly rice, wheat and sugar we will save billions of dollars in foreign exchange and drastically reduce our food import bill. We resolved to keep the Naira steady, as in the past, devaluation had done dreadful harm to the Nigerian economy. Furthermore, I supported the monetary authority's decision to ensure alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We shall keep a close look on how the recent measures affect the Naira and the economy. Furthermore, I supported the monetary authority's decision to ensure alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We shall keep a close look on how the recent measures affect the Naira and the economy. The measures we must take, may lead to hardships. The problems Nigerians have faced over the last year have been many and varied. But the real challenge for this government has been reconstructing the spine of the Nigerian state. The last twelve months have been spent collaborating with all arms of government to revive our institutions so that they are more efficient and fit for purpose: That means a bureaucracy better able to develop and deliver policy That means an independent judiciary, above suspicion and able to defend citizen's rights and dispense justice equitably. That means a legislature that actually legislates effectively and Above all that means political parties and politicians committed to serving the nigerian people rather than themselves. These are the pillars of the state on which democracy can take root and thrive. But only if they are strong and incorruptible. Accordingly, we are working very hard to introduce some vital structural reforms in the way we conduct government business and lay a solid foundation on which we can build enduring change. An important first step has been to get our housekeeping right. So we have reduced the extravagant spending of the past. We started boldly with the treasury single account, stopping the leakages in public expenditure. We then identified forty-three thousand ghost workers through the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information system That represents pay packets totalling N4. 2 billion stolen every month. In addition, we will save Twenty-Three Billion Naira per annum from official travelling and sitting allowances alone. Furthermore, the efficiency unit will cut costs and eliminate duplications in ministries and departments. Every little saving helps. The reduction in the number of ministries and work on restructuring and rationalization of the MDAs is well underway. When this work is complete we will have a leaner, more efficient public service that is fit for the purpose of changing nigeria for the good and for good. As well as making savings, we have changed the way public money is spent. In all my years as a public servant, I have never come across the practice of padding budgets. I am glad to tell you now we not only have a budget, but more importantly, we have a budget process that is more transparent, more inclusive and more closely tied to our development priorities than in the recent past. 30% of the expenditure in this budget is devoted to capital items. Furthermore, we are projecting non-oil revenues to surpass proceeds from oil. Some critics have described the budget exercise as clumsy. Perhaps. But it was an example of consensus building, which is integral to democratic government. In the end we resolved our differences. We have, therefore, delivered significant milestones on security, corruption and the economy. In respect of the economy, I would like to directly address you on the very painful but inevitable decisions we had to make in the last few weeks specifically on the pump price of fuel and the more flexible exchange rate policy announced by the central bank. It is even more painful for me that a major producer of crude oil with four refineries that once exported refined products is today having to import all of its domestic needs. This is what corruption and mismanagement has done to us and that is why we must fight these ills. As part of the foundation of the new economy we have had to reform how fuel prices had traditionally been fixed. We are also engaged in making recoveries of stolen assets some of which are in different jurisdictions. The processes of recovery can be tedious and time consuming, but today I can confirm that thus far: significant amount of assets have been recovered. A considerable portion of these are at different stages of recovery. Full details of the status and categories of the assets will now be published by the Ministry of Information and updated periodically. When forfeiture formalities are completed these monies will be credited to the treasury and be openly and transparently used in funding developmental projects and the public will be informed. On the Niger Delta, we are committed to implementing the United Nations Environment Programme report and are advancing clean-up operations. I believe the way forward is to take a sustainable approach to address the issues that affect the delta communities. Re-engineering the amnesty programmes is an example of this. The recent spate of attacks by militants disrupting oil and power installations will not distract us from engaging leaders in the region in addressing Niger Delta problems. If the militants and vandals are testing our resolve, they are much mistaken. We shall apprehend the perpetrators and their sponsors and bring them to justice.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria137","Electricity - the Price Nigerians Must Pay - Fashola [interview]","April 24, 2016","Vanguard (Lagos)","Babatunde RAJI Fashola, SAN , responds to these Frequently Asked Questions about the Nigerian Power Sector. Fashola, the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, explains that there is a price to pay to have improved electricity supply. What are the components required for generating electricity? Perhaps the place to start is to say that the whole purpose of this discussion is to simplify what appears to have become a very complex issue. And first to say that, Electricity is not different from what you and l learnt in our Physics in schools; Energy resulting in alternating current and all of the technical processes. But to say that if you remember the Principle of the Dynamo and the magnetic fields and all of that, that is really what it is all about. Simply put, the power plants that we have are nothing but very big generators. Power plants are just multiples of the small generators we use at home and just as the generators use fuel, petrol or diesel, the big power plants also use fuel. The fuel sometimes is gas, sometimes it is water where you have hydro-plant, sometimes it is coal. So we just need to understand that we are dealing with big generators, there is no mystery about it. Let me also say that our energy supply is also behind the growth of our population. Today, in March 2016, we have just about 5,000 MW of power on the National Grid for about 180 million people. Now, we have been producing power since 1960 or thereabout, the old Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN), the predecessor of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and the Power Holding of Nigeria (PHCN), was created by a 1950 Ordinance and it started operations in 1951, probably over 60 years and from that time the cumulative power we have generated is 5,000 MW and we got to that a few weeks ago this year. So if you do a breakdown of about 66 years you look at averagely about 75 MW of power per year. And when you look at how our population has exploded between 1950, when it was about 37 million, even then corporate Nigeria as known today had not evolved, the Northern and Southern Protectorate, by 1962, l think we were about 47 million and now we are 180 million. So part of the problem we have to deal with is how to equitably and sufficiently distribute what is not enough; clearly not enough. But again possibly, and I believe, can increase in geometric proportions if we all do the right things. One year ago, the holy grail for Power was 4000MW. That was what they were chasing, but less than a year later, we are at 5,000MW. So, if we now do the right things, we won't have the outages that we have and instead of fixing and trying to stay at 5,000MW, we should be moving on to 6,000, 7,000. And probably be moving in leaps of 2,000MW and I think that is where we should start really, to just understand that background that there is nothing esoteric about it. It is more about how much we want it and how much price it is going to take from us in terms of our behaviour, in terms of our restraints, in terms of our sacrifice that determines how much more of it we can get. What are the features of reforms in the Power Sector? Well, l think before we go into reforms, let us also understand why reforms? Until about 2013, which is over 60 years ago, Government was the provider of electricity. Nobody else but Government except for a few gas-to-power initiatives by our Joint Venture partners like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and some other Independent Power initiatives, in order to convert the gas that they were producing. It was government in generation, in transmission and in distribution. And then the people of Nigeria said that government was not efficient, that government must change the system and that government must hand it over to the Private Sector. That was what the people of Nigeria said and in 2005, our elected representatives came together and passed one law called, the Electricity Sector Reform Act of 2005 and that was the beginning of reform. That reform was concluded in November 2013. That was the privatization that the last administration did and it ended in the sale of 17 companies comprising six generation companies called the GenCos and 11 distribution companies called the DisCos sold to private organizations with government retaining certain levels of equity and ownership. But majority interest has been sold to private owners. The only one government kept was the transmission line. The Transmission System is the one we colloquially call the ""high tension."" That is the transporter in the whole value chain. I will now go to that value chain. In that value chain, it is important to talk about the fuel source because it defines the cost of electricity. Today we have power produced from two principal sources - Gas and Water which is hydro. Now before you get gas, you will either get it directly from production, which is called associated gas or from natural gas fields that has no association with oil. So you need to set up a gas production and processing facility to set up. That is a very big machine that you must raise money in order to construct. People must understand this. After you have produced the gas, you must now pipe it out and pump it into the generator. It is like building your fuel tank at home and now using pipe to connect it to your generator. From the time the gas is going out, there is a meter saying how much gas I am sending to you the generator owner. At the point of intake, when you are receiving the fuel, which is the gas, you also have a meter measuring how much you are receiving. So just as your generator at home is measuring how much fuel it can take, it is measured because you have to pay for that fuel. And when you use it and turn the machine on to produce energy, when you are sending it to a transmission company, the transporter, there is also a meter at the generation end saying, ""\'cf am sending you so much power"". So, he too knows what he is carrying. And when the transmission system is receiving it, it is also measuring and saying, ""0 l got 10 "", and then it is delivering it to the DisCos. At the point the DisCos take the Power in, they too have meters which measures how much was received. The DisCos may say, you said you sent me 10MW of Power, l received 9.8 and that's what l am going to pay for. It is now the Disco at the last end that does the hard business of distributing to hundreds of thousands and millions of homes. At the point when the DisCos are pushing out Power from the substations, if you go to those substations, you will see meters of what is going out from each substation as bulk power and then it is metered at the transformer end into our individual homes so that it can be measured, the money collected and paid back to everybody. Now, the impression has been created, perhaps, that the DisCos collect all the money. It is not true. The maximum that the DisCos collect is about 25 or maximum 30 percent of what they collect from consumers because they must now pay the transmission company, they must pay the generation company and they must pay the gas company. Once there is a default on that value chain, the power system is in trouble. Because there must be continuous supply of gas and continuous wheeling of energy. So if you are an operator or a transporter in that system and you don't get paid will you continue to render service? This is the reform that had taken place. Will it work? I believe it will work. Does it have challenges? It does have challenges and this is not the best that could have been done. But I don't want to bemoan yesterday. I want to deal with today. I want to plan tomorrow from today. That is why I am going around from one power plant to another. I have been to Kainji and Jebba hydro Power Station, I have been to Egbin Gas Power Stations, I have been to the old Oji River Power Station which used to run on coal. It has been dismantled now. There are still many more to see, l have been to the major transmission Stations across all the six states in the North Central area of Nigeria. I have been to them and my learning still continues because I need to see what I am employed to manage, I have heard about it in the briefings now I am going out to see and what I am telling you now come from what I have seen, what I understand and what I am still learning more of. Some of the people who come to speak without visiting some of these Stations, without knowing how they work, I wonder how our people find them credible and believable and I will address some of those comments as we go on. Power is a capital intensive venture that requires foreign investors. Why is government not looking in this direction? Power is too strategic, just like fuel, to leave entirely in the hands of foreigners. And as a matter of National Security, we can't leave all of our power to foreign investors. They can play in the environment as they already are, there are investors from different parts of the world now. But listen, Power is a strategic security asset. That is one side of it, the other side of it is that, we complained that most Nigerians don't invest in their country, they keep their assets abroad; they have invested here now and we must give them some support. We must give them some token acknowledgement. They could have refused to invest at all or they could have even taken their money abroad. When you look at economies like the United States today, you can't talk about the prosperity of their economy without talking about people like Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, the Carnegies and so on that built that economy. They built the first oil wells, the first rail lines, the steel plants and other big projects. J. P Morgan financed the production of electricity although he is much more known for Banking and Finance. And l think that, in my own little way I am beginning to see that generation of Nigerians beginning to emerge, funding infrastructure, strategic national assets and venturing into entrepreneurship. That is my sense of it. Now the interesting thing is that in the last few weeks there has been enormous appetite for investment in the power sector. International brands that I worked with when I was Governor have come and they are seeking to invest in buying equity in some of the existing distribution companies and generation companies. That means Capital is coming into the Sector. Also some people are wrongly directing proposals to government to supply electricity accessories. Such proposals should be properly directed to the GenCos and DisCos and not to government what government does now through TCN is building transmission lines. For those who want to generate power, their proposal and license applications should be directed to NERC. We are now just supervising the architecture of power. But indeed there is a lot of appetite for investment in the power sector. We just approved about 14 different solar projects to generate a combined capacity of 1,286 MW and that is the biggest aggregation of solar project that the country has ever undertaken but those projects would not be delivered for another 12 to 18 months depending on how quick they come through with the agreement on tariff and the price which has made it difficult to close the agreement. I think it is important for the information of the public, to underscore that when you get a license to generate power, the journey has just began. If you are using Gas, you have to close agreement to guarantee the supply of gas otherwise you will have some of the projects we have today in Geregu Omotosho, and Olorunsogo where the gas is not enough because it wasn't well planned. NERC and NBET now insist that they must see the agreement for the purchase of gas before they sign the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Once this is signed it is almost a certainty that the plant must be built. Once you take the PPA to the bank you get money because it means there is a guaranteed purchaser who is ready to take the power. It was PPAs that we used when I was Governor to build all those plants for our Water works; for Lagos Island, for Lekki, for the Free Zone, for Mainland in Ikeja and for the hospital and all of that. Once you signed a PPA, take it as done that project will happen. In an environment where there is not enough gas, where there is inadequate price, you won't sign a PPA, and once you don't sign a PPA, there is no power project. It is important for people to understand this as well. But what we are trying to do is to reduce the time frame in which this is done. Perhaps this should take me to the issue of location of the Power production facility to the source of power fuel. It is a very important issue. Once the generation plant is far from source of fuel what it invariably means is that the cost of that power is bound to go up. We have an Energy Policy that we met but there is no Energy Mix. That is what I am working on now, to develop an Energy Mix because we have many sources of fuel. We have solar in the North and what we are doing now is to find the most prolific Solar area of the North and I think it is looking like Jigawaand Kano where the irradiation is at the highest and classify that area as our solar belt. We would get land there from those states and know that our solar development for the next 15, 20 to 30 years will come from that place, put more solar manufacturing plants in that area and this way we reduce the cost. It is much more efficient for us to plan a transmission programme that evacuates all the solar from one place. We are looking at the Middle Belt, and North Central for the most prolific area for coal production. As you would also see, that area and parts of the Northeast in areas like Taraba will have a mixture of some solar and hydro because of the projects that are coming there like Mambilla, and you already know about Kainji, Jebba and Zungeru, which is under construction now, in Niger. The Energy Mix in that area will be a combination of solar, hydro and some coal. For down South, in the South South and South West, it will largely be gas. In parts of the South East it will be a combination of gas and coal because the mines in Enugu still have their historic capacity which my colleagues in the Ministry of Solid Minerals are looking at. So once that Energy Mix is completed which should happen before the end of the second quarter this year, it is easier for investors to then know that if you want to do gas stay here, if you want to do solar, stay here and so on. So all the transmission problems that we have had in the past will go away because it is now planned. This will affect pricing because if you put a Gas Power Plant in any part of the North today and you have to pipe gas from the South over 500 to 700 or 800 kilometres, the law says that for you to arrive at the tariff, it must factor in your investment and profit. So that, will include cost of the pipes and power. That's going to be a high tariff. It would have been better if you build a plant in the Gas location in the Niger Delta and you transport the Power through transmission. Transmission is actually cheaper than pushing gas over 700 kilometres. This are some of the errors made in the past that we don't want to repeat. Thankfully they are not many. If the Government has sold the DisCos and GenCos, why is it still in charge of increasing tariffs? Let me say first that as Minister, I have no power over tariff. Any interference that I make on tariff would be an unlawful one. I have no powers over tariffs, but an opinion and I think it is important to make that point. The authority vested with deciding tariff matter is the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). It was created by the 2005 law which the people of Nigeria, through their representatives passed and I think it is a good law. The power to review tariff is vested in provisions of that law. Of course, they will not set tariff without notifying the Ministry. The important thing to say about this last tariff is that when privatization took place, the last administration knew that they were not doing market tariff. It is important to say this and I think they should have been honest and open with Nigerians to say this is the price. But they sought to inch the price along, especially because of the advent of elections. And so people had already began to get an impression that tariffs were just going up every time. So instead of taking us to that tariff once, they were inching us towards it. So the impression was created that the thing was going up every day. So I understand the frustrations and the reactions that trailed the last tariff. But there are two broad lines between the two tariffs. The old tariff was going to continue to go up. How did I know? I was the first person to oppose the review of the tariff when I was briefed. Why are you reviewing upward? Why can't we have Power? These were my initial reactions when l first became Minister. Then, I was taken through all that had happened before, in my opinion and I saw in fact that the tariff was reviewed upwards but was reversed by the last administration because of the elections and during that reversal liabilities had accumulated; about N200 billion liabilities had accumulated. In order to validate what they were telling me I called a meeting of all the DisCos and the DisCos took me through all the challenges that they were facing. It wasn't that they were without blame, but these were the realities and if we kept the tariff going like that, every two years, Nigeria would be indebted to them to over a trillion Naira for an asset we had sold. So we were going back to an era of subsidy for people who are supposed to be operating commercially. I couldn't recommend that. If we had a trillion Naira to spend on Power why didn't we give it to PHCN. If we had done that we won't be where we are today. So this was what changed my thinking, because without a doubt as I have always told people there is problem with gas. Gas production for local use was low because the price was not right. Local gas use was selling at $1.30 and for export it was $4. If you were producing gas where would you sell it? So we needed to raise that price to get more gas to our idle power plants. So by the time I became Minster that decision had been made to add two dollars to the price of Gas to take the price of Gas to $2.50 and to allow for 80 Cents transportation which came to $3.30 from $1.30. If gas was the major material for producing power, how sensible is it to expect that the major component, the palm oil that you would use for cooking your soup, the price would go up and the price of your stew would not go up. So that was the basis when l surrendered my objection to tariff review. As l said, l have no authority but l have an opinion and l saw that this tariff, as challenging as it might be, was really the driver for gas. It has become the incentive to supply gas; if we get more gas, we will get more power. How did we reach 5,000 MW? We haven't built any new plants, we just got more gas into the existing power plants and the more gas that comes, the more power we'll get. We still have power plants in Geregu that has six turbines, only two are working; four are idle. Each one of them has 115 MW of power to produce, so that's 460 MW of power idle. Omotosho is running at half speed, Olorunsogo is running at half speed, the old Lagos IPP built by Governor Tinubu now managed by AES is lying fallow in Lagos, 240 MW, no gas. So if the price of gas is not right, you won't fire those plants. It's that simple. That was why, it made sense to me to support it but the decider was NERC, not me. With the increase in tariff will Nigerians now have stable Power? There is still a lot of work to do. What I can tell you is that if we can get the cases out of court against the tariff, we get the cases out of Parliament against the tariff, because I believe that business men like to deal with their regulator not with politicians, they understand business rules they don't understand political rules, then you create stability in the market. Business men are confident; they know that the game won't change. They will take position and in that way, you will see first incremental power. If you don't have incremental power, moving from 5,000 to 8,000 and upwards like that you can't equitably distribute what is not enough. The logic behind it is like ten people are thirsty and there is one bottle of Ragolis water and they ask the seller to buy more Ragolis water when the cost of production has increased and they are not ready to pay for the difference, they won't get enough Ragolis water to quench their thirst. Electricity is compounded by the fact that you cannot store it. Once it is produced, it must be used. But the more power we produce the more stability we will see. I can guarantee that but I cannot guarantee that people will not go and cut gas lines. I can't guarantee that people will not go on strike and go and shut down distribution companies or transmission facilities or the Control Centre in Oshogbo because they want some of their colleagues to be kept at work. Is it profitable to discomfort a whole nation in order to protect 200 people? Because that is what happened in Ikeja DisCo. If there is a dispute about policy in the NNPC about restructuring, is the answer to a welfare issue that can be negotiated, resolved or even litigated upon in a court or before an arbitration panel a shut down? Instead of choosing those options, the chosen option was to shut down the gas pipelines. As a result, 13 generation plants were shut down. Was that the best answer? I can't guarantee people's behaviour. So it is actually the people who are supposed to be producing the energy that are shutting down production in both the gas companies and DisCos. It is not the President or the Minister. So we need to have a rethink about the productivity of that workforce. What are they doing? What are they contributing to our national productivity? Because, as I said, I am a lawyer and I do not know about the technical side of electricity except what I am learning. But you know what; very highly educated engineers like Engineer Makoju and Prof. Barth Nnaji have operated in this Ministry. It wasn't that they were not good enough; it was because of some of these attitudes. So, as far as technical capacity lies, we have it. In terms of technical capacity, Engineer Makoju can fix things but he cannot run a power plant on his own, people were employed to do that. I know that Prof. Barth Nnaji knows much more about gas than me but he won't operate a gas pipeline on his own. The job of a Minister is to coordinate all these activities together in order to engender productivity. If there was a war today, President Buhari, with all his military might would not be the one to carry the gun. His role would be to coordinate. So that is the productive force. What are we getting out of it? That is a question we need to ask. It is, therefore when we all sign up for qualitative and uninterrupted power supply that we can then guarantee what you are talking about. Will the Power sector not be better off with the spread of metering and bringing more consumers into the meter net than increasing tariffs? Deregulated, privatized, regulated; they are terms of art. The real purpose is to allow business operate on a commercial basis, in order to create competition, in order to engender productivity. Now meters in electricity production are not as freely sold as the readily available telephones, because there are codes, there are standards, and because of safety as well. Improperly installed meters may become a potential source of danger- fire; using cheap meters can cause accidents. There is a regulatory agency which regulates the types of meters you can use. Installation of meters is a very technical things because the Operators are saying that some people even by-pass their meters. But what is the meter when stripped of its technicalities? An electricity meter is basically just a measuring device to measure how many units of power you use. Meters on a basic level are comparable to measuring devices such as fuel pumps, plastic water bottles and mudu cups for measuring garri. But we can't leave meters without going back to tariff. We have about 180 million people. But all the DisCos combined have just about six million consumers in their database combined for Nigeria. Are you telling me in reality that it is only six million people that use electricity in Nigeria? So you can imagine the number of people that are using electricity that is not measured, that is not metered, that is free. Out of that six million that they have, they have metered about three million, inherited and added on. So there is still a gap of close to 50 percent of that six million that need to be metered. Now, in deciding that tariff what did we seek to achieve? It was to say, ""stop giving people fixed charges, it's unfair... Take it out,"" because there is no fair basis for doing so. In deciding tariff again what people must understand is that consumers are classed in different categories. R1, for example, is the most vulnerable class of consumers, their tariff is about N4 per kwh or something like that. It remains unchanged. It wasn't changed; there is a protective policy for the poorest of the poor that if we get power to them they must not pay more than this. These are people who use not more than a light bulb and radio. They don't have fridge or any big appliances. Then there is R2 one phase; these are people who have the basic one fridge, television and radio. Then there R2, 2 phase and R3, these are those with big appliances, DSTV, air conditioners and all of that. Those are the people whose tariff really went up because they form the real bulk of those who pay for electricity. When you flip it around, it is almost like a type of cross subsidy, let those who can afford pay more and let the poorest of the poor stay where they are, don't change their tariff. Then we removed, through NERC, the fixed charge, don't pay the fixed charged any more. We now told the DisCos ""If you get this new tariff, if anybody complains that his bill has gone up, and he disputes that bill, that person is only liable to pay his undisputed last bill"". You cannot say because your bill has gone up so you won't pay; pay your last undisputed bill so we know you are complaining in good faith; you are not trying to game the system. From that point on, the DisCo cannot disconnect you. If he insists you used the power, let him come and prove it. The only way to prove it is to measure it. That was the first incentive to force the DisCos to meter. But we also had to give them the incentive because people should not forget that meters cost money. On the average, some of the DisCos that I know used to have about three to four hundred thousand consumers that they have to meter and given some of the numbers that I have seen, those run into no less than seven, eight to ten or 18 billion Naira to cover. You don't keep that kind of money in your pocket, you must go to a bank. Now if a bank wants to lend you that kind of money it wants to see that you can pay and if you are doing it with the old tariff clearly no bank will lend you money because it is an unsustainable business. One of the examples I use is the person selling iced water and the price of ice block has gone up and you say he can't increase his price but must go and buy more bottles, to sell to who? He won't recover. That is one thing people must understand about the philosophy behind the tariff. And the other point I want to make is that many of us have generators and we also have inverters. The combined cycle of our inverters and our generators does it produce 24-hourelectricity? It does not. Your inverter can only run for about eight hours and so can your generator unless you want to kill it, and that is 16 hours out of 24; you still have eight hours gap. If you combine the cost of the generator, the cost of the inverter and the diesel to power it as well as maintenance cost, how much does it add to, to generate 16 hours of electricity? And then we expect somebody to generate 24 hours of electricity at a cheaper price. That is one way to look at it. And if you cannot do it yourself at a cheaper price, is it fair to ask someone else to do it at a price cheaper and a longer period. That is one side of the coin. The other point and about increasing power is that the old tariff did not allow people to buy power at premium except you were a government agency which was what we did in Lagos. So if for example my diesel costs about N50 a week and I have someone who could give me power at N30 a week and public tariff is about N24 a week, there is no way I can't take that power at a premium because it is still cheaper. But the old tariff did not allow that. It fixed everybody at the cap. But in the new tariff, we recommended that they should have willing buyer and willing seller. What that would have done if it hadn't been challenged in court was that it would have allowed the embedded power that people were asking for to take root in various communities across the country in such a way that those who wanted premium power would take premium power, free off the Grid for those who did not want premium power. But again people have said no; perhaps they did not understand. This was a tariff order that was more friendly ultimately to the consumer. And as I said, the old tariff was going to be going up but this new tariff would be coming down in 24 months on a progressive basis. Now I also wish to make this point and I shouldn't lose the opportunity. I have said that the R1 consumers were protected and so on; but we have heard allegations that the Tariff was increased by 45 percent. That is not correct because the price of power is not exactly the same in e very DisCo just as the price of garri is not the same in every state. So if the amount is not the same can you increase them with the same amount uniformly? How is tariff derived? Tariff derivation starts from the Discos and not from NERC. Each DisCo must hold consultations in its operational area with stakeholders. The law did not say who are the stakeholders but the law did not mention Labour. But each DisCo must now file a return to NERC because NERC is now the referee to say, ""Oh you said you consulted people, we want to know who attended. They look at their records, they ask for video recordings and make sure that it happened. And I saw their reports. The interesting thing was that representatives of Labour were present at those disco meetings. May be not in enough numbers but what is enough numbers is a matter for debate. Did they consult? Yes. They issued advertorials as required, in radio, some used radio and television, some used radio, TV and newspapers and some used only newspapers. Once the publication has been made, did we respond? Were we sufficiently educated? I think these were the issues that went on and we saw the classification of people that went there. I saw in their report representatives of organized labour who attended the meetings and signed with their names and email addresses and telephone numbers. So some of the things that have been put in the public are false because there is documentary evidence to show that there was consultation. Was there enough consultation? We can continue to debate that, nobody is ever guilty of over-consultation. If you want to get opinion of everybody in a community you do poll sampling. You don't speak to everybody in order to get opinion about a poll and that is the whole idea about that. There is also a provision in the law that anybody who is not satisfied with the tariff pronounced by NERC can file an application to NERC asking for a review. The law didn't say you should go and protest or go to Court or Parliament. The law says you should go back to NERC which is obliged to review it. So all of us must become familiar with the consequence of this reform. But in order to close this part, and it is the most important part of the discussion, is that it is the tariff that gives stability to distribution, to transmission, to generation and to gas production. If you don't have that stability, if you have all the generation capacity, the distribution companies won't take power, just as you have heard, some are rejecting power because they can't sell it. And once it has been sent to them, it cannot be stored and they can't wheel it on. That was why I expressed my opinion and appealed to Nigerians, let's support this. I think it can work. Today, NERC has issued over 100 licenses for power generation but if the tariff is not right, they won't translate to power plants. If we allow this stability to stay, I am convinced from what I have seen so far, there can only be incremental power because power is the real business now that everybody is interested and once Nigerians are interested in doing something they don't lose, they don't give up. They have this energy. You will see the penetration we have achieved with GSM. Even those we met ahead of us we overtook them. So that is why I am optimistic. But we must set the ground rules. With widespread complaints relating to issues of load shedding, ageing or non-existent transformers in some areas and estimated billings: Why is there poor customer service instead of improved service in the power sector ? We have talked about how long privatization has taken, nearly two years. I've talked about the transition in knowledge and capacity. Most of the power plants are very old. Most of the transformers are very old, 30 to 40 years and they are being refitted slowly. I was in Jebba Hydro Power Plant which was built and commissioned by President Buhari when he was Military Head of State. Part of the maintenance schedule for Jebba was a full turn around service scheduled every six years after commissioning. It was not done until 2013, almost 30 years later, so how do you expect that to deliver efficient power? The same thing happened in Egbin, turbines were down; parts were being cannibalized and so on and so forth. At Oji River Power Station, after cannibalizing the old coal plant one turbine at a time, in order to save the other turbines, the whole system finally collapsed and somebody suggested that it should be scrapped. So that is what the businessmen have bought. In the same vein, similar to the same backbone that the GSM operators had of 250,000 lines prior to expansion to the current 100 million lines. So that's another analogy. So you will have epileptic power supply from time to time until all the equipment is refurbished, changed, upgraded and more power is built in. But as I said, the focus is incremental power. Now why is that important? It is important because all over the world, machines and turbines break down. The reason you do not notice them in those parts of the world is that they have enough and they have redundancy. When one is down they switch to another because they have enough and they have time to carry out routine maintenance on the broken down machines. If you have only one generator in your house, it will not generate power for you while it is being maintained if it breaks down. If you have two, you have a backup. This is just a context for you to see all of this. But customer service must improve. At our meeting in Enugu I said to the DisCos ""you have to lead this reform now by taking ownership. You have to have complaints officers that people can reach to explain why they could not have service and how long they have to wait to get it"". That is customer service. They can wait out a problem if they know what the problem is and how long it will take to solve it. But it becomes frustrating if they do not know what's going on. They need to open more customer service outlets just like the TELCOS have done. Some of them are already opening up portals on the internet which we must also use because they are trying to cut cost. The more customer care centres they open the more rental they pay and you see when they are going to pay rent nobody wants to accept one year rent they all want 3years rent in advance. So these are part of the cultural issues that you and I must also change because they can't build all of those facilities, they will need to rent. Well, I am sure that their business will be assisted if they see someone who will accept 6 months rent rather than 3years rent in advance. But as the equipment get upgraded they will get better. As I pointed out, all of the lines that come to our homes now don't belong to NEPA again but belong to the DisCoS. As they age they must change them. They must change within that bandwidth of money they get. Bulk power today for gas is about N13.50kobo per kilowatts, N2.50 kobo for transmission to carry it, you are at N16. The average tariff now is about N24 so N16 to N24 is about N8 and that is the margin of the DisCo to operate its station, get the power to you, to fix broken transformers, to fix your line, to get people to come and repair and so on and so forth. That is the reality. It can be a very profitable business in numbers but it can also be challenging. Why not use solar and wind for cheap power if the cost of gas is too expensive? There is a lot of misinformation being thrown out there by people who claim to know, who either have not verified what they learnt yesterday or deliberately seek to mislead the public. Today, the cheapest source of energy is hydro because the turbine is driven by the force of water to create electricity. Hydro is about 4 cents per kilowatt hour followed by gas which is about 11 cents per kilowatt hour. If you multiply that by N200 per dollar hydro comes to about N8 per kilowatt hour while gas come to about N22/kwh. Now the minimum tariff for solar is 17 cents which works out to about N34/kwh. How do you index a tariff of N34 for solar energy on people who are resisting tariff of N24? It cannot be cheap after accounting for imported costs of shipping, transport and demurrage. However, it can get cheaper with locally made photovoltaic panels and cells. As for wind power, upon assumption of office as Minister, even I questioned why we don't make use of wind energy. The simple answer is that we lack the required wind speed because of our location as a country. To achieve the necessary wind speed of 8 mph as compared to the 4 mph typically available in Nigeria, taller and more expensive wind towers will be required to achieve the same result. If you need a storey building to achieve something and I need to build a 6 storey building to achieve the same result, then I am definitely at a disadvantage compared to you. These are some of the factual realities our experts have not told Nigerians. And so, the answer is again in the energy mix. Take the power closest to the energy and fuel source which will help reduce both tariffs and production costs while making evacuation easier because of an increased ease of planning. What is the future of Power generation in Nigeria given the current state of the Power assets? I think that as long as we can excite the investors' confidence, the future of power generation is bright. Today, incidentally, I just saw the head of the international nuclear agency who visited to assess the progress of Nigeria's nuclear power because we are already pursuing, from the previous administrations dating back about 15 years, a nuclear programme. The plan ultimately is to start to produce nuclear energy, 1,200 mw at start, expanding up to about 4,800 mw as we go forward because that would be, again, the new power for developing an emerging economy because most of the big, global economies have signed up to Cop . 21 and the Climate Change obligations to reduce carbon fuel use and therefore nuclear energy will be the alternative energy they will be looking at. Therefore, we will benefit from the technology as time goes on. So the future really, for me, is a very hopeful future. We can ramp up on solar, reduce the cost, we can ramp up on gas, produce more, and we can ramp up on hydro because Zungeru Power Project is now back on stream. Construction stopped for about two years due to court cases and other hindrances. Thanks to the initiative and dedication of the Governor of Niger State, all the cases got out of the way in order for the construction workers, about 800 workers to get back on site. So, there is so much opportunity for inclusion and jobs if people just allow this thing to play. But we can't force people to do the right thing and that is why I have decided that this discussion is important to educate people and to let Nigerians know that it is one thing to elect a government and another thing to stand by your government, through the distance. And I think ,this is the time the government needs the people to stand by it, and to tell all of those who seek to obstruct the plans that this government has. There must be a continuing ownership of the policy of government. That is the way you give support, and every time your government looks back, the government sees that you are still there, the way you were during the campaigns and during the voting. That is a fuel that government needs to carry on without looking back. Pipeline vandalism contributes largely to the poor generation and transmission output currently being experienced. What steps are you taking to put a stop to this? I think the biggest contribution will come from the communities through whose territories these pipelines pass, to take ownership, to stand as security vanguards for the protection of pipeline assets because if the pipelines work it benefits them more. With the best of intentions, how many kilometres of pipeline could any government really police? And they are as diverse as they are lengthy. So it is a cultural and behavioral remake that we must have, that no matter how aggrieved or upset we are about anything, government assets that deliver power, that support the power system and the economy of the country are not things that we can take our anger out against. There is no society in the world that I know, as vexed as they may be in Europe, as vexed as they were in the Arab Spring, they didn't damage their power assets and they didn't damage their gas lines. And I think that is the message really to us. Those assets must remain inviolate. All of us must protect them as if they were our personal assets. And that is when we can then begin to say we will have uninterrupted power. No matter what anybody does, once you take out a gas asset, no matter how much power you have, you shut down the system. From the last outage we had now, it takes days to restore the system back because you have to get the pressure back; before you can begin to hook up all the power plants. So it's like when you have a dirty fuel filter in your car, it just begins to jerk. And when you drain the tank and switch on the engine, clearly you won't have enough fuel. You need to wait for the fuel line to be suffused with enough fuel for the pump to activate before driving the car again, so it is the same, it's not different. What are some of the things you have been able to do since you assumed office? For me it is premature to talk about achievements; this is a journey that hopefully will take us to 2019 when the government's scorecard will be assessed. So, I don't think perhaps it is the best time to measure events. Rather we should measure trends. One of the trends is increased power production and that is important. But there is still a problem as I have said. I don't want to talk about energy in terms of megawatts but in terms of access; how many more people have access to more reliable electricity? That is what is important to me. The amount of electricity produced is meaningless if people can't tell me that they are getting it. But there are problems along the line. One of the things we have succeeded in doing is building the team to begin to interrelate, that's why we hold those monthly meetings now because as a ministry we can't deliver power on our own. We can regulate the GenCos, DisCos and the transmission company (TCN) however we don't have power over the gas companies as they are regulated by another ministry, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources as well as NNPC. So we need to work with them. So these are the partnerships that we have forged together. At those monthly meetings now there are very senior representatives of those gas companies sitting down with us and taking instructions. So, some of the things we have sorted out, for example, at the last meeting, NEMSA (the safety agency) had a complaint from a DisCo that their meters were not approved for use. In that meeting we resolved it and within 2 weeks, their meters were approved for use. We have issues with gas supply to one of the major power plants, the 240 MW Power Plant at Egbin in Lagos. The groups are talking now; they have reached an agreement so they are going to the gas company to get gas. That, for me, is progress. We had the issue of the unfortunate incident of the young lady who was electrocuted in the University of Lagos. When I became Minister, we stepped in because she had a sibling that also had issues and compensation. We have closed on that and for me again that is progress. We have this court case that has been in court for about 13(thirteen) years. Let me put it differently and accurately, there is a contract that was awarded in 2003 for the supply of meters that was awarded by the old PHCN and it has ended up in court. So that is for 13 years we could not supply those meters and people were bickering and fighting. We have taken that case, really, out of court and we are trying to close it and hopefully take delivery of the meters that have been locked up in a warehouse, I think about 300,000 meters or so. Hopefully they will be useful for some purpose, I do not know. There is a problem with Aba DisCo, by Geometric Power Plant, there is 190 MW there and they are having issues which they were not talking about. We got them to start talking, because if they close an agreement then there is potential to get 190 MW onto the Grid. There is a construction project for a transmission line to feed Alaoji Power Plant and all the way to the South East and the South South. Now, part of the problem, in fact one problem out of the many on that project, is that there is a telecommunications mast belonging to one of the TELCOs. And let me say this publicly, it belongs to Globacom (Glo). And I say this publicly because the Chairman of Glo must be commended for his sense of patriotism. Because of this, they could not energize that line, and that is one of the problems. There are other problems. And I said ""Glo, I know him and I will call him"". And I called him and said: ""Look Sir, we have this problem and I do not know who got there first but it is easier to remove your transmission mast than for us to remove a transmission line that runs over several hundred kilometers. Can you please move Sir?"" And he said to me, ""Look, it will be done in a week,"" and it has been done. So we have cleared one problem and we are moving to the next one. There are still other problems such as procurement and so on. So these are some of the things that have been going on backstage. We are also getting the DisCos to take on their responsibilities. We have published the names of all of the heads of the DisCos in the newspapers so that people can know who to call if you have a problem in your distribution area. People call me from as far as Borno State. Now, there was a line that was damaged during the conflict in the Borno which we have restored back to operational status. So these are some of the problems we are solving. People call me from Calabar, Warri, Sapele etc. that they do not have power, but people are also not reporting to their DisCos. So instead of coming to me in Abuja, deal with your DisCos in your area. So we are populating information out about who to call and how to solve complaints. But as they come also, I must commend the Director of Distribution in my Ministry too. As I send those complaints to her, she notes them and is calling the heads of the DisCos. So all of these things are going on but, these are things that should not be escalating to us in Abuja. They should be dealt with at the customer service level in the states. Consumers too must be up and doing. If there is a fault, go and report it. Sometimes the DisCos do not know that you don't have power but they are transmitting and distributing power. But again, as they bring on meters, the smart meters they say they are installing then hopefully things will get better. And one of the things to say about meters, some of the complaints we've had, and people must just before they get angry, think. Sometimes when they want to come and install meters, people are genuinely not at home. These are some of the problems. And when you look at some of these mass exercises we have done, such as SIM card registration, we always leave it until the last minute. BVN, we left it until the last minute. So, if the whole of Nigeria has not been metered for 66 years, and suddenly we want everything to be donein one year, how really rational is that? Did everybody get a cellphone in the first 2 years? And yet, the phone is something you can freely go and buy for yourself. Some people still do not own a cellphone as we speak. So, for me it is a progress on a journey, and I am optimistic it will be done. Three solutions offered by a critic Trucking of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Localization of generation, transmission and distribution through micro power plants Now, the problem with these alternatives, as I know it, is that first of all trucking gas, and I think I read trucking about 500 trucks of gas a day, overlooks the fact that pricing location of the power plant to the gas source is the key to sustainable power. So, when you start trucking 500 trucks of gas every day, who will bear the cost of that trucking? Because transportation becomes incidented to the price of gas. And where do you put it in the tariff? A tariff we are saying people are still finding hard to accept, and then you want to incident cost of transportation into it. You see, and when you look at it, that is why in the past, and even till lately, we had the Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF) which ensures that the price of petroleum products is the same nationwide. It is another subsidy; can we afford to subsidize power again at this time? I am not sure we are ready for it. I think when the market plateaus, and we actually know where the problems are, government can then come and say: ""Look, I will carry transmission free as my subsidy"". We can, and I think we will get there. It is premature, the market must play. So that is one limitation with that solution. The other suggestion I think was the embedded generation. Again, it overlooks the gap between the tariff that I have talked about. So, the only way people can have embedded generation is if willing sellers can sell to willing buyers. Yesterday at our meeting, one of the complaints we received was simply that the people in GRA in Ikeja, Lagos had written to NERC and they had not yet gotten a response. They were asking that NERC approve for them to buy power from the Lagos Mainland IPP that we built during my tenure as Governor, because they felt they needed only about 2MW of power to meet all their needs in the community. So, we will see more of that coming to play once the new tariff settles down because it allows willing sellers to sell to willing buyers. We also have applications like that from people on Banana Island that we are looking at, and there are a couple of them like that popping up. There are private companies whom are generating their own power and want to offer more power onto the Grid, but again it is a question of pricing. So, that contribution overlooks the fact that one will not happen without the price. It is more expensive to sell small power than it is to sell big power, and I mean that in the sense of coverage. So, if you are selling to a thousand people, your prices are more competitive than if I am selling to 100 people because I am going to sell at a premium. But once those who buy at a premium take their power that is when what they were using from the public power will be freed up for the 1000 people. As I said, nobody could ever be guilty of over consultation with stakeholders. What we are often guilty of is under consultation and the point is that this is a representative form of governance. So, how many people will be enough consultation? That part of it is welcome, continuous consultation never hurts anybody but if you spend all your time consulting, you will spend no time doing anything at all. And there are times when you think you have sampled enough; you're right because sometimes to be honest what you hear is more of the reason why it will not work. I am always looking for one reason why it will work so that I will go and try it. This job can be done, we can have power but it will come at a price, and not just the price of the tariff but also the price of our own restraints. Our sense of understanding that even though electricity works like magic and you just flick a switch, there is a long process that many of us do not see which results to that magical act. And anybody who disrupts that system, really, is not a friend of our country, is not a friend of the ordinary people, is not a friend of the champions of change who elected this Government. \"

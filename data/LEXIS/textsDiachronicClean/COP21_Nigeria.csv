This means 1 in 10 babies born worldwide.According to the agency in a press statement obtained by our correspondent in New York on Wednesday, of these 15 million premature babies, around 1 million die from complications due to prematurity. More than three quarters of these babies could be saved through better access to quality care and medicines for both mother and baby, WHO further said.The statement pressed further that complications of preterm births are the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, stressing that without appropriate treatment, those who survive often face lifelong disabilities, including learning, visual and hearing problems and their quality of life is greatly affected.In an effort to improve preterm birth outcomes, the statement said WHO had published recommendations for managing preterm births that are designed to save lives and improve the health of preterm infants. Many of these recommendations are simple, proven and cost-effective measures.In a related development, the WHO has called on countries to protect health from climate change, saying that climate change is already causing tens of thousands of deaths every year - from shifting patterns of disease, from extreme weather events, such as heat-waves and floods, and from the degradation of air quality, food and water supplies, and sanitation.The agency said the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP-21In 2012, WHO estimated 7 million people died from air pollution-related diseases, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps.Not only are ways to combat climate change already known and well-documented, they can bring important health gains. As WHO's new series of climate change and health country profiles illustrate, investments in low-carbon development, clean renewable energy, and strengthening climate resilience, are also investments in health.\l"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria21","Africa Wildlife Foundation at COP-21: ""Our mission is to protect the wildlife of Africa""","December 3, 2015 Thursday","Ventures Africa","Adaptation, survival and extinction rates among wildlife have been connected to climatic and environmental factors and variability. They rely on seasonal changes for migration and breeding, under which intolerable levels of climate change would account for the disruption of biotic interactions. Currently, animals in the wild are suffering because of global warming, which is reflected in their inabilty to maintain their habitats, or a stable food chain, threatening their existence altogether.In 2012, science researchers in Kenya discovered that the African cheetah is gradually losing its ability to reproduce, and in other parts of Africa, elephants are threatened\~as well because of the pressure put on their space.As represenatatives from different parts of the world gather to discuss the impact of climate change on the world\~at in Paris, various animal conservation organisations and concerned individuals are joining them to speak on behalf of wildlife. The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), a renowned advocate for wildlife conservation on the endangered continent, is filled with the hope that they can make a change by lending their voice to the ongoing climate talks.Ventures Africa\~spoke to\~Kathleen Fitzgerald, Vice President of Conservation Strategy for the AWF, for commentary on how advocacy for African wildlife is integral to the conversation at COP-21.Given that a lot of animals are already experiencing instability in their natural habitats, what do you think we need to do to address global warming?Global warming should be avoided, for both people and wildlife. Making our globe cleaner is better for everyone.What people need to consider in relation to climate change and wildlife in Africa, and globally, is that it is not happening in a vacuum. Already, in Africa wildlife face a series of threat, including poaching and habitat loss, and when you add climate change you see instances in many landscapes where it is already pushing wildlife and people to a tipping point.The AWF's presence at the COP-21 is first to create awareness about the threat facing wildlife and people in Africa, pertaining to climate change, and secondly to advocate for a global agreement that reduces pollution, which would help reduce the impact of climate change. In addition, we are pushing for an increase in funding for Africa, because while Africa is not one of the major polluters globally, it is already one of the most impacted continents for climate change, and that will only get worse.People are feeling the impact of climate change, and they don't have the resources or resiliency to adapt. This is a priority for AWF, and one of our major programmes sees us working with communities that live with wildlife, in order to help them to adapt to climate change.In Southern Kenya, for example, a result of climate change is an increase in human-wildlife conflict, because water is a scarce resource in an arid the landscape. This area is where we have one of the most important populations of elephants, and they have to go to the same source with people for water. What happens next is retaliatory killing of wildlife, and other chain of effects that have an impact on wildlife.Will\~humans be impacted from changes in animal behaviour due to climate change?\~Africa is growing and changing, with an increase in human population, as well as infrastructure development across the continent. What we have been advocating \- and firmly believe \- is that with good planning, human and wildlife can coexist. And we are trying to implement that in the areas we work in. We look at wildlife and the areas that they need to survive, and we makes plans, with climate change in mind, through a system of modelling. This happens either in a special analysis laboratory, or we project based on the implications of climate change that we are aware of. We also look at the human population, and how they need to survive.The biggest change in animal behaviour has to do with movement, and sourcing for food and water, and the greatest impact is habitat stability. As Africa changes, the weather becomes more radical, and the lands become more arid, putting both humans and animals in a situation where they have to adapt.AWF has spent the last 15 years working on a large landscape scale, and that is one of the greatest mitigation and adaptation mechanisms that we believe that Africa needs to implement. Because, by working on such a scale, wildlife is enabled to adapt to movement, sourcing, and accessing different foods and water sources, which fragmented and isolated lands won't help with.In Africa, habitats are changing because of human impact and plant use, and adding climate change to that basically accelerates these changes. The wildlife then need to move and adapt to new habitats, and without protecting large connections of landscape, they are unable to do that. We need to ensure that there's space for the wildlife to adapt.In your opinion, is wildlife conservation getting enough attention at COP-21?No, it's not. And that is part of why we are here; to raise awareness about the implications of climate change on wildlife in Africa, because our mission is to protect the wildlife and wild lands of Africa. As an organisation, the AWF witnesses and feels the direct impact of climate change on the wildlife that we are working with.What do you think it would take for the world, and the representative authorities at COP-21 as well, to show more responsibility towards conserving wildlife?We are starting to see governments recognise the value of ecosystem services in Africa, and it has a direct link to wildlife. Governments have begun to note that the value of the ecosystem goes beyond protecting areas, and revenue for parks, and really has to do with water, air, among other things that have an impact on humans and the economy.If you look at agriculture, for example, it's a major growing area on the continent, and without adequate water and good soils, it's not going to thrive. It's excellent that governments are showing concern now, and we are encouraging it to continue, while considering the broader picture.What would you describe as a 'win' for wildlife in Africa in terms of the talks?The best outcome would be a global agreement, and we are hopeful that the leaders this year would achieve that, by setting targets for reduction in pollution and financial support for adaptation and mitigation in Africa.Another major conversation here also is forestation and conservation, and Africa's forests are critically important for the globe, and for mitigation, and we are seeing that play a central role in the discussions here, and AWF is advocating for an increase in support for the protection of the forests, because that would mean that the wildlife and forest-dependent communities would be helped to come up with ways to thrive in l"

He, therefore, urged members of the Awolowo family to keep the flag flying and ensure that the legacies and values left behind by both Awolowo and HID were upheld by them.Buhari later arrived at the residence of the Awolowos at about 2:16pm and headed straight for Efunyela Hall. Journalists were, however, barred from entering the hall by the security personnel at the reception.By 8:45am, the 690-seater church was filled to capacity as people scrambled for space to pay their last respects to Mrs Awolowo.To cater for spill-over, canopies were erected within the premises of the church and television screens were hung at strategic points for people far away from the altar to watch and follow the proceedings in the church.The church service formally commenced at 9am when the white chariot conveying HID's gold-plated casket arrived at the church and the bell on the belfry tolled for the third time.The service, which was conducted by the Primate of the Anglican Communion in Nigeria, Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh, had 36 bishops in attendance.Speaking during the service, Okoh described the late Mrs Awolowo as a great wife who stood by her husband, the late Obafemi Awolowo, throughout his sojourn on earth.Okoh explained that she deserved a rest quite different from the worldly rest everybody thinks of, and prayed that she finds eternal rest after living a worthy life.Eulogising HID further, the Anglican primate lauded her for being courageous even when she lost three of her children, urging the congregation to emulate her strong heart and firm belief in God. Okoh also lamented the inability of Nigerian leaders to check the spate of terrorism in the country, remarking that the menace of terrorism had negatively affected the image of the nation.He further stated that the prevalence of social vices, corruption and mass unemployment had worsened the health conditions of Nigerians, resulting in many citizens going down with various terminal diseases.""Terror has taken over our power, money, our strength, our resources and degraded our infrastructure. It has also taken our peace. Government must do something about it. Corruption in all ramifications, including indiscipl"

First, like any grandfather, I want my grandchildren to enjoy the beauty and bounty of a healthy planet and, like any human being, it grieves me to see that floods, droughts and fires are getting worse, that island nations will disappear, and uncounted species will become extinct. ""Second, as the head of the United Nations, I have prioritised climate change because no country can meet this challenge alone. ""Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. ""It is a threat to lives and livelihoods everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. ""Only through the United Nations can we respond collectively to this quintessentially global issue. ""The negotiation process has been slow and cumbersome. But we are seeing results. In response to the UN's call, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 per cent of emissions, have now submitted national climate plans with targets. ""If successfully implemented, these national plans bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately three degrees Celsius by the end of the century. ""At the same time, we must support countries to adapt to the inevitable consequences that are already upon us. ""The sooner we act the greater the benefits for all: increased stability and security; stronger, more sustainable economic growth; enhanced resilience to shocks; cleaner air and water and improved health. ""The climate change conference in Paris is not the end point. The responsibility now rests with governments to conclude a meaningful, binding agreement in Paris that provides clear rules of the road for strengthening global ambition,'' he said in a statement. Ban also said a meaningful climate agreement in Paris would build a better synergy to end poverty, improve public health, create new jobs and encourage green innovations. In view of Ban's directive, stakeholders in Nigeria have expressed optimism that the conference will provide an avenue for the country to interact with multilateral organisations on climate change. They observed that in an effort to put up a brilliant performance at the conference, the federal government started early preparations to mobilise support from development partners and donors since February. Mrs Nana Mede, the immediate past Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, said she had a strong belief that Nigeria would represent Africa competently at the conference. She urged Nigeria to submit a robust national climate action plan known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs, which should state a clear-cut pathway to reduce emissions from greenhouse gases. Mede also urged the negotiators to give their best at the conference in view of the impacts of climate change on both human and natural resources. She noted that such impacts manifested through increased frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding, droughts, desertification and increased sea temperature, among others. The former permanent secretary recalled that in 1992, the UN member states established the conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. She, however, observed that the UNFCCC and the subsequent Kyoto Protocol in 1997 could not provide enough solution to the challenge of climate change. ""Therefore, during the COP 19 in Warsaw, parties adopted a decision to prepare and submit fresh Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris COP 21,'' she said. Corroborating her view, Dr Samuel Adejuwon, Director, Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment, said that INDCs is a document required to be submitted by all parties to the UNFCCC at the Paris conference. According to him, countries signatory to the UNFCCC will negotiate a global climate agreement for the post-2020 period that will be adopted at the conference. He noted that the submission of the document was a major component of the climate change treaty likely to be adopted at COP 21. In view of this, the federal government, in collaboration with the UN Development Programme, UNDP, engaged the services of international consultants in June to work with national consultants and produce credible INDCs. At the stakeholders' consultative meeting with the consultants in Abuja, the UNDP urged Nigeria to come up with robust INDCs that would address climate change impact on the country. Mr Muyiwa Odele, Team Leader, UNDP Environment Unit, who represented UNDP Country Director, Dr Pa-Lamin Beyai, emphasised the need for Nigeria to meet up with its climate change commitments. ""This process of developing INDCs is extremely important for Nigeria, because of the leadership role that Nigeria plays in the area of climate change negotiations in Africa. ""If Nigeria is serious about taking forward the climate change agenda, it is important that the INDCs be developed in a very robust manner,'' he said.However, some stakeholders suggested that the INDCs should set realistic and achievable targets to reduce the greenhouse gases.They also suggested setting clear targets in some areas such as renewable energy and agricultural projects as mitigation measures.Prof. Daniel Gwary, a negotiator at COP, said as Nigeria prepared for COP 21, it should announce its preparedness to reduce emissions in l"

Agriculture and livestock considered as the main economic activities of the continent are heavily affected. The question becomes more a problem of survival than a development issue.\~Africa needs strong agreement and not argument here in Paris. -\~Sani AyoubaParticipants at the COP21 now expect a final deal tomorrow, December 13, as opposed to today when the summit was initially billed to end. A 27-page draft of the deal is however available which stipulates that temperature rises must be kept ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C"". \~According to Laurent Fabius, French Foreign Minister and COP21 Chairman, ""things are moving in the right direction"". The signed deal will become effective in 2020Despite the laudable progress witnessed so far, certain issues are yet to be met with a resolution. Top on the list is what negotiators have termed ""differentiation"", and it involves climate finance and the demarcation between developing nations and developed ones.The anticipation for a mutually beneficial and sustainable agreement has never been higher. As the final stages of negotiations steadily approach, Africa is still not out of the clear, and now is the most crucial of times to band together, speak with a united voice, and not settle for anything less than is attainable.As the world has come to agree, the job of fighting of change is not that of representatives and negotiators in Paris alone. Individuals from different walks of life have lent their voices to advocate for the salvation of the planet throughout the talks.Sani Ayouba Abdou is one of these distinguished set of ""climate saviours"". Since 2009, he has devoted his energy to Jeunes Volontaires pour l'Environnement (JVE) [Young Volunteers for the Environment], an NGO that encourages youth involvement in environmental issues. He talks to rural communities in Niger to raise awareness on environment issues and sustainable development. He holds a Master's degree in Project Management\~and\~has already been active in his community for a number of years. He was a leader in the Nigerien scouting movement from a young age.""People used to say that Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate change. This situation is increased by its poor state of economic development and low adaptive capacity as well as extreme poverty,"" Sani told Ventures. \~""Also, the absence or weakness of modern technologies in all sectors frequent natural disasters such as droughts and floods, and heavy dependence of agriculture on rainfall further increases the continent vulnerability. In analyzing the situation, it was established that the continent is not responsible for climate change but unjustly suffered the consequences of this phenomenon.""Sani is very engaged in climate change and renewable energy movement. He is strongly involved in the Beyond 2015 agenda (the transition of the MDGs to the SDGs), and the UN Negotiation on Climate Change (COP21).\~Sani is a\~2014 YALI Mandela Washington Fellow\~and attended a six-week Civic Leadership institute at the University of California at Berkeley.The Mandela fellowship honed his skills and reaffirmed his advocacy for the promotion of sustainable development by including youth and women. He was\~re-elected as Observer for Africa CSO to the\~World Bank Climate Investment Fund\~in Washington DC.According to him, the 21st UN Conference is an opportunity for Africa to demand climate justice for the benefit of its population and its strategic orientation towards development.""Africa must develop and climate change unfairly slows this drive,"" he told us. \~""For us as a young [population], this is our future and the future of Africa. This is why by participating in the 11th Conference of Youth Africans, we expressed our desire to be associated \~[with], and for an effective participation in all initiatives in the fight against climate change on the continent. Young people contribute to promote solutions for sustainable development through the education and behavior change to affirm their eco citizenship.""For Sani fighting climate change is about balancing the need to adapt to the change that will most certainly come while also working towards mitigation of further effects. This requires a financial commitment that \~is respected and clearly explained in addition to technology transfer that can help in both adaptation and mitigation.Sani is urging African leaders to stay united and strong in Paris climate talks in the interest of the continent:\~""As young activist that work directly with communities, we are here in Paris to advocate and push for a strong agreement and not arguments. We hear more arguments and now it's time for action, for a commitment and leadership that saves our planet in the benefice of humanity.""\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria39","President Buhari's Foreign Trips Not Frivolous - Lai Mohammed","December 05, 2015","Vanguard (Lagos)","The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has justified the many foreign trips of the President, saying that such trips by President Buhari since assuming office are critical to the implementation of his administration key policies of enhancing security, jump-starting the economy, creating jobs and fighting corruption.In a statement issued on Friday in Abuja and signed by the Special Assistant to the Minister of Information and Culture, Segun Adeyemi, the Minister said all the trips have started yielding fruits in terms of turning the tide in the fight against the insurgents, attracting investments in the range of billions of dollars, and securing global support for the administration's anti-corruption fight.""Nigerians, whether in the ruling or the opposition parties, have a right to ask questions about the activities of their President, but it is absolutely important that they do so from an informed, rather than partisan or sensational, standpoint,"" he said.The Minister explained that most of the President's trips to Nigeria's neighbouring countries of Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger, as well as to Germany, the US, France and the UN - were devoted to rallying regional and global support for the war against terrorism.""He was in Germany at the invitation of the G7 to solicit support from the Industrialized Nations for the war against terrorism. No one who has witnessed the killings and maiming in the past seven years by Boko Haram will call such trips frivolous. After all, the security and welfare of the citizens are the reason for the existence of any government.""The President's visit to South Africa was to attend the regular summit of the African Union; the trip to Ghana was aimed at fostering better relations with a brotherly country; the trip to India was for the India-Africa summit that provided the opportunity to explore ways of enhancing Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) from Indian investors.""On the trip to Iran, he also explained that the President represented Nigeria in the forum of Gas Exporting Countries, a veritable platform for discussing how to better harness Nigeria's abundant gas resources for industrial/domestic consumption and export, at a time of dwindling oil prices.""The President also travelled to Malta to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, from where he travelled to Paris for the UN . The President's second trip to South Africa since assuming office is for the China-Africa forum. On the few occasions that the President has embarked on a State Visit, he has tied that to an agenda that will further the quest for support for the war against terror and the efforts to enhance FDIs, thus stimulating economic growth and creating jobs,"" he said.He said that apart from rallying global support for the country's wars on terror and graft or seeking foreign investments, it is important that Nigeria leverages President Buhari's brand, a high integrity quotient and an embodiment of committed and dedicated leadership, to further Nigeria's relevance and visibility on the global stage.\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria40","A fair, efficient, and feasible climate agreement","December 21, 2015 Monday","Business Day","How should one evaluate the agreement reached in Paris this month at the United Nations ? No sooner was the deal announced on December 12 than the debate erupted.Some avid environmentalists were disappointed that the agreement did not commit firmly to limiting global warming to 1.5\'ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050.But such a commitment would not have been credible. What emerged in Paris was in fact better, because the negotiators were able to agree on practical steps in the right direction. Individual countries pledged to limit their emissions in the near term, with provisions for future monitoring and periodic reviews of targets. This is far better than setting lofty goals for the distant future while giving little reason to think that they would be met. The important thing is to get started.In four key respects, the agreement is a good one for those who regard global climate change as an important problem and want to take feasible steps to address it.First, and most important, participation is comprehensive, with 188 countries offering individual commitments, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). In the past, only rich countries were expected to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions; developing countries were explicitly spared that within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. That had to change, partly because it is in developing countries, not the advanced economies, that emisssions are growing the fastest. Furthermore, countries like the United States would not agree to limit their emissions if they feared that carbon-emitting industry would simply migrate to developing countries.Second, the agreement includes a process of future assessment and revision of targets. Every five years, the parties will take stock and renew the commitments. Targets can be adjusted in light of future developments to be more or less aggressive, (probably more, if the scientists' predictions are borne out). Negotiations on the INDC revisions are to begin in 2018, even though the first set of targets is scheduled to take effect in 2020.Third, the Paris deal takes steps toward transparency in monitoring, reporting, and verifying countries' progress. Starting in 2023, countries are to report every five years on compliance with their emissions targets. The US and Europe had to push China and India to agree to this. But without transparency, the INDCs would not be credible.Fourth, the agreement contains mechanisms to facilitate international linkage, including scope for residents of rich countries to finance emissions reductions in poor countries. This is important because it is cheaper to pay a poor country to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants than it is to shut down an existing plant in a rich country. And achieving the first period's INDCs at low cost will be an important determinant of countries' willingness to take further steps in future periods.Achieving more aggressive environmental goals, particularly limiting warming to 1.5\'baC, or zero greenhouse-gas emissions in the second half of the century, would of course be desirable in terms of minimizing the risk of disaster scenarios. In fact, the first INDCs, by themselves, are nowhere near enough even to limit warming to 2\'baC (the global goal that was agreed in Canc\'fan in 2010).But proclaiming ambitious targets is very different from achieving them. It is almost beside the point that the economic cost of pursuing a goal of 1.5\'baC would be very high. In any case, leaders can't make credible commitments 35 years into the future. And the plan needs to be credible if it is to influence myriad business decisions made today.Some developing-country leaders may be displeased for another reason: the figure of $100 billion in finance from rich countries does not appear in the legally binding body of the agreement. The rich countries did admit their moral responsibility to help small island states, for example, cope with 'loss and damages' from sea-level rise. But they rejected demands for formal acceptance of legal liability.This was a reasonable outcome in a difficult situation. Rich countries can't deny that their past emissions have inflicted harm on the world. In a domestic legal system, an entity whose land was, say, flooded would have a claim to compensation from the entity that had caused the damage. But sovereign countries are not operating in such a system. The $100 billion in finance has always seemed problematic. The developing countries fear that the rich countries won't deliver the money, at least not cash; and they are right. The rich countries fear that such 'reparations' would disappear into the pockets of local elites; and they, too, are right. So it is better not to make promises.The poor countries do have a strong case. The average American still accounts for ten times the emissions of the average citizen of India, and India should not be deprived of the right to develop economically. But the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets. The efforts that richer countries promised should be - and generally are - greater than the efforts of poor countries. The richer a country is, the earlier the date at which its emissions should peak. The richer it is, the more sharply its target should cut emissions relative to the basel"

Hopefully, with these elements in the new deal, we are well on our way towards tackling the impacts of climate change on the continent.""Beyai said, ""As the day moves closer, with about 196 countries getting ready to sign a new climate change agreement, we in Africa and especially Nigeria would need to ensure that a favourable outcome is obtained as a befitting reward for Nigeria and in recognition of the efforts of the Permanent Secretary (of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Mrs. Nana Mede) and her team, who all have been working round the clock.""Beyai stated this in his opening remarks at a training organised for Nigeria's negotiators that will be at the Climate Change conference in Paris.The training was supported by the UNDP in partnership with the Department of Climate Change, of the Federal Ministry of Environment, under its Climate Diplomacy programme, which the Country Director said, ""Is aimed at increasing Nigeria's presence and influence on international politics, notably within the UNFCCC framework, in a way that actively contributes to building the key conditions for successful mitigation and adaptation in the country.""The UNDP's desire, he said was that the training would increase the awareness of the strong linkages between climate change and sustainable development policies in Nigeria and specifically result in; The establishment of a gender balanced core group of national negotiators, with increased capacity to support Nigerian climate negotiations.""Secondly, that it will foster deeper dialogue and cooperation across a network of national and sub-national technical experts and leaders in the field of international relations, economic development, forestry, natural resources management, green economy, national development and financial planning.""And thirdly, that it would provide an enduring platform for national discussions that will in turn define Nigeria's position and contribution to the UNFCCC COP21 in Paris.""A strong deal, Beyai said would not only help Nigeria meet her international obligations, eliminate poverty, improve health and the living standards of the people, make agriculture a flourishing sector, but that it would also help increase investment opportunities, especially in clean and renewable energy solutions, and as well as develop the much needed human and institutional capacities to undergird these progress.He reminded the trainees that ""the current emissions on the greenhouse gas runs out in 2020, but what happens in the decade after that and beyond is the big question we need to ask ourselves. For us here, we would like to see Nigeria along with other African countries develop a common position to address climate change challenges and its adverse effects on her population's livelihood.""He said the membership of the trainees in the core team ""is vitally crucial, in ensuring that Nigeria plays its leadership role in climate change negotiations, effectively. This is why you all have been carefully selected to become the foundation and bedrock of a revitalised national climate change negotiation team and we are quite confident that collectively, you are up to the task.""Beyai congratulated the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Mrs. Nana Mede ""on the timely completion of the draft Nigeria Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), developed with the support of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and to assure of our continuing support.""Mrs. Mede, who declared open the training, said it was timely considering that the world was expecting a new climate change agreement to be adopted during COP21 in Paris.Nigeria, she said has been part of the negotiation within the context of the African group in the climate change process right from the onset of the UNFCCC adopted in 1992. ""We participated in the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol and we remain active in the potential climate change agreement expected in Paris, France later in the year.""She said, ""Nigeria's position in terms of the UNFCCC negotiation and along that of the African Group suggests a scheme based on equitable multilateral rules with a strong link to fair access to sustainable financing. Nigeria wishes to see a global objective for adaptation and a mitigation objective in the 2015 agreement to limit global warming to below 20C compared with pre-industrial levels.""The Permanent Secretary said the African Group proposes the use of a reference framework to reflect mitigation actions and adaptation measures taken by the countries that would lead to equity. ""We will, therefore, continue to stress in our negotiation the necessity for the developed country Parties in the climate change process to come forward with ambitious scale of emission reduction both in the pre- and post-2020 Agreement.""The training, she said was also expected to strengthen the technical capacity of Nigeria in the development of actions that allow the mainstreaming of climate change into national and sectoral development goals by continuing the institutional and technical capacity strengthening process.""Thereafter, she launched the National Policy on Climate Change and the Department of Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment's Improved Website.The Director, Department of Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment, Dr. S.A. Adejuwon presented a 'Brief Overview on the Status of Negotiation Towards UNFCCC COP 21: From Durban, South Africa enroute Paris, France.'Dr. Adejuwon said the training was for experts, including people from the Academia; government; non-governmental organisations about the art of negotiating, especially climate change issues to enhance their capacity. The main negotiators would be drawn from the experts present at the training.He stated that the Nigerian team would strive to arrive at the conference early so that they can take part in the negotiation from the beginning, stressing that ""It is important to be there on time, because if you are not there during the Regional Group/African Group meeting/G77 Group meeting then you will be completely lost as per the position that is going to be negotiated. Those are the Groups where you also have to ensure that your position is negotiated. You have to ensure that what the African Group is passing on to the G77 contains your position and what G77, as a bigger Regional Grouping, is passing on to the Main Plenary also reflects your position.""The key issue that would be on the table at the conference, he said is the consideration of all Thematic Areas highlighted in the Co-chair Text that would lead to the adoption of another climate change agreement in Paris.He said Nigeria wants the new agreement to address the inadequacies of the previous Treaties in terms of why have the two existing Treaties become inadequate. ""For instance, under the Convention, have we been able to meet the target or have the developed countries been able to meet their target or their commitment under the Kyoto Protocol? These have not been met; so we regard them as inadequate; then we have to make sure that all these are properly addressed. We need an ambitious scale of emission reduction to help the climate. Therefore, the contribution of the developed countries to be submitted should be ambitious enough to help the climate.""He said it was important for this to happen because if at the initial stage we discover that all those emission commitments under the INDC are not going to be helpful to the climate then there is no point in having another agreement because we already have two existing agreements that are not adequate in terms of their emission reduction, in terms of finance and capacity building. Whichever one we are coming about in Paris must address all these inadequacies.""Adejuwon said the good news about the Paris agreement was that it would not become operational until 2020, ""meaning that even if the INDC submitted now are adequately addressing the problem of climate change, there will be room for review of the INDC by various Parties before 2020 and maybe have something that will be very adequate to help the climate.""Legal Perspective of the outcome in Paris was presented by Mr. Huzi I.

The year, 2015, has been adjudged the warmest on record but experts warn that 2016 would even be hotter. Over the past 100 years, 14 of the hottest summers have occurred since the year 2000 and the world is already suffering from rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, increased droughts, erratic storms, among others.In Nigeria, 2015 has been adjudged the warmest on record, although experts warned that 2016 would even be hotter.Global effort to save the dying world led 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to a unanimous pledge to speedily curb emissions, strengthen resilience and take common climate actions. This was the highpoint of two weeks of tireless negotiations at the United Nations (COP21), held between November 30 and December 12, at Le Bourget, Paris, France. The leaders set a target of keeping global temperature rises below 2C (35F) and a five-year aim to increase ambition on cutting emissions.At the conference, the world agreed with one voice that the warning signals of climate change were harbinger of doom, and constituted one of the biggest threats of our time. The Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Magdy Martinez-Soliman, had in an urgent message at the event warned that climate change has exacerbated existing economic, political and humanitarian issues around the world.""Hard-won gains that have helped communities increase access to food, health, education and other needs are at risk.

Membership of the Senator Schwarzenegger 'Regions of Climate Action' (R20) Organisation was conferred on Ogun State on the occasion.Other dignitaries from the partnering institutions at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference included Mr Peter Hoddinott, Area Manager South and West Africa LafargeHolcim Mrs Adepeju Adebajo, CEO, Cement, Lafarge Africa Plc Richard Eckrich, Head, Infrastructure Fund, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and Dr Henry Neufeldt, Head, Climatic Change Unit of the World Agro-forestry Centre.Commenting on the Ogun State's participation at the climate conference, Governor Amosun said: ""The Forest Landscape Restoration project is a well thought out initiative, in partnership with two responsible institutions, NSIA and Lafarge Africa.""He noted that almost 70 per cent of Ogun State is arable land. There is therefore a significant potential for improving lives and livelihoods.Governor Amosun stated that the agro-forestry project is a win-win opportunity for companies and citizens, offering a range of benefits: it will reduce CO2 emissions by increasing vegetation and eliminating the current negative slash-and-burn practices it will create employment for young graduates and will help to diversify Nigeria's economy.Governor Amosun insisted on the absolute importance to address simultaneously, the short-term job creation necessity while preparing the climate change mitigation long-term challenge.Commenting on its commitment to the realisation of the project, Mr Peter Hoddinott, who is also the Group Managing Director/CEO Lafarge Africa Plc, said, ""as a responsible organisation we are working to minimise the impact of our activity on the climate. Lafarge Africa plans to replace 30 per cent of its fuel use from fossil to biomass by 2020. We need to put in place a solid structure to move into renewable energy, which is clearly what this partnership offers.""Speaking at the event on behalf of Mr Uche Orji, MD/CEO of NSIA, Richard Eckrich, said: ""The NSIA recognises the importance of agriculture to the economy a sector which employs around 70 per cent of Nigeria's population.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria45","Inclusive Growth and Global Justice","November 16, 2015","Daily Independent (Lagos)","As France and the world mourn the terrorist slaughter of innocents in Paris, the leaders of the G-20 are meeting in Antalya, Turkey.Terror will now vault to the top of the long list of pressing issues that will be discussed. The G-20, whose members account for about 85% of the world economy, has an important responsibility to respond to challenges that affect the lives and prosperity of millions of people around the world. It cannot risk falling into complacency and inaction, whether regarding terrorism or the fragile state of the world's economy.Since Turkey assumed the presidency of the G-20 in December 2014, our approach toward ensuring inclusive and robust growth through collective action has enjoyed the support of the organization's members. This effort has been built on three pillars: decisive implementation of past commitments, boosting investments as a powerful driver of the global economy, and promotion of inclusiveness so that the benefits of growth are shared by all.When it comes to implementation, great strides have been made. By promoting sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and implementing solid, structural reforms, we have made significant progress toward our objective of expanding the G-20's collective GDP by 2.1% by 2018. The global financial system is now more resilient than it has ever been. Financial capacities are being rebuilt, and new growth targets are being met.But there remains much more to be done. G-20 members should expedite efforts to deliver on their commitments to boost productivity and eliminate structural bottlenecks to investment, competition, trade, and jobs. We must also cement the fundamental reforms to the global financial system that the G-20 has delivered over the past seven years.Our focus on investment - a key driver of growth, jobs, and development - is also beginning to pay off. There is a huge investment gap in the global economy, both in advanced and developing countries. That is why we need developed-country strategies that bring together concrete policy actions and commitments to improve the investment ecosystem, support small and-medium-size enterprises, and promote the construction of efficient, high-quality infrastructure. If the G-20 members fully implement their commitments under these strategies, their collective GDP is expected to increase by another 1%.Economic growth must be strong and sustainable; but, above all, it must be inclusive. Inequality is rising in many G-20 countries; in some cases, it has reached historic highs. This is a dangerous development, one that can retard growth, threaten the cohesion of societies, and jeopardize people's wellbeing. It is imperative that the G-20 tackle inequality head on and demonstrate its determination to ensure that all of its member countries' citizens enjoy the fruits of economic growth.Reducing unemployment is central to the fight against inequality. There are about 100 million jobless people in the G-20, and another 200 million young people who are neither working nor studying. Significantly reducing youth unemployment is one of the G-20's most important commitments.Inclusiveness cannot stop at the borders of the G-20. We must work to ensure that the benefits of growth and prosperity are shared by people all over the world. In Antalya, we will discuss how we can align our efforts with the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and increase our engagement with low-income, developing countries.As politics and economics are increasingly intertwined, the G-20 must also work together to confront our era's geopolitical challenges. This year is an important one in the fight against climate change. We must send a strong political message from Antalya in support of a successful outcome at the United Nations that takes place in Paris from November 30 to December 11.Meanwhile, the terror attacks in Paris have brutally reminded us, once again, that global challenges - such as terrorism, the war in Syria, and the refugee crisis - require truly global responses. The G-20 is an ideal forum in which to address them.The Syrian civil war - now well into its fourth year - must be brought to an end, and a fair and sustainable political transition must be ensured. The conflict and the brutal state terrorism of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime is not only the cause of terrible suffering in Syria and the death of more than 360,000 people; it is also the root of the refugee crisis and the emergence of Daesh - a threat to all countries. Turkey is a member of the coalition against Daesh, and we are seeking to degrade and destroy this terrorist menace in our country and beyond our borders.At the same time, we must not allow ourselves to forget the plight of those fleeing the brutality of the Assad regime and Daesh. The international community that shuddered at the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian toddler who was found dead on a Turkish beach, must be made to remember that many more like him are dying every day in the cold waters of the Mediterranean and the Aegean.Turkey is currently hosting some 2.2 million Syrian refugees, and we have spent more than $8 billion over the last three years caring for them. The international community must agree on a mechanism that ensures that the burden is fairly shared.Finally, it is important to note that Turkey continues to confront the threat of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organization listed as a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union. Turkey has implemented a large number of reforms and made major investments to the benefit of our Kurdish citizens. And yet the PKK has refused to disarm, instead amassing weapons and attacking civilian and security targets across the country. As we continue to fight the scourge of terrorism in our country, we call on all countries not only to mourn the dead in Paris, but to reject terrorism in all of its forms.The G-20 Summit in Antalya will address these and other major issues confronting the world. Whether the subject is economics, finance, climate change, or politics, the guiding principle must be equality and justice for all.\l"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria47","Training the next generation of African experts to tackle climate change","December 17, 2015 Thursday","Business Day","Ahead of COP21The potential benefits of increasing Africa's renewable capacity are significant. It has been predicted, for example, that solar power could become the continent's most significant power source by 2050. This requires substantial financial investment and the development of local technical capacity. Unfortunately, there is a significant skills shortage in the areas of climate monitoring, reporting, mitigation and adaptation on the African continent. As a result, it is of paramount importance that African governments build capacity at community, academic and institutional levels to produce actionable knowledge-based strategies which address the many and varied problems of climate change.Due to climate change, Africa has been heavily hit by droughts, rising sea levels and new weather patterns. The decreasing levels of rainfall in Africa are undermining harvests and contributing to food shortages. These issues are compounded by Africa's often marginalised voice in matters of climate change on the world stage. If concrete actions are not taken, more than 43 million people could fall into extreme poverty by 2030. In the face of the associated disaster risks, complex and transdisciplinary solutions are required. Such measures must be supported by careful planning, building and sharing of scientific knowledge and early warning systems. The technical aspects of each process must be underpinned by a rigorous research agenda which is directly applicable and usable for governments and policy makers across the continent.In light of these overarching trends, the role of the Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences (PAUWES) is of vital importance in pooling resources and coordinating research and training in Africa to navigate the risks brought by climate change. The discussions at COP21 will undoubtedly highlight the need for capacity building in the form of educational training in Africa, and PAUWES sits at the nexus of such efforts.PAUWES is a trilateral project between the African Union, Algeria and Germany. Algeria is proud to host the Institute, which is situated on the campus of the University of Tlemcen, as it aligns with the new national programme of development of renewable energy launched by the Algerian Government to horizon 2030.Translating academia into policymaking, PAUWES is collaborating with African and European experts to design and implement a research agenda which will support governments across Africa in making strategic decisions and facing climate change head on. For example, one area that PAUWES is focusing on is growing technical capacity related to green growth, water management and security. This gives PAUWES a critical position in contributing to a more environmentally, politically and commercially sustainable outlook on the continent.PAUWES has a specific responsibility and assigned role to implement research programmes identified in the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa 2024 (STISA-2024) published by the African Union. This highlights the pan-African significance of the institution and its role in contributing to a lasting change in Africa in the area of climate change policies and strategies. Given PAUWES' focus on water and energy sectors, the institute is in a position to provide specialist insight and research on these vital areas for the continent. In particular, it will consider ways in which to facilitate much greater innovation, entrepreneurship and technology transfer that could raise the quality of research and higher education in Africa.Ultimately, the institute's underlying aspiration and role is to train students, equipping them with the skills that they need to translate ideas into reality.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria53","Time for LPG Policy in Nigeria","January 05, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","With President Muhammadu Buhari's recent commitment to reduce Nigeria's greenhouse gas emission by 20 per cent in 2020, Ejiofor Alike writes on the need for the federal government to develop an actionable policy to encourage Nigerians to switch over from the use of dirty fuels such as kerosene, firewood and coal to the use of liquefied petroleum gas, better known as cooking gasThe use of kerosene, firewood and coal as domestic fuel is associated with a lot of health hazards, in addition to the destruction of the ecosystem and the climate change effect, according to health experts and environmentalists. For instance, one of the latest reports of the World Health Organisation (WHO) showed that the use of firewood, coal and kerosene as domestic fuel causes indoor pollution, which accounts for over four million deaths globally every year. According to WHO, of the three billion people worldwide that cook and heat their homes using open fires, coal and simple stoves burning biomass - wood, animal dung and crop waste; a total of 4.3 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels.The report further revealed that more than 50 per cent of premature deaths among children under five are due to pneumonia caused by particulate matter (soot) inhaled from household air pollution; while 3.8 million die prematurely annually from non-communicable diseases, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer are attributed to exposure to household air pollution.Of the 4.3million that die yearly due to domestic pollution, the world body noted that 12 per cent deaths are due to pneumonia; 34per cent from stroke; 26 per cent from ischaemic heart disease; 22per cent from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and six per cent from lung cancer.Nigeria ranks high in the use of kerosene, firewood and coal as domestic sources of energy.Despite local and global interventions to address the problem of Nigeria's local under-utilisation of LPG as domestic fuel, the country has remained one of the lowest consumers of the product in sub-Saharan Africa and the highest consumer of firewood, kerosene and other dirty fuels.The World Bank and the World LP Gas Association (WLPGA) had in 2003 developed a strategic roadmap for the country but this measure could not promote the growth of LPG market due to lack of a deliberate policy on the part of government to promote the use of the product.The poor utilisation of LPG degenerated to the extent that by 2007, the product was virtually disappearing from the Nigerian market, following the collapse of the refineries, the country's main supplier.The development forced an intervention by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who directed the Nigeria LNG Limited to set aside a certain volume of its production for the local market.This step, which was government's greatest intervention in the history of the LPG sector in Nigeria, successfully resolved the supply challenges as NLNG initially set aside 100,000 metric tonnes yearly for the local market.However, it has failed to encourage the use of LPG as the government has continued to promote the use of other dirty fuels, particularly, kerosene.While other countries such as India, Indonesia and several others have sincedeveloped actionable policies to switch over their citizens from the use of dirty fuels to LPG, the federal government has continued to pay subsidy on kerosene to encourage the use of the product at the detriment of LPG, which is safer, cleaner and a more environmental-friendly product.Even the LPG supplied by the NLNG is sold in the domestic market at international market price, despite the fact that it is Nigeria's natural endowment that is produced locally.Buhari's commitment on greenhouse gas emission However, as the country's contribution to address the issue of climate change, which has become a global issue, President Buhari recently committed to cut its greenhouse gas emission by 20 per cent from year 2020.The Presidential spokesman, Mr. Femi Adesina had also revealed that President Buhari had approved the submission of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to address climate change to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), during the recent meeting of the world leaders in Paris for the United Nations , or COP 21.The action plan reaffirms President Buhari's commitment to an economic transformation which places inclusive, green growth as key priority for this administration, the statement said.He said President Buhari was fully aware of the acute threat that climate change poses to Nigeria's development through flooding, desertification and insecurity, stressing that many of these accrue from weather-related natural disasters.Reduction of GHG emission Though the role of LPG in the INDC prepared by the federal government to address the issue of climate change could not be ascertained, it is evidently clear that the promotion of the use of the product above other fuels will help the government to realise its 2020 aspiration of reducing GHG emission by 20 per cent.The dirty smokes from coal, firewood and kerosene causes health hazards and alters the natural composition of the climate, thus causing climate change.Also the felling down of trees for firewood has resulted to desertification and other weather-related disasters.So, any measures adopted by the government to encourage the use of LPG and discourage the use of kerosene and other dirty fuels will contribute significantly to reduce greenhouse gas emission as committed by President Buhari.At the recent fifth annual conference of the Nigeria LPG Association held in Lagos recently with the theme ""LPG: The Future is Here,"" the President of the Nigerian LPG Association, Mr. DayoAdeshina insisted that LPG would play a significant role in realising President Buhari's commitment in Paris.""LPG plays significant role in achieving that if we can make that switch from the dirty fuels like kerosene, firewood and coal to LPG. Nigerians need to be aware of the role LPG plays. We have been saying it for years but nobody listens. But the time has come for the government to take control; and to take charge of the awareness campaign to switch people if they truly want that 20 per cent reduction,"" he said.He urged the federal government to adopt the Indonesian model by providing cylinders to help Nigerians to switch over to the use of LPG.In his speech, Director/Head of Import and Export Operations at Borkir International Company Limited, Mr. SahadiTukurhowever said for LPG to penetrate deeply into the Nigerian market, the problem of logistics should be addressed.""If you have LPG but you don't have logistics to deliver it, it is as good as not having the product. We have to agree that logistics is the key in the business. Nigerians are very resilient. Roads are bad and we are having difficulty accessing money from the banks but we should keep on moving. We will be there one day,"" Tukur said.Also speaking, Mr. Femi Fanoiki of Longview Gas called for the construction of LPG terminals in other parts of the country to reduce over-dependence on Lagos and the attendant risks and costs of trucking product from Lagos to other parts of the country. ""We had expected additional terminals in other parts of the country but everybody still comes to Lagos to load LPG,"" he added.In his remarks, Mr. DitanOyekan of TSL Logistics said investment in infrastructure was key to the growth of LPG consumption in the country.""We have now learnt that it takes eight days to do a complete cycle from Kano to Lagos. The Apapa problem will not go away in three months. Railway is another option but the rail infrastructure is dilapidated. So, how are we going to prevent these challenges from stopping our business? Even though it may take time to pay back but investment in infrastructure is the way to go,"" Oyekan explained.Removal of kerosene subsidy In addition to the challenges of getting LPG cylinders and accessories, the subsidy paid on kerosene by the federal government to encourage the use of the product by subsidising the cost is also one of the greatest threats to the use of LPG in the country.To encourage the use of LPG, Adeshina has also cautionedthe government against subsidising kerosene when the country has cheaper, cleaner and safer alternative fuel. Also speaking at the recent Nigeria LP Gas conference, a Professor at University of California, Berkley, Dr. Kirk Smith, said that ailments related to dirty fuel like kerosene and firewood would kill more Nigerians if nothing is done to encourage the use of cleaner fuel for cooking, powering machines, fuelling vehicles, among others. Delivering a paper entitled: ""LPG and the Health of the World's Poor,"" Smith revealed that when firewood is used as domestic fuel, it produces smoke that is equivalent to the amount produced by 400 cigarettes per hour.Challenges of cylinders/accessories About 10 years ago, the only source of supply of LPG in this country was through the refineries. About the same time, the only LPG terminal in Lagos was the one built by Pipel"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria56","On the global climate deal and Nigeria's pledged actions","December 21, 2015 Monday","Business Day","This is a year of big global events, of multilateral negotiations and regime formation. I have followed these global talks closely because I have intellectual and professional interests in the legal and political economy aspects of global governance. I believe the multilateral negotiations reveal the potential for cooperative action in global governance, but they also tell us something about the self-interest and game-theoretical considerations that stop nations from cooperating. For me, three of these multilateral events stand out this year. I have written about two of them in this column; the third is the subject of this piece.Unarguably, the first major global diplomatic event this year was the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, held in New York from 25 to 27 September, when world leaders adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The summit itself was preceded by the Third International Conference on Financing for Development held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from13 to 16 July. Then, last week, as I wrote on these pages, the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC10) took place from 15 to 18 December in Nairobi, Kenya. However, a week before the trade summit, the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention in Climate Change (UNFCCC) had taken place in Paris from 30 November to 11 December.These global events are important because of the linkages and synergies between them. The development, environmental and trade issues are complementary, which is why the three summits make reference to one another in their agendas. For instance, the Sustainable Development Agenda strongly emphasises the role of climate action (goal 13 of the SDGs) and trade (goal 8) in meeting the development objectives and targets. However, while negotiating the SDGs was relative non-contentious, securing new agreements in the trade and climate regimes have usually proved difficult.This is why the conclusion of a climate treaty at COP21 in Paris is remarkable. The climate agreement has been described superlatively as 'the first universal climate treaty ever', a 'major leap for mankind' and a climate deal that will 'change the world'. The rhetoric has, indeed, been stratospheric! But is the agreement truly historic? If so, why and what does it actually say? Furthermore, what's Nigeria's contribution to the Paris deal? I will deal with the systemic questions first, then come to Nigeria's pledged actions. To answer the systemic questions, we should first take a brief tour of the history of climate talks to give us some perspective on what was achieved at COP21 in Paris.Now, the starting point in our narrative is the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. For it was in Rio that the international climate regime was created with the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention in Climate Change (UNFCCC). The convention was signed in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. The UNFCCC was established to tackle global climate change through legally binding climate agreements, negotiated by its supreme decision-making body, the Conference of the Parties (COP). However, since its first COP in Berlin, Germany, in 1995, it constant struggled to produce a universal treaty. While every country agreed that climate change poses severe and even irreversible dangers and needs to be tackled, none wanted to accept binding national carbon production targets. As the Oxford professor, Dieter Helm, puts it in his book, The Carbon Crunch, 'when it comes to climate change, self-interest and collective interest are very different'.However, the Kyoto Protocol made some progress in setting binding carbon productions targets. It was adopted in 1997, entered into force until 2005 and remains in force until 2020. But the protocol is flawed in at least two respects. First, it is expected to cover only 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emission by 2020. Second, the United States, the world's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2), releasing 5.6 billion tonnes (15 per cent of the world's total), did not ratify the Protocol because China did not have a cap. China, of course, is the world's biggest emitter CO2, releasing 9.5 billion tonnes (27 per cent of the world's total). Given these limitations, efforts were made at several COPs to develop a successor to the Protocol that is legally-binding, ambitious and universal.For instance, attempts were made at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009to produce a binding treaty. But those efforts failed after the US and China rejected the EU's call for a legally-binding treaty. However, COP15 was not without some success. While it didn't result in a treaty, it nevertheless produced a political agreement that cleared the path for the Paris agreement. The political agreement, albeit reached by a small set of countries, was to keep increase in long-term average temperatures below two degree Celsius (2C), relative to pre-industrial levels. They also agreed to establish the Green Climate Fund through which $100 billion per year of public and private climate finance would be available to developing countries by 2020. This pivotal political deal was later formalised by 196 countries at COP16 in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, under what was known as the Cancun Agreement.Yet, it subsequently proved difficult to turn the Cancun Agreement into a legally binding treaty. At COP17 in Durban, South Africa, in 2011, the US, China and India continued to resist pressure from the EU to create legally binding emissions targets, and even Japan, Canada and Russia did not want a 'Kyoto plus' agreement. Despite the conference being extended for a couple of days, all that was agreed was an £greement' to try to reach an agreement! Things began to look a little better, however, at COP20 in Lima, Peru, in 2014. In Lima, the countries agreed to communicate their Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDCs), their pledged actions, under a new treaty, well in advanced of COP21 in Paris. It was this heavy build-up to COP21, coupled with the political will to reach an agreement, which led to the success of the talks.But how historic is the Paris agreement? Well, two things are certainly remarkable about the deal. The first is the scale of the ambition, the second the coverage. On the first, Article 2 of the agreement commits the parties to 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial level'. The commitment to aim to limit average temperature increase to '1.5C' was not envisaged before the conference, but it has been widely welcomed as the level of ambition needed to face the challenges of climate change. The second remarkable achievement is that the Paris deal was agreed by 195 countries, including the big emitters, China, the US, the EU and India. This comprehensive coverage thus, indeed, makes the Paris agreement 'the first universal climate treaty ever'!Yet, despite all that, the treaty is still inadequate in one critical respect: it is not legally binding. It is more or less a statement of promise. For instance, it is stated in the preamble that 'the Agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation'. Furthermore, although Articles 13 and 14 of the treaty creates a stringent monitoring and transparency regime, including a 'global stocktake', which involves a periodic stocktaking of the implementation of the agreement, it is stated clearly in Article 15 that the mechanism to facilitate compliance with the agreement shall be 'non-adversarial and non-punitive'; in other words, the agreement is not enforceable!The truth is that there would have been no agreement in Paris if countries were required to accept legally binding obligations. One interesting incident during the negotiation aptly illustrates this. In the draft Agreement that was presented for adoption, Article 4.4 had stated that the developed countries 'shall' continue to take the lead to reduce economy-wide emission, while developing countries 'should' continue to enhance their mitigation efforts. But the US objected to the word 'shall' and insisted it be changed to 'should'. In other words, the US did not want a legally binding obligation. The developing countries, particularly the Africans, opposed the removal of the word 'shall' from the developed countries' commitments. But without the US there would be no agreement. So, in the end, to prevent the talks breaking down without a deal, 'shall' was changed to 'should'.But, let's be clear, the treaty will not be without some bite. The stocktaking mechanism will ensure that countries are held accountable for their compliance with the agreement. Furthermore, the transparency mechanism will result in countries that fail to fulfil their national pledges being 'named and shamed'. However, although such reputational measures may have some effect of inducing compliance with the treaty, they are not the same as having a legally binding commitment.Now, what about Nigeria's contribution to the Paris climate deal? Well, for a start, I would say that Nigeria's preparation for the Paris talks was shoddy. Nigeria did not submit its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions until almost the last minute, despite two deadl"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria60","Gorilla Glue for Buhari [opinion]","December 12, 2015","This Day (Lagos)","It is difficult, indeed impossible, to know what exactly transpires inside the mind of a man. Even psychologists --- those pretty well informed about the infinite variety of the human mind --- may well tell you so. But I'm reasonably certain that President Muhammadu Buhari's mind gladdens exceedingly at every opportune moment to travel outside Nigeria for any event that ranges from the most ridiculous to the least sublime.Since Buhari was sworn in as president about six months ago, one has lost count of the number of official trips he has made overseas. If you factor unofficial trips into the equation, then be prepared to go as far back as when he made that much talked-about unscheduled visit to the United Kingdom (what for? I still don't know) ahead of his swearing-in earlier this year.Now no one begrudges the president of Nigeria his right to travel outside the country for official or unofficial business; that, at the very least, comes with the territory. And boy, Nigerian presidents sure do love to gallop in and out of the country. Remember President Shehu Shagari? Well, the former president gained a jaw-dropping reputation for his nonstop junkets abroad in his exquisitely embroidered babaringa outfits. It did not matter whether the country was burning at the time, the frequency of Shagari's mostly sybaritic foreign trips was not to be interrupted. Self-styled military president Ibrahim Babangida circled the globe in eight years, and in much ostentation, too. The only place he did not visit officially, and please correct me if my memory suffers from cataract here, was the United States where he would have loved to be feted by then President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. Babangida, probably the smartest of Nigerian leaders in the last 50 years, lobbied obsequiously for this trip in such a way as portrayed him as having lost his self-respect and the dignity pertaining to the office he held.In his Second Coming, Olusegun Obasanjo, the irreverent critic, also did what he once lambasted Shagari for. And like Shagari also, Goodluck Jonathan turned his attention elsewhere as his country combusted. Even when a section of the country was under siege by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram with as many as 2,000 victims just slain by the group in Baga village in January, Jonathan, the outsider who cried louder than the bereaved, the Rip van Winkle who would help other men's wives with chores while those meant for his wife remained untouched, still found both the time and sufficient ""reason"" to travel to Paris imaginatively, if not physically, to join the leaders of other countries gathered there to mourn the 12 victims of Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical weekly, who had been gunned down by Islamic terrorists in January. Jonathan came under searing fire for that, especially for his failure to acknowledge the worse tragedy that had just happened in his own country. Nigerian leaders have a large natural propensity for doing outrageous things.It is that same ailment that Buhari appears to be terribly suffering from, and his strain, already so exasperating, threatens to be without precedent and, as a consequence, remedy. As I wrote this, the president was in far-away Paris attending to some universal problems with rather mundane, humdrum significance in comparison with a multiplicity of internal travails in clamorous need of urgent, sustained attention. This is by no means an attempt to discount the importance of safe-guarding our environment from willful human depredation, but shouldn't President Buhari be home at the time looking for that elusive silver bullet to the very heart of Boko Haram instead of being at the United Nations where all he was required to do was give one or two presentations and yawn and get some sleep and watch a football match and then jet back home?Buhari must have woken up last Sunday morning in Paris to yet another sad news of Boko Haram attack on yet another northeastern Nigerian town. As is consistent with many of the group's attacks, Sunday's attacks was audacious. The group stormed a military base in Gulak town, Yola, sending soldiers to flight. It fell to the town's civilian population to repel the terrorists and reclaim their town. Why does this have to be so? Why are Nigerian soldiers still impotent under the firepower of Boko Haram many months after Buhari promised to lick the problem?But as seemingly intractable a problem as Boko Haram is, it is only one of many others Nigerians have found so wearisome under Buhari. Government is not working for many. Our democracy remains increasingly fractured with cries of secession issuing forth from parts of the south, cries we may ignore now at our own peril later. Buhari claims to be fighting corruption, but it has been, to use a hackneyed term, all motion with no progressive movement. Whole towns and villages remain without electric power. Millions are either out of job or have been without one in the first place for years. It took Buhari almost a lifetime before he finally emerged with a ministerial list, and when he did they were all men and women that did not justify the eternity he had invested into the search. It all reminded you of Diogenes, that legendary Greek figure who, carrying a lamp in broad day light, went from one Athenian street to another looking for an honest man. He never found any.We can go on and on. The bottom l"

This means that the power we need, the road and the railway, we can still get these infrastructures and have it in a way that is friendly to climate change that lowers emission and puts us on a low carbon growth path. How do we do that?""We have to get the private sector, we are looking at power, look at renewable energy, we are not saying renewable should be everything because Africa should have a mix. We can still use gas to some extent, but we should increase the renewable. Our companies that are investing should look at off- grid solutions, let our companies get off -grid solar solutions for our people before other people come into it because that is what always happens. Instead of flaring, we can use the gas, we can convert this gas for our use and I know government has the power to do that.""The former minister, who is also the Commissioner, Global Commission on the Economy and Climate spoke at a session titled: Climate Change in Africa: Financing Sustainable Pathways for Development at the ongoing Climate Change talks.She said the solution for climate change lies in Africa because of the opportunity to build renewable infrastructures on the continent.""Africa should stop playing the victim game. We are not supposed to be going to the West to beg as victims, we should be telling them that the solution is in Africa.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria62","FG Targets 2030 to End Gas Flare","January 05, 2016","Daily Trust (Abuja)","The federal government has planned to end gas flare in the country by 2030 according to the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), a mandatory but non-enforceable country level commitment to tackle the challenges of climate change submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The commitment submitted by Nigeria contained sets of strategy that would ensure that the country contributes to the successes of the Paris climate summit and grow its economy sustainably while reducing carbon pollution.The climate action plan seeks to considerably address the impact of climate change in the country as the northern part remains vulnerable to drought while sea-level rise, flooding, ocean surge and fluctuating weather patterns are common occurrences in the South.According to the plan, Nigeria aspires to achieve economic and social development by growing the economy 5percent per year, improving standard of living, electricity access for all under a mitigation objective of 20 per cent unconditional reduction in emissions and a 45 percent conditional reduction from business as usual.The INDCs identifies as key measures, the plan to work towards ending gas flaring by 2030, working towards off-grid solar PV of 13GW (13,000MW), deployment of efficient gas generators, and 2percent per year energy efficiency (30 percent by 2030).Other key measures are transport shift car to mass transit means, improving electricity grid and climate smart agriculture and reforestation.The plan reckons that under a business-as-usual growth scenario, consistent with strong economic growth of 5 percent per year, Nigeria's emissions are expected to grow to around 900 million tonnes per year in 2030, which translates to around 3.4 tonnes per person.The identified key measures could potentially reduce emissions by around 45 per cent, compared to business-as-usual.Nigeria's great potential for climate smart development is recognised in the plan with proposed support for implementation. Much of the reduction potential identified has zero net cost or indeed achieves a net economic benefit. The plan, therefore, is optimistic that the measures would benefit Nigeria, even before taking into account the climate benefits.Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed, said recently that following the outcome of COP21 in Paris, government was subjecting the INDCs to review to ensure that it becomes measurable, verifiable and achievable.\l"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria64","Climate change and Nigeria's energy mix","December 5, 2015 Saturday","Weekly Trust","The on-going Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change also known as COP21, will, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aim to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'c2\'b0C.The COP is the international political response to climate change that started at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.One of the major topics that delegates and the 142 heads of governments that are participating in the conference would spend much time to discuss is the transition to green energy.For Nigeria, the issue of insufficient energy is one that experts say is retarding the country's progress. Electricity is pivotal to the development of nations. Its use is directly correlated with healthy economic growth. In Nigeria only about 40 per cent of the citizens are connected to the energy grid. The situation has forced people to find their own sources of power hence the introduction of generating sets by households, businesses and offices.According to the Global Energy Network Institute, consistent blackouts have crippled the nation's once vibrant industrial sector.Nigeria's energy grid is arguably in crisis due to lack of development with experts arguing that the key to making a more reliable energy sector was to find and use renewable energy resources, rather than simply relying on the country's non-renewable resources.As part of efforts to solve the problem, government had issued licenses to various stakeholders to explore other sources of energy other than the gas and hydro that is powering the various power generating plants.Three out of the four above resources used for energy production in Nigeria are linked with increasing greenhouse gas emissions: coal, oil and natural gas, with coal emitting the worst of the three. According to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) the importance of sustainability in energy is: the ability to preserve its use, the importance of energy in living standards and for economic development and the significant impacts that energy systems and processes have had and continue to have on the environment.Nigeria needs to invest in sustainable resources because of the obvious signs that it will be strongly impacted by environmental change such as: desertification, droughts, flooding, and water shortages. The biggest blow to Nigeria would be the low lying areas that contain many of their natural resources being flooded if ocean levels rise as predicted, since further development of hydro-electricity does not seem practical because of the dependence on the seasons for amount of water supply.Wind energy has potentials, but is unreliable for consistent energy supply. Nuclear energy could be a viable solution to the energy problem because of its lack of emissions and reliability. Nigeria also has easy access to the uranium needed for the plants but the issue of safety and maintenance as well as community buy-in is still a challenge.The Ministry of Mines and Steel in the last few years granted licenses to a couple of companies to explore coal. Nigeria has a large natural supply of this fossil fuel making it relativity easy to access and it would be the cheapest resource to develop into energy plants but its impact on the environment is terrible.From the NIMET's info sheet, Nigeria is endowed with an annual daily sunshine that is averagely 6.25 hours, and an annual average daily solar radiation of about 3.5 KWm2/day in the coastal area and 7.0 KWm2/ day at the north.Nigeria receives about 4909.212 kWh of energy from sun which is equivalent to about 1.082 million tonnes of oil; this is about 4000 times the current crude oil production per day, and also put at about 13,000 times of daily natural gas production based on energy units.There are indications that electricity production from the mix of conventional fossil fuels will occur in the future at a higher cost to consumers than the current levels. Nigeria is blessed with an abundance of renewable energy both as direct solar energy and indirect solar energy. Indirect solar energy includes water power in the form of hydroelectric power, wind power, bio-fuels derived from corn and other plants, biomass, and biogas from garbage and other biological wastes. Solar energy can be exploited directly in thermal applications (crop drying, water heating, distillation, solar cooking, refrigeration and air conditioning, thermal power generation) and in solar electricity production using photovoltaic converters.Before the beginning of COP21, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the submission of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to address climate change to UNFCCC.The federal government's policy to address climate change, as espoused in the country's INDC, commits to 20 per cent unconditional and 45 per cent conditional GHGs emission reduction post 2020 and attaining this ambitious goal means the country must as a matter of urgency review its energy mix profile and place more emphasis on renewable energy.The opening of the global conference on climate change last week coincided with the launch of the global coal atlas, composed of a number of articles on mining and use of coal for energy and its socio-economic and environmental impact.

The Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed, led the Nigerian delegation to the crucial discussion to harmonise divergent views and give the continent a common voice in the ongoing negotiation at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP 21. ""Climate Change may be just one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but without addressing it properly, all remaining 16 goals cannot be fully implemented. It is critically important that we have a vision implemented in Paris"", he stressed. Key officials of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) led by its President, Dr Khaled Fahmy, the Egyptian Minister of Environment, explained the precarious state of African continent buffeted by climate extremes like drought, flooding, landslides, water scarcity and diseases. They warned that rising sea levels would threaten Africa large coastal population, bringing enormous pressure on Agriculture, tourism, health, energy, fisheries, among other sectors. The Ministers admitted that although Africa produces the least carbon emission when compared with other continents, negative climate impact could put modest progress in the region into reverse. The President, African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, had in his earlier statement, warned that Africa was the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, when compared with other continents of the world. He said the shared commitment to a low carbon future that will emerge from the Conference of Parties (COP 21), presents huge opportunity for Africa. "" The move towards a greener and more sustainable development pathway can be a spring ball for economic transformation. Africa has vast potential in clean energy. With the right vision and investments, it can be help lead a global energy revolution, leapfrogging to renewable technologies and improving lives through cleaner, safer energy for household use"", he further explained. Adesina said the African Development Bank will lead a major push to deliver cleaner, more affordable energy for all Africans by 2025.""We will integrate climate- smart development across our portfolio. And we will continue to use our expertise to leverage climate finance for Africa and help African countries speak with a common voice in the international policy arena"", he pledged.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria66","Climate change, threat to food security in Nigeria Buhari","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has warned that the adverse effects of climate change poses a threat to food security in Nigeria, as extreme events such as flooding and drought are on the increase.Stating Nigeria's position on Monday at the Conference of Parties 21 (COP21) ongoing in Paris, France, he said such factors have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures.He also made a connection between the insurgency in the North-East and climate change which he observed had resulted in the drying up of the Lake Chad, thereby depriving many communities of their means of livelihood.President Buhari, therefore, told world leaders gathered at the event that they had a historic chance to save the planet by coming up with binding resolutions for sustainable development.Noting that the conference must work to make Paris a global landmark in the history of climate change negotiations, Buhari advised that nations must scale up their commitments to ensure a successful outcome and contribute to transforming the world through sustainable development.He added: ""Like many countries, Nigeria continues to witness the adverse effects of climate change in all its ramifications. Presently, we are reeling under the challenges of climate change as the frequency and intensity of extreme events like floods and drought are on the increase.""These challenges have resulted in the destruction of many economic and social structures and more worryingly threatening our national food production and security.""The magnitude of insurgency Nigeria is facing cannot be completely explained away without taking cognisance of the threat of climate change.""Climate change is threatening not only the sustainable development of our social and economic activities but also the totality of human existence in our country as in other parts of the world.""At the sub-regional level, we are saddled with the challenge of the drying up of the Lake Chad Basin, which is resulting in the total wipe out of livelihoods of many communities surrounding this trans-boundary natural resource.""Regrettably, the world is leaving behind millions of people who depend on the Lake for their survival. The Government of Nigeria welcomes the Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Plan, and the Lake Chad Basin Commission and international partners for designing this climate-based plan.""In all, the experience of countries sharing the Lake Chad further illustrates the mutual challenge we face today and which must be collectively addressed without further delay.""He noted the inadequacies of existing climate change treaties, protocols and conventions, reiterating Nigeria's position that for the potential of Paris Agreement on Climate Change to be meaningful, achieve its objectives and eventually become universal in nature and scope, it must draw extensively on the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.""Indeed, for the agreement to be durable, it must recognise not only the emission right but also the survival rights of the citizens of developing countries,"" he said, adding, ""The inadequacies of the existing climate change treaties, the Conventions and its Protocol, constitute the driving force propelling parties to reach another climate change agreement as the main outcome of this Conference of Parties.""Nigeria appreciates the efforts and demonstration of flexibilities of all in the run up of discussions since Durban towards evolving the new global climate regime. Yet, we are very concerned at the pace of progress made so far.""This is more important, since the negotiation continues to go back and forth without necessarily addressing the interests and concerns of the developing countries in general and African countries in particular.""In this regard, Nigeria strongly believes that the agreement we reach here in Paris must equitably address climate change mitigation and adaptation activities in terms of the means of implementation with emphasis on adequate financing, technology transfer and capacity development.""It is our fervent hope that these implementation modalities will be explicitly enshrined in the Agreement."" President Buhari gave Nigeria's target on cutting greenhouse emissions arrived at after extensive consultations with stakeholders by up to 45 per cent by the year 2030.He said: ""On our part in Nigeria, we undertook an extensive and participatory process of multi-level consultations with a cross section of stakeholders within the different tiers of government towards determining our national contributions to global mitigation reduction.""Based on national considerations, Nigeria intends to attain the mitigation reduction objective of 20 per cent unconditional and 45 per cent conditional below the Business as Usual level of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2030.""It is our expectation that this nationally-determined ambitious target given our national circumstances and developmental requirements will eventually pass the green test.""Buhari reiterated that the Paris Agreement must be legally binding, all-encompassing and sustainable for it to be universally applicable, result-oriented and in all, effective. ""The Agreement we reach here must also be a fair, multilateral and rules-based regime guided by science with an overall aim of ensuring the right to equitable access of every country of the world to sustainable development,"" he declared.Meanwhile, President Buhari has approved Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) or the country's plan to tackle the issue of climate change while promoting sustainable development and delivering on government priorities. The document is a requirement by Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-UNFCC) in preparation for the Adoption of Climate Change Agreement at the ongoing COP21 Paris conference.The INDC was prepared by the Ministry of Environment in recognition of the fact that significant challenges such as food insecurity, lack of access to energy and high unemployment, amongst others, remain principal constraints on economic development in the country and are of primary concern to the government.The document, therefore, focuses on the delivery of direct development benefits and sustainable growth of the economy.The Executive Summary of the INDC points out that in addition to these challenges, the country is considerably impacted by climate change.""\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria67","Abuja 2016 - Turning Point for Lake Chad Region? [analysis]","May 19, 2016","Daily Trust (Abuja)","The tone and tenor of speeches of Heads of State and government at the Regional Security Summit hosted on Saturday by President Muhammadu Buhari suggest that the countries in the Lake Chad region are looking beyond the Boko Haram terrorism.In all probability, the world would have benefited more from the leaders if the summiteers in Abuja had to say everything on the war situation as it enters its end in their territories but they, instead, chose to dwell on the promise of the future and what can be done to steer the economy and humanitarian situation into better times.While acknowledging the progress so far made, the summiteers who included French President Francois Hollande, Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari and ten other African Presidents, prime ministers and delegates concluded that defeating Boko Haram Terrorist Group will require a sustained comprehensive approach based on clear and coordinated plans of engagement at the regional level. Such an approach, they said, must confront challenges relating to effective security operations, providing civilian security and civil administration, restoring stability, and promoting economic development and job creation to break the cycle of violence in all countries where Boko Haram is active.Among other things, they recommended the enlistment of local community and religious leaders as constantly hammered on by President Buhari; increased intelligence sharing; the prioritization of the public education system and sparing no effort in the continuing search for the Chibok schoolgirls and all those abducted by Boko Haram by pooling intelligence resources.The leaders also agreed to support the victims of sexual violence or forced marriage by Boko Haram, and the need to provide them with appropriate support including reintegration to communities; that defeating the insurgency requires more than a Military solution but that it also requires government-led development action to tackle the root causes of insurgency in the Lake Chad Basin through the development of education and economic opportunities.The summit agreed to address the humanitarian situation affecting millions of IDPs, refugees and host communities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The critical situation of the inhabitants of the newly-liberated towns and villages was also adjudged to be very pathetic. The summit agreed to provide and rehabilitate facilities in the devastated towns and villages with a view to creating conditions for citizens to live without fear of violence and return to conventional life and called for additional support from the international community. They, in addition, took special note of the 20,000 unaccompanied children (below the age of 18 years) displaced by the conflict and over 6000 minors, under the age of five years, and agreed to work together with international organisations to reunite those children with their families.One other major step toward a lasting solution towards permanent peace in the region is identified as coming through the acceleration, specifically within three (3) years, of the implementation of the Lake Chad Development and Climate Resilience Action Plan as presented on the margins of COP21 in Paris in consultation with communities of the Lake Chad. It is hoped that the accelerated implementation of the Action Plan would go a long way in bringing development to the Lake Chad Basin.As a matter of fact, the summit blamed the impact of climate change for the unemployment and crime in the region and urged the LCBC and other willing partners to pursue the goal of inter-basin water transfer project with a view to restoring its normal level, mitigating drought, re-establishing fishery, irrigation and navigation.For Nigeria in particular, the period of the summit was used to receive an important visitor described as a friend of Africa, Francois Hollande who, in a literal sense killed two birds one stone. He engaged his host, President Buhari in a bilateral meeting in the early part of the day and in the afternoon, joined the other leaders at the summit. The two presidents reviewed the activities of the Multinational Joint Task Force, MNJTF and the progress made since the Climate Change agreement, COP 21 in Paris.President Hollande gave commitment to Nigeria on the resettlement of IDPs as well as his continuing support towards the reestablishment of full security in the Lake Chad region. Five agreements were signed between the Nigerian parties and their French partners.A cultural agreement and a scientific and technical agreement were signed by government ministers. Dangote Group's Dansa Foods Limited signed an agreement with the French company Nutriset for the production of nutritional foods in the North East. The state development commission, AFD of France signed two credit agreements with the Ministry of Finance and one with Zenith Bank for amounts that were not disclosed.In the margins of the security summit, the President also received in audience and at their request, Presidents Macky Sall of Senegal, Patrice Talon of Benin and Idris Deby Itno of Chad.The President also had audiences with the British Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Rt. Hon. Phillip Hammond, the U.S Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and the Deputy President of the European Union Ms Federica Moghereni.President Macky Sall raised concerns about the need for the emergence of a good candidate for the Chairmanship of the soon-to-be vacant African Union Commission in view of the decision of Mrs Zuma not to run for a second term. He told President Buhari that his country has such a capable candidate. He also raised an issue concerning the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.President Patrice Talon seemed very keen to strengthen the very warm and friendly relations he met on the ground between his country and Nigeria. He intends to pay a State visit to this country in the shortest possible time.President Deby Itno gave important news about some Boko Haram hideouts on the border between our countries against which Chadian troops will soon to be tackling.He was also interested in promoting a railway l"

So while they struggle to send technology into Africa, we are told to stop deforestation and maintain our forest stock so we can conserve carbon.""""As Africans, we must shut our doors and reinvent ourselves, adaptation is not the way to go because it is adjusting yourself.""""In all of these, there is very little Africa is doing in terms of technology, in terms of even mechanical cultivation of young plants that have capacity for the assimilation of carbon dioxide.""We have also been very inefficient.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria89","How Nigeria's proposed coal-fired plants negate Paris Agreement0","April 13, 2016 Wednesday","Business Day","Nigeria's power generation challenges still persist; the country's current output has far fallen below the 5,000 megawatts peak. As pressure mounts on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government of 11 months to revitalise the ailing sector, rather than adopting abundant harmless renewable alternative energy sources, plan is fully set to augment the dwindling power by investing heavily in coal-fired power plants. A move that betrays the 2015 Paris universal legally binding climate agreements that involved Nigeria's active participation.'The Ministry of Solid Minerals Development is collaborating the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to ensure that huge coal deposit in the country is explored to meet some of its energy needs,' Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Minister of Solid Minerals Development, was quoted as saying.At the Economic Summit held recently in Lagos, he further said, 'I know there are people who are worried about climate change and the implication of coal on that. But even coal can achieve clean coal environmental standard and we believe that about 1000 megawatts of electricity can be generated from coal by the year 2020.'This is regarded as a deliberate pranks and an attempt to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that coal is environment friendly. At a crucial time when other committed countries are halting new coal projects, and busy closing down existing coal plants while strategising and threading feasible sustainable renewables paths, Nigeria is totally pursuing a contrary devastating archaic project.It should be noted that, as a result of alarming air pollution in China and India, over 1.6 million deaths are recorded annually. In addressing China's air pollution, Chris Wright (Climate Tracker activist) stated: '(China has decided) to close up to 2,000 coal-fired power plants. It also plans to shut down 1,000 coal mines this year.'Despite these facts, if the coal-fired plant is constructed due to government's recalcitrance, past influences on aforementioned countries speak volume of its likely adverse consequences on vast majority of Nigerians, future generations and our dear planet. Nigeria's estimated average life expectancy which currently stands at 53 years could further be reduced. Conscious citizens should be aware of this proposed dangerous adventure that could rob them of quality lives.Rather, the Federal Government should consider massively diverting funds to be channelled in fossil fuels projects into the renewables; hydro, wind, solar and biomass are wide eco-friendly alternatives. Many hydro power projects are abandoned while immense renewables remain unexploited.Ikere George hydro dam situated at Iseyin was built 33 years ago and is a glaring example out of many alternatives. It has the capacity to generate 3750 MW (3/4 of Nigeria's current total output). Unfortunately, it was never completed and is now a shadow of itself. Several abandoned hydro-power projects are languishing and littering every nook and cranny of the nation, while Africa's most populous country of estimated 170 million inhabitants grapples with dilemma of satisfying its ever increasing power demands.One then begins to wonder why Nigeria's power output currently remains at the lowest ebb in 21st century. Positive influence of humongous funds allegedly spent on power over the years by past administrations failed to have meaningful impacts. The failure can unarguably be attributed to financial recklessness and mismanagement of resources by the past anchors.If Nigeria sincerely desires change in the power sector, there is a compelling need for the current administration to radically defy all odds in challenging and addressing the status quo. This is an unconditional choice that may warrant stepping on cartels and corrupt powerful toes.It is high time the Ministry of Environment headed by Mrs. Amina Mohammed synergised with the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and Solid Minerals Development. This to be geared towards working out modalities for initiating projects having harmless long term effects on Nigerian populace while running it in consonance with UN climate agreements. Fruition of sustainable environment requires unrelenting coordinated concerted efforts of various actors and stakeholders.Reneging on COP21\l"

They have no other place to live and no land for cultivation,"" he said.The President recalled the research conducted by a professor in a London university and published more than three decades ago had predicted that unless one or some of the rivers from the Central African region are diverted to empty into the Lake Chad basin, the river will dry up.He noted that sadly that prediction has become reality as the lake which covers over 25,000 square kilometers in 1925 have shrunk to 2,500 square kilometers.""The amount of resources required and the high technological expertise and infrastructure needed to be undertaken to revive the Lake Chad has to be mainly financed by the G7 and the United States.""The cost is great and more than 14 billion dollars is needed to revive the Lake.""But if that is achieved, at least five million people from Central African Republic to the Lake Chad Basin countries (Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin) will be rehabilitated.""When this is done those who are daring to cross the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean to come to Europe will remain at home because they have land where they can cultivate and earn a respectable living,"" he said.While decrying the consequences of climate change Nigeria's development, President Buhari however said his administration was ready to embrace several opportunities presented by the challenges posed by climate change.\l"

She lamented that the impacts of the phenomenon were daily threatening the livelihoods of everyday Nigerians, with 70 per cent of Nigeria's population relying on climate-sensitive activities for their income such as rain-fed farming and fisheries. ""Nigeria is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world,"" she said, ""By 2050, it could cost between 6 per cent and 30 per cent of its GDP ($100 billion to $460 billion.)"" These were among the key messages made available by the minister during a news briefing in Abuja, the first since the COP21 held in France last month.She however reaffirmed that this administration was committed to an economic transformation which places inclusive, green growth at the centre, adding that the new leadership is ""extremely well-placed to deliver on this agenda."" Citing the Lake Chad in the North-east, the zone where Boko Haram is located, as an example, Mohammed noted that climate change aggravates regional conflicts. She noted that the body of water known as Lake Chad had shrunk to 10 per cent of its original size as a result of climate change, bringing with it the associated collapse of economic and institutional fabric, making the region a breeding ground for terrorism. ""Boko Haram is now recognised as the most deadly terrorist group in the world,"" she said. ""... Of an estimated 20 million people that lived on the Lake Chad basin circa 2003, about 11.7 million were in the North-eastern region of Nigeria."" She said while seeking to maintain strong growth, the federal government had recognised that its current economic composition was unsustainable.""The recent fall in oil prices has heightened the vulnerability of its economy to fossil fuel exports,"" Mohammed stated. ""Diversification, especially towards sustainable agriculture, is already a key part of the country's economic strategy."" On the continued pursuit of the use of coal, a highly damaging fuel, for power, she said while the country was committed to renewable energy rather than fossil fuel, she could not sacrifice its economic interest and the well-being of its citizens on the altar of going green. Also, Mohammed said Nigeria can generate 7.5 billion dollars in 15 years if the government can end gas flaring and utilize gas for commercial purposes. The minister made the statement yesterday in Abuja while briefing newsmen on the outcome of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The agreement provides a framework for keeping average global temperature below two degrees Celsius. Mohammed said that the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted by Nigeria as its contribution to the agreement was aimed at reducing emission by 20 per cent by 2030. Reduction of emission, the minister noted, could act as catalyst to achieve economic diversification and assist economic restructuring in a way that would facilitate inclusive growth with vast opportunities. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), she listed some of the opportunities to include substantial increase in the use of climate smart agriculture through irrigation systems, climate resilient crops and broader Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices. ""Given the climate risks that Nigeria faces, this is the only way in which the government ambitious Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) can be delivered,"" she said. Mohammed listed other opportunities to include diversifying the energy mix with emphasis on renewable energy and efficient gas power. ""In particular, we plan to generate around 13GW of off-grid solar power, delivering energy access to the poorest communities in a cheaper, healthier manner with less emission,"" she said. The minister also stated that reducing emission would create greener, more resilient and pleasant cities to live in. ""Nigerian cities are now adopting global best practices with low-carbon transport solutions. ""For example, bus rapid transit system is already in operation in Lagos. ""More can be done and will be done to promote urban transit solution that will reduce emissions and unblocks congestion and provide huge stimulant to productivity,"" she said.To deliver the agenda for change, Mohammed stressed the need for the nation's climate plans to ""align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."" ""This is necessary to enable the plan have ambitious, robust and effective approach that will tackle inequality and address the challenges of climate change."" According to her, the Paris agreement has created a veritable platform for President Muhammadu Buhari's bold change agenda with focuses on a new road map with emphasis on green and inclusive growth.\l"

Here's how.","December 10, 2015 Thursday","Ventures Africa","As the \~COP 21Ventures Africa spoke to Nigeria's former Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala who since leaving office has become prominent global\~voice advocating economic solutions for dealing with the impacts of climate Change.Ventures Africa (VA): Dr. Okonjo-Iweala, analysts posit that it is quite difficult to ascertain the long-term economic costs of climate change. Do you agree? If so, is it possible for you to give us a short-term projection?Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (NOI): There have been many studies, including by Lord Nick Stern, that have shown that climate change is real and costly, and that if we do not manage to keep the world, not even at 2 degrees, but at 1.5 \- because this was the chant in Paris, ""1.5 to stay alive"" \- \~some of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Pacific rim would sink.So, the issue the costs have become very prominent, in terms of pollution, which causes a lot of diseases and ill health. Even today in Beijing, the pollution is so high that they have given the highest level of alert. A large number of deaths are caused by pollution and other forms of diseases caused by climate change, loss of productivity of crops and lands, flooding, storms it's catastrophic, and many estimates have been given. Therefore, giving an estimation is a very scientific affair, not something someone gets up and projects.Many years have been spent trying to study this phenomenon and trying to estimate the damage, and if you look at the work done by the new climate economy, you can get various estimates. I've just given you one, about how degraded land leads to more damage to the climate, and it's going to cost $250 billion a year to restore. That's one kind of estimate that you can get. It's a very costly phenomenon.But I think that the essential thing is there are solutions which are being discussed in Paris. First, you have $650 billion a year being spent in fuel subsidies, and fossil fuels contribute to carbon dioxide emission, very heavily. If you were to stop subsidising, it would then help to reduce the amount of carbon emission, and you could even take the $650 billion and invest it in alternative sources of energy, such as renewables, which are friendlier to the climate, and dramatically reduce carbon emission.In fact, the IMF has estimated that if you take the additional indirect costs of subsidies, that figure of $650 per year becomes $5.4 trillion. So, can you imagine such huge an amount of money that is lost due to this fossil fuels subsidy. I think that this is one area where the world can really make a big difference; phase it out; direct the resources to other alternatives that would actually help to manage climate change, and make the world a safer place to live.VA: You recently made the opening remarks at the Global Landscapes Forum in Paris at the COP21 in which you\~emphasized\~the need for public funding and investments in landscape restoration and conservation. Urbanisation has been named a major source of land degradation, but economists agree that there is a positive connection between urbanisation\~and economic growth, especially for developing countries. What is your take on the topic? Does this conflict with\~the agreement that you wish to come to on funding?NOI:\~Urbanisation is not necessarily a form of land degradation. I don't agree with that. I think that if you have a properly planned urbanisation, you can do it without degrading land. The issue is that, very often people migrate to urban land without adequate services, without adequate housing. And then they sometimes convert areas that should not really be used for building housing, into housing and other uses. That is when you begin to get problems with flood, like for example when they settle on the slopes of hills, or on sewer l"

We, therefore, look forward to their fulfilment and implementation.""As the United Nations (UN) office in Nairobi gears up to host the second session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) this year, under the auspices of UNEP, I would like to take this opportunity to further pledge Nigeria's commitment to this very worthy cause of having a safe, secure and clean planet.""He also said with half of the world's population now living in cities, world leaders must give greater attention to the challenges of rapid urbanisation.Buhari spoke further: ""In our effort to promote the sustainable urbanisation in Africa, the Federal Government of Nigeria funded and anchored the Africa Urban Agenda (AUA) programme, in partnership with the UN-Habitat.""The programme aims to enhance engagements between state and non-state actors to build consensus around identified urban development priorities and amplify Africa's voice at the global level towards HABITAT III.""The Africa Urban Agenda will culminate in a major conference of African Ministers of Housing, where numerous issues will be discussed.""I am pleased to announce that this conference will be hosted by Nigeria in Abuja, next month and I look forward to meeting and deliberating with you and other stakeholders on this very important topic.""Resident Coordinator of United Nations Office, Ms Sahle-Work Zewde, in her remarks, said the election of Buhari in a free and fair election last year demonstrated the commitment of Nigerians to democracy as a system of government.She described Nigeria as a ""crucial member of the UN, a vital partner and a major contributor to UN peace-keeping operations.""President Buhari undertook the symbolic planting of a tree before leaving the UN office.\l"

This will support the restructuring of the economy in a way that will facilitate inclusive growth with vast opportunities to diversify the energy mix, with emphasis on renewable energy and efficient gas power.""In particular, we plan to develop around 13GW of off-grid solar power, delivering energy access to the poorest communities in a cheaper and healthier manner with less emission. We also plan to create a more efficient, lower carbon oil and gas sector. By ending gas flaring and using the gas for commercial purposes, including power generation, we could generate as much as $7.5bn worth of benefits,"" she added.She noted that the government would substantially increase the use of climate smart agriculture through irrigation systems, climate resilient crops and broader sustainable land management practices. ""Given the climate risks that Nigeria faces, this is the only way in which the government's ambitious Agriculture Transformation Agenda can be delivered,"" she added.Mohammed said these opportunities would not only reduce emissions and improve climate resilience, but that the approach would unlock economic opportunities.The minister further revealed that the World Bank has projected that a combination of low carbon activities could provide a boost to the Nigerian economy and add as much as two per cent to the country's Gross Domestic Product.She urged the international community to support and assist Nigeria with financing, technology and capacity building, just as she enjoined the private sector and civil society to partner the government to unlock the opportunities provided by the historic climate change agreement, emphasising that, ""working together, I firmly believe that we can commit ourselves to actions that will serve as a springboard to Nigeria's new climate economy.""\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria103","Nigeria must break free from fossil fuels","April 11, 2016 Monday","Business Day","On May 29, 2015, Nigeria's new president Muhammadu Buhari in his inaugural speech promised to join the international community to combat climate change and other challenges head-on.Environment enthusiasts were happy when Nigeria's new minister submitted the country's INDC to UNFCC. At the COP21 conference in Paris, Nigeria made an unconditional offer to end greenhouse gas emission by 20% and provide access to electricity by the year 2030. Nigeria joined majority of the 161 countries in support of the 1.5 degree ceiling of carbon exposure against the 2.0 degree promoted by most developed nations. The signing of the Paris Agreement purportedly marked the beginning of the end of environmental rascality and the commencement of a new sustainable environmental pathway.Few months after the euphoria and emergence of the new government, it was shocking to hear from the Minister of Power that Nigeria will revert to the use of coal as source of fuel to improve its electricity generation. Similar announcement by the Emir of Kano and Aliko Dangote to build coal powered plants has clearly shown that Nigeria is towing a dangerous and decelerating course in an era propelled by clean and sustainable energy.Will the additional coal and petrochemical powered plants reduce the amount of carbon exposure as agreed in Paris? Is there no other better alternative to power than outdated fossil powered plants? What is the cost implication of choosing dirty energy against renewable alternatives on the long run?Coal fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made carbon emissions. A third of all carbon dioxide emissions come from burning coal. This makes coal energy the single greatest threat facing climate change, from mining to combustion. Apart from climate change coal also causes irreparable damage to the environment, people's health and communities. According to experts, if more coals are used around the world, carbon emission from coal will rise 60% by 2030 thus undermining the international agreements to tackle climate change.In 2014, Nigeria's renewable energy improved following private input and government initiatives. That same year a study by Pew Research survey indicated that 65 percent of Nigerians were very concerned about threats of climate change despite economic stability. Nigeria produces over 2.5 million barrels of oil daily. Yet it cannot generate enough electricity for its people. It boasts of the highest concentration of small-scale generators in the world.Petrochemical has contributed enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere especially in the South East region where gas flaring has continued unabated. The numerous oil spills in the Niger Delta has rendered farmlands useless and the waters toxic further impoverishing rural dwellers who are mostly fishermen. Crude oil has done enough damage to our environment and economy. The abandoned coal mining sites left several years ago were not properly managed and they constitute serious health hazards to the surrounding communities.Diversification can play a critical role in reducing vulnerability not only to supply disruption and oil price hikes but also to climate change. Many factors may be taken into account, such as costs, pollutants, energy demand, land use system and distribution. The Buhari government can determine what constitute its mix of energy sources in order to quick-fix the power problem but should not ignore the impact of such technologies to the environment and health of the citizenry.Yes, Nigeria holds large coal reserves estimated to be over 2billion metric tons. It is also true that Nigeria is located in the equatorial zone and can receive over 85% of sunlight proportionately across the states. Our landmass of over 900,000 sq.km still has more unused areas where enormous solar panels can be deployed to tap the sun energy for power generation. Nigeria has the capacity to achieve 100% renewable energy (solar, water and wind) before 2040, if a master-plan is judiciously pursued.Morroco, Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa and Algeria are already leading the race to sustainable energy in Africa. South Africa has established itself among the top 10 countries in the world harnessing renewable sun energy with over 15 solar plants providing electricity to 80,000 houses. Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina, Bauchi can collectively harness solar power for all the northern states while Lagos, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Cross River can harness onshore wind power. The area being encroached by the Sahara desert can be used for utility-scale solar farms which can also act as artificial soil covers thereby protecting the area from further drought.Germany has been able to produce 78% of its total electricity needs from renewable energy. The German Energy Transformation is a master plan to significantly shift from fossil fuels. Germany consumes more power than Nigeria.All the relevant factors are favourable to Nigeria and each geographic zone can harness those renewables (biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, hyro) more prevalent in the area as clearly stated in our national Renewable Energy Programme. Renewable energy will not only provide clean and sustainable energy it will provide job opportunities for youths. We can move from zero megawatt to 100% renewable energy. Let us break free from fossil fuels.The Minister of Power and the current government should as a matter of urgent importance terminate the idea of using coal to power our electricity and pursue a more environmental friendly alternative which are readily abundant.\l"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria105","What you need to know about distributed renewable energy markets in Africa","December 11, 2015 Friday","Ventures Africa","For African countries, accessing sources of renewable energy is still a challenge, even as the rest of the world is gradually turning towards them. Renewable energy is mostly\~distributed through mini-grids and isolated systems. Recently, the mini-grid distribution sector has grown considerably, particularly in developing countries in Africa where centralised grid systems are unable to reach people in remote\~locations. Although urban migration\~is common in Africa, about 59 percent of the continent's population is still rural. Mini-grids are expected to contribute 45 percent of the additional generation capacity for universal access to energy by 2030. Based on this, they are expected to play a major role in enabling countries to meet the objectives set by the United Nations Secretary General's Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative.Investment in distributed renewable energy in Africa is witnessing significant support from governments, public and private investors, even though there is a level of skepticism about its\~new and evolving nature.Ventures Africa (VA): How accessible is distributed renewable energy technologies market is and what is the current attitude towards the market in Africa, both on the public and private fronts? Dr. Rose Mutiso (RM):\~Renewable technologies such as solar are mature and costs have dropped significantly. This is not just an environmental consideration, the economic drivers for renewables are also strong as more than two-thirds of Africans lack access to electricity. Renewables will play a major role in closing this energy access gap. In particular, distributed renewable technologies such as off-grid solar and mini-grids will be crucial for reaching the millions of Africans who live in rural areas where conventional grid-extension may not be cost-effective or timely.The markets for these off-grid technologies are growing, but there is still more to be done in order to give them stronger legitimacy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that over 60 percent of energy investments need to go towards these solutions, if universal energy access goals are to be met, so we have to embrace them. African governments and global development partners are starting to recognise the role of renewable technologies and distributed solutions, which is a welcome change.Through the efforts of programs such as\~International Finance Corporation's Lighting Africa\~program, markets for off-grid solar lighting and charging products are growing rapidly. More needs to be done enable these technologies to reach more people and also allow\~them move up the energy ladder beyond providing electricity. I co-lead the Clean Energy Ministerial Global Lighting and Energy Access Partnership (Global LEAP)\~initiative, which works with partners across the world to catalyse commercial markets for affordable, high-quality and high-performing clean energy products and services in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. We just announced a new effort in collaboration with UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4All) at COP21 known as the\~Efficiency for Access (E4A) Coalition, which aims to harness energy-efficient technologies to enable delivery of energy services to off-grid populations faster and at the lowest\~cost.Meeting the ambitious SDG7 (Sustainable Development Goal 7) \~targeting universal energy access by 2030, will need a major paradigm shift away from business-as-usual approaches and explore more innovative technologies and service delivery models.\~Distributed renewable technologies are at the heart of this strategy.VA: Besides funding, what other technical or operational challenges exist with distributed renewable energy on the continent?RM:\~Technologies are largely mature, but more needs to done to bring down costs of some key components such as batteries and end-use technologies. A sound regulatory and policy environment is also needed. Off-grid energy companies face many challenges in attracting private investment due to the high risks, both real and perceived, so the public sector actors need to step in to help de-risk these investments.Companies are still experimenting with different business models and some sectors, such as mini-grids, are yet to see some really successful examples, so we need more resources to enable experimentation and risk-taking in this sector.Do you think that Africa is capable of building infrastructure to support distributed and/or renewable energy generation, as well as their necessary technologies?Yes, as long as we have a stronger political 'buy-in', prioritisation of distributed renewables as an important part of the energy mix, enabling policies and regulatory frameworks and mobilization of substantial public and private sector finance. Developed countries need to play a stronger role in support of Africa as it undertakes this task of working towards universal electrification in a way that side-steps the many pitfalls of the mainstream approaches to electrification such as environmental degradation. This is a great opportunity for the whole world to learn from Africa's experience in a massive roll-out of renewable and distributed technologies and there is also a huge opportunity for Africa here by bypassing some of the challenges of dealing with legacy infrastructure that other countries face.\l"

We had lost the respect accorded Nations like ours were they well-led and well-run.I recall that not a few Nigerians complained that the green passport was becoming, if it had not already become, a burden.That was at the height of the dictatorial government that broke the rules of international relations.It was from there that we started to heal. Investors entered our country. Many brands that we sought after abroad started coming to set up shop in our country.The tourist footfalls in our country increased slowly but surely, but again we began to slide.That was when Buhari declared at a meeting in Lagos during his campaign in 2015, that if elected, he would make us proud about our country again. Proud to be Nigerian again.That is the context in which I view his foreign trips and the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Foreign Relations which promised to:Make the Nigerian national interest the overriding factor in its foreign policy and international relations.Work to reform global governance in multilateral institutions and agencies.Work to strengthen the African Union to become a more effective organization on global affairs.Engage the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) on the basis of equality.Play a leadership role to develop a MINT (Mexico, India, Nigeria, and Turkey) as a counterforce to BRICS.I will limit my takeaways to 4 (Four) trips that I attended with the President namely: the G7 Summit in Germany, the Oil and Gas Summit in Iran, the Renewable Energy Conference in Abu Dhabi and the State visit and Business Forum in China; and 2 (Two) trips that I did not attend, but whose deliberations I followed, namely: Paris for the COP 21 and USA for the Nuclear Energy Summit.G7 in GermanyThis is a club of eight of the most industrialized, economic and technologically advanced nations.For the benefit of those who do not follow international politics it was originally the G8 comprising the USA, Britain, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Russia, who were later suspended and had sanctions imposed on them to make it G7 as a result.It was formed in 1975 as a club of 6 (Six) before Canada and Russia were admitted.They look after each other, and the rest of the world to put it simply.They have gone to war together if you remember Iraq and Libya in recent memory and they are all largely collaborating to fight terror. (Most recently the FBI was rendering assistance to Belgium in the aftermath of the terror attacks in that Country).Why G7 one might then ask?Answer: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as host, invited PMB on his inauguration to be their guest along with some three or four other African countries.Apart from the personal aides of the President, Governor Shettima of Borno, General Dambazau and myself were the only ones who accompanied PMB.I recall that upon our arrival in Germany they expressed surprise that our delegation was small and asked if others were still coming.In the pre-departure briefing, in addition to highlighting how the security and economic agenda of the G7 coincided with 2 (Two) of his campaign promises, security, (corruption) economy, PMB stated the reasons 3 of us were invited.Governor Shettima was in the front l"

Mr. Michel Kafando the Transitional President of Burkina Faso at the State House, Abuja, Nigeria on Wednesday, 16 Dec., 2015I am pleased to welcome you all to Abuja for the 48th Ordinary Session of the Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Allow me, your Excellencies, to pay tribute to President Kafando and the entire members of his Transitional Government for the laudable efforts they deployed in the implementation of the Transitional Charter and the conduct of successful elections in Burkina Faso. This is yet another demonstration of the Community's commitment to the principle of democracy and good governance. While we wish President Kafando every success in his future endeavours, we congratulate, once again, President-elect Roch Marc Christian Kabore and wish him well in the governance of his country. Let me recall that the election in Burkina Faso completed the cycle of 2015 presidential elections in the region, successfully conducted in my country-Nigeria, Togo, Guinea, and Cote d'Ivoire. This remarkable achievement reflects our collective resolve to entrench democracy and good governance in the region. As we prepare for more general elections in the coming year, I assure Your Excellencies that Nigeria will remain steadfast in its commitment and support to democracy and good governance. We believe that a politically stable West Africa can only be strong and prosperous. The convening of this Summit in Abuja is a great honour and privilege for the Government and people of Nigeria. I sincerely thank my brothers, Heads of State and Government for accepting Nigeria to host this unique Summit, which is taking place as we celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the founding of our Organization. I would like to express my warm appreciation to my brother, H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal and Chairman of the ECOWAS Authority for his statesmanship and able leadership since he took over seven months ago. Let me also thank the President of the ECOWAS Commission, the Commissioners and staff members for efforts deployed in the preparation of this Summit. Over the years, our Organization has recorded concrete achievements which loudly speak for themselves. ECOWAS has indeed been universally acclaimed as a model regional economic community. In spite of the significant achievements, our Community still faces numerous challenges. While some militate against the integration drive, others continue to pose risks to peace and security, as well as political stability in the region. There are also structural and administrative challenges in running the Commission that equally require serious attention. Security challenges persist in our region as we continue to be confronted with the daunting scourge of transnational organized crime including arms trafficking, drug trafficking, as well as piracy and criminality at sea. Equally worrying is the rising scourge of violent extremism and terrorism. All this constitute serious threats to peace and security in the region, and therefore require our urgent and concerted actions.Regional and indeed global solidarity is vital in our efforts to counter these threats. To this end, we must continue to enhance our system of governance and, working with our partners, accelerate the implementation of our joint initiatives and mechanisms created to address these daunting but not insurmountable risks. As we do so, we should not relent in our effort to engage with member states coming out of crises, in order to help them to consolidate on the achievements made. The catastrophic consequences of climate change are manifest in our region. A number of fragilities, conflicts and environmental degradation that affect our countries today with serious negative impact on peace, security, economy and livelihoods are either directly or indirectly triggered by climate change. Alone, we will not be able to reverse or stop some of these consequences, as it requires huge investment of resources far beyond our capabilities.We should therefore continue to press for international assistance and to work with the rest of the world to protect the environment. We should do so without loosing focus on our industrial development objectives. Our efforts to fast track regional integration should also be informed by the requirement for clean source of energy. In this regard, I welcome the agreed outcome of the just concluded COP21 in Paris, which aims at reducing global warming and providing for financial support to developing nations. We must also continue to cooperate with our development partners, and take advantage of their willingness to support our initiatives to address all these challenges in the most appropriate and beneficial ways to our region and to global peace and security. Nigeria would like to see that on-going reforms in ECOWAS institutions are concluded and firmly entrenched to ensure greater effectiveness in leading the integration process. We would like to see that the resources of the Community are devoted to the implementation of economic programs that would enable us build a prosperous region. Let me conclude by expressing my strong belief in the vast potentialities of our region. I remain confident that under the leadership of the Chairman of the Authority of Heads of State and Government, H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, our Community will continue to make steady progress towards achieving the goals for which it was founded a community that gives hope to the present and future generations. I also express deep gratitude to our bilateral and multilateral partners for their continued support and cooperation. I wish us all fruitful deliberations. And please accept my best wishes for a happy festive season. I thank you.This speech was delivered on Wednesday, 16 Dec., 2015.\l"

About 150 presidents and prime ministers, from every part of the world, had come to attend the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 21), to rub minds on a particularly distressing issue - climate change.At the end of conference, history was made, as nations of the world came to a consensus to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius. Interestingly, the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, was part of the historic conference.Although Nigeria is not one of the top emission producing countries in the world, the impact of climate change means that the country has to pay attention to what happened in Paris. Currently, the country is experiencing adverse climate conditions with negative impacts on the welfare of millions of people. Persistent droughts and flooding, off season rains and dry spells have sent growing seasons out of orbit, on a country dependent on a rain fed agriculture. Alarm bells are ringing with lakes drying up and a reduction in river flow in the arid and semi arid region. The result is fewer water supplies for use in agriculture, hydro power generation and other users.For example, Lake Chad used to provide means of livelihood for over five million people, either for fishing or irrigation farming. But over time, due to the inaction and lack of determination to confront the problems that was staring its dependants in the face, nations allowed Lake Chad to continue to dry up. The effect of that drying up is that farmers, fishermen, other artisans that previously depended on Lake Chad for means of livelihood now poured into nearby cities like Maiduguri and some cities in Yobe, looking for a way to survive. But these people were not equipped to live in cities. And to live, anybody who gives them food became their master, their god. That was how these individuals became murder weapons in the hands of terrorists.The encroaching Sahara Desert that is racing down around one mile per annum has also depleted the grazing area previously depended on by herdsmen for feeding their cattle. These areas have dried up, as desertification kicks in. And the country has not been able to arrest these things. The result is that the herdsmen are moving southwards, looking for areas where they can graze and feed their stock. Now, instead of grazing areas prepared for that purpose, they now come to graze in the farms. They destroy crops that took farmers months and years to prepare. This has led to the regular violent confrontations involving Fulani herdsmen.This is why it has been said that climate change has varied implications, among which are national security, health, famine, and even malnutrition; because if people cannot get what to eat, they eat things that are not good for them.In January 2016, President Buhari addressed the World Future Energy Summit at Abu Dhabi and pointed out some of the tragic effects of climate change.""Africa is already suffering from the consequences of climate change, which include recurrent drought and floods,"" he said.

It was built on three key beliefs: the world would always need their products; energy technologies change slowly, governments will not act decisively to tackle climate change.'The Paris Agreement seems to have put paid to that belief.Paris AgreementThe Paris Agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change impact by limiting global warming to well below 2 C. It will enter into force in 2020.Governments agreed to a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. They also committed to limit increase to 1.5 C to reduce the risk impacts of climate change. Governments also committed to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science.There were also commitment to meet every 5 years to set more ambitious targets as dictated by current science, report to each other and to the public on how well they are doing to implement their targets and track progress towards the long-term goal through a robust transparency and accountability system.While these are ambitious targets, the sticking point in past agreements has been getting countries to domesticate the policy provisions by having their legislatures approve them. Also, big business lobbyists give legislatures incentives to encourage inaction.However, West African countries should not operate under the assumption that the Paris Agreement will go the way of the other 20 protocols that have been signed towards checking climate change. It would be a move as risky as betting the house on the lottery.For one, the political resolve that gave birth to the Paris Agreement is forged upon the crucible of stern realities. Tsunamis, ozone depletion, acid rains and irrational weather have forced governments and big businesses to take seriously the threat of climate change. This has taken the will out of the voices of dissent.Unlike the 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference that collapsed into chaos, the Paris Agreement saw political will from the countries. They even made provisions to finance poor nations in order to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects extreme weather.Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International told the Guardian UK what he thought of the agreement. 'It sometimes seems that the countries of the UN can unite on nothing but nearly 200 countries have come together and agreed a deal. The human race has joined in a common cause.'Another significant fact about the Paris Agreement is that businesses are now urging governments to take urgent action. Burke noted businesses now want governments to move faster to tackle climate change. Other companies such as those making clean energy technologies see huge opportunities in a decarbonising world.According to United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) global trends in renewable energy investment report for 2014, green energy investments worldwide surged 17 percent to $270 billion at the beginning of 2014 and before the year ran out, it peaked at $339 billion driven mainly by investments in solar and wind energy. 2015 preliminary reports indicate that renewable energy technologies for the first time, attracted more investment globally than fossil fuels!What is even more significant is that users of oil are now seeking alternatives. The media reported that 13 chief executives from the car industry led by Renault have committed themselves to decarbonising transport over the next 'two to three decades'. While they anticipate about 2 billion vehicles on the road by 2050, they would not rely on fossil fuels to power them. Electric cars is seeing a revolution by Tesla.Weaning Africa from fossil fuelThe dip in crude oil prices to less than $30 dollars per barrel is hurting West African economies. Ghana introduced a 30 percent hike in prices of petroleum products in January barely a month after increasing electricity tariffs by 59 percent and water tariffs by 67 percent.Nigeria even presents a grimier picture with an import dependent economy and crude oil as the country's key foreign exchange earner. The country ran into troubled waters when crude oil prices fell below $30 and the country's 2016 budget benchmark was set $38 per barrel. To make a bad problem worse, Nigeria's apex bank introduced unorthodox methods to curtail the fall of the naira leading to acute shortage of foreign exchange and further weakening the naira to nearly N400/$. Over half of the value of the stock market has been erased, now the country struggles to pay teachers.The UNEP report on investments in renewable energies has some of the lowest figures from Africa. But what Africa needs is to, as a matter of national urgency, wean itself away from fossil fuels. South Africa recorded the highest investment of over $5 billion dollars in 2014 far below China's over $80 billion worth of investments. Egypt and a few other African countries are making significant investments in renewable energy. West African countries have to rethink their engagement with fossil fuels.West African markets can see billions of dollars' worth of revenue by adding value to the raw materials in their domain and grow agro allied industries. There is also a critical need for advanced technologies in manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign imports.A future unchained to fossil fuels is indeed possible, Africa has to decide if it will follow or be dragged along.\l"

The COP is the supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to make nations have a legally binding and universal agreement on climate to keep global warming below 2p C.The French President Francois Hollande, addressing security concerns on the Paris COP 21 with expected 50,000 participants (including government official and civil society delegates ) in a joint session of his country's parliament, assured it would go ahead to show that the world must stay united against terrorism. Growing concerns on global warming have led to calls for reduction of greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases act like blanket around the earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm. This warming of the earth's surface as a result of atmospheric pollution by gases is the greenhouse effect.Although the greenhouse isnecessary to support life on earth, rising global temperatures have caused polar icecaps melting, oceans warming and sea levels rising with changes in rainfall resulting in floods, droughts or intense rain as well as frequent and severe heat waves. Warm climate affects water supplies, agriculture, power and transportation systems, health, safety and environment.From the United States Environmental Protection Agency human activities over the past century have released a lot of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases into the atmosphere with dangerous effects on human health and ecosystems and indeed the ozone layer depleted. Scientists discovered the hottest years of the last century came after 1990 with the hottest being 1998. A lot of greenhouse gases come from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) to produce energy. Industrial processes, deforestation, solid waste, and some agricultural processes also emit gases into the atmosphere.The international climate negotiations are to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases linked to climate change. The discourse is the reduction of fossil fuels for energy and replaced with renewable energy sources to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy like biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel), biomass, geothermal, solar, hydropower and wind are naturally generated energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2030, renewable energy could become the world's largest source of electricity ahead of conventional sources of coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear power.The Group of 7 (G7) industrialised nations summit in Bavaria, Germany on June 8, 2015 pledged to rid the global economy of fossil fuels by the end of the 21st century. German Chancellor and G7 summit host Angela Merkel had told reporters they are committed to the decarbonisation of the world economy.Observers believe the joint declaration may not have the bite considering the scramble for global oil by super majors from countries discouraging petroleum energy usage. Would the United States yet to sign the 1997 Kyoto Protocol ratify any treaty to reduce carbon dioxide emissions? Three heavy global emitters of carbon dioxide: China (27.6 percent), United States (14.5 percent), and India (6.7 percent) have not accepted the Lima 2014 legal framework that would obligate them to pay for CO' emissions.However, natural gas with low carbon dioxide emissions is now preferred to coal. China which heavily relies on coal, is now bowing to internal pressure on the dangers of smog in Beijing and 15 major cities making her to increase renewable capacity in solar energy. Last June, Norway reacted with plans to divest its $890 billion sovereign wealth fund from coal assets.Technologies developed in energy sources including renewables may soon render liquid fossil fuels useless. One's concern is on climate change but one's greater worry is the socio-economic implications on economies that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Some OPEC members' survivals hang on petroleum with some respected global institutions using global warming reduction as bait to push for fossil fuel subsidies withdrawal. These may fuel global political destabilisation owing tensions if not properly addressed.The United States is already producing flexible fuels vehicles E85 and M85 that run on (ethanol 85 percent and gasol"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria119","The future drivers of power projects in Africa","February 8, 2016 Monday","SweetCrude Reports","Sources of renewable energy.08 February 2016, Sweetcrude, Abuja  Available data on power access in Africa is really gloomy. Kofi Annan, in his foreword to the Africa Progress Panel Report 2015 said ""On current trends, it will take up to 2080 for every African to have access to electricity"". Electricity consumption in Spain exceeds that of all Sub-Saharan Africa (except South Africa). Only one in six persons living in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity. And a whopping 600 million live without electricity completely.Globally more than 1.5 billion people lack access to electricity and this number is likely to remain the same until 2030 according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This sad global reality continues to drive research efforts towards improving human access to energy. Although Africa is not leading in the inventive efforts to improve energy and power access, it remains one of the most viable markets for power and energy systems in the world.Heightened stakeholder awareness has led to closer collaborations between the public and private sectors. African governments are chiseling existing power regulations and policies to reflect new realities. These concerted efforts have lowered the political risks, involved in power investments in many countries; making way for the needed private sector enthusiasm. Recent progress includes President Obama's Power Africa Initiative and the recent passage of the ""Electrify Africa Act"" introduced by US Congressman Ed Royce.Across many energy markets in Africa, investors and consumer alike are increasingly reaching a consensus. The recognition that three elements are critical for success in Africa's strides for better power access. The triangular forces of power reliability, affordability and green concerns have emerged to be the framework for success in many power projects.Reliability Reliability of power depends on the state of the associated infrastructure, power generation mix and management skills that exist between the plant and the meter. With unreliable distribution assets and poor generation capacity, revenue streams for both the generating firm and the distribution firms (where it is split) is threatened.Aging transmission and distribution infrastructure in many countries is the major source of unsteady supply and its related revenue losses. Power sector players that are unable to offer reliable supply undermines their very existence. Profitable firms are firms that will be able to build reliable systems through a mixture of the right generation and distribution infrastructure, as well as sterling management skills.AffordabilityPower systems that are not affordable will not be attractive for many African electricity markets. This include all state owned national grids, independent power plants that sell to private or public distribution companies, dispatchable & non-dispatchable mini grids and off grid solutions. Even if these solutions are attractive in other markets (with higher purchasing power and energy consumption behavior) they will often require some cost modification to sell in Africa. Rolake Akinkugbe, Vice President for Energy and Natural Resources at FBN Quest (in a recent publication) made a good example based on Tesla's Powerwall home-storage battery. Although they can provide renewable power (for 24hrs) above the daily need of an average rural home in Africa (6hrs), their cost at $3000 for a 7 Kilowatt hour (KWh) capacity battery makes it somewhat prohibitive in its current form. They may however appeal to other markets.And now Green! Renewable energy is now the word in everyone's lips. Even prior to the agreement of COP 21 Paris, renewable energy was increasingly contributing to the generated capacity of many developing and developed nations. It's the future! Experts say. But the best has not been seen in Africa, as fossil fuel-fired plants continue to come on-stream throughout Africa.On renewable energy in Africa, Kofi Annan remarkably noted ""Africa stands to gain from developing low-carbon energy, and the world stands to gain from Africa avoiding the high-carbon pathway followed by today's rich world and emerging markets"" Because significant power infrastructure is yet to be built and majority of Africa's existing plants are fossil-based; Africa has a compelling need to promote clean energy alternatives.Africa's unique vulnerability to climate change means that investors and governments will be tasked for greater environmental responsibility. Non-green energy sources will be increasingly scrutinized, making it difficult for ""dirty energy"" to be supported.Some countries in regions outside Africa are making good progress. In Asia, Sri Lanka with analogous economic indices to many African countries has made good success in green energy generation. Of its 2,681MW installed power generation capacity (2010) 50% comes from hydropower and conventional renewable sources. In South Africa, combined generation from solar power exceeds 510 Megawatts. Elsewhere in Africa many renewable energy projects are being promoted, from Grand Inga in DRC, to Zagtouli Solar Photovoltaic plant in Burkina Faso. With Kenya and South Africa averaging $1 billion Foreign Direct Investment in renewable alone in 2014.To neglect the trio elements of reliability, affordability and green concerns could significantly spell doom for many projects and initiatives at least in the medium to long term.Chijioke MAMA is an Energy Research Analyst, Business Strategy Consultant and Syndicated Columnist in Lagos, Nigeria.

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria120","Why climate change mitigation is not the end of the world for global investors","December 10, 2015 Thursday","Ventures Africa","Discussions at COP21 highlight the crucial position of\~economic investors in helping to work\~towards a better planet.\~Although the attitude of investors towards issues surrounding climate change is becoming\~more positive, a good number\~of them are still battling with whether or not to\~prioritise the good of the planet over how it\~will\~most likely affect their investment returns. Fossil fuels [dirty fuels] are a major asset to numerous investment companies, especially for those that have built their portfolio around\~the sector. Advocating for clean energy and carbon emissions regulation puts them at a risk of losing this. However, to achieve a significant reduction in carbon emissions and improved management in global warming, big investors around the world will be required to decarbonise their assets, ultimately.Greg Murray, Co-Founder and Managing Director of CleanStar Ventures, talks to Ventures Africa about investing around climate change and how investments in Africa - and globally - can still thrive, especially if investors do the right thing to save the planet.Ventures Africa (VA): What would you say is the biggest worry that investors have when it comes to climate change as it affects investment returns in AfricaGreg Murray (GM): I suppose it would be agriculture. That's the most affected sector, followed closely by the energy sector. Aside from the political issues surrounding\~foreign ownership of land, the major concern that foreign investors have is around primary agriculture risks and that translates to climatic risks. The seasons are all over the place and there's not a lot of predictability in many countries around rainfall patterns and droughts.You end up with people who play more of an agro-processing and source-trading role, rather than a primary production one, offloading the climate risks onto small farmers. It sounds great from a political economy, land ownership and community involvement point of view when taken at face value. However, it\~can be problematic, because small farmers are obviously the least prepared to handle the climatic variability associated with\~climate change.(VA): Do you think that understanding the risks of climate change on financial stability will push investors to make smarter choices to improve their business environments?(GM):\~There are favourable situations\~created by the increase in\~awareness around the need to act on climate change, as well as a huge growth in renewable energy opportunities, whether it's in energy generation or in the huge market that exists for cooking fuel. The current deforestation and climate changes are all linked to the charcoal market, for example, and it creates a significant opportunity to replace that fuel with a more sustainable alternative\~and that's something that wasn't really possible five years ago.Thus, whilst climate change presents risks, it is\~also an opportunity to do things in a more sensible way. In terms of how people are assessing risk, I do not know if there's a sufficient integration of climate risks into investment decisions, such as with renewables investors or climate-related investors, which is our primary function. Perhaps agriculturists are thinking about dams and hydro-plants and would be aware of the risks associated with drought periods and the impacts on their business, but that is as far it goes for investment decisions.For example, the oil and gas/coal industry is promoting\~awareness for\~the donation of stranded assets within huge reserves found all over the place. If a global agreement is reached to have emissions not rise above 2 degrees Celsius then it's quite likely that a majority of the existing reserves are not going to be utilised.Some people [investors] are taking this very seriously, while others\~are not and they are trying to divert attention away from this fact. I really doubt that the notion of unburnable reserves is factored into the decisions of the guys doing coal-mining on the continent or going after oil and gas. Particularly given as the African countries are not likely to be at the forefront of enabling regulation of emissions, I'm not sure that it is being concluded in investment decisions in the same way.(VA): How prepared would you say investors are to undergo a structural change under which fossil fuels as a source of energy for economies is no longer viable?(GM):\~Investors want to make money. So once the alternatives are cheaper and we have factory technologies that enable us really compete, the money will flow. I think that it's a matter of taking a moral decision. In terms of focus, existing energy assets are to be protected and we can expect them to behave, to fight tooth and nail to protect those assets and fight regulation on emission and so on.We've seen this behaviour before and I don't think many people will suddenly change their. On the continent too, the mentality, at least from developed countries, is to use any means necessary \- including energy \- to grow as fast as humanly possible. Looking back historically, this is not necessarily good.Frankly, I don't see any regulation with 'teeth' coming up soon, at least not in the East African countries that we operate in, acting to limit emissions. There might be governments that will position themselves for the climate finance, for example, to track some of that.(VA): What financial strategy do you think investors should adopt as the global energy sector evolves?(GM):\~I think that they should hunt down renewable energy and climate-friendly technologies, because they are going to be the future with the amount of capital being poured\~into them. Going after coal and fossil fuel-mining or generation would be against them as it takes time for the regulation on emissions to trickle down. We're already seeing it in the destruction of value of coal stocks globally.(VA): Institutional investors tend to play a powerful role in determining how some of the biggest companies around the world decide on economic issues. What are your thoughts on how they can influence the necessary response to the 2 degrees Celsius scenario being discussed presently in Paris?(GM): Recently, the investment community is leading the charge in terms of taking an active role in pushing for the adoption of certain standards. I don't see the institutional investors being the intransigents here, it's more of the companies themselves that have sunk capital into a particular strategy.Institutional investors can trade out of companies easily, it's much harder for the companies themselves to divest fossil fuel assets because they won't find a buyer to sponsor the financial trade, particularly in the public market. Institutional investors can take a stand or a strategy decision on climate risks and decide that they want to go underway on dirty fuel or energy assets. It's easy to implement, but less so\~to undertake the structural challenge required.For example, E.ON, in Germany, has basically separated itself into the\~'good bank' and 'bad bank'\~where\~all the dirty energy assets are in the bad utility and the new distributed energy assets are situated in the good utility. As a result of this, they have to try to delink the forward-looking from the residual, dirty energy asset portfolio that has to be protected and I think we're going to see more of that.It's harder to do than the institutional investors simply summing down a particular stock because they decide that the climate risk premium has increased. I actually see institutional investors as being part of the solution. We've seen it with various declarations and with institutions signing on to the need for greater disclosure on climate risk and carbon risk.\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria121","Former US Ambassador to African Union, John Simon, talks about strategising towards a tolerable climate future for Africa","December 4, 2015 Friday","Ventures Africa","If African nations want to have any sort of influence in these types of talks, they need to band together behind the AU, as well as behind the countries with which they have shared interests. It used to be the G77 representing the developing world, but now it's different because different countries have diverse interests, and one voice for the developing world doesn't quite work. However, you can create communities of interest.According to John Simon, a former US Ambassador, Africa has a distinct set of interests. Right now, the biggest impediment to Africa's development is the lack of power- but some of the best power sources for Africa are fossil sources. Fossil sources are a hot topic at the climate talks, based on their natural tendency to cause environmental harm but they are crucial to the continent's development.Africa has tremendous renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal energy. However, rather than prioritising one energy source over the other, it seems a symbiotic approach would be the most useful.The aforementioned debate is just one of many that underscores the need for African nations to be strategically positioned at the COP-21. As an expert in strategy and public policy, Simon shared his thoughts on what the continent's leaders should focus on in Paris, with Ventures Africa.Ventures Africa (VA): You worked with the African Union between 2008 and 2009. Can you give us a brief history on how African nations have handled climate talks in the past?John Simon (JS): In my experience, climate wasn't very high up there on the list. Africa faces a lot of consequences of climate change, so there was concern about climate mitigation. But, Africa uses a tiny amount of the greenhouse gases in this world, and so it's not as if African countries have a significant imperative to reduce their greenhouse gases, it's really more about how they develop going forward.Africa was kind of used as a prop in the old formula. Not much was asked of poor Africa, who had nothing to cause these problems, but was bearing a big part of the consequences, and votes were advocates for stronger control in the developed world. Now that there is a chance to get the developing world to share more of the burden, I think that Africa needs to be wary of restrictions on what sources of power they can use that would ultimately inhibit their development. And of course, the best way for countries to become more environmentally responsible is for them to be more developed.So in the past, Africa didn't need to have a robust voice at these climate talks, and some countries like Mauritius paid serious consequences of climate change, because, again, we're held out as props of the impact if we don't do something.Now, Africa needs to make sure that it can bring some of the leverage that it has to the world, like significant renewable resources, and say, ""look, we have a lot of resource, and you can help us develop it, and we'll help reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the future. But that can't be at the expense of us being able to use other sources of energy where it makes sense.""\~Most important is for African countries to realise that their voice is stronger if it's united, and that they need to rally behind a negotiating strategy that should be articulated behind the AU.VA: What can you say about the 2006 Adaptation Fund that was established for developing nations, following attempts to help them cope with climate change?JS: If I remember correctly, it was more of an aspirational thing. I don't know that the fund ever really deployed any capital at all, to tell you the truth. Do you?VA: Not at all. And after that there was another effort made in form of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2011. Do you think that the AU played a strong enough role in ensuring that it was distributed accordingly?I honestly don't think that those funds have done a lot to make a difference, such as increase renewable energy, or mitigation. I'd be happy to be proven wrong.VA: You've just made an interesting point about words being more than action in these situations. There have been comments about how the conference in Paris is already tilting away from the vocal commitments initially made by world leaders. What do you think that African leaders should anticipate as a result?JS: It's probably a bit too early to tell, but I can categorically state what they should guard against. They should guard against control over their use of practical power solutions, as while it has a marginal global impact, it also has an impact on the ability of countries to develop.They should also make alliances that are convenient with other 'like-minded' blocs and countries that are also interested in seeing a certain amount of latitude given for them to be able to develop, while at the same time making sure that they are not overly res\l"

A few years after the air plane came in the second industrial revolution.As the world look forward with optimism the Industrial Revolution 4.0 it is hoped it would develop a cyber-physical system that may have innovations in driverless smart cars, artificial intelligence and robotics in hospitals, world's first solar powered air plane, biotechnology, nanotechnology, mobile banking, and 3.D printing.The World Economic Forum has become a global think tank for economic advancement. The World Economic Forum on Africa (WEFA) holds in Kigali, Rwanda on 11-13 May 2016 with theme: Connecting Africa's Resources through Digital Transformation.It would improve investment climate and macroeconomic policy reforms for foreign direct investment flows to grow economies.Nigeria hosted the 24th WEFA in May 2014 in Abuja days after the horrendous, terror-striken Nyanya bomb blasts like those in Paris in November 2015 before the COP 21.The Forum has been a model of world corporate governance founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a holder of two doctorate degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Economics. As a nonprofit organization, the WEF is a foremost international institution for public-private cooperation with values as important as rules.Legitimacy, accountability, transparency and concerted action are the guiding principles of the Forum that engages political, business, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.President Barack might have initiated processes of the Revolution 4.0 in his very last state of the union address to Americans in January.Obama said priority would be to invest in the future and avoids subsidizing the past. He meant America would use solar and wind energy to solve the challenges of climate change. That meant fossil fuel subsidies is now a thing of the past and renewables as the future; It is an American dream he may however not implement as he leaves office in January 2017 with fossil fuels still playing dominant roles in global economies.But what lessons have Nigeria learnt as the Fourth Industrial Revolution beckons? To the Group of Seven (G7) nations it is a knockout of fossil fuels but should we tag along?We must strive to be in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 party, irrespective of whether the industrialised world ruminate an abandonment of fossil fuels.It is a wake up call for Nigeria as one believes that divinely a Nigerian would stumble across solution to our liquid fossil fuels for our own industrial take off. We must not for now abandon petroleum; our goose that lays the golden egg. What we have been shying away from is what others are benefiting from and we import. We will continue to have comparative and competitive advantages in petroleum to invest in process plants.As the Federal Government convenes an economic summit next week, Petroleum should be seen as our takeoff commodity to heavily invest in. We spend $1490.59 importing 80 percent of products in the value chain of petroleum if we were to refine one metric ton of crude.For every metric ton we sell, we make less than $280. We buy back 80 percent of the byproducts at $1490.59. Adding the remaining 20 percent of byproducts and derivatives it means we buy back what we sell for less than $280 for over $2000. Our national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) should now brace up to the challenge and invest in refineries.The developed world is thinking ahead, we should follow but tread carefully to achieve our desires. We must start from wherever to be in the revolution. Our lads and lasses are ready for the much talked about fourth industrial revolution. We must harness their potentials in the information and communications technology for the petroleum industry. Who would have thought the Nigerian genres of music would be reckoned with globally; ditto the films?It is a must do spirit for Nigerians.\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria124","Draft Climate Change Agreement Forwarded to Paris","October 27, 2015","This Day (Lagos)","After five days of dedicated work in Bonn, the draft text of the new, universal climate change agreement and its accompanying decisions will be dispatched to Paris, where a final agreement will be reached in December.The draft text of the agreement enjoys full ownership by the governments of the world and represents a balanced text that will constitute the starting point for the final round of negotiations. This is contained in a statement by the UNFCCC COP 21 Paris office. Negotiations will resume in Paris when governments meet at the Paris Climate Change Summit from 30 November to 11 December 2015.The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with 196 Parties, has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol has been ratified by 192 of the UNFCCC Parties.For the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, 37 States, consisting of highly industrialized countries and countries undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, have legally binding emission limitation and reduction commitments. In Doha in 2012, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, which establishes the second commitment period under the Protocol. The ultimate objective of both treaties is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Christiana Figueres said that the draft text includes additional options that reflect the concerns of all countries. ""We now have a Party-owned text that is balanced and complete. The challenge for governments is to bring it down to a much more concise and coherent form for adoption in Paris.""French Climate Change Ambassador Laurence Tubiana said: ""We have a manageable text for further work in Paris. While much work remains, the text is a good basis for negotiations and negotiations need to start from the first day of the conference."" Both Ms. Figueres and Ms. Tubiana agreed that the political process between now and the beginning of the Paris Summit will be central to the success of the meeting.A Pre-COP Ministerial meeting will take place in the French capital in early November to further address the high-level political issues relating to the draft agreement, the statement said. The G20 Heads of State will meet in Turkey in mid-November, followed by the Heads of State meeting of the Commonwealth in Malta just before the Paris Summit opens.Meanwhile, a total of 146 countries, representing almost 87 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have submitted their intended national climate action plans to the United Nations.A statement by the Paris conference media team said ""This means that so far over 75 percent of all member countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have responded. This includes all developed countries under the Convention and 104 developing countries, or almost 70 percent of UNFCCC developing member states.""Over 80 percent of the plans include quantifiable objectives and also over 80 percent include intended actions to adapt to climate change.""Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC said: ""Over the past few months, the number of countries submitting their climate action plans to the Paris agreement has grown from a steady stream into a sweeping flood. This unprecedented breadth and depth of response reflects the increasing recognition that there is an unparalleled opportunity to achieve resilient, low-emission, sustainable development at national level.""""The INDCs can be seen as an impressive portfolio of potential investment opportunities that are good for each individual country and good for the planet,"" she said.The UNFCCC secretariat, as requested by Parties to the Convention, will provide a synthesis report of all these plans, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), on November 1. More countries will continue to submit their plans ahead of the Paris UN climate change conference from 30 November to 11 December, 2015.The European Union is also counted as a separate ""Party"" to the UNFCCC in addition to all its members, which means that a total of 147 Parties to the Convention have submitted plans.National Level Planning Across Diverse National Circumstances The Paris agreement is to be a turning point that puts the world on track to the low-emission, climate resilient and sustainable future that is the only way to keep global average temperatures from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius, the internationally-agreed defense l"

By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants had been routed by our gallant armed forces,"" he stated. Buhari said his administration's immediate focus was on a gradual and safe return of internally displaced persons in safety and dignity and for the resumption of normalcy in the lives of people living in those areas.The president said apart from giving the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the freedom to pursue corrupt officials, his administration had also alerted the judiciary on what Nigerians expected of it in the fight against corruption.The president said the government's plan was to save foreign exchange by fast tracking repair of the refineries and producing most of our fuel requirements at home.He said the nation would save billions of dollars in foreign exchange and drastically reduce its food import bill by growing more food in Nigeria, mainly; rice, wheat and sugar.He said the economic misfortune the nation was experiencing in the shape of very low oil prices had provided an opportunity to restructure the economy and diversify.""We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestocks, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce.""Central Bank of Nigeria will offer more fiscal incentives for business that prove capable of manufacturing products that are internationally competitive. We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria.""Meanwhile, the first steps along the path of self-sufficiency in rice, wheat and sugar - big users of our scarce foreign exchange - have been taken. The Labour Intensive Farming Enterprise will boost the economy and ensure inclusive growth in long neglected communities. Special intervention funds through the Bank of Agriculture will provide targeted support.Concerns remain about rising cost of foods such as maize, rice, millet, beans and gari. Farmers tell me that they are worried about the cost of fertilizers, pesticides and the absence of extension services,"", he said.He added: ""I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the increasing role that our women are playing in revitalizing the agricultural sector. Modern farming is still hard and heavy work and I salute our Nigerian women in sharing this burden. In this respect I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict.""With respect to solid minerals, the minister has produced a roadmap where we will work closely with the world bank and major international investors to ensure through best practices and due diligence that we choose the right partners. Illegal mining remains a problem and we have set up a special security team to protect our assets. Special measures will be in place to protect miners in their work environment.""For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimizes the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom. A society that fails to recognize that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen "" poverty is not just lack of money. It is not having the capability to realize one's full potential as a human being.""President Buhari reassured of his administration's commitment to rescuing the over 200 abducted Chibok schoolgirls.He said to the delight of all, two of the abducted Chibok girls had regained their freedom.""During the last one year, not a single day passed without my agonizing about these girls. Our efforts have centred around negotiations to free them safely from their mindless captors. We are still pursuing that course. Their safety is of paramount concern to me and I am sure to most Nigerians. I am very worried about the conditions those still captured might be in. Today I re-affirm our commitment to rescuing our girls. We will never stop until we bring them home safely. As I said before, no girl should be put through the brutality of forced marriage and every Nigerian girl has the right to an education and a life choice,"" he said.The president paid a special tribute to ""our gallant men and women of the armed forces who are in harm's way so that the rest of us can live and go about our business in safety. Their work is almost done. The nation owes them a debt of gratitude"".He added: ""Abroad, we want to assure our neighbours, friends and development partners that Nigeria is firmly committed to democratic principles. We are ready partners in combating terrorism, cyber crimes, control of communicable diseases and protection of the environment. Following on the Paris Agreement, COP 21, we are fully committed to halting and reversing desertification. Elsewhere, we will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which I referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report.""We are grateful to the international community notably France, the US, UK and China for their quick response in helping to tackle the recent Ebola outbreak in our sub-region. We also acknowledge the humanity shown by the Italian and German governments in the treatment of boat people, many fleeing from our sub-region because of lack of economic opportunity. We thank all our partners especially several countries in the EU.""We appreciate the valuable work that the UN agencies, particularly UNICEF, ICRC, the World Food Program have been doing. We must also appreciate the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund and Educate A Child of Qatar for the excellent work in our health, education and other sectors.""\l"

"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria127","Assessing Ogun's Diversification Drive","May 18, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","The Ogun State Investors' forum was an opportunity to showcase efforts being made by the state to become an economic force in Nigeria.Following the significant drop in funds from the federation allocation as a result of the slump in crude oil prices, economic diversification has become an anthem with most states looking inwards to attract investments.Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, said the state would continue to focus on agriculture. The theme of the forum was: ""Agriculture, Environment and Transportation.""Amosun said: ""Agriculture plays a significant role in economic development of our state. The state is endowed with favourable climate and good vegetation for all year round cultivation of various cash and food crops as well as livestock rearing. In the south, we have the evergreen forest vegetation and soil most suitable for the cultivation of cash and food crops like oil palm, rice, kola- nut, cocoa, cotton, cassava, cocoyam and vegetables.""While in the north, we have a vast grazing savannah land that is very proper for animal husbandry. In addition to this, there are forest reserves, rivers and lagoons. Other natural resources include forest and large quantities of mineral deposits, such as limestone, phosphate, granite stone, gypsum, bauxite, bitumen, feldspar, clay, glass sand, kaolin, quartz, tar sand and gemstones.""Speaking on environment, he said: ""Environment is a new theme this year, but as demonstrated during the COP21 Climate Change Summit in Paris in December 2015, we are aware that we cannot ignore our environment while pursuing our developmental initiatives. Ogun State has one of the last remaining virgin rain forests in West Africa.""Found within J4, a forest reserve located 66km from Ijebu Ode, of which 20 per cent is protected by the United Nations. Yet, unless surrounding communities can see how preserving the forests can help them earn a decent living, they are likely to collude with illegal loggers, threatening the world's ecosystem.To demonstrate how agro-forestry can generate wealth for local communities, Ogun State has entered into an ambitious collaboration with LaFarge Holcim Africa Plc and the Nigeria Sovereign Wealth Fund for the restoration of the Aworo and Imeko Forest Reserves.""Furthermore, on transportation, he said: ""The strategic location of Ogun State offers immense benefits for investors in the area of logistics, distribution and retail, which emphasises the need for infrastructural development in the state. Ogun State is a natural transportation hub for Nigeria, as the flow of goods and people from the commercial capital Lagos via land must and does pass through our state.""Indeed, whether going into or out of Lagos from any other part of Nigeria, one must pass through Ogun State. We believe that an inter-modal transportation network is essential in order to maximize economic growth. The development of strategically placed airports and railways is integral to the Ogun State development plan.""""Now, more than at any time in our history, industries and entrepreneurs from within Africa and around the world are choosing Ogun State as their preferred investment destination. For example, just last month (April, 2016), our Administration attracted $2.1 Billion dollars of Investment from China, directed mainly towards the development of our railways and Free Trade Zones.""Yet, more investment is needed to realise the full potential of the State. Our State Master Plan, which is the statutory policy of government, guiding the physical development of the State, captures the many areas where the discerning investor may wish to put his or her money to secure attractive returns.""Agriculture and Economic DiversificationPresently, agriculture has been embraced as the major plank for governments' economic diversification drive.Speaking at the forum, the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh described agriculture as the soul of nations, saying that any nation without a vibrant agricultural sector is already deprived of its essence and its soul.According to the minister, it was in recognition of the strategic importance of agriculture to national transformation that President Muhammadu Buhari is giving the revival of the agricultural sector the priority it deserves in the on-going national development efforts.""So what are our priorities over the next four years? The first priority is the achievement of self-sufficiency, and excess, in our local staples namely: cassava, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, wheat, fruits and vegetables, poultry, honey, sugar, beans, soya, oil-palm, fish, milk, vegetable oils.""Through the cooperative efforts of all key stakeholders in the agricultural sector that we expect to key into this vision and help us to actualize it, we are confident that over the next four years, the huge import bill that we are incurring presently should gradually be a thing of the past while we conserve foreign exchange for deployment to areas of strategic importance, and improve on our employment generation capacity, especially for youths, which invariably will help to guarantee shared prosperity and enhance national security,"" the minister added.He also urged participants to enhance agro products for export in the areas of Nigeria's comparative advantage namely: Cocoa, Coffee, Kolanut, Cotton, Cashew, Tea, Sesame, Soya, Fruits & Vegetables, Banana, Onions, Pineapples, Ogbono, Gum Arabic.He recalled that at independence, Nigeria was a world-leading exporter of many cash crops including groundnut, palm oil, cocoa and cotton till the subsequent period of petroleum resource dominance that overshadowed the agricultural sector for many decades. Then, the South-western geo-political zone of the country financed most of its development programmes with earnings from the agricultural sector which made the region a pace setter in many areas of human endeavour in the country.To this end, Ogbeh, said there was need to recover lost grounds in these areas given the realisation that Nigeria controls a sizeable share of the global market for crops in the past.""We believe that the various measures that we are putting in place to re-energise the production of these crops in larger volumes, both as raw materials for home industries, and as exports, will help to restore our market share within the next two to four years.""Given its proximity to Lagos State and the investment-friendly disposition of the State which has attracted more corporate organisations and industries into it lately, it is evident that Ogun State will be a key beneficiary of this policy drive of enhanced agro production and export in our areas of comparative advantage,"" he added.Ease of Doing BusinessAn array of investors who were discussants at the forum, all agreed that the state accessibility to Lagos, which is the largest market in Africa, as well as its Ease of Doing Business, have all helped their businesses positively.The Managing Director Unilever, Mr. Yaw Nsarkoh hailed the state for being a people-focused state. He said: ""It is a reality that whilst it is one of the states that make up the federation of Nigeria, it is also competing in the international sphere. The reason I define the contest that way is because I feel that Ogun is setting apart a thought-leader when it comes to people centred development and thinking about development in a very integrated way.""There are specific attributes of competitiveness in Ogun state which is the roads, infrastructure, and the fact that there is a government that is accessible, and aside from giving priority to the private sector, it gives priority to people.""People are at the centre of Ogun state development effort and at the end of the day; those of us at the private sector understand that there is no way to build an enduring business module without putting the people first then the community would thrive. That is the most distinguished feature of Ogun state which should be an example for many states not just in Nigeria, but for many communities elsewhere in Africa and the world.Also, Managing Director MD Rites Food, Mr. Saleem Adegunwa said: ""We have been in the state for 2 years now and by virtue of location, the state is actually statically perfect. It is an hour from Lagos and to get across the country it is much easier than you would actually realise because we need our products all over the country.""He added that with this ease they experience doing business in the state also, they are targeting to employ over 3000 workers once their new plant is up and running.Also, the Chairman Flour Mills, Mr. John Coumantaros said: ""I think Ogun has one of the greatest opportunities because it is at the cross roads of Agriculture and industry. There is an old saying that a factory without a farm is scrap metal and a farm without a factory is a weed. I see tremendous ability here to unite industrious and agricultural sector.""On her part, the Managing Director Larfarge Africa Plc, Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo, disclosed that her organisation had invested heavily in the state.""WAPCO has been in the state for 59 years so I think we actually predated Ogun state as the heart in western region. We have continued to invest in Ogun state. We have also invested in power, we have currently 90 megawatts and we are looking 310 megawatts by 2017. We have huge social investment which we estimate our total impact at N24 billion per annum.""We have huge environmental investments which are in l"

Though the Clock has been closer to Doomsday in 1953 - it was two minutes away then when the threat of nuclear catastrophe seemed very real soon after the H-Bomb was first tested by both USA and USSR - the witching hour seems nearer to us than ever before. Things seem a far cry from 1991 when the Clock moved to 17 minutes from midnight - the best time ever, when the Cold War and the communist era ended and it appeared that days of sanity and a climate of hope was once again upon us.However, we are back where we started, and unfortunately, this time around conditions seem just right for a perfect storm with new threats having arisen that makes the pessimists' dire predictions a near certainty. The threat of disease and contagion is never over: the Middle Ages had the bubonic plague and in our times we have all become familiar with acronyms that together have spelt death of millions. I refer to AIDS, SARS, MERS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola and now ZIKA.

We reiterate the importance of staff diversity and gender balance at all levels, including diversity of educational institutions and background as well as experiences.Members rising from their meeting said in a communique ""We reiterate our deep disappointment with the lack of progress in implementing the IMF quota and governance reforms agreed to in 2010 and strongly urge the U.S. to complete ratification. This remains an impediment to IMF credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness and has considerably delayed forward-looking commitments, namely, a new quota formula and the 15th General Review of Quotas.""Implementing the 2010 reforms remains our key priority. Nevertheless, we believe that a decision to de-link quota reform from the Board reform amendment, which is the element of the 2010 reforms that requires ratification by the U.S. Congress, would be the preferred option in the interim, as it increases IMF resources and also realigns quotas to reflect the increased economic weight of EMDCs. The alternative option, interim ad hoc increases, can, if properly designed, achieve meaningful progress towards the shifts in representation under the 2010 reforms, although it would increase IMF quota resources only marginally. It is important that any interim measures be designed so as not to lower incentives to complete the 14th General Review of Quotas"".They observed ""We strongly urge the initiation of the 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, without further delays, with a view to meet the December 2015 deadl"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria130","6 questions African policymakers must answer now by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala","March 17, 2016 Thursday","PM News","The Africa rising story of the past decade, fueled by 5 per cent average annual growth, is in danger of faltering, due to the impact of global uncertainty, depressed commodity prices, and weakly performing economies like China. Don't be lulled by the IMF's 2016 forecast: yes 4 percent growth will outperform global expectations, but continued commodity price volatility and global uncertainty are giving rise to a fresh bout of Afro-pessimism. To change the narrative, and - more importantly - the reality it describes, African policymakers must urgently answer these six questions.1. How do we ensure steady financing for our significant needs for sustainable development in an increasingly uncertain global environment?This is perhaps the fundamental question. Slowing growth and low commodity prices will be around for the next few years, causing an inevitable, but hopefully temporary, macroeconomic setback. This increases vulnerability to a retrenchment in external finance. Several African countries have issued Eurobonds (to the tune of $21 billion during 2013-15) and foreign investors hold a growing share of domestically issued debt. Foreign direct investment, which tends to be concentrated in natural resource sectors, is also likely to pull back. A cutback in external funding will put badly-need infrastructure investment and social programs on hold, dealing a blow to long-run growth. African countries need to work with the donor community to avert such a situation.Economic diversification, creating jobs and tackling inequality, which are discussed below, are a vital part of the long-run challenge in Africa and also feed into two key global achievements of 2015: the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September and the agreement on climate change at COP21 in Paris in December. But diversification requires well-developed infrastructure, telecommunications, power, roads, rail, water, etc. The World Bank estimates Africa's infrastructure financing needs alone at US$93 billion annually. Climate-friendly and sustainable infrastructure will cost even more. But Africa offers the best opportunity for low-carbon, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure development because so much is greenfield and still to be built. Directing the necessary financing from international public and private sectors into African infrastructure development can reap important positive externalities for the whole world.Africans rightly argue that they are victims, and not perpetrators, of today's climate-related challenges. So will the international community rise to the occasion? The reality is weak global growth, coupled with domestic challenges on unemployment and immigration, makes it unlikely that developed countries will fully honor promises for additional financing to implement the post-2015 development agenda. Africans will have to mobilize the majority of their own resources. In fact the New Climate Economy estimates that 50-80 percent of the resources required for the development of sustainable infrastructure will have to come from countries' own domestic resources.This means African countries must ensure a quantum leap in domestic resource mobilization (DRM). The opportunity clearly exists to substantially increase tax and other revenue efforts, including limiting tax evasion and illicit financial flows. Across sub-Saharan Africa, tax revenues account for less than a fifth of GDP, while they correspond to over a third in OECD countries. African countries will need to almost double their tax revenues to help finance the SDGs. The good news is that tax revenues on the continent are growing rapidly. Through reforms between 1990 and 2004, Ghana raised tax revenues from 11 to 22 percent of its GDP, for example. Admittedly this is difficult. Raising non-oil tax revenues was something we saw as an opportunity in Nigeria and struggled with.What is needed is a significant improvement in capacity, systems and processes in these countries - a worthwhile investment for governments and a small fraction of aid budgets that donors can support. In addition, DRM should also involve leveraging public resources innovatively to tap private-sector resources. Estimates indicate approximately US$380 billion in total pension assets under management in just 10 African countries, and these resources are growing rapidly. Between 2008 and 2013, Nigeria's pension industry grew from US$7 to US$25 billion. In Ghana, the pension industry is expected to grow 400 per cent between 2014 and 2018.2. How do we truly diversify our economies?Diversification has become a slogan. Everyone talks about it but the debate on how to truly diversify is shallow. The discourse reflects lazy thinking as if diversification could happen in just a few years. The vision of what needs to be done is often truncated into the short time frame of politicians, instead of carefully laying out the various stages to achieve a truly diverse economy - notwithstanding the abundance of 10-, 20-, and 30-year-long economic plans that are crafted in almost every country, and then gather dust.There are plenty of models to follow: Dubai, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and South Korea are admired by Africans as economies that have managed to transform themselves. But the discussion often stops there without recognizing that Dubai, for example, started more than three decades ago to ask the question: What should life be like after oil? And it set out to implement a step-by-step vision of a services economy, putting infrastructure and incentives in place to build up financial services, tourism, medical services, real estate, media, arts, and culture. Singapore and South Korean are no less inspiring because they had few or no natural resources to rely on.What these countries also had was leadership that was relentless decade after decade in pursuing the diversification and transformation of their economies - either through entrenched but benign dictators or democracies in which generations of leaders and citizens agreed on a vision of a broad-based economy.Sub-Saharan Africa has the foundation for diversified growth that several of these trailblazers did not: value-added agriculture and agro industry, processing and transformation of mineral resources, petrochemical complexes, manufacturing of durable and consumer goods, tourism and entertainment, and an emerging information technology sector.For donors, diversification delivers on several critical SDGs:Goal 1 to end povertyGoal 8 to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for allGoal 9 to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovationGoal 10 to reduce inequality within and among countriesGoal 13 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impactsThe journey toward diversification is long, but policymakers must start down this road now.3. How do we improve the quality of growth and create jobs?Recent growth in Africa did not bring a corresponding increase in jobs. Except in a few countries, like Nigeria, where growth actually occurred in the non-oil sectors, growth in most African countries was linked to their commodity sector. And growth benefited only a few, leaving, especially, young people and women behind. In fact inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient (with 0 denoting perfect equality and 100 perfect inequality) rose in several African countries between 2006 and 2013.Country 2006 2013S/Africa 57.8 63.1Nigeria 43.7 48.8Rwanda 28.9 50.8Ghana 40.8 42.8Tanzania 34.6 37.6Source: UNDP World Development Reports for 2006 and 2013Policymakers should answer this: is growth occurring in sectors that create jobs such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services? Who is left behind? How can taxation and income redistribution redirect resources better, and include those at the bottom of the ladder via social safety nets?These were questions we were starting to ask and answer about our own growth story in Nigeria. The idea was not to question whether we needed growth but to improve the quality of growth.4. What type and quality of human resources do we need to underpin our development aspirations?As African economies diversify, matching skills to emerging job opportunities will be critical. Many Africans feel that despite the progress made by the continent on health and education indicators under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), our education and health systems are broken and need fixing. On a continent where 70 percent of the population is already under 30, and that is home to half the worldwide total of primary-school-aged children not in school, basic reading, writing and technology skills, followed by vocational, technical, and entrepreneurial training, must be priorities. Nigeria, especially, should act decisively here - Africa's most populous country also has the largest number of children out of school, at 8.7 million in 2010.But we must simultaneously strengthen weak health-care systems to tackle endemic diseases that sap productivity (such as malaria), and to provide preventative care for adults and, especially, for children (through vaccinations and routine immunizations). Stronger health-care systems will also help the world cope with future epidemics: the World Bank estimates the devastation wrought to the economies of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone by the Ebola virus at US$2.2 billion, or 16 percent of the combined GDP (2014) of the three countries. Sierra Leone's growth rate for 2014, for example, was forecast at 11.3 percent prior to the crisis, but fell to 4 percent. The impact on other African economies due to the neighborhood effect was also significant.5. How do we trade better with each other?African goods and services accounted for just 16 percent of trade within Africa in 2013, and just over 3 percent of world trade. One problem is what we are making. Most African countries produce the same type of commodities, and trade them with very little value added. The continent's industrialization drive, very much a part of the African Union's 2063 development agenda, needs to focus on the issue of specialization to enhance inter-African trade. Industrializing through trade was the focus of the Economic Commission for Africa's 2015 Economic Report on Africa. Countries with the requisite manufacturing base should consider what can be processed or manufactured, and traded with others.One encouraging signal is the growing volume of intra-African investment, which rose as a share of the continent's overall foreign direct investment from 8 percent in 2003 to close to 23 percent in 2013. This could be harnessed to achieve greater industrialization and increased trade of differentiated goods and services between African countries. This can be a virtuous circle which adds value and volume to Africa's trade with the world.But there is another problem to consider: logistics. Policymakers must make it easier to move goods across borders, by improving connectivity between countries, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles and administrative costs. For example, road transport tariffs across Africa are estimated at US$0.05 to US$0.13 per ton-kilometer, compared to the average of US$0.01 to US$0.05 for all developing countries. This must come down so Africans can more easily trade with each other.There are some examples of significant improvements. The East and Southern African regional blocs , COMESA and SADC, have made some important gains in this area. For example, paved roads along the central corridor connecting the ports of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to Bujumbura, Burundi, increased from 57 percent in 2006 to 87 percent in 2010. There have also been efforts to improve rail infrastructure to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The African Development Bank estimates that the ongoing Rift Valley Railway project between Mombasa, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda, would double the volume of trade while reducing marginal costs by 30 percent.6. How do we focus on good economic management?Africa offers incredible opportunity for diversified economies based on low-carbon, sustainable infrastructure. We can meet the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement - indeed, we must - and we can change the Africa failing narrative. But African leaders must answer these development challenges now.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is a former finance minister of Nigeria, and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development.\l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria131","Buhari - Taking Sambisa, Rescuing Chibok Girls Our Last Major Task","May 15, 2016","This Day (Lagos)","President Muhammadu Buhari stated at the Second Regional Security Summit yesterday in Abuja that the Nigerian armed forces had considerably degraded the Boko Haram terrorist sect. Buhari, however, stressed that dislodging the group from the Sambisa forest in Borno State, where its fighters are currently holed up following heavy bombardment by the military, and freeing the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls were the major tasks still left.This was as the European Union pledged to support the Multinational Joint Taskforce, a sub-regional security outfit, with 50 million Euros. Vice President and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Federica Mogherini, disclosed this at the Abuja summit. The MNJTF was reactivated in the wake of the Boko Haram insurgency to coordinate the fight against the sect and other acts of terrorism within the West African sub-region.The United States Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Anthony Blinken, told the conference that his country had contributed over $250 million to the on-going fight against terrorism, in addition to other resources.The Second Regional Security Summit in Abuja was attended by President of France, Francois Hollande, and seven regional leaders, including the presidents of Chad, Cameroun, Niger, Benin, Senegal and Gabon. Though, other Western countries and institutions were represented at the summit, Hollande was the only Western leader present, underscoring France's crucial involvement in the fight against terrorism in the continent. Hollande had hosted the First Regional Security Summit in Paris on May 17, 2014.Speaking at the summit yesterday, Buhari said he had significantly fulfilled his promise to rout Boko Haram, which has wreaked havoc in the Nigeria's North-east since 2009, and spread its activities to countries within the Lake Chad Basin.He said, ""When I started, our first task was to improve our security infrastructure and strengthen our regional and international alliances. We have degraded Boko Haram and squeezed them into a small enclave in Sambisa forest. What remains is the dislodgement of terrorists from their hideouts from the Sambisa forest and liberate the Chibok girls and others. Boko Haram now resorts to hit and run tactics.""Buhari stated that the country's military operations against terrorists had followed acceptable international standards. ""We have not only observed human rights and international humanitarian law in our military operations, we have also diligently implemented several proactive programmes. Today, we have achieved significant outcomes. Boko Haram is no longer a cohesive force, but a group of self-seeking individuals pursuing personal glory,"" he said.The president listed some of the feats recorded at both bilateral and multilateral levels since the Paris summit in 2014 to include recovery of all the territories occupied by the terrorist group; establishment of special military units by Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon to prosecute the war on terror; admission of Benin Republic to the group to strengthen the regional coalition; establishment of the Regional Intelligence Fusion in Abuja and its operation; and strengthening border security among member states.Buhari said the regional alliance had also set up the Inter-Regional Coordination Centre (ICC), based in Yaounde, Cameroon, under the aegis of the Gulf of Guinea Commission (GGC), to coordinate and disseminate intelligence and security information to all member states. It has reactivated the MNJTF with 8,500 officers and men, drawn from Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin, with headquarters in Ndjamena, Chad, he said.He stressed, ""These achievements would not have been possible without the steadfast support, invaluable contributions and sacrifices of my brothers, the Presidents of Cameroun, Chad, Niger as well as the Republic of Benin. I am convinced that the great solidarity and good neighbourl"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria132","Buhari shelves publishing looters' list despite pressure","May 30, 2016 Monday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Lai Mohammed to disclose recovered loot this weekLeader vows to arrest N'Delta Avengers, sponsorsNigerians who had expected a comprehensive list of the alleged treasury looters as promised by President Muhammadu Buhari were disappointed yesterday. The president failed to make good his promise. However, he directed the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture to publish the list.Later in the night, the Minister of Information and Culture said during a television programme that he would disclose the recovered loot this week.Buhari had, on May 14, during his recent trip to London, the United Kingdom to attend the anti-corruption conference put together by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, pledged in an interview, to avail Nigerians of details of the alleged treasury looters, including where stolen assets were being kept.""So far, what has come out, what has been recovered in whatever currency from each ministry, department and individual, I intend on the 29th to speak on this because all Nigerians are getting from the mass media is the number of people arrested either by the EFCC, DSS. But we want to make a comprehensive report on May 29"", Buhari said while attending the anti-corruption summit in London.But during a special nation-wide media broadcast to mark his first year in office as president, Buhari failed to give the details, citing the cumbersome nature of tracing the looters, merely repeating his previous position that his administration was grappling with bureaucratic hurdles that make it difficult for stolen assets to be recovered from foreign jurisdictions.His words: ""We are also engaged in making recoveries of stolen assets some of which are in different jurisdictions. The processes of recovery can be tedious and time-consuming, but today I can confirm that thus far: significant amount of assets have been recovered. A considerable portion of these are at different stages of recovery.""Rather than personally speak on the matter and provide specific details as promised, the president only said he had directed the Ministry of Information to periodically publish details on the assets recovered so far.The president admitted that his government had of recent come under pressure to publicly substantiate his claims that billions of dollars have been recovered through the administration's intensified war against graft.He attributed the widespread poverty in the country to what he identified as largely certain policies of the Federal Government which were ""necessary pills"" to swallow in order to have a better future.Buhari who announced the official inauguration of his administration's Social Protection Programme, lamented that the Nigerian society had been neglecting the poor and victimising the weak.He said the social protection programme would seek to start the process of lifting many citizens out of poverty, while at the same time creating the opportunity for many to fend for themselves. ""For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimises the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom. A society that fails to recognise that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen, 'poverty is not just lack of money '""So, today, I am happy to formally launch, by far the most ambitious social protection programme in our history.'' He, therefore, expressed optimism that the programme would lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty while at the same time creating the opportunity for people to fend for themselves.Accordingly, he said, N500 billion has been appropriated in the 2016 budget for social intervention programmes in five key areas. He said that his administration was committed to providing job creation opportunities for 500,000 Nigerians to work as teachers and employ 100,000 artisans across the nation.His words: ""5.5 million children are to be provided with nutritious meals through our school feeding programme to improve learning outcomes, as well as enrolment and completion rates. The conditional cash transfer scheme will provide financial support for up to one million vulnerable beneficiaries, and complement the enterprise programme which will target up to one million market women; four hundred and sixty thousand artisans; and two hundred thousand agricultural workers nationwide.""He said this particular programme would target up to one million market women, 460,000 artisans and 200,000 agricultural workers, nationwide. President Buhari further disclosed that, through a education grant scheme, the Federal Government would encourage students studying sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics as well as lay a foundation for human capital development for the next generation.On the Niger Delta, the president said his administration was committed to implementing the United Nations Environment Programme, (UNEP) report, noting that he believed the way forward was to take a sustainable approach to address the issues that affect the delta communities. He noted that re-engineering the amnesty programmes was an example of this.He stressed that the recent spate of attacks by militants disrupting oil and power installations would not distract the administration from engaging leaders in the region in addressing Niger Delta problems, warning that if the militants and vandals were testing the government's resolve, they were much mistaken, saying, ""We shall apprehend the perpetrators and their sponsors and bring them to justice.""The policy measures and actions taken so far are not to be seen as some experiment in governance. We are fully aware that those vested interests who have held Nigeria back for so long will not give up without a fight. They will sow divisions, sponsor vile press criticisms at home and abroad, incite the public in an effort to create chaos rather than relinquish the vice-like grip they have held on Nigeria.""The president condemned the activities of illegal miners in the country, saying that a special security team had been set up to check the menace. He stressed that the security team was saddled with the task of protecting the nation's mining assets. He also revealed that special measures would be in place to protect miners in their work environment.According to him, the Ministry of Solid Mineral Resources has produced a roadmap where Nigeria would work closely with the World Bank and major international investors to ensure best practices and due diligence in the mining sector.On security, the president commended members of the Armed Forces for their efforts in checking the menace of Boko Haram insurgency in the North Eastern states of the country.""I would like to pay a special tribute to our gallant men and women of the armed forces who are in harm's way so that the rest of us can live and go about our business in safety. Their work is almost done. The nation owes them a debt of gratitude,'' he said.Buhari described the last one year of the administration as being a year of triumph, consolidation, pains and achievements, adding ""By age, instinct and experience, my preference is to look forward, to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead and rededicate the administration to the task of fixing Nigeria.""On putting the economy back on track, he noted: ""The measures we must take, may lead to hardships. The problems Nigerians have faced over the last year have been many and varied. But the real challenge for this government has been reconstructing the spine of the Nigerian economy.""According to the president, the good news about low prices of crude oil is that it has provided the nation with an opportunity to restructure its economy and diversify.He said: ""We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestock, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce.""He assured the citizens that the ""Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN) would offer more fiscal incentives for business that prove capable of manufacturing products that are internationally competitive. We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria.""To assist the women, the president said: ""I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict.""On the foreign scene, Buhari said: ""We want to assure our neighbours, friends and development partners that Nigeria is firmly committed to democratic principles. We are ready partners in combating terrorism, cyber-crimes, control of communicable diseases and protection of the environment.""Following on the Paris Agreement, COP 21, we are fully committed to halting and reversing desertification. Elsewhere, we will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which I referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report.""We are grateful to the international community notably France, the U.S., UK and China for their quick response in helping to tackle the recent Ebola outbreak in our sub-region. We also acknowledge the humanity shown by the Italian and German governments in the treatment of boat people, many fleeing from our sub-region because of lack of economic opportunity. We thank all our partners especially several countries in the EU.""We appreciate the valuable work that the UN agencies, particularly UNICEF, ICRC, the World Food Programme have been doing. We must also appreciate the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund and Educate A Child of Qatar for the excellent work in our health, education and other sectors.""He reaffirmed his administration's belief in democracy as the form of government that best assures the active participation and actual benefit of the people, noting that despite the many years of hardship and disappointment the people of this nation have proved inherently good, industrious tolerant, patient and generous.""The past years have witnessed huge flows of oil revenues. From 2010 average oil prices were $100 per barrel. But economic and security conditions were deteriorating.

Oil prices have been declining since 2014 but due to the neglect of the past, the country was not equipped to halt the economy from declining. The infrastructure, notably rail, power, roads were in a decrepit state. Twenty-seven states could not pay salaries for months. In the north-east, Boko Haram had captured 14 local governments, driven the local authorities out, hoisted their flags. Elsewhere, insecurity was palpable corruption and impunity were the order of the day. In short, we inherited a state near collapse. readability=""8 Our problems as a government are like that of a farmer who in a good season harvests ten bags of produce. The proceeds enable him to get by for rest of the year However, this year he could only manage 3 bags from his farm He must now think of other ways to make ends meet. On the economic front, all oil dependent countries, Nigeria included, have been struggling since the drop in prices. Many oil rich states have had to take tough decisions similar to what we are doing. The world, Nigeria included has been dealing with the effects of three significant and simultaneous global shocks starting in 2014: A 70% drop in oil prices. Global growth slowdown. Normalisation of monetary policy by the United States federal reserve. From day one, we purposely set out to correct our condition, to change Nigeria We reinforced and galvanized our armed forces with new leadership and resources. We marshaled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants had been routed by our gallant armed forces. Our immediate focus is for a gradual and safe return of internally displaced persons in safety and dignity and for the resumption of normalcy in the lives of people living in these areas. Our problems as a government are like that of a farmer who in a good season harvests ten bags of produce. The proceeds enable him to get by for rest of the year However, this year he could only manage 3 bags from his farm He must now think of other ways to make ends meet. EFCC was given the freedom to pursue corrupt officials and the judiciary was alerted on what Nigerians expect of them in the fight against corruption. On the economy, in particular foreign exchange and fuel shortages, our plan is to save foreign exchange by fast tracking repair of the refineries and producing most of our fuel requirements at home. And by growing more food in Nigeria, mainly rice, wheat and sugar we will save billions of dollars in foreign exchange and drastically reduce our food import bill. We resolved to keep the Naira steady, as in the past, devaluation had done dreadful harm to the Nigerian economy. Furthermore, I supported the monetary authority's decision to ensure alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We shall keep a close look on how the recent measures affect the Naira and the economy. Furthermore, I supported the monetary authority's decision to ensure alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We shall keep a close look on how the recent measures affect the Naira and the economy. The measures we must take, may lead to hardships. The problems Nigerians have faced over the last year have been many and varied. But the real challenge for this government has been reconstructing the spine of the Nigerian state. The last twelve months have been spent collaborating with all arms of government to revive our institutions so that they are more efficient and fit for purpose: That means a bureaucracy better able to develop and deliver policy That means an independent judiciary, above suspicion and able to defend citizen's rights and dispense justice equitably. That means a legislature that actually legislates effectively and Above all that means political parties and politicians committed to serving the nigerian people rather than themselves. These are the pillars of the state on which democracy can take root and thrive. But only if they are strong and incorruptible. Accordingly, we are working very hard to introduce some vital structural reforms in the way we conduct government business and lay a solid foundation on which we can build enduring change. An important first step has been to get our housekeeping right. So we have reduced the extravagant spending of the past. We started boldly with the treasury single account, stopping the leakages in public expenditure. We then identified forty-three thousand ghost workers through the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information system That represents pay packets totalling N4.2 billion stolen every month. In addition, we will save Twenty-Three Billion Naira per annum from official travelling and sitting allowances alone. Furthermore, the efficiency unit will cut costs and eliminate duplications in ministries and departments. Every little saving helps. The reduction in the number of ministries and work on restructuring and rationalization of the MDAs is well underway. When this work is complete we will have a leaner, more efficient public service that is fit for the purpose of changing nigeria for the good and for good. As well as making savings, we have changed the way public money is spent. In all my years as a public servant, I have never come across the practice of padding budgets. I am glad to tell you now we not only have a budget, but more importantly, we have a budget process that is more transparent, more inclusive and more closely tied to our development priorities than in the recent past. 30% of the expenditure in this budget is devoted to capital items. Furthermore, we are projecting non-oil revenues to surpass proceeds from oil. Some critics have described the budget exercise as clumsy. Perhaps. But it was an example of consensus building, which is integral to democratic government. In the end we resolved our differences. We have, therefore, delivered significant milestones on security, corruption and the economy. In respect of the economy, I would like to directly address you on the very painful but inevitable decisions we had to make in the last few weeks specifically on the pump price of fuel and the more flexible exchange rate policy announced by the central bank. It is even more painful for me that a major producer of crude oil with four refineries that once exported refined products is today having to import all of its domestic needs. This is what corruption and mismanagement has done to us and that is why we must fight these ills. As part of the foundation of the new economy we have had to reform how fuel prices had traditionally been fixed. We are also engaged in making recoveries of stolen assets some of which are in different jurisdictions. The processes of recovery can be tedious and time consuming, but today I can confirm that thus far: significant amount of assets have been recovered. A considerable portion of these are at different stages of recovery. Full details of the status and categories of the assets will now be published by the Ministry of Information and updated periodically. When forfeiture formalities are completed these monies will be credited to the treasury and be openly and transparently used in funding developmental projects and the public will be informed. On the Niger Delta, we are committed to implementing the United Nations Environment Programme report and are advancing clean-up operations. I believe the way forward is to take a sustainable approach to address the issues that affect the delta communities. Re-engineering the amnesty programmes is an example of this. The recent spate of attacks by militants disrupting oil and power installations will not distract us from engaging leaders in the region in addressing Niger Delta problems. If the militants and vandals are testing our resolve, they are much mistaken. We shall apprehend the perpetrators and their sponsors and bring them to justice. The policy measures and actions taken so far are not to be seen as some experiment in governance. We are fully aware that those vested interests who have held Nigeria back for so long will not give up without a fight. They will sow divisions, sponsor vile press criticisms at home and abroad, incite the public in an effort to create chaos rather than relinquish the vice-like grip they have held on Nigeria The economic misfortune we are experiencing in the shape of very low oil prices has provided us with an opportunity to restructure our economy and diversify. We are in the process of promoting agriculture, livestocks, exploiting our solid mineral resources and expanding our industrial and manufacturing base. That way, we will import less and make the social investments necessary to allow us to produce a large and skilled workforce. Central Bank of Nigeria will offer more fiscal incentives for business that prove capable of manufacturing products that are internationally competitive. We remain committed to reforming the regulatory framework, for investors by improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria Meanwhile, the first steps along the path of self-sufficiency in rice, wheat and sugar big users of our scarce foreign exchange have been taken. The Labour Intensive Farming Enterprise will boost the economy and ensure inclusive growth in long neglected communities. Special intervention funds through the Bank of Agriculture will provide targeted support. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the increasing role that our women are playing in revitalising the agricultural sector Modern farming is still hard and heavy work and I salute our Nigerian women in sharing this burden. In this respect I am very pleased to announce that the government will shortly be launching the national women's empowerment fund, which I have approved to provide N1.6 billion in micro-finance loans to women across the nation to assist in rehabilitating the economies of rural communities, particularly those impacted by the insurgency and conflict. With respect to solid minerals, the minister has produced a roadmap where we will work closely with the world bank and major international investors to ensure through best practices and due diligence that we choose the right partners. Illegal mining remains a problem and we have set up a special security team to protect our assets. Special measures will be in place to protect miners in their work environment. For too long, ours has been a society that neglects the poor and victimizes the weak. A society that promotes profit and growth over development and freedom A society that fails to recognize that, to quote the distinguished economist Amartya Sen "" poverty is not just lack of money. It is not having the capability to realize one's full potential as a human being."" So, today, I am happy to formally launch, by far the most ambitious social protection programme in our history. A programme that both seeks to start the process of lifting many from poverty, while at the same time creating the opportunity for people to fend for themselves. In this regard, Five Hundred Billion Naira has been appropriated in the 2016 budget for social intervention programmes in five key areas. We are committed to providing job creation opportunities for five hundred thousand teachers and one hundred thousand artisans across the nation. 55 million children are to be provided with nutritious meals through our school feeding programme to improve learning outcomes, as well as enrolment and completion rates. The conditional cash transfer scheme will provide financial support for up to one million vulnerable beneficiaries, and complement the enterprise programme which will target up to one million market women four hundred and sixty thousand artisans and two hundred thousand agricultural workers, nationwide. Finally, through the education grant scheme, we will encourage students studying sciences, technology, engineering and maths, and lay a foundation for human capital development for the next generation I would like to pay a special tribute to our gallant men and women of the armed forces who are in harm's way so that the rest of us can live and go about our business in safety. Their work is almost done. The nation owes them a debt of gratitude. Abroad, we want to assure our neighbours, friends and development partners that Nigeria is firmly committed to democratic principles. We are ready partners in combating terrorism, cyber crimes, control of communicable diseases and protection of the environment. Following on the Paris Agreement, COP 21, we are fully committed to halting and reversing desertification. Elsewhere, we will intensify efforts to tackle erosion, ocean surge, flooding and oil spillage which I referred to earlier by implementing the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report.

We must also appreciate the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund and Educate A Child of Qatar for the excellent work in our health, education and other sectors. Fellow citizens let me end on a happy note. To the delight of all, two of the abducted Chibok girls have regained their freedom During the last one year, not a single day passed without my agonizing about these girls. Our efforts have centred around negotiations to free them safely from their mindless captors. We are still pursuing that course. Their safety is of paramount concern to me and I am sure to most Nigerians. I am very worried about the conditions those still captured might be in. Today I re-affirm our commitment to rescuing our girls. We will never stop until we bring them home safely. As I said before, no girl should be put through the brutality of forced marriage and every Nigerian girl has the right to an education and a life choice. I thank you and appeal to you to continue supporting the government's efforts to fix NigeriaPosted. on May 29, 2016, 9:18 am ., .. \l"
"COP21","Nigeria","COP21_Nigeria136","Electricity - the Price Nigerians Must Pay - Fashola [interview]","April 24, 2016","Vanguard (Lagos)","Babatunde RAJI Fashola, SAN, responds to these Frequently Asked Questions about the Nigerian Power Sector. Fashola, the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, explains that there is a price to pay to have improved electricity supply.What are the components required for generating electricity?Perhaps the place to start is to say that the whole purpose of this discussion is to simplify what appears to have become a very complex issue. And first to say that, Electricity is not different from what you and l learnt in our Physics in schools; Energy resulting in alternating current and all of the technical processes. But to say that if you remember the Principle of the Dynamo and the magnetic fields and all of that, that is really what it is all about.Simply put, the power plants that we have are nothing but very big generators. Power plants are just multiples of the small generators we use at home and just as the generators use fuel, petrol or diesel, the big power plants also use fuel. The fuel sometimes is gas, sometimes it is water where you have hydro-plant, sometimes it is coal. So we just need to understand that we are dealing with big generators, there is no mystery about it.Let me also say that our energy supply is also behind the growth of our population. Today, in March 2016, we have just about 5,000 MW of power on the National Grid for about 180 million people. Now, we have been producing power since 1960 or thereabout, the old Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN), the predecessor of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and the Power Holding of Nigeria (PHCN), was created by a 1950 Ordinance and it started operations in 1951, probably over 60 years and from that time the cumulative power we have generated is 5,000 MW and we got to that a few weeks ago this year. So if you do a breakdown of about 66 years you look at averagely about 75 MW of power per year. And when you look at how our population has exploded between 1950, when it was about 37 million, even then corporate Nigeria as known today had not evolved, the Northern and Southern Protectorate, by 1962, l think we were about 47 million and now we are 180 million.So part of the problem we have to deal with is how to equitably and sufficiently distribute what is not enough; clearly not enough. But again possibly, and I believe, can increase in geometric proportions if we all do the right things. One year ago, the holy grail for Power was 4000MW. That was what they were chasing, but less than a year later, we are at 5,000MW. So, if we now do the right things, we won't have the outages that we have and instead of fixing and trying to stay at 5,000MW, we should be moving on to 6,000, 7,000. And probably be moving in leaps of 2,000MW and I think that is where we should start really, to just understand that background that there is nothing esoteric about it. It is more about how much we want it and how much price it is going to take from us in terms of our behaviour, in terms of our restraints, in terms of our sacrifice that determines how much more of it we can get.What are the features of reforms in the Power Sector?Well, l think before we go into reforms, let us also understand why reforms? Until about 2013, which is over 60 years ago, Government was the provider of electricity. Nobody else but Government except for a few gas-to-power initiatives by our Joint Venture partners like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and some other Independent Power initiatives, in order to convert the gas that they were producing. It was government in generation, in transmission and in distribution. And then the people of Nigeria said that government was not efficient, that government must change the system and that government must hand it over to the Private Sector. That was what the people of Nigeria said and in 2005, our elected representatives came together and passed one law called, the Electricity Sector Reform Act of 2005 and that was the beginning of reform. That reform was concluded in November 2013.That was the privatization that the last administration did and it ended in the sale of 17 companies comprising six generation companies called the GenCos and 11 distribution companies called the DisCos sold to private organizations with government retaining certain levels of equity and ownership. But majority interest has been sold to private owners. The only one government kept was the transmission l"

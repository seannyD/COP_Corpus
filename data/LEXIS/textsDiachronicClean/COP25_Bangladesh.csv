"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh3","Tepid COP25: Failure is not an option at COP26","December 22, 2019 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 22 -- After a disappointing 2019 United Nations , there is a need to restore confidence that the intergovernmental process can deliver on mitigation, adaptation, and finance.The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP25, that recently concluded in Madrid, was expected to put in place the final piece of the rulebook for the historic Paris Agreement, which was designed to address greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance.The meeting also was meant to set the stage for enhanced pledges by countries in 2020 to work toward keeping global temperature increase below 2.0 degrees centigrade, preferably 1.5 degrees.Instead, the world witnessed a prolonging of the negotiation process, and an unwillingness to compromise for the greater good. The current pledges by countries, as inscribed in their climate pledges, also called nationally determined contributions or NDCs, have set us on the path to a temperature increase of 3.2 degrees in this century.The world is already witnessing the impact of 1.1-degree centigrade temperature above pre-industrial levels. The recurring droughts and floods in some regions, as well as increased intensity and frequency of extreme events, foreshadows apocalyptic events that we may witness as a result of climate change. To meet the goal of no more than 1.5-degree centigrade temperature rise, current emissions have to be halved by 2030.The reluctance to commit to higher ambition and action is driven by economic and political considerations, as well as social upheavals. Perhaps the ambiguity in action stems from 1992, when the UN Climate Convention was labelled as a framework, a high-level umbrella document with principles and overarching objectives that signaled political will for action, with room for maneuvering at a later stage to reach a consensus on detailed actions.This gave countries the flexibility to develop national policies and action plans based on common but differentiated responsibilities. This arrangement has enabled learning and evaluations and subsequent ratchetting up of action. But it has also left space for uncertainty as circumstances change in countries amid shifting power and trade dynamics and relationships.At COP25Consequently, proposals relating to transitioning to new carbon markets floundered with one group of countries rightfully insistent on ensuring environmental integrity. Associated with this was the direction of shares of proceeds from the cooperative approaches under the new markets that would ensure automatic funding for the Adaptation Fund.On the other hand, the group of vulnerable countries that have borne the brunt of climate impacts were seeking a mechanism to compensate them for these losses and damages. The issue of compensation has been an impasse for many years now, and the compromise yet to be negotiated.The elephant in the room is the financing of action in developing countries and the target of $100 billion in financial flows from developed to developing countries by 2020 that was agreed at COP15. The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) estimates that climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries for developing countries in 2017 reached a little over $71 billion. But what developing countries want at this stage is an early assurance that, as agreed in Paris, a new financing commitment will be agreed to by 2025. So far, there have been no concrete signals that this will happen.The upcoming presidency of COP26 by the United Kingdom will have to untie the proverbial Gordian Knot of the negotiations. Future commitments to financing, as expected, would hold the key to encouraging deeper and wider action. Facilitating a dialogue within the Group of 77 and People's Republic of China grouping on how to narrow the divergent interests in this bloc is needed. On one side will be the big emitters, and on the other the small island developing states, least developed countries, and other vulnerable countries.The Article 6 conundrum will need to be resolved through a more nuanced and perhaps staged approach. A lot will ride on the United Kingdom's leadership in the coming year to coalesce and converge diverse interests on the intractable issues.The most important objective will be to restore confidence that the intergovernmental process can deliver.

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh7","COP 25: Facing existential crisis of climate change","November 28, 2019 Thursday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 28 -- The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25) is scheduled be held in the Spanish capital Madrid on December 2-13, 2019. The Conference of the Parties (COP) within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFCCC) is a collective response of the international community to climate change. It is an Agreement of 196 countries and the European Union (EU) that establishes the basic obligations to stabilise greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent climate change. COP is the important annual international forum for taking stock of where the world stands as regards climate change and to discuss issues related to global warming caused by human activities.The COP 25 is targeting to resolve some of the remaining issues on the rules that the participating countries (parties) are to follow in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The meeting may announce new initiatives to respond to global warming to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising global atmospheric temperatures. Also, COP 25 is expected to reach a consensus on funding for repairing damage of the climate crisis. The funding issue is especially important for the climate vulnerable, least developed and the small island nations. The landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement (signed in 2015) is scheduled to enter into force in 2020. Therefore, COP 25 becomes the prelude to the major world event and a lot of expectations have been created.In the backdrop of the increasing natural disasters and dwindling bio-diversity, the mainstream political parties in most countries have been compelled to respond on 'unequivocal' public concerns over climate change and human sufferings from global warming. The latest example is the UK election manifesto of the major political parties participating in the election where they have supported a transition to net zero GHG emission within a few decades and are competing with each other on the policies to attain the target. Despite the 'Brexit' debates hanging over the country, UK members of parliament (House of Commons) have unanimously passed (on April 30, 2019) a motion to declare an 'environmental and climate emergency'. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbin, then leader of the opposition in parliament, tabled the motion and the House of Commons passed the bill. Earlier, parliaments of Scotland and Wales declared climate emergencies. Analysts consider that the approved nonbinding climate emergency motion in UK parliament was reached unanimously because thousands of people took to the streets for a sustained period of protests by a number of environmental groups, UK Student Climate Network, Friends of Earth and others including the school strikers led by Greta Thunberg.Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament) adopted a motion on November 13, 2019 declaring climate change and its fallout as 'planetary emergency'. The planetary emergency motion ahead of the upcoming COP 25 calls for the global community to act urgently and decisively in achieving the net zero (carbon) emissions well before 2050.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to attend COP 25 which would be a good forum to present the 'planetary emergency' resolution adopted in Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad and share views with the world community on how best the emergency can be addressed. The COP 25 forum may serve as an opportunity to discuss the issues related to 'planetary emergency' and help formulate plans and get support from the global community on implementing such plans. As Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable hotspots for global climate change, it expects the global community to act urgently, decisively and with considerably higher ambition in achieving net zero emission well before 2050, capping temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius. Despite being least responsible for these problems, Bangladesh and many other countries in the developing world became the worst victims of climate change.The planetary emergency connects with the existential crisis of climate change, devastating impact of disasters and increase in extreme weather events, irreparable loss of biodiversity, looming food insecurity, rising water level, unprecedented pressure on oceans and unsustainable use of resources. The resolution calls for planetary justice and climate equity so that the climate vulnerable countries are assisted with finance and technology to meet their development aspirations in the shortest possible time.Mushfiqur Rahman is a mining engineer and writes on energy and environment issues.

Coast Trust, in association with several other organisations, organised the press meet titled 'COP25 Climate Conference and the Observation of Civil Society'.In the COP21 in Paris in 2015, nearly 200 nations signed the climate deal in which each country provides its own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change.On December 2-13 last year, the longest 25th United Nations , also known as COP25, was held aiming to finalise the ""rulebook"" of the Paris Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020 - by settling on rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation.Due to discontent between the developed economies and the least developed countries, however, the talks were unable to reach agreement in many areas, pushing decisions into COP26 scheduled to be held next year in Glasgow, UK.In this context, speakers at the conference stressed for planning alternative strategies to continue and strengthening ongoing climate action plan for Bangladesh, and placed some recommendations in this regard.Hence, Bangladesh has to choose alternative ways of its own to combat climate change, they added.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

'It (Delta Plan) is a long-term strategy to implement action for sustainable delta development in Bangladesh. It'll also assist us to address the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptive delta management,' he said.Working closely with stakeholders, Bangladesh hopes to harness international best practices and finance to ensure its successful implementation, the minister said, adding that in the year of action, Dhaka will be able to contribute substantially to the global actions to deal with the climate crisis.'We stand ready to contribute to global adaptation actions building on our experiences,' he said.In Bangladesh, resilience building and adaptation are at the heart of development efforts and the government has invested heavily for improved agriculture, coastal zone management, resilient infrastructure and water and land management, he said.Bangladesh has shown how a strong early warning system and a coordinated approach in disaster management can make a big difference and Scaled-up disaster response has included cyclone shelters , building civic awareness, and improving post-disaster recovery, he added.

And to this effect, Bangladesh needs to move on along with its team, the least developed countries, in the global platforms to avail global climate fund,"" he said.On the other hand, Dr Saleelimul Haq observed there were some limitations and mismanagement in the local fund disbursement.He suggested that the government engage all stakeholders, experts and local victims in the process so that such mistakes do not occur again.Echoing Dr Haq, Uthpal Kumar, researcher at Water Systems and Global Change research group of Wageningen University, The Netherlands, emphasised conducting a necessary research to know how Bangladesh became a victim of global climate change effects.And, relevant research can help Bangladesh cope up with climate change and play important role in negotiating in global platforms for funding, he added.Regarding attainment of global funding, the deputy managing director (DMD) of Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF), Md. Mokhlesar Rahman Sarker, told the FE after failing to get substantial amount of fund from the developed countries, the government formed BCCTF to address the climate change issue with its own money in 2013.He said in last nine years the government has allocated Tk 38 billion (Tk 3800 crore) from its own revenue and a total of 650 projects have been taken during the period.

Issues that have not reached any consensus will be transferred to the next climate conference,' he explained.Md Ziaul Haque feels the biggest achievement of this climate conference will be in the context of loss and damage.'We wanted the developed countries to pledge a specific amount of fund for long-term financing.

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh22","COP25 and climate-anxiety: What can be done?","January 29, 2020 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Jan. 29 -- The recently held Madrid Climate Meeting marked 25 years of the Conference of the Parties (COP), a UN Framework Convention for Climate Change signed in 1992 by 165 signatory nations. Despite agreement that the planet Earth is facing a ""climate emergency,"" the COP25, which was billed as the Action COP, delayed any real climate action. Indeed, after the first few COPs that were constructive and hopeful, the fossil fuel producers such as the United States, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brazil and Russia and the carbon-emitting countries captured the COP process. The apparent actions from the processes are more delays.The long-term goal of the Paris Agreement (COP2015) is to keep the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degree celsius above the pre-industrial level and to limit the increase to 1.5 degree celsius. This urgent action to combat climate change is intrinsically linked to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The spirit of the Paris Agreement is now slowly eroding from one COP to another. With no tangible action, the planned extractions of coal, oil and gas are enough to blow past the 1.5 degree celsius target or even 2.0 celsius by 2030.The harsh truth is that the world is getting increasingly warmer, and extreme weather events such as glacier meltdown, forest fires, flood, cyclones etc., are on the rise globally. The climate impacts and anxiety are felt by all, particularly the world's most vulnerable and innocent people being at the receiving end as victims. Island countries like the Maldives, Tuvalu and Kiribati are sinking due to rising sea level. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Kiribati as one of the six Pacific Island countries most threatened by rising sea level, and thus would likely become uninhabitable as early as 2050.Rising sea level, drought and crop failure are expected to force tens of millions of people to migrate within their countries as ""internal climate migrants"" by 2050. A2018 World Bank study found that 143 million people across South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America are at risk of the effects of ""slow-onset"" of climate change. ""Every day, climate change becomes a more urgent economic, social, and existential threat to countries and their people,"" observes World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva in her introduction to the 2018 Study.With the climate crisis worsening and the declaration of climate emergency by the climate scientists, the climate-anxiety - for instance, the fear of sea level rise, the horrific forest fires in Australia, displacement due to disasters, loss of homes and livelihoods, stress, helplessness, a sense of loss of control and the potential for a catastrophic future - has become prevalent beyond the physical world into mental health and well-being, according to a recent report issued by the American Psychological Association (APA). The report urges to address the core causes of and solutions for the changing climate, and building and supporting psychological resilience.In Bangladesh, climate-anxiety is very evident in physical, economic, social and existential terms. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in a recent statement in Parliament, said that some 40 million people from 70 upazilas and 19 districts of the country are at the risk of displacement due to climate change (recent revised estimates, however, put the figure between 15 and 20 million). The PM reiterated her commitments to fighting against climate disasters, giving vivid descriptions of the various impacts such as higher average temperature by one degree celsius in May and 0.5 degree celsius in November, increase in average rainfall and other weather events, outbreak of different insect-borne diseases, and increased salinity of river water up to 100 km from the coastl"

Hence, relocation and protection of displaced persons need due focus in global discourse to ensure their protection. We need to commence discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of people displaced due to climate change,' she said.The Prime Minister made the call while addressing the Action for Survival: Vulnerable Nations COP25She said it is widely accepted that the gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration. Extreme weather events are already displacing many more people than violent conflicts. Slow-onset events like sea-level rise and desertification get even lower global focus. 'We must work towards correcting this imbalance.'Pointing at the leaders of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Sheikh Hasina said, 'We now have a situation where the most vulnerable countries, which deserve the highest level of priority, are failing to access whatever support that is being realized.'She said creation of a new CVF and V20 Trust Fund and possibility of having a new Special Rapporteur on climate change would be a great success.Noting that CVF and V-20 are great examples of South-South and Triangular cooperation, she said, 'We want to further build on the current accomplishments. The time is now to act as we're at the most important crossroad of human history confronting possibly the gravest global challenge of our time.'She said climate change has now become an existential threat for every country, especially for the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh.With more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar causing all sorts of environmental havocs, Bangladesh already has the firsthand experience of the worst kind of environmental calamity, she said.'We must therefore establish a set of criteria to prioritize vulnerable countries based on their risks, impacts and lack of coping capacities. We also want to keep the climate change support and the regular development finance strictly separate,' she added.Hasina said major emitters show extreme reluctance on mitigation, which may wreck the international climate regime and put the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh at the risk of peril. 'Hence, we shouldn't hesitate to demand accountability for inaction.''We're also looking towards the 2020 Climate Adaptation Summit in the Netherlands to strengthen our adaptation efforts. And Bangladesh is ready to take the responsibility of the Presidency of the Forum if the Members kindly agree to honour us with this task,' she said.The Prime Minister said climate change is a stark reality for the world. It has now caused irreversible damages to human life and environment, ecology and natural resources, she said.Since the Earth Summit in 1992, it has not been able to secure much progress in the reduction of greenhouse gases and their emission is still on the rise, she said adding that this trend is now unsustainable for the Earth.'We, the vulnerable countries, suffer the most due to our limited coping capacities and specific geographical features. We're bearing the brunt of the damage though we made negligible or no contribution to the menace. This constitutes a serious injustice and must be acknowledged by the global community,' said the Prime Minister.Unfortunately, she said, the progress under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process is very slow and largely inadequate. There's still hardly any move to support nationally determined adaption initiatives undertaken especially by our vulnerable countries, the PM added.Different funds created for different purposes lack availability of the required capital, she pointed out.'Often direct and easy access to funds and technology along with conditions and criteria seem to favour mostly the countries that already have acquired greater capacities,' Hasina told her audience.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC Patricia Espinosa and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet Jeria, among others, spoke at the event.\l"

BBC reports from Madrid on Sunday: ""The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal. Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year.""At the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid have re-emerged old splits between rich polluters and developing nations over who should slash greenhouse gas emissions by how much, and how to pay the trillions needed to live in a climate-addled world.The specific aim of the Madrid negotiations was to finalise, if possible, the rulebook for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which enjoins nations to limit global temperature rises to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius. However this effort does not appear to have clearly succeeded. This failure in moving forward was denotated through a comment made by Spain's Minister for Energy and Climate change Teresa Ribera: ""There are those that want to move quicker and those that want to hide behind things which aren't working, so as not to advance."" The talks however received a shot in the arm on December 13 after the European Union (EU) pledged to make the bloc carbon-neutral by 2050. Nevertheless, this much-heralded decision was immediately undermined by the refusal of Poland-a major emitter-to sign on.This meeting in Madrid has however signalled the need to find least common denominators that would have to be agreed upon through frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November 2020.The seriousness of the existing situation pertaining to climate change, adaptation and mitigation measures was outl"

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh30","Climate COP 25 Reducing Global Temperatures?","December 12, 2019 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 12 -- Also, there are uncertainties over thresholds for climate change impacts and the pace and form of technological innovation that can take shape in the future. Furthermore, the effects of climate change are not uniform across countries. Different parts of the world are likely to be affected differently: countries closer to North and South poles will experience warmer temperatures and once inhospitable land will experience melting of ice. Small island nations are at risk of extinction due to rising sea levels. Low-lying islands and countries are at a greater risk of flooding both from rising sea levels and increased precipitation. Countries near the equator are likely to experience unbearable heat. Some of the countries are already experiencing more frequent events of severe weather.The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released its annual report on ""emissions gap"" referring to ""commitment gap"" on November 26 this year. The UNEP also warns that the world will fail to get on track towards 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, unless the emissions of global greenhouse gas fall by 7.6 percent in each year between 2020 and 2030. The report shows that despite the pledges by several countries, the amount of greenhouse gases is increasing at an alarming rate, where it urges for deeper and faster cuts of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. It should be noted that the global temperature is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer and has been warned to rise by 3.4 to 3.9 degrees Celsius in this century if current trends persist, and that may result in wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts, including extreme weather, droughts and storms across the globe.By 2050, low-lying areas in some South and Southeast Asian cities not far from the coast are likely to face inundation during high tide as part of the flood zone. Bangladeshi climate experts have denoted that 100km away from the coastal zones, the districts of Pirojpur and Shariatpur might be badly affected as there are no embankments there.These debacles that are staring us in the face have raised several questions as to how the concerned countries are expected to respond to the evolving disastrous situation, and how basic human rights of the affected people need to be safeguarded while tackling and managing this growing emergency. Efforts to promote environmental sustainability can only be effective if they occur in the context of conductive legal frameworks, and by the exercise of certain human rights, such as the rights to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice.Bangladesh's ranking in the index was decided based on these data, the think-tank said. The data showed that the losses were equivalent to 0.41 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. There is no denying that Bangladesh is one of the most affected countries in the world on account of climate change in the past two decades, says the German think-tank report. In 2016, Bangladesh stood 13th among other countries in the world -- counting a total of 222 fatalities for climate change and incurred losses over US$1,100 billion. Honduras bottomed the list of most affected countries of the past 20 years, followed by Haiti, Myanmar, Nicaragua and the Philippines.The Global Climate Risk Index has placed Bangladesh at the seventh position among countries most vulnerable to climate change in its annual report for 2020. According to the German think tank, Bangladesh lost 577 lives during the last 21 years since 1999, suffered economic losses to the tune of US$1.7 billion in purchasing power parity and witnessed 151 extreme weather events during the period from 1999 to 2018.The symptoms of climate change are visible in Bangladesh. Delicate specialties of six seasons are lost and the routine of natural events changed. A typical flower of one season is blooming in another. Cold waves and hot waves have now been regular features. Death toll by lightning strikes is on the increase. The salinity from sea is creeping into the mainland. The country had to bear the harsh blow of cyclone Sidr in 2007, haor flooding in 2017 and frequent inland tornadoes. Thus people bear the brunt of climate change for no fault of theirs.Bangladesh is aware of the danger of climate change. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund has been created to implement climate-related projects with its own funds. As a vulnerable country, Bangladesh has the right to receive funds from the Global Climate Fund of the United Nations for adaptation measures and for the protection of infrastructure. But the availability of such funds is uncertain and irregular.As society's total disposable time - social wealth - expands, so too does the ability of all members of society to increasingly participate in running, planning and solving its problems, including finding solutions to the more intractable environmental or technological problems. Lifelong theoretical and practical education, made possible by this expanding disposable time, Marx states, will ""convert science from an instrument of class rule into a popular force."" Only public ownership, popular democracy and planning, and a new definition of wealth based not on individual personal enrichment and consumption can possibly meet the dispute. It would not be too extreme to declare that humanity in the next 50 years faces a stark choice: capitalism or socialism and human survival.Bangladesh has been well aware of this problem for over a decade and has developed the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) which has been implemented for nearly a decade and is now being revised to take it to 2030. Once the revised version is adopted it should become integrated into the 8th Five Year Plan as soon as possible.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

And leading up to COP26, the UK intends to build a stronger partnership with countries like Bangladesh; a vulnerable country but increasingly resilient to climate impacts. As the leading voice against climate impacts, Bangladesh can play a more significant role in the global climate change discourse through COP 26.The UK is already a key partner to Bangladesh on disaster management and resilience building.Since 2008, UK and Bangladesh jointly helped over 27 million people gain access to early warning systems for floods and cyclones, and provided emergency assistance and recovery support after disasters to more than 900,000 people.Environmental experts, diplomats and government officials at the discussion roundtable discussion called for stronger cooperation between the UK and Bangladesh for a successful climate conference. They also said Bangladesh has already demonstrated its strong willingness need to improve in how it implements the climate action plans.\l"
"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh33","Deep Disappointment","December 31, 2019 Tuesday","Energy & Power","P#9#PT he UN climate talks concluded in disappointment on December 15, with governments showing no signs of addressing the climate crisis. This years annual UN climate conference, COP25 in Madrid, became the longest on record after it concluded on December 15, following more than two weeks of negotiations. It had been scheduled to wrap up on December 13. Nearly 27,000 delegates arrived in the Spanish capital in early December aiming to finalize the rulebook of the Paris Agreement the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020 by settling on rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation under Article 6 of the deal. Countries failed to reach consensus on many of the expected outcomes, including rules to set up a global carbon trading mechanism and a system to channel new finance to countries facing the impacts of climate change. Negotiations put politics and fossil-fuel interests above people and the planet. Many countries, led by the United States, Australia and Brazil, once again exposed their apathy to the suffering of millions and a wilful rejection of the science. Major emitters failed to show clear signals about increasing ambition by 2020 and rich countries reneged on the promise to provide finance for loss and damage.The key polluting countries responsible for 80 percent of the worlds climate wrecking emissions, stood mute, while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year.The big polluting countries like the USA, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia continued down a path of inaction and were undermining international efforts to prevent the increasingly eminent climate breakdown. Countries such as China and India made it clear they will not support strong language on raising ambition without a similar call for rich countries to provide the finance and support promised to developing countries. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed with the results of COP25 and that the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. Guterres emphasized in his opening address to the conference, telling parties to step up next year. He added: The worlds biggest emitters need to do much more. Instead of committing to more ambitious cuts in emissions, countries have been arguing over technicalities. Poorer nations spoke with one voice to demand funds for the loss and damage. Wealthy nations have used every trick to stall progress and avoid paying their fair share.The bushfires in Australia raging for three months six people have died, 720 homes have been destroyed, beautiful national parks and their wildlife burnt. Yet still the Australian government has sought to weaken its climate ambition, and drag the ambition of the whole Paris Agreement down to its level.The US has once again gotten its way through bullying and tricks. Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change Patricia Espinosa in a statement on the outcome of COP25 expressed her frustration that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidel"
"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh34","Danger of denying climate call","December 15, 2019 Sunday","Energy & Power","Madrid is all set to host the COP25 (the 25th session of the conference of parties) as the governments, members of civil society and NGOs, and environment activists have already started gathering. The main negotiation on implementation of Paris Agreement to protect the world from climate change impact starts on December 2 and is scheduled to continue until December 13.The organizer, Chile, regretted holding the global event only one month before amid citizen\' s protest. Then Spain showed interest in hosting it and it was accepted by the board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, people concerned with the issue are optimistic about the availability of fund, required for implementation of the Paris Agreement, would agree upon at the COP25. Rules and procedures, action plan and implementation strategy would also be decided. It is being thought that if these are not agreed upon at the COP25, the commencement of implementation of Paris Agreement from 2020 will be delayed.The conference is being held at a time when different countries of the world are encountering different types of climate disasters. Bangladesh capital Dhaka has become one of the most polluted cities of the world. Air pollution of different cities and towns including the port city has become unbearable. Threats of frequent cyclones and other natural calamities are growing. Countries including America, Brazil and Australia are huffing and puffing in managing bush fire menace. Some European countries are struck by flash flooding. Another important matter worth mentioning here that one of the major polluting countries, United States of America, has walked out of the Paris Agreement.A report of the World Resources Institute evidences that though USA as a state has walked out, yet different states, cities and businesses in USA still remain committed to the Paris Agreement. They represent two-thirds of the US population and business control 70% of the GDP. It will be great news for protecting the mother earth if this continues. Three recent reports published by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have sounded wake up alarm for the world leaders.The entire civilization, our land and our sea are in great danger from the adverse impacts of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions if we fail to act quickly now.The IPCC reports also stated that melting of polar glacier would not stop unless we can limit global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius by 2100.The sea level would continue rising and the danger of natural calamities would become more menacing than the previous decades.The Emission Gap Report by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) stated that even if the NDCs declared by different nations are fully implemented, the global warming would rise 3.2 degree Celsius. That will make mother earth exposed to different disasters.The report also states that for restricting the global warming within 1.5-2.0 degree Celsius, the annual GHG emissions reduction rate between 2020 and 2030 must be 7.6%. An initiative was launched at the climate negotiation in Katowice, Poland in 2018 for framing the Rules Book for implementation of the Paris Agreement. But it could not be finalized. In Madrid COP25, the participating countries must work to finalize the Rules Book. The world leaders expressed optimism that the COP25 would achieve the objectives. Dr Manjurul Hannan Khan, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and a member of Bangladesh delegation to the COP25, said that the crunch time for reaching final agreements in climate conference has arrived. He sounded optimistic that the meeting of minds of all parties would be there in Madrid. Different analyses and observations indicate that the COP25 would create the necessary momentum for commencing implementation of the Paris Agreement from 2020. During the COP21 in Paris in 2015 all the countries have been requested for submitting the updated NDCs. Most of the countries have already submitted the updated NDCs to the UNFCCC. Many countries including Bangladesh have started finalizing Climate Strategy and Action Plan. Bangladesh would complete it within three months. In September 2019 at the Climate Action Summit in New York, many small and medium countries committed to intensify actions for reducing the GHG emissions for achieving greater NDC targets. Some 68 countries have pledged for this. But it needs to observe what major polluting countries are doing.The COP25COP25, some head of the states or governments would attend the COP25. Among them, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would lead the country delegation. Apart from participating in the inaugural program, she will address in a special session on adaptation. In addition to highlighting the Bangladesh experience of adaptation, she will press for global funding on behalf of the climate vulnerable countries for confronting adverse climatic changes.The COP25The UNFCCC would prepare a synthesis on the basis of NDCs of countries. It will act as a policy paper for reducing GHG emissions. Governments, civil society, business and NGOs are expecting that the outstanding elements of the Rules Book would be finalized and agreed through negotiation in Madrid. These are carbon market post-Kyoto Protocol, common timeframe for implementation of NDCs, review of loss and damage and determination of action plan, advance financing and capacity building. A 300-page Rules Book was formulated at the COP24 for implementation of the Paris Agreement. But the issues could not be finalized.The main priority of COP25 is finalization of the rules for carbon market. More or less 51% of the NDCs state about attaching NDCs with the emission control is a major objective. The money received from carbon market will drive the world towards renewable energy and will play a major role in climate resilience financing. Experts observed that all must remain concerned about these during the finalization of the rules and regulations.The correct accounting of GHG emission would not be possible if the scope of carbon credit accounting is there for both buyers and sellers. Prior to 2020, the carbon market would follow Kyoto Protocol. But the modality of the carbon market operation from 2020 needs to be determined following the article 6 meticulously. We must bear in mind that the emission control mechanism is not affected through tangles of accounting. It needs ensuring that the money received from carbon market directs to adaptation fund and climate vulnerable countries gets higher benefits. Climate activists and civil society have advised remaining vigilant so that the rules are not finalized carelessly. These must be done in environment-friendly manner. Otherwise the carbon market rules would rather have negative impacts than positive one.The second priority is agreeing on a common timeframe for implementation of the NDCs of the countries. The COP24 reached initial agreements but could be ultimately finalized.The NDCs submitted in 2015 had set implementation timeframe by 2020 and 2025. But the implementation time of NDCs submitted last year set the starting time of implementation as 2031. Analysts suggested that in Madrid negotiation agreement should be reached for implementing the NDCs within the 2031-2035 timeframe. The third priority is assessment of loss and damage. It is a very sensitive matter.The Madrid negotiation must review and finalize the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage 2015 (WIM). WIM was created for ensuring financial assistance of the developing and climate vulnerable through accurately accounting their damage and losses. WIM reviewed and assessed the damage and losses over the past 6 years. It is expected that the Madrid negotiation would ensure the rules and modalities are finalized for financing for the affected countries through final review of the assessment done. The fourth and final priority is advance financing and capacity development. It is clear that advance financing is a must to enable the climate vulnerable countries achieving double reduction of GHG emission. This financing has to come from Green Climate Fund (GCF). But till now, contribution to the GCF is not encouraging at all. Till now, 28 countries together have pledged for US$ 28 billion to the GCF. But the actual receipt is only $ 5.6 billion. In subsequent 2020, $ 100 billion would be required and every year more $100 billion. Analysts believe that Madrid conference must ensure the above contribution by rich major polluting countries if Paris Agreement implementation is to start from 2020. Otherwise countries relying on contribution from GCF for achieving NDCs cannot achieve the targets.The main focus of Madrid conference must be confirming the contribution to the GCF. Inger Andersen of UNEP has told media that the climate investment cost in 2050 would grow US$ 7.9 trillion. The world\' s major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the United Nations and research groups said.The 10 nations in focus, including China and the United States, plan to produce fuels by 2030 at levels between 50-120% over Paris Agreement targets, the study showed. Under that 2015 global pact, nations committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature increase to within 1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. But by 2030, the 10 countries\' planned production would lead to 39 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide emissions, 53% higher than what is needed to reduce temperature rises to 2C and 21 Gt, or 120%, more than is needed for 1.5C, the report said. Other countries analysed included Russia, India, Australia, Indonesia, Canada, Germany, Norway and Britain.  The world\' s energy supply remains dominated by coal, oil and gas, driving emission levels that are inconsistent with climate goals,  said United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen. According to an AFP report, large investment funds are not directed towards achieving climate change mitigation targets. British Organization Influence Map analysing 50, 000 investment accounts of 150 financial giants has mentioned that the investment in Oil and Gas Exploration, Coal Mining and Automobile Industry is US$ 8.2 trillion. They are interested for investment in brown technology although the Paris Agreement stressed upon giving priority to green projects by private sector investors. For this, the Paris Agreement perceived target of limiting the fossil fuel use especially of coal by 2030 would not be achieved.The use of coal would still remain above 30%. On the other hand, World Energy Outlook 2019 published recently by the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that stable policy is absent for restricting increased global carbon emission. It stated that people of many countries of the world are still deprived of quality energy supply. Around 850 million population of the world do not have access to electricity.The rate of growth of energy sector would be 1.4% till 2040. Emissions growth would also match this rate. New policy scenario of expanding use of renewable energy and achieving energy efficiency can limit this growth to 1%. It is being told that Oil use would remain stable till 2030 and gas would remain third in preference. Use of coal would be reduced but can not be eliminated all together. During this period, renewable energy contributing about 50% would take the lead and solar would be the leader. IEA observed that emission would be reduced but mentionable success may not be visible by 2040.The growth of energy efficiency now is 1.4%. For achieving the target set in Paris Agreement, it has to reach 3% by 2040. Energy efficiency has huge potential to help reduce carbon emissions, the IEA said. But governments need to take stronger policy action to reverse the worrying slowdown in global energy efficiency improvements, according to a public survey conducted by the International Energy Agency.The survey was carried out to inform the first meeting of the Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency.A catastrophic scenario has appeared about global warming and NDCs in a UNEP Emission Gap Report. On the eve of a year in which nations are due to strengthen their Paris climate pledges, a new UNEP report warns that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\'b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. It says that even if all current unconditional commitments under the Paris Agreement are implemented, temperatures are expected to rise by 3.2\'b0C, bringing even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts. Collective ambition must increase more than fivefold over current levels to deliver the cuts needed over the next decade for the 1.5\'b0C goal. 2020 is a critical year for climate action, with the UN climate change conference in Glasgow aiming to determine the future course of efforts to avert crisis, and countries expected to significantly step up their climate commitments.  Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7 per cent each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,  said Inger Andersen, UNEP\' s Executive Director. This shows that countries simply cannot wait until the end of 2020, when new climate commitments are due, to step up action. They - and every city, region, business and individual - need to act now.  We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger Nationally Determined Contributions to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies. We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated,  she added. If we don\' t do this, the 1.5\'b0C goal will be out of reach before 2030. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that going beyond 1.5\'b0C will increase the frequency and intensity of climate impacts, such as the heatwaves and storms witnessed across the globe in the last few years. G20 nations collectively account for 78 per cent of all emissions, but only five G20 members have committed to a long-term zero emissions target. In the short-term, developed countries will have to reduce their emissions quicker than developing countries, for reasons of fairness and equity. However, all countries will need to contribute more to collective effects. Developing countries can learn from successful efforts in developed countries; they can even leapfrog them and adopt cleaner technologies at a faster rate. Crucially, the report says all nations must substantially increase ambition in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as the Paris commitments are known, in 2020 and follow up with policies and strategies to implement them. Solutions are available to make meeting the Paris goals possible, but they are not being deployed fast enough or at a sufficiently large scale. Each year, the Emissions Gap Report assesses the gap between anticipated emissions in 2030 and levels consistent with the 1.5\'b0C and 2\'b0C targets of the Paris Agreement.The report finds that GHG emissions have risen 1.5 per cent per year over the last decade. Emissions in 2018, including from land-use changes such as deforestation, hit a new high of 55.3 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. To limit temperatures, annual emissions in 2030 need to be 15 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for the 2\'b0C goal; they need to be 32 gigatonnes lower for the 1.5\'b0C goal. On an annual basis, this means cuts in emissions of 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to meet the 1.5\'b0C goal and 2.7 per cent per year for the 2\'b0C goal. To deliver on these cuts, the levels of ambition in the NDCs must increase at least fivefold for the 1.5\'b0C goal and threefold for the 2\'b0C. Climate change can still be limited to 1.5\'b0C, the report says. There is increased understanding of the additional benefits of climate action - such as clean air and a boost to the Sustainable Development Goals. There are many ambitious efforts from governments, cities, businesses and investors. Solutions, and the pressure and will to implement them, are abundant. As it does each year, the report focuses on the potential of selected sectors to deliver emissions cuts. This year it looks at the energy transition and the potential of efficiency in the use of materials, which can go a long way to closing the emissions gap. There has not been even marginal achievement in challenges for limiting the global warming to 1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial revolution as perceived in Paris Agreement.The developed world is not even prepared for providing the required fund for advancing towards the target. Major polluter USA has already moved out of the Paris Agreement. According to the Emissions Gap Report, the global warming can be limited to 3.2 degree Celsius even if all countries achieve the present targets of NDCs. For achieving global warming limitation target of 1.5-2 degrees Celsius, the GHG emissions must be reduced to an annual rate of 7.6% between 2020 and 2030. Climate activists and civil society all over the world in united voice are urging repeatedly that major polluting countries must contribute massively for saving the climate vulnerable countries and saving the mother earth.The climate vulnerable countries using their own resources are endeavoring for reducing GHG emissions for achieving NDC set targets although they have no obligations for this. They desperately need additional fund for reducing more GHG emission. This financing must come as grant and not as loan or insurance.The developed world is not agreeing to this argument. Required investment is the demand of time and nature. If we fail to respond positively to the call of the nature, world civilization, our earth and our light would move towards destruction. Natural calamities have become a frequent phenomenon worldwide. This frequency would assume catastrophic level if we continue to fail in our obligations. Nature would take revenge and its intensity would take the world civilization and mother earth to the brink of destruction. Hence, good senses must dawn on all now for taking consensus decisions. The COP25 is expected to walk along this way.\l"

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh37","UN Climate Conference and amp; The Planetary Emergency","December 15, 2019 Sunday","Energy & Power","The 25th UN Climate Change Conference () is taking place in the Spanish capital of Madrid on 2-13 December 2019.The annual climate conference has become a major event to discuss strategies and action plans to prevent and adopt with climate change and all the consequences that have been threatening the planet earth.The conference is attracting attention of the global community for a number of reasons: In the year 2020, the landmark Paris Agreement, signed by 196 countries of the World, will come into force.The global warming and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise in the atmosphere, accelerating climate change.The UN assessment shows that the poor countries are hit hardest due to climate change. Rising sea levels, intense storms, unpredictable weather and rainfall, flood, larger and longer heatwaves have already affecting tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and in the countries of East and West Africa. Industrially developed countries are not away from the effects of climate change.The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is created in the Paris Climate Conference in 2015 to assist these climate change victim countries in adopting practices to cope with the consequences of climate change. The governments of industrially developed economies formally agreed to the Paris Agreement to mobilize US$100 billion per year by 2020 through public and also from bilateral, multilateral and private funds. The second largest GHS emitter and the largest economy of the world, the USA has formally notified the United Nations on 4 November 2019 that it was withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.The US administration understands that the country will be the only UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member state and the largest economy of the world, which has signed the Paris Agreement and will withdraw from the global initiative. As a result, the US will stop contributing to the GCF and will end reduction of carbon to atmosphere, roll back of fuel efficiency rules set by former US President Barak Obama. The climate conference within the framework of the UNFCCC is the international response to climate change.The Paris Agreement have been signed by 196 countries, including the European Union that establishes the basic obligations to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent climate change.COP25 is expected to gather 25, 000 people including the heads of governments and states, politicians, academia, researchers, bureaucrats, activists, observers etc. Last year in Katowice of Poland, more than 20, 000 people attended the COP24.The 25th COP is targeting to resolve some of the remaining unresolved issues on the rules that the participating countries (parties) to follow in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Also the meeting may announce new initiatives to respond to global warming to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising global atmospheric temperatures. Also, the COP25 is expected to reach a consensus on funding for repairing damage of the climate crisis. The funding issue is especially important for the climate vulnerable, least developed and the small island nations.The GCF support is very important to enable the paradigm shift from  Carbonism (is a belief that fossil fuel is better than other energy sources and denies the scientific evidences that carbon pollution into atmosphere accelerates climate change and acidification of oceans and water bodies) to low emission and climate resilient development by innovation and investments in mitigation and adaptation projects in the developing world for transformational impacts of climate action. But the paths to secure implementation of the Paris Agreement are not simple mainly as the rich nations in the agreement generally are reluctant to fulfill their pledges to finance the GCF; not all of the major polluting nations want any legally binding date to reduce GHG emissions at the cost of their own usual lifestyles and economic philosophy. Despite the fact that the Trump administration in the US remains firm on withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, it has to wait until 04 November 2020 (4 years from the date USA entered in the Paris Accord) to realize it\' s intention into effect in accordance with the Article 28 of the Paris Agreement.The Article 28 stipulates that the a party (member country of the Paris Agreement 2015) cannot withdraw from the Paris Agreement 2015 before four years have been passed from the date the agreement came into effect. President Trump considers that the Paris Agreement is \' unfair, horrible, costly, one sided\' . However, optimists consider the Paris Agreement will exist because the rest of the world but USA support it. Instead of fighting climate change as a source of pain, the Paris Agreement 2015 \' recognizes that the victors in a post-carbon world those who move first\' . As reported by the German DW, among the above, the US being the biggest economy pledged to contribute US$ 3.0 billion, followed by Japan ($1.5 billion), the UK ($1.1 billion), France and Germany ($1.0 billion) each. Since then, many of these countries have increased their commitments and more countries have joined the fund. China pledged to contribute to the GCF US$ 3.1 billion over a non-specific timeframe.A total of US$ 10.3 billion was promised as well as signed to be paid by 43 countries in 2018, but US$ 6.5 billion has been paid. Japan is the largest contributor so far followed by the USA, UK, Germany, France and Sweden. USA government has paid US$ 1.0 billion as first installment and US$ 500 million as second installment for the GCF under Obama administration. Soon after President Trump took charge of the US government, he criticized Barak Obama\' s decision and since then USA did not pay its installments USA pledged. As per the agreement, USA owes US$ 2.0 billion or 20% of the total sum that was supposed to be funded by all nations in the first round of funding. Australia also decl"

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh40","Red Alert","November 4, 2019 Monday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- Barely a week passes without alarming news of the most recent scientific research into the global climate crisis compounding a growing sense of urgency, particularly the impact on small island states from rising sea levels and extreme weather.Latest findings suggest that several hundred million more people than previously thought are at risk of coastal flooding due to climate change. Climate Central, a non-profit research and news organisation, found data used in past calculations overstated the elevation of many low-lying coastal communities.And for the people of the Bahamas who had just endured Hurricane Dorian, the most intense tropical cyclone on record to hit their islands, it came as little surprise when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) soon after released its landmark special report on the planet's oceans and frozen regions, warning of ""multiple climate-related hazards"" for coastal regions.""The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive,"" the IPCC report stated.The ""Blue Pacific"" concept sees the island states establishing themselves as ""large ocean states"" and guardians of the region rather than ""small island states""Oceans are absorbing heat twice as fast as just two decades ago, with hundreds of billions of tonnes of melting ice raising sea levels at an average rate of 3.6 millimetres a year, more than twice as fast as during the last century.If greenhouse gas emissions ""continue to increase strongly"", the IPCC report said, then levels could rise more than a metre by 2100.Some island states in the Pacific face becoming uninhabitable. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted while visiting Tuvalu, the sea level rise in some Pacific countries is four times greater than the world average, posing ""an existential threat"" to several island states.Against this background the UN COP25 climate change summit scheduled to be held in Santiago in December had been dubbed the Blue COP, with expectations of a focus on the oceans and commitments of aid to poorer nations most at risk. So it comes as a serious blow that President Sebastian Pinera has just announced that Chile is calling off its hosting of COP25 because of mass anti-government protests rocking the country.While the UN anxiously looks for an alternative venue (and Santiago had been the second choice after Brazil's newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro, pulled out of hosting it), the small island states of the Pacific will be making their voices heard as they seek to confirm themselves in the role of custodians of the world's largest region.It is an existential struggle but it is not a blame game however.As Micronesia's President David Panuelo declared last week in The Diplomat: ""Rather than point fingers, we must all point the way toward solutions.""""No single country created this problem, and certainly a small country like ours is bearing far greater responsibility for the solution than we ever contributed to the crisis in the first place. But we sit shoulder to shoulder in a coalition which has set a goal of growing economies while achieving 30 percent marine protection globally,"" he wrote in a plea for action to save the oceans.""Everyone must do more when garbage patches larger than entire countries float in the Pacific, and rising carbon dioxide levels increase ocean acidity and devastate coral reefs and marine life."" The Pacific Community, the principal scientific and technical organisation in the region and founded as the SPC in 1947, counts 22 Pacific island countries and territories among its members who see themselves as the ""tip of the spear"" in terms of the impacts of climate change and their efforts to adapt.SPC has recently established the Pacific Community Centre for Ocean Science (PCCOS) to provide the framework to ""focus its scientific and technical assistance on providing solutions that will build, sustain, and drive blue economies in Pacific Island countries and territories"" and support SDG 14 of conserving and sustainably using oceans and marine resources.The SPC's new and growing Pacific Data Hub is a public resource of data and publications on the Pacific across key sectors, from education and human rights to oceans and geoscience.Such initiatives reflect how Pacific Island states have grown more assertive in their diplomacy, becoming more active in global multilateral forums and using their voices and votes for increased leverage rather than the old reliance on support from Australia and New Zealand.The ""Blue Pacific"" concept sees the island states establishing themselves as ""large ocean states"" and guardians of the region rather than ""small island states"". As stewards of the Pacific with their cultural identity shaped by the ocean, the Blue Pacific framework seeks to establish leadership on issues, with smart policies backed by scientific expertise and data.As Micronesia's president has reminded us, the climate crisis is neither abstract nor ""tomorrow's faraway challenge"". It is happening now and as the IPCC's special report on the oceans and cryosphere warned in September the crisis is gathering speed, as seen in the recent acceleration of sea level rise.In Antarctica the rate of ice loss tripled in the decade 2007-2016. May and August in 2019 were the warmest on record for the Arctic while this year saw the summer minimum extent of sea ice reaching a joint-second lowest in 40 years of satellite records.As summarised by Carbon Brief, the IPCC warns that this accelerating ice loss, and the more rapid sea level rises it causes, will continue to gather pace over this century regardless of whether greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. The ""likely"" maximum rise of 1.1 metres by 2100 is some 10cm above the top-end estimate from its previous estimate, while a rise of 2 metres cannot be ruled out.Such warnings were intended to provide input at COP25 for world leaders who face mounting calls to adopt more ambitious goals for carbon emission cuts. Those negotiations will not be happening in December in Santiago after all. An alternative must be found urgently. HYPERLINK contentservices@htlive.com\l"
"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh41","US-Bangladeshi Teen Fighting for Climate","December 31, 2019 Tuesday","Energy & Power","P#42#PWorld leaders have come together in Madrid, Spain, for the UN Climate Change Conference, COP25, where they will deliberate on the environmental crisis facing humanity. The issue of climate change, a key global conversation, has been brought to the fore by youth activists, mainly students such as Greta Thunberg, whose call for urgent climate action culminated in thousands gathering in New York City for a climate strike during the UN General Assembly in September. At the gathering, in which more than 200,000 people marched across Manhattan, one teenager highlighted stories of a community that remains some of the most vulnerable to climate change and yet remains under-reported: The women, children, and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Sixteen-year-old Rebeca Sabnam stood in front of a crowd of thousands, recalling the times her uncle had to carry her to school on his back during floods in her hometown Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. 'I am from Bangladesh, a country that exemplifies how interconnected the climate emergency is to racial justice and poverty,' she said, referencing the discourse on how people of colour are often disproportionately affected by climate change. Sabnam later told Al Jazeera she thought that when she mentioned Bangladesh, she would hear nothing but silence. Instead, she was overwhelmed by the crowd's roaring response.'The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue, it's an urgent human rights issue,' said Sabnam to the cheers of the crowd in New York.\l"
"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh42","Climate crisis hits a somnambulistic world","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 10 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's presence at the COP25 in Madrid last week finally proved to be quite vital and timely. This year she, like in the previous years, has laid renewed emphasis on the impact of climate change --- by focusing on the issue of climate migrants. She has made quite a bleak observation while speaking at a roundtable meeting of the conference. Upon drawing a post-climate change picture of the country, the premier homed in on a normally less discussed issue: people displaced by sea-level rise, also called climate migrants. She termed the brewing climate change disaster an existential threat to Bangladesh and a great number of vulnerable countries. And quite rightfully she wanted to know about the fate of these displaced people. Her worries stemmed from the fact that Bangladesh alone cannot cope with the massive crisis. That she would place an appeal to the industrialised nations to stand by the country in accommodating the climate refugees was quite expected. The issue of permanent shelters for the migrants is directly linked to livelihoods and the other prerequisites for survival. The Prime Minister has called for sincere cooperation of the global community in this regard.Meanwhile, climate change watchers have warned that even a small rise in the sea level will leave devastating impacts on the country's coastal region. As they predict, as a consequence of the sea-level rise Bangladesh may lose 17.5 per cent of its land mass by 2050. It will lead to displacement of around 20-30 million people.Bangladesh has been considered for decades one of the lands most vulnerable to climate change-induced sea-level rise. Of late, the German Watch Global Climate Index Report has put Bangladesh among the 10 most vulnerable nations feared to be affected by climate change. It's a dreadful picture. Given the dour message lurking in the report, days may not be far when Bangladesh would be bracketed with the vulnerable countries in Africa, Latin America and small island territories.Meanwhile, four groups comprising the highly vulnerable countries numbering 100 out of 195 and belonging to a special segment have taken a collective stand to fight climate change impacts. The segment is called Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) under UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).Perhaps it was the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who could unsparingly delve into the approaching climate apocalypse at the plenary of the COP25 (the 25th annual Conference of the Parties). The UN climate change conference is being held from 2-13 December, 2019. Without mincing words, the UN chief told the opening plenary that the mankind was confronted with a climate crisis threatening civilisation itself. Elaborating, Guterres said, ""(At present) One is the path of surrender, where we have sleepwalked past the point of no return, jeopardising the health and safety of everyone on this planet."" The UN chief was quite blunt and incisive in his observations. He posed a most critical question to the nations, ""Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?""The writing on the wall is far from being reassuring. The maximum global temperature has unanimously been set at 1.5 degrees Celsius, lowering from 2 degrees Celsius threshold, above the pre-Industrial average between 1850 and1900. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) says the global temperatures so far this year were 1.1 degrees Celsius. It has put 2019 on course to be in the top three warmest years ever recorded, and possibly the hottest non-El Nino year yet. The WMO's portrayal of the global warming scenario for the outgoing year is quite appalling. As it has noted, man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels, building infrastructures, (methods of) growing crops and transporting goods mean 2019 is set to break the record for atmospheric carbon concentrations, locking in further warming. The WMO disclosed this in its report released at COP25.The global warming-vulnerable countries nowadays use the phrase 'polluters pay' targeting the large industrialised countries, especially the US and some other greenhouse gas-emitting nations. There are strong reasons for it. Most of the least developed countries (LDCs) with weak economies contribute little to the fast-rising global warming. Ironically, it is them who will, finally, have to bear the brunt of the global climate change catastrophe in the making. Many countries have already been made to begin feeling the heat. Bangladesh can boast of its multi-pronged initiatives taken to preempt the onslaught of the climate change. Apart from the all-out attempts to avail its share of the climate impact funds, the country has put in place strategies like making a national adaptation plan.Besides, it has adopted impact mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emission drastically. The greatest challenge, however, remains in the form of rehabilitating the internally displaced people. The task calls for massive infrastructure building and fund mobilisation. Bangladesh cannot be expected to achieve full success in coping with the climate impact challenge with its limited resources. For this, it has to rely on cooperation of international organisations like the UN, and large donor countries.

Underdeveloped countries will have to collectively raise the demand for the smoother supply of necessary funds from the GCF and other international funds Bangladesh will have to play a significant role [in this regard],' said Dr Iftekhar.TIB denounced the proposed bond and insurance-based funding scheme terming it 'inconsistent' with the fundamentals of grant-based adaptation funding for the affected countries.They warned that such plans will only help boost the profits of corporate houses.'Collecting insurance premiums from the affected people and families will put greater strain on them and increase the financial burden on those at risk,' said M Zakir Hossain Khan, Senior Programme Manager, Climate Finance and Governance, TIB.However, the TIB Executive Director called for approaching the proposed climate insurance scheme with caution. 'The government must accept the scheme only after assessing and determining the positive factors.'He further mentioned that the government must step up efforts to reduce the number of coal-based energy plants. 'But, Bangladesh plans to increase coal-based power plants to 30 that will emit about 11.5 croremetric tons of extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

When nations struck the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit temperature rises under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), they agreed on five-year periods in which climate action could be implemented, assessed and boosted. 2020 is the year the landmark deal goes into effect, yet almost three decades of diplomatic wrangling has fallen far short of what science says is needed to avert disastrous climate change.A crucial UN summit at which leaders will finalize their action plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is set to open in Glasgow on November 9 -- just six days after a US general election that could see President Donald Trump win a second term. Trump shocked the world in 2017 when he said the United States -- history\' s largest emitter -- was withdrawing from the Paris agreement. It is due to leave the deal on November 4.

Every moment, the cost of our inaction is devastating every living person on earth. The time to act is now,"" she said.Climate change is a stark reality for the world which has now caused irreversible damage to the human life and environment, ecology and natural resources, said Hasina.""Since the Earth Summit in 1992, we have not been able to secure much progress in the reduction of greenhouse gases, their emission is still on the rise. This trend is now unsustainable for the Earth,"" the prime minister said.The vulnerable countries suffer the most due to their limited capacities to cope with climate threats and specific geographical features, she said.""We are bearing the brunt of the damage though we made negligible or no contribution to the menace. This constitutes a serious injustice and must be acknowledged by the global community,"" said Hasina.The global climate landscape has changed considerably since the Forum first met in November 2009 in Male. Unfortunately, the progress under the UNFCCC process is ""very slow and largely inadequate"", said Hasina.Now there is a situation where the most vulnerable countries, which deserve the highest level of priority, are failing to access whatever support that is being realised, the prime minister said. ""The creation of a new CVF and V20 Trust Fund and possibility of having a new special rapporteur on climate change would be a great success.""More than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar have taken refuge in Bangladesh wreaking a havoc on the environment, said Hasina.

""This may wreck the international climate regime and put our countries at the risk of peril. Hence, we should not hesitate to demand accountability for inaction,"" she said.It is widely accepted that the gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration, according to Hasina.""Extreme weather events are already displacing many more people than violent conflicts. Slow-onset events like sea-level rise and desertification get even lower global focus. We must work towards correcting this imbalance,"" she said.""We must appreciate that migration could be an effective adaptation strategy, as we focus on enhancing adaptation capacities of affected communities.

They said money should come from wealthy nations - historically most responsible for planet-warming carbon emissions - in the form of tax on financial transactions, international air travel and fossil fuels.The Madrid conference is set to be dominated by discussions on so-called ""loss and damage"" funding, with a sharp divide between developing nations and richer polluters over how finance should be structured. Green groups this week said the increased pace and intensity of climate disasters, such as the twin cyclones that devastated parts of Mozambique this year, means that funding needs boosting to keep track. They said the amount needed for loss and damage would top $300 billion annually by 2030.'Without finance to help countries cope with climate-induced loss and damage, the most vulnerable parts of the world will sink deeper into debt and poverty every time they are hit by climate disasters they did not cause,"" the letter said.

The Conference of Parties (COP) is the supreme decision-making body of the Convention.Ruling Awami League lawmaker Saber Hossain Chowdhury piloted the motion in the House.The MPs across the benches passed the motion unanimously by voice vote when Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, who was in the chair, placed it for voting following the discussion.Taking the resolution, the House declared a planetary emergency on account of existential crisis of climate changes, devastating impact of disasters and increase in extreme weather events, irreparable loss of bio-diversity, looming food insecurity, rising water stress, unprecedented pressure on oceans and unsustainable use of resources.'The global community must act urgently, decisively and with considerably higher ambition in achieving net zero emissions well before 2050, capping temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius and transitioning swiftly to low carbon economies as overarching priorities,' said the Bangladesh Parliament.'Despite being least responsible to these problems, Bangladesh and many other countries in developing world, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are the most impacted and vulnerable,' said the Parliament adding that actions at global levels have not matched commitments and rhetoric.It said planetary justice and climate equity demands that these vulnerable countries are assisted with finance and technology to meet their development aspirations in the quickest and the shortest time.The House, therefore called on parliaments, governments, the United Nations and all stakeholders to work on a war footing, as custodians and as one team, to protect and fortify our planet- the only Home we have.Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid, Awami League MPs Tofail Ahmed, Begum Matia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Rafiqul Islam (Bir Uttam), Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Nazrul Islam Babu and Waseqa Ayesha Khan, BNP MPs Harunur Rashid and Rumeen Farhana, Jatiya Party MPs Mujibul Haque (Chunnu) and Rustum Ali Faraji, and Jasod MP Shirin Akhter supported the motion joining the discussion.\l"
"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh58","ADB remains the partner of choice for climate action","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 11 -- As they extend their power grids, build more roads and bigger cities, and cultivate forestland, developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are increasingly contributing to the global climate change problem. Two of the top three emitters of greenhouse gases are developing countries in Asia - the People's Republic of China and India.At the same time, five Asian developing countries are among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. Across the region, livelihoods and economic growth are increasingly exposed to climate change impacts and disaster risk. Clearly, Asia and the Pacific must play a strong role in efforts to address climate change.As the region's development bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to remaining the partner of choice for climate action by our developing member countries. In 2015, as world leaders gathered in New York to launch the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs), ADB made a bold announcement - a pledge to double our climate investment to $6.0 billion annually by the end of 2020.Coinciding with the call for action at COP25, the United Nations' Conference on Climate Change, ADB has proudly reached this achievement one year ahead of time. ADB's climate-related financing for 2019 comprises $1.4 billion for financing adaptation and $4.8 billion for mitigating climate change.The feat is the result of a singular focus to integrate climate actions into our entire operations. ADB has introduced climate risk screening of our project portfolio, undertaken diagnostics on the critical infrastructure at risk in the region, and introduced new financing instruments such as contingent disaster risk financing for financial resilience. ADB is strengthening its investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, sustainable transport and urban development, and climate smart agriculture.This has been accompanied by actions to enhance transparency of our climate operations by publicly disclosing project-level information of our climate portfolio and enhancing capacity and technical assistance for delivery. The spirit of One ADB has underpinned this achievement, with the collaboration of our sovereign and non-sovereign operations and knowledge departments steering us toward this target. One example of the many that illustrates this is the Pacific Renewable Energy Programme, which is providing an innovative blend of loans, guarantees, and letters of credit to encourage private sector investments in renewable energy. ADB's treasury department also contributed to the endeavour by issuing green bonds amounting to $5.0 billion as an added financing mechanism.In addition to scaling up its own climate financing, ADB has been working on new and innovative co-financing opportunities with public and private partners. For example, ADB has mobilised concessional financing from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for nine projects worth a total of $473 million in grants and concessional financing.Building on the momentum of our climate finance milestone, ADB is pursuing new and ambitious targets on climate change for the coming decade in our Strategy 2030 - cumulative climate financing of $80 billion from 2019-2030 and a commitment to make 75 per cent of our projects climate-relevant by 2030. Furthermore, by steadily increasing shadow carbon price, which factors climate costs into our project economic analysis, ADB is reflecting the urgency of shifting to low carbon alternatives.However, given the narrowing window for avoiding catastrophic climate change, mobilising finance at the necessary speed and scale remains a huge challenge.

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh59","Take responsibility for climate migrants: PM to global community","December 2, 2019 Monday","United News of Bangladesh","Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday asked the global community to take the responsibility for climate migrants as they are getting displaced for no fault of their own.'As our people will be displaced for no fault of ours we expect the international community to shoulder the responsibility of accommodating them and providing them with livelihood,' she said. The Prime Minister was addressing a general roundtable discussion at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP25).Sheikh Hasina said, 'All 'Funds' to fight climate change must be replenished as per our agreement, including the $100 billion annual contribution.'She said the Convention and the Paris Agreement recognise the special circumstances and needs of LDCs and 'Particularly Vulnerable Countries' based on the principle of the 'common but differentiated responsibility', and this recognition must be adhered to in every delivery mechanism of the climate finance.Hasina warned that there is a limit to resilience and adaptation. 'We simply have to stop the increase of global temperature at 1.5 degree centigrade more than the pre-industrial level.'Despite lack of interest among many to adopt adequate measures, he said, Bangladesh is a firm believer of collective efforts and understanding to fight climate change and UN is the most appropriate platform.'We think to stop further degradation of environment, we have some useful international mechanisms like Paris Agreement and other relevant global instruments and mechanisms, and we must strictly implement our agreed provisions,' Hasina said.From now on, she said, the principle of 'Loss and Damage' must feature prominently in all negotiations and the 'Warsaw International Mechanism' must be given a much stronger mandate to explore financing losses and damages through its review.'The global landscape of climate finance is highly fragmented -- complex and grossly inadequate,' the PM said.She said the concept of equity or fairness is a fundamental issue that underlies the framing and operationalisation of the Paris Agreement under the Convention through which greater levels of international cooperation under the Convention and its Paris Agreement may be achieved.'We hope that finalisation of robust rules under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement must continue environmental integrity, avoid double counting and other accounting loopholes, deliver a share of proceeds from the market mechanism for the Adaptation Fund to assist overall mitigation in global emission,' she said.'Any consequence of failure to deliver a climate action plan must fall equally on every country, especially the countries which are more responsible for contributing to climate change, and the cost of our inaction is devastating for every living person,' she added.The Prime Minister said it is the responsibility of the leaders and politicians to make the public aware of the critical situation and the actions required to stop it from developing. 'We cannot decide to be undecided.'The Prime Minister said climate change now has become an existential threat for climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. 'We're fighting the battle on two fronts. First, mitigation measures to reduce and eventually reach to zero emission in future. Second, adaptation measures in areas where irreparable damage has been done.'She said lives and livelihoods of millions of people would continue to be at risk unless all concerned deliver on both these two fronts.Hasina said the time is ticking fast to the point of no return. 'It urgently needs to limit temperature increase to 1.5oC and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, by cutting 45 percent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.'She said Bangladesh, the largest delta in the world, is the worst-affected country by adverse impacts of climate change. 'Up to 2050 from now, our annual GDP loss will be 2 percent and at this rate by 2100, the loss will be a staggering 9 percent.'According to the World Bank, more than three-quarters or 134 million of around 165 million population of Bangladesh are at the risk of declining living standard as a result of rising temperature and erratic rainfall due to climate change, the Prime Minister said.By 2080, some 40 million people will be homeless due to sea-level rise, she said adding that Unicef, in April last, published that in spite of excellent progress on resilience and adaptation, Bangladesh has 6 million climate migrants already and the number could be more than double by 2050 and 19 million children in Bangladesh are already under threat.'We'll never achieve the SDGs and eradicate poverty if the adverse impacts of climate change are not stopped.'Hasina said when people are vulnerable and left with no choice to survive, they will resort to any action endangering state, regional and global security. 'Their weakness and vulnerability make them easy prey for threats like radicalization and we are already experiencing its devastating effects all over the world.'In spite of being a non-emitter and being severely constrained in terms of resources and choices, Bangladesh is doing its best to enhance our resilience, she said.Noting that Bangladesh is the first LDC to establish a Climate Change Trust Fund, she said Bangladesh has so far spent more than $415 million from own resources for mitigation and adaptation purposes. 'We're set to spend as much as $10 billion to make the country less vulnerable to natural disasters.'The PM said the Bangladesh Parliament has recently adopted a motion declaring the current state of climate vulnerability as a planetary emergency calling all other Parliaments to act to adopt necessary measures to reduce global warming.She said the presence of 1.1 million Rohingyas, who fled persecution in Myanmar, has caused an environmental and social havoc in an environmentally critical area, Cox's Bazar, with the loss of forest, hills, biodiversity and local livelihood. 'So, we already have the dreadful experience of how the situation after a climatic calamity may turn out.'\l"

Hence, relocation and protection of displaced persons need due focus in global discourse to ensure their protection. We need to commence discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of people displaced due to climate change,"" she said.The Prime Minister made the call while addressing the Action for Survival: Vulnerable Nations COP25She said it is widely accepted that the gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration. Extreme weather events are already displacing many more people than violent conflicts. Slow-onset events like sea-level rise and desertification get even lower global focus. ""We must work towards correcting this imbalance.""Pointing at the leaders of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Sheikh Hasina said, ""We now have a situation where the most vulnerable countries, which deserve the highest level of priority, are failing to access whatever support that is being realized.""She said creation of a new CVF and V20 Trust Fund and possibility of having a new Special Rapporteur on climate change would be a great success.Noting that CVF and V-20 are great examples of South-South and Triangular cooperation, she said, ""We want to further build on the current accomplishments. The time is now to act as we're at the most important crossroad of human history confronting possibly the gravest global challenge of our time.""She said climate change has now become an existential threat for every country, especially for the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh.With more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar causing all sorts of environmental havoc, Bangladesh already has the firsthand experience of the worst kind of environmental calamity, she said.""We must therefore establish a set of criteria to prioritize vulnerable countries based on their risks, impacts and lack of coping capacities. We also want to keep the climate change support and the regular development finance strictly separate,"" she added.Hasina said major emitters show extreme reluctance on mitigation, which may wreck the international climate regime and put the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh at the risk of peril. ""Hence, we shouldn't hesitate to demand accountability for inaction.""""We're also looking towards the 2020 Climate Adaptation Summit in the Netherlands to strengthen our adaptation efforts. And Bangladesh is ready to take the responsibility of the Presidency of the Forum if the Members kindly agree to honour us with this task,"" she said.The Prime Minister said climate change is a stark reality for the world. It has now caused irreversible damage to human life and environment, ecology and natural resources, she said.Since the Earth Summit in 1992, it has not been able to secure much progress in the reduction of greenhouse gases and their emissions are still on the rise, she said. This trend is now unsustainable for the Earth.""We, the vulnerable countries, suffer the most due to our limited coping capacities and specific geographical features. We're bearing the brunt of the damage though we made negligible or no contribution to the menace. This constitutes a serious injustice and must be acknowledged by the global community,"" said the Prime Minister.Unfortunately, she said, the progress under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process is very slow and largely inadequate. There's still hardly any move to support nationally determined adaptation initiatives undertaken especially by our vulnerable countries, the PM added.Different funds created for different purposes lack availability of the required capital, she pointed out.""Often direct and easy access to funds and technology along with conditions and criteria seem to favour mostly the countries that already have acquired greater capacities,"" Hasina told her audience.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC Patricia Espinosa and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet Jeria, among others, spoke at the event.Keep the pressure on Myanmar: PMPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday renewed her call to the world community, including the European countries, for keeping up pressure on Myanmar so that they take their more than one million forcibly-displaced Rohingya people back.Sheikh Hasina made the appeal during her separate meetings with Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte and President of the European Council Charles Michel at Feria de Madrid on the sidel"

"COP25","Bangladesh","COP25_Bangladesh73","Who's afraid of Greta Thunberg?","January 24, 2020 Friday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Jan. 24 -- Some are fascinated with her: they see her as a hero, as a Joan of Arc of modern times or as a Mafalda, with a political agenda to preserve planet Earth and as such, represents the younger generations as more intelligent than that of their parents. Others are angry: they see her as a naive puppet of opaque adult interests and they make fun of her.Young ecologist, Greta Thunberg became a new global figure and depending on the political point of view of observers, she is either defended or hated. On September 20, 2019 the #FridaysforFuture movement, inspired and encouraged by the Swedish teenager, celebrated its largest mass mobilisation. In almost every country in the world, young people and adults took to the streets. It is estimated that about 4 million people mobilised around the world.Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old student, has been known in Europe for around a year, but in the United States she has risen to fame over the past month. Many Americans first saw her when she appeared on the Trevor Noah Daily Show. There, she explained with her well know seriousness that the world has very little time left, precisely eight and a half years, because as of January 1, 2018, only 420 gigatons of carbon dioxide remained. Now there are only 360 gigatons left, and in eight and a half years this will run out if the current levels of emissions are maintained.Despite her youth, Great Thunberg has become popular because of her knowledge of climate and environmental problems, for the firmness of her convictions and for the actions that she carries out. Commentators are sure that that is why she has become an icon.The climate activist does not relate well to the irony of American television programs. When asked for her impression of New York when she arrived on the Malizia yacht, she replied that it smelled bad. Her lack of understanding of irony and her seriousness are probably related to her Asperger's syndrome (a condition she speaks openly about) and dose of Nordic frankness. All of these qualities have influenced the new environmental movement. It is a group that speaks very seriously and uses scientific research to support their arguments. It is, in fact, the antithesis of the ironic language used by generation X or millennials.Greta Thunberg is the global face of this movement and her presence is extremely influential. In August 2019, when embarking on a trip from Europe to New York on a ship that doesn't produce carbon dioxide, she caused rage in the media and in the political world. Furthermore, her interventions at the World Climate Conference in Katowice (Poland) in December 2018 and at the World Economic Forum in Davos put the world's powerful in a very awkward position. This young girl, with her hair in braids threw slogans at them (""act"" or ""panic"") and was able to attract the world's attention. Especially the European media. But her presence at the New York and Washington demonstrations, the meeting with Barack Obama, the appearance on the Daily Show and the speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 23rd also made her a popular figure in the US.The mass movement led by Great Thunberg dates back to the ""school strike"" that began on 20th August 2018. That day, instead of attending school, she sat in front of the Swedish Parliament in an attempt to draw attention to the dangers climate change represents for future generations. Her intervention produced an avalanche effect. In a few months a mass movement known as #FridaysforFuture emerged, reaching its first peak in March 2019 when 1.5 million teenagers and youngsters took to the streets to protest and demand a change in attitude to climate change. The movement is global, but its centre is in the Global North. And although in many countries the movement is led by teenage women, in no other country in the world is the symbiosis between the movement and a person is as clear as in the case of Greta Thunberg.The activist triggered not only a political movement, but also fury from powerful media outlets. The media and commentators have become obsessed with her. According to some observers, the adoration towards Greta Thunberg is similar to a religious awakening. But this is not her problem. It is, on the contrary, a problem of the people and the media that react to her actions and her words. Within the political spectrum, environmentalism is found mostly on the left and in the academic world. The right and many liberals deny Greta Thunberg and her colleagues the right to formulate their own political ideas and goals, instead treating them as immature and spoilt. The Argentine journalist Sandra Russo calls this the first case of ""global bullying"", an idea which she discussed long before September 23rd when Donald Trump, the president of the United States, sent out a tweet which made fun of the 16 year old.The criticism that Greta Thunberg's ideas about the climate would be potentially ""undemocratic"" since they do not allow for political compromise are based on the idea that politics works ""only step by step, always through compromise"". However, this can be seen as a form of soft paternalism. Greta Thunberg's sharp accusations do not take place in a vacuum, they are stark, political interventions aimed at polarizing public opinion. Her statement that ""the poverty of the many pays for the luxury of the few"", is according to some commentators on the extreme right, is ""the product of socialisation in the Swedish education system"" and is a stupid left wing criticism of capitalism.Other critics argue that fanatical ecologists (or green capitalists) are hiding behind the young Swedish girl. More specifically, We Don't Have Time AB, a Swedish company that works on environmental projects founded in 2017, by public relations specialist Ingmar Rentzhog, who gave wide coverage to the school strikes led by Great Thunberg in 2018. On November 27 of that year, We Don't Have Time AB announced they were issuing securities on the stock exchange and mentioned her name 11 times in their advertising brochure. Earlier this year, she alongside her family said that they are no longer are in contact with the firm. Others point to the ever-present George Soros, the ghost of the global alternative right.Everything seems to suggest that the more popular and disruptive the climate movement become, the more virulent the rejection from those who consider climate change as a conspiracy and the protection of the climate as pure nonsense becomes. The severity of reactions to a 16 year old teenager should make us reflect. Some psychologists try to explain it by saying the 'old' white men won't change their attitudes towards the environment, so instead attack Greta for her illness, for her age or because of the apparent manipulation of her activism. But behind these criticisms there is much more than the intransigence of a whole male generation. The attacks may be a sign that she, alongside the youth involved in the movement, have managed to hit a sensitive nerve. Is Greta Thunberg questioning the system?At the climate conference held in Katowice in December 2018, the young Swedish woman stressed that political elites had not yet understood the severity of the climate crisis. Since the political class acts irresponsibly, it is up to the younger generations to take charge of their future and do what adult politics should have done a long time ago. Young people must understand what previous generations have done with climate change and respond to the chaos that have inherited. They need to ensure that their voices are heard.In all of her speeches, Greta Thunberg makes it clear that if real and concrete measures are not taken to face the current situation, politicians will be acting irresponsibly. She maintains that rich nations have a greater obligation to reduce emissions quicker and that countries like Sweden should reduce their fossil fuel emissions by 15% annually and reduce their emissions to zero within six to twelve years. This would allow emerging economies such as India and Nigeria sufficient time to adapt their infrastructure.The main concern of the #FridaysforFuture movement is, therefore, that climate protection measures be adapted in the widest, fastest and most efficient way possible. In order to achieve the objective of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a limit established at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change that was held in Paris in 2015 (COP 21) and adopted by the UN. These positions do not seem to question the system itself; they are simply a call to reason and for fulfilment of objectives that have already been established.The power of persuasion of the movement doesn't come from theoretical positions (as in 1968), but from simply saying ""what is happening"". It comes from insisting on the fact that, as the reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say, the climate crisis has worsened in last 20 years and, despite this, politics is doing very little to change its course. German climate movement activist Luisa Neubauer comments that ""the battlefield is between those who benefit most from the status quo and those who are set to lose the most."" And she adds: ""We young people ask ourselves why things are the way they are when they could so simply be different? And we have to fight this as strongly as we can because we have absolutely nothing to lose, except our future"".In the movement, which is symbolized by Greta, there is potential for generational conflict: voters of the future are mobilizing against the interests of those of the present. But they are not alone and many adults are willing to change their behaviour and seek a change in policy, demonstrated by the large participation of adults in the demonstrations of September 20th.Greta has managed to create mass mobilisation through her statements, actions in the public eye and intervention in the media. Its objective is not and cannot be to solve the climate crisis, but it has won a more immediate resounding political success: a generalised and global awareness of the urgency of climate change. What she says and what she does already influences political debates in different countries and first steps, although still tentative are being taken in the right direction. Without mobilisation, this would not be happening.The European Green Party is one of the main beneficiaries of advertising the strikes and protests of the climate movement. In Germany, the Greens obtained 20.5% of the votes in the 2019 European elections with 33% of the votes of those under 30. The electoral behaviour of young people is not just an expression of their sympathy for the environmental cause; it is also a reflection of the deep crisis that German social democracy is going through. Many people see the same worries in both the #FridaysforFuture movement and the Greens, highlighting how far the party is from the radicalism expressed by its founders.The fact that in the party congress of the Greens, their politicians applaud the critical position of the younger generation (which strongly rejects the decisions of the adult generation) could be seen as flattery and hopefully, will not subvert representative democracy.Greta Thunberg and the new climate movement has created a new political actor. They will need a lot of patience to continue the campaign. The fascination with the novelty and personal magnetism will diminish and interest will weaken, as will the wave of sympathy. Traditional media and social media do not stick to the same story for long. Greta Thunberg will return to school. Her generation has a lifetime ahead, though this movement should become an example of democratic commitment. Hopefully most young people will say no to fatalism and resignation. There will come a point when we become aware that environmental issues cannot be resolved if we separate them from economic and social issues. They are inextricably linked and part of the same problem.Greta has also begun to be recognised in Latin America. The urgency of social and economic crises in many countries in the region forces the environmental issues to take a back seat. The Swedish teenager announced in December 2019 she will travel from the United States to Chile for COP 25. We still don't know how she will make the trip without producing polluting emissions. The trip is further than her trip from Europe to New York and there are no train l"

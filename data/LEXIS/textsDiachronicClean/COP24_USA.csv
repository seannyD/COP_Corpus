"COP24","USA","COP24_USA1","PRESIDING BISHOP'S DELEGATION TO ATTEND 24TH UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","November 28, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Episcopal Church: Episcopal Church Office of Public Affairs An eight-member delegation representing the Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop Michael Curry will attend the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, December 2-14. This is the fourth Episcopal delegation to attend this climate change meeting. Known as COP24 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference is an annual intergovernmental meeting to focus on global dialogue and action around the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This conference produced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, which serves as the current basis for global standards on climate action and lowering carbon emissions. Called by Presiding Bishop Curry and led by Bishop Marc Andrus of the Diocese of California, the COP24 What I have found in participating in the United Nations climate summits from Paris onwards is that the thousands of national representatives from virtually every country on Earth are also local climate activists. These remarkable COP representatives are updating the adage from the 1970s, think globally and act locally' to be 'think and act globally and locally',"" said Andrus. ""Thinking and acting, globally and locally is what we in The Episcopal Church are about. At General Convention 79 in Austin we passed 19 pieces of environmentally-related resolutions, and we also heard compelling stories of local action. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams once said, It takes a global body to confront global problems.' The Episcopal Church is a global body doing climate and environmental work at the world and the local levels."" The delegation will bring the voice and perspective from Episcopalians around the globe to the diplomatic community gathering in Katowice. It will also coordinate with Anglican Communion, interfaith and civil society partners in their presence at the conference. ""Resolutions coming out of the 79th General Convention have given the Episcopal Church's Office of Government Relations additional tools to advocate for care of creation from allowing us to be engaged around advocacy for our earth's oceans to recognizing the need to address carbon emissions,"" said Rebecca Linder Blachly, Director, Office of Government Relations. ""We look forward to partnering with organizations and governments around the world to work for an earth that will sustain us for generations to come."" ""Following the Presiding Bishop's call for life-giving, liberating, and loving care of creation, our witness at COP24 informs our ministry and helps us safeguard the integrity of creation and sustain and renew the life of the earth,"" added Melanie Mullen, the Episcopal Church's director of reconciliation, justice, and creation care.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA2","The Arbor Day Foundation Attends the United Nations Climate Change Conference","January 29, 2019 Tuesday 2:07 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Jan 29, 2019( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP24 , in Katowice, Poland to advocate for investments in natural climate solutions[2], specifically forests and trees. The two main goals of COP24 were to finalize the 'Paris Rulebook' for implementing the Paris Agreement[3] from COP21 in 2015 and to 'raise ambition' for reaching a global response to the threat of climate change.Leading up to COP24 , there were two major reports from the leading climate scientists the IPCC Special Report 15[4] and the 4th US National Climate Assessment[5]. These reports highlight how climate change is already negatively affecting human and natural systems, what could happen if we do not change our current behavior and economic systems, and what communities, companies, and governments can do to get back on track for a more prosperous future.Here are some of the biggest changes we need to make to mitigate climate change: Avoid additional carbon emissions by transitioning to renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro, and advance renewable energy storage. Stop deforestation. Cut global carbon emissions to net-zero by mid-century. Remove all the carbon emissions humans have released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution  more than 1.5 trillion tons. When you think of the best way to fight climate change[6], forests and trees are the cheapest, most powerful, and accessible solution to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Trees also enhance community resilience and help companies meet sustainability goals. Trees provide the necessities of life. They clean our air and water, improve biodiversity, soil, human health, food production, and the economy.Read The Carbon Footprint of Coffee[7] Takeaways from COP24A 'Rulebook' was agreed upon at COP24 . Here are some of the positive highlights.Rulebook Sending Demand Signals to CompaniesMore ambitious national climate action plans are coming, likely by 2020 when the Paris Agreement officially goes into effect. Therefore, businesses must be ready for tougher climate goals and a growth of new sustainable development policies in the coming years. One thing is clear, companies that are proactive in using climate action to their competitive advantage will adapt well to the new clean and ecologically sustainable economy. One third of all human-caused carbon emissions came from land-use change and deforestation. Taking steps to measure and manage emissions from land-use will be important for many companies and the communities where they operate. Land-use change emissions are usually the most difficult set of emissions to address and the most overlooked by investors, companies, and countries.Read Planting Purpose with the Arbor Day Foundation[8] One Set of Rules for all CountriesDeveloped and developing countries will all have the same rules. In the past, global climate agreements had separate rules for rich and poor countries. This has been a major issue for political leaders in the U.S., European Union, and China. Standardized monitoring and reporting will make it easier to recognize the countries that are the leaders and identify countries that need help. Climate Finance In addition to climate financing from the public sector and multilateral development banks (MDB)  like the World Bank private climate finance continues to grow through initiatives like the U.S. Alliance for Sustainable Finance[9] and Climate Action 100+[10].These initiatives caused some complications for COP negotiators in how to count private sector climate finance funding in addition to other public monies from developed countries to assist developing countries in climate action investments. With the current rulebook, countries can report the complete loan value (public and private funds); not just the granted public and MDB money. Going forward, this will likely result in unlocking additional private sector capital for sustainable development projects. There is More Work that Needs to be Done in These Areas Welcoming the IPCC SR15 Report Since the release in October 2018, the latest IPCC Special Report has been an urgent call to climate action and a guide to use sustainable development as a tool to eliminate poverty and other systemic economic inequalities. Over 190 counties agreed to fully support this report as the primary guide to climate negotiations and actions.The science is clear, the impact of GHG emissions can be felt now and smart business leaders understand that ambitious action is critical and urgent. For example, oil and gas giant Shell is taking important steps to transition its business models to align with the scientific community[11]. Just TransitionThe clean economy and sustainable development goals should not be a model to reinforce existing economic inequalities (income inequality, lack of high-quality education, inadequate and costly healthcare) and only improve the environment. This economic transition needs to improve people's lives and be a better way of doing business. Recognizing that there needs to be fair labor transitions and major investments in worker's skill development is critically important. The transition of the workforce and creating high-quality jobs embedded with purpose is essential to a fair transition. Read Duke Energy Florida Helps Customers go Green[12] More business and political leaders need to keep the Just Transition Declaration[13] in the forefront of their economic transition plans. The ongoing 'yellow vest' protests in Paris, stemming from a carbon tax on gasoline, shows that policies with the best environmental intentions can backfire if the near-term pain, real or perceived, is too volatile for ordinary people.Natural Climate Solutions are Gaining Momentum According to Nature4Climate and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, natural climate solutions[14] - forests, agriculture, and wetlands - can account for one-third of the climate solution by 2030 and have greater opportunities to scale throughout the 21st century, but they are only getting two to three percent of climate action investments and one percent of media coverage.In advance of COP24 , I was happy to see leaders adopt The Ministerial Katowice Declaration on Forests for the Climate[15]. The Declaration elevates the critical role forestry plays in achieving the Paris Agreement's goals to slow down and reverse climate change. Article 6 is Still Unresolved The one major part of the rulebook that was not resolved was Article 6: voluntary cooperation - market and non-market-based approaches. However, this impasse should not have a harmful impact on the global carbon markets. The most contentious piece of Article 6 is solidifying universal accounting and reporting to prevent 'double counting' of verified emission reductions (or carbon credits) from the buyers and sellers of carbon credits and the related changes necessary to national emissions inventories.The Declaration on Sound Carbon Accounting[16] proves that the solutions are fairly simple and transparency in this area will be critical to build and maintain public trust in the carbon markets.Many companies and countries are committed to ambitious goals. Resolving Article 6 will be a key matter over the course of 2019 leading up to the U.N. Climate Summit in September and COP25 in November. Hope for a Healthy FutureEven when the solutions are clear and accessible, multi-lateral negotiations are complicated. Mitigating climate change will be a global effort and we must take time to connect with each other and see that we are all interconnected on this unique planet and not separate from nature. Don't leave the negotiating table.

Published 8 December 2018 From: Foreign and Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Mark Field MP Foreign Office Minister with responsibility for Climate Change Mark Field attended the UN's major climate change conference COP24 in Poland on 6-8 December. COP24 brought together representatives from governments across the world along with experts from science, business and finance to advance work on tackling climate change. During his visit, the Minister met with senior Ministers and officials from a range of partner countries, including China, Germany, Indonesia, and Poland. He also hosted a series of events at the UK Pavilion, showcasing British expertise and green innovation, including an event to celebrate the UK-Poland Partnership on electro mobility and zero emission vehicles. The Minister highlighted the need for all countries to demonstrate higher ambition in their international commitments, and pushed for a robust set of rules to underpin the Paris Agreement. The UK is committed to sharing its expertise and help developing countries in the global challenge of tackling climate change. The government has committed at least 5.8 billion of funding between 2016 and 2020 to help developing countries reduce emissions, and mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The UK will use our role leading on Climate Resilience at the 2019 UN Climate Summit to advance this work. FCO Minister Mark Field said: This year marks 10 years since Britain enacted the world's first comprehensive climate change law. It has been instrumental in our progress on climate change. Since then, we have decarbonised our economy faster than any other country in the G20, and we are leading the way in the shift from coal to renewable energy. But the reality is that we all need to do more. COP24 has brought us together across government, civil society and business boundaries, to build on the Paris Agreement 2015. It is vital parties make good on their commitment to finalise a set of rules that apply to all and will ensure continuous improvement in the fight against climate change. The conference will continue for another week, with Ministers from BEIS and DEFRA in attendance, as well as the Foreign Secretary's Special Representative on Climate Change. \"

The COP24 , also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference , Katowice, Poland, 2018, is the fourteenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. The conference is scheduled last two weeks, ending on December 14, 2018. The COP24 is the highly anticipated follow up to the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November of 2016, is an agreement between the parties to the UNFCCC to combat climate change. Specifically, the Paris Agreement includes a commitment to keep the global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius this century. The Paris Agreement also requires parties to the agreement to establish Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and to report regularly on their emissions and implementation efforts. Canada ratified the Agreement in October of 2016 and its NDC submission to the UNFCCC includes a commitment to achieve economy-wide GHG emission reductions of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030[1]. The COP24 is expected to include negotiations regarding detailed guidelines for how the Paris Agreement is to be implemented. So far, the conference has included high level talks and workshops on topics ranging from mitigation technology to human rights and inequities. The outcomes of any negotiations on a Paris Agreement 'rulebook' remain to be seen.

HYPERLINK https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/12/COP24-6.jpgEach https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/12/ HYPERLINK COP24 -6.jpgEach year at this time, the eyes of the world's energy and environmental industries turn to the latest location of the United Nations Climate Change Conference .Conference of the Parties (COP) is the supreme body of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)and meets each year to make decisions ensuring the effective implementation of policies agreed upon by involved parties. This year's COP24 is being held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 14.Rocky StartStraight out of the gate, however, theopening plenary was delayed on Sunday in part because of a request from Turkey to downgrade its status to that of 'developing country'  a move intended to soften Turkey's responsibilities. Developed countries  those listed in the Convention as Annex I countries  are expected to contribute more to climate financing and emission reductions than developing nations.The COP presidency agreed to schedule consultations on Turkey's proposal. Similarly distracting from the core purposes of the Conference is the position of host country Poland regarding its reliance upon coal for its electricity generation. Protestors picketed the site of a former coal mine in Poland over the weekend in an effort to shine a light on the country's coal industry. According to the World Energy Council[3],Poland consumes 77 million tonnes of coal per year, making it the tenth-largest coal consumer in the world and the second-largest in the EU, after Germany, securing 92% of its electricity and 89% of its heat from coal. Unfortunately, it would appear Poland has arrived at the Conference fully intent on ensuring everyone knows it is not ashamed of its coal use, considering that its own pavilion design ethos is prioritizing coal:So Polish exhibition stand is literally made of coal. Points for authenticity. # COP24 [4] pic.twitter.com/9FoLZzlMD2[5]  Pascoe Sabido (@pascoesabido) December 2, 2018[6] This comes after the United States continued to impose its gravity on the Conference, promising to put on a literal coal sideshow[7] on the sidelines of the event only days after it was revealed that the US had been responsible for a dramatic watering-down of the joint communique (PDF[8]) published at the end of last week's13thmeeting of Group of Twenty (G20) held inBuenos Aires, Argentina  though it turned out to be only marginally better than previous draft versions[9].'Unequivocal Message' \~ HYPERLINK https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/12/COP24-1.jpgHowever https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/12/ HYPERLINK COP24 -1.jpgHowever , there is still hope that this Conference will be able to solidify the guidelines necessary to fully implement the Paris Agreement of 2015 through the Paris Rulebook. It's also important to remember that COP24 is taking place only two months after the release of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC)Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C which warned that 'Limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.';; In line with the importance of this event, thepresidents of COP20, COP21, COP22, and COP23 issued a joint statement (PDF[10]) over the weekend calling on all 'Parties and non-Party stakeholders to send an unequivocal message from Katowice for enhanced ambition by 2020 that puts the world on a trajectory compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.' The joint statement was signed by Laurent Fabius, President of COP21, Frank Bainimarama, President of COP23, Salaheddine Mezouar, President of COP22, and Manuel Pulgar Vidal, President of COP20. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also published a statement Sunday[11] outlining the priorities for this year's COP24 which includesthe Talanoa Dialogue, climate action before 2020, and the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. 'This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record,' saidPatricia Espinosa, the UN's Climate Chief. 'Greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more - COP24 needs to make that happen.' \~ HYPERLINK https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/12/COP24-3.jpgSimilarly https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/12/ HYPERLINK COP24 -3.jpgSimilarly commenting on the necessary outcomes from COP24 , 350.org Executive Director May Boeve explained that 'We expect to see a way forward to upgrading action on climate prior to 2020, as our representatives promised in Paris. But the choice of fossil fuel companies to sponsor the conference casts a long-shadow over such hopes.'; 'We also expect a strong and comprehensive Paris Agreement rulebook agreed in Katowice. A rulebook that ensures that governments stop all new fossil fuel projects, turn off the funding tap to dirty energy, and actually prepare, plan and invest in a just transition to 100% renewable energy.' 'But no matter what happens in the negotiating corridors in Katowice the change is already happening the world. Cities in Ukraine and Georgia have committed to go 100% renewable; community activists in Poland are shaping a new consensus on what the economy and development should look like; and financial markets are increasingly black-listing fossil fuel industries like coal.' 'We're on a fast road to suffering unless we act now. People are already dying from the impacts of climate change,' addedGreenpeace's head of delegation at COP24 Jens Mattias Clausen[12]. 'This is the harsh reality that leaders must confront at COP24 . They are the last generation of leaders who still have the time to act. They must put the Paris Agreement to work and ramp up action now. Only through fast, bold change can we alter the course of history. 'The window of opportunity is open - but only just. Climate science still provides hope, but the time for political talk has long gone. People are clamouring for action. Children are walking out of schools, the vulnerable are calling for justice or launching lawsuits and communities are standing up to defend their forests.

Brown Jr. tonight implored the world's leaders to ""wake up"" and ""take action now"" in a video message released ahead of the conclusion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland ( COP24 ). To the leaders gathered in Poland for the Conference of the Parties, this is a message from California: Wake up! The planet is burning up. Carbon emissions are growing this year has been one of the highest growth rates in recent decades. This is not a matter to be taken anything but very, very seriously. The United States, I am sorry to say, does not represent the people of the United States. California, Washington, New York, Vermont and many, many other states, representing tens of millions of people, believe in the science of climate change believe, and demand that we reduce our carbon emissions. In California, we have set a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2045. We have taken other measures: We are introducing electric vehicles, building restrictions, cap-and-trade, renewable energy requirements upon our electric utilities there is so much we can do. I'm not saying we've gotten there our emissions per capita are entirely too high, but we are committed to do more. We recognize the science undergirding the knowledge we have today on climate change. If we're going to stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade from the industrial period, we have to take action now. The actions and the behavior of the leaders of the United States and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Russia and other countries are not acceptable. This is a suicide mission upon which you have embarked. Pull back, the people of the world are asking you men, women and children. From California, I can tell you, people are dying because of climate change in fires, in mudslides, in floods and other parts of the country, in New York and North Carolina and Louisiana and Texas. This is serious stuff. You represent humanity over 7 billion people are counting on you. Don't resort to what will be condemned in future years as nothing less than a criminal enterprise. Wake up, do the right thing. Leaders in Poland, this is your chance, this is your time. The people of California, the people of the United States and the people of the world expect no less. Take action, take action now. \"

I would like to express my joy and gratitude for your pr4esence in this Hall, thank you for gathering here on the one hand, at the opening of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP24 , but also - and I would like to stress this very strongly - in connection with the centenary of the regaining of independence by my country, the Republic of Poland. See also: President: Poland, as UN member, proud contributor to global security This is no coincidence whatsoever that it is precisely in this year, in 2018, that this great world event, the COP24 conference, takes place in Poland. At COP22 in Marrakech, back in 2016 we, as Poland, sought to be the host of COP24 this year, also in connection with the centenary of Poland's regaining independence. At the occasion afforded by this grand meeting we wanted to share with you our joy of the century of regaining independence. Today's concert - also in its contents - is a reference to the two aforementioned grand periods in the history of my country. We will hear music by Paderewski, but also by Wojciech Kilar. We will hear the music of an exquisite Polish pianist and composer, as well as an outstanding diplomat, to whom, among others, we are indebted for the restoration of independence in 1918, recognising his talent, his struggle for a free Poland; we consider him to be one of the six fathers of our independence. But we will also hear pieces by the contemporary composer: Wojciech Kilar, who died only five years ago. There will be historical music, but there will also be contemporary music. This is precisely the way we would look at those one hundred years of our history, at that Poland, which was reborn in 1918, and at today's Poland, which has been reborn, has gained full sovereignty and independence in the wake of developments of 1989. That Poland was arising from the ruins of World War I, the one today is still struggling to make up for the delays which communism inflicted on it. That Poland could only develop for 21 years, until 1939, i.e. until the beginning of World War II, the present-day Poland is almost 30 years old. See also: Statement by the President at the official opening of the Climate Summit and the COP24 Leaders' Summit Statement by the President of the Republic of Poland at the session devoted to the ""Just Transition"" declaration I would like to strongly emphasize that we, the Poles, welcoming you and rejoicing in your presence, are also very proud to be able to host the COP Conference on Climate Change in Poland for the third time, but also that this is happening at a time when we are a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. We are very proud that as a member of the world's largest organisation, the United Nations, we can take care of the world security in many aspects: the security of everyday life, and therefore also in the military aspect, but also in terms of secure future and security of future generations to come, which is the essence of works of COP conference. See also: President and UN Secretary General open COP24 climate summit in Katowice I firmly believe that this conference, which takes place in Katowice, a venue of symbolic nature for us, Poles, in terms of climate protection, in the city which develops at such a good pace, will produce excellent results expected by all of us. Above all, that it will contribute to global climate protection. And this is something I wish to all of you, this is something I wish for myself, for my compatriots and my Home Country, also in the context of the centenary of its regaining independence. I wish you a beautiful concert, great experiences and, above all, a successful COP24 summit in Katowice. Thank you. \"

This year the EBRD will engage with representatives of the public and private sectors to present its unique business model for addressing the global challenge of climate change. Bank representatives will take part in several events focused on climate finance, climate mitigation and adaptation investments and policy dialogue to help countries move towards low-carbon resilient pathways. The EBRD will also hold sessions about tracking and reporting climate finance, about its work on disclosing physical climate risks and opportunities, its technology transfer programme and on EBRD Green Cities, a programme that helps cities identify, prioritise and connect their environmental challenges with sustainable infrastructure investments and policy dialogue. Since 2006, the EBRD has invested over 28 billion in more than 1,500 projects that are helping to reduce CO2 emissions, by 93 million tonnes per year. And under its Green Economy Transition approach, the EBRD aims to double the pace of its climate financing by 2020. Register 11 December: Financing an inclusive Green Economy Transition Date: 11 December Time: 11:00- 12:30 Organiser: EBRD, Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics (LSE) The objective of the session is to discuss the extent of the challenge and possible routes to overcome it, focusing on the role that financial institutions can play. It will combine corporate and political views, and comment on the degree of awareness/action plans of institutional and multilateral investors. Some pilot initiatives will be shown.Many Governments and companies are contributing to the Paris Agreement by advancing their green economy transition agendas. This transition has the strong potential to bring economic prosperity and high quality jobs, and to pave the way for a sustainable future for present as well as future generations. However, it could entail short term and sometimes intense- adverse impacts on certain kinds of jobs and assets, often labelled as stranded assets and stranded labour.

She said this to highlight how important it is for the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) opened on December 02 in Poland's Katowice to address climate change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions. The annual United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) opened on December 2 in Poland's Katowice to finalise the implementation guidelines for the Paris Climate Change Agreement. While talking about how important this conference is since it is happening in a year that saw a series of devastating climate disasters around the globe she said this year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record saying greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. ""Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more, COP24 needs to make that happen"", she added. She stated that the guidelines are to provide clarity on implementation of the landmark agreement and strengthen international cooperation saying a finalised set of implementation guidelines will unleash practical climate actions, like adapting to climate change impacts, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing financial and other support to developing countries. The conference is being held hot on the heels of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, as well as a cascade of UN and other reports on increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions. ""All of these findings confirm the need to maintain the strongest commitment to the Paris Agreement's aims of limiting global warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5C,"" says Ms. Espinosa. Meanwhile, in a brief interview Lesotho Meteorological Services (LMS) Principal Meteorologist Mr. Mosuoe Letuma stated that Lesotho is represented in the COP24 saying the delegation will also participate in the adaption of the Paris Agreement and other issues that will be discussed at the conference including the global average temperature. He explained that from 1990 the global average temperature has increased by 0.8% which he said has resulted in countries such as Lesotho experiencing heat wave, drought and other climatical changes. He pointed that for Lesotho and other developing countries the 2C is not an option for them saying that temperature should be kept at least 1.5C emphasising that if it rises to 2C it will be a disaster because the heatwave will be extreme, ""the heat will be so unbearable"", he said. 2018 Climate Change Summit termed COP24 started on December 02 and will end on December 17 and Lesotho delegation comprises of government officials from the Ministries of Energy and Meteorology, Agriculture and Food Security, Forestry, Range and Soil Conservation, Foreign Affairs and International Relations as well as Development Planning Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Lesotho News Agency.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA11","FAO URGES TO SCALE UP RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL SECTORS","December 13, 2018 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): Investing in policies, people, data, innovations and leadership should be part of the solution FAO Deputy Director-General says at COP24 summit 13 December 2018, Katowice, Poland - The world must scale up the response to climate change, particularly in agricultural sectors, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo told delegates at a high-level side-event of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, today. It will require investing in multi-sectoral policy design, implementation capacity, people, data, innovations as well as leadership, especially for women, she said. At the special event, focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, Semedo warned of the increased global hunger levels, driven largely by the impacts of climate change, conflicts, and economic slowdown, noting that ""our efforts to end hunger will become more challenging if warming reaches two degrees Celsius"". However, ""achieving Zero Hunger is still possible,"" she stressed, adding that in order to succeed it is essential ""to define transformative actions that will reshape our food systems, sustainably and equitably for all."" Climate-smart agriculture approach in action At a COP 24 side event of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture earlier this week, FAO launched a new publication that showcases ten success stories from around the world revealing how the management of farms, crops, livestock and aquaculture can meet food security needs while building adaptation to climate change and contributing to mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. ""Climate-Smart"" Agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to transform agricultural systems to ensure food security and support rural development in a changing climate. The aim of the publication is to provide the best FAO-led examples of how CSA is not a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach that can be universally applied but, rather, involves different elements embedded in local contexts. Land use factor - a missing link in addressing climate change Semedo also spoke at the joint UN side event on SDG15: Life on Land at COP24 earlier this week. Noting that currently the land use sector is responsible for almost a quarter of global GHG emissions, Semedo underlined that it also has great potential to store vast quantities of carbon in soils, forests and wetlands. ""We can make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by adopting smarter, integrated farming systems, by protecting and managing forests and by shifting to approaches that use natural resources sustainably and efficiently,"" Semedo said. ""This way, the land use sector can change from being part of the climate problem to becoming part of the solution and deliver up to 30 percent of the climate mitigation needed by 2030,"" she added. Semedo also highlighted the vital role of partnerships, innovations and technology in scaling up joint efforts to better manage forests and land. At the event, FAO and US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched a new open-access tool Collect Earth Online (CEO) allowing anyone to track land-use and landscape changes anywhere in the world. It will enable countries to strengthen measuring, monitoring and reporting capacities on forests and land use. At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, FAO supports countries to ensure that the linkages are made between climate change adaptation, mitigation, agriculture, and food security for enhanced climate action. Agriculture can and must be a significant part of the response to climate change. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA12","COUNTDOWN TO COP24: ECA SUPPORTING MEMBER STATES AT EVERY LEVEL, SAYS MUROMBEDZI","November 15, 2018 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UN Economic Commission for Africa: The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), through its African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC), is fully committed to supporting member States in their efforts to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)which embody efforts by each country to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Speaking ahead of the 24th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP 24 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which will be held from 2-14 December 2018 in Katowice, Poland, ACPC Officer-in-Charge, James Murombedzi, said the NDCs were important and at the heart of the Paris Agreement. ""The ECA is fully committed to supporting member States regarding the NDCs, taking into account the need for urgent and adequate climate action while staying on course to achieve the goals of Agenda 2063 and the sustainable development goals,"" he said. Mr. Murombedzi said the recent Seventh Conference on Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA-VII) which was held in Nairobi, Kenya, under the theme; 'Climate change and development in Africa: policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa' had helped Africa prepare for COP24 . ""The rule book is particularly important because it will guide every country's action on the ground and help them to enhance their climate action pledges, especially the NDCs, by 2020. The rule book will also be useful to hold accountable parties who committed to adopt those rules by this time,"" Mr. Murombedzi said, adding the ACPC was working with member States and others on the continent in preparation for COP24 . COP 24 , the most important COP since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, is being held against the backdrop of a year of record-breaking climate impacts, and the landmark special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); ""Global Warming of 1.50C"" which unequivocally concluded that the world is not on track to limiting global temperature rise to below 1.50C. The more salient aspects of the IPCC Report for Africa include: i. Global average warming of 1.50C will probably imply 30C or greater warming for Africa ii. That global warming is already at around 10C warming, and Africa is already experiencing unprecedented disruptions of rainfall and temperature patterns and sea level rise iii. The impacts of these on economies and livelihoods include droughts, flooding, displacement, climate induced migration, food insecurity and significant losses of infrastructure and investments. COP 24 will also seek to make progress on the ongoing implementation of the UNFCCC including mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building support; the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue; and the stock-take of climate action before 2020. A High-level ministerial event on climate finance will take place during COP24 . Mr. Murombedzi said Africa was preparing well for COP24 , adding some of the key issues the continent wants discussed include whether rules on NDCs should be common to all or split into differentiated versions for developed and developing countries. China and the G77 have also advocated for a ""two-tier"" rulebook. The ECA has carried out a detailed survey of the status of implementation of the NDCs in Africa, and has designed a programme to support member States to streamline their NDCs in line with their national development goals, as well as with the SDGs and Agenda 2063. African countries also want to discuss climate finance which they argue is key to helping developing countries meet their obligations. Current flows of finance are not yet sufficient to meet a promised $100 billion per year by 2020. Africa and other developing countries want to start discussing a new climate finance goal, which is due to kick in from 2025. The ECA, the African Development Bank, AUC and NEPAD will host ""Africa Day"" at COP24 under the theme; ""Operationalization of the Africa NDC Hub: Going further and faster with NDC implementation for resilient economies in Africa"". The Africa NDC Hub, which intends to leverage technical and financial assistance to African countries to implement their NDCs, was launched by the ECA and its partners at COP23 in Bonn and at COP24 they will focus on operationalization of the hub. The day will provide a platform and opportunity for member States, development partners, private sector, civil society and various key stakeholders to dialogue and discuss ways of supporting coordinated partnerships and approaches to support member States with implementation of their NDCs through the Africa NDC Hub. Discussions will focus on how to ensure developed countries and development partners go beyond partnerships and commitments of intents to concrete actions and resources towards effective and adequate means of implementation - finance, capacity building, and technology development and transfer - of the Paris Agreement in Africa. It is estimated that climate change could displace between 50 and 200 million by 2050 and Africa hopes COP24 will be a success, especially in finalizing the Paris Agreement Work Program given the challenges the continent is facing due to climate change. \"

This year's COP24 is being held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 14.Rocky StartStraight out of the gate, however, theopening plenary was delayed on Sunday in part because of a request from Turkey to downgrade its status to that of 'developing country'  a move intended to soften Turkey's responsibilities. Developed countries  those listed in the Convention as Annex I countries  are expected to contribute more to climate financing and emission reductions than developing nations.The COP presidency agreed to schedule consultations on Turkey's proposal. Similarly distracting from the core purposes of the Conference is the position of host country Poland regarding its reliance upon coal for its electricity generation. Protestors picketed the site of a former coal mine in Poland over the weekend in an effort to shine a light on the country's coal industry. According tothe World Energy Council[3],Poland consumes 77 million tonnes of coal per year, making it the tenth-largest coal consumer in the world and the second-largest in the EU, after Germany, securing 92% of its electricity and 89% of its heat from coal. Unfortunately, it would appear Poland has arrived at the Conference fully intent on ensuring everyone knows it is not ashamed of its coal use, considering that its own pavilion design ethos is prioritizing coal:So Polish exhibition stand is literally made of coal.

It's also important to remember that COP24 is taking place only two months after the release of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC)Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C which warned that 'Limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.' In line with the importance of this event, thepresidents of COP20, COP21, COP22, and COP23 issued a joint statement (PDF[10]) over the weekend calling on all 'Parties and non-Party stakeholders to send an unequivocal message from Katowice for enhanced ambition by 2020 that puts the world on a trajectory compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.' The joint statement was signed by Laurent Fabius, President of COP21, Frank Bainimarama, President of COP23, Salaheddine Mezouar, President of COP22, and Manuel Pulgar Vidal, President of COP20. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) alsopublished a statement Sunday[11]outlining the priorities for this year's COP24 which includesthe Talanoa Dialogue, climate action before 2020, and the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. 'This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record,' saidPatricia Espinosa, the UN's Climate Chief. 'Greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more - COP24 needs to make that happen.' Similarly commenting on the necessary outcomes from COP24,350.orgExecutive Director May Boeve explained that 'We expect to see a way forward to upgrading action on climate prior to 2020, as our representatives promised in Paris. But the choice of fossil fuel companies to sponsor the conference casts a long-shadow over such hopes.'; 'We also expect a strong and comprehensive Paris Agreement rulebook agreed in Katowice. A rulebook that ensures that governments stop all new fossil fuel projects, turn off the funding tap to dirty energy, and actually prepare, plan and invest in a just transition to 100% renewable energy.' 'But no matter what happens in the negotiating corridors in Katowice the change is already happening the world. Cities in Ukraine and Georgia have committed to go 100% renewable; community activists in Poland are shaping a new consensus on what the economy and development should look like; and financial markets are increasingly black-listing fossil fuel industries like coal.' 'We're on a fast road to suffering unless we act now. People are already dying from the impacts of climate change,£ddedGreenpeace's head of delegation at COP24 Jens Mattias Clausen[12]. 'This is the harsh reality that leaders must confront at COP24 . They are the last generation of leaders who still have the time to act. They must put the Paris Agreement to work and ramp up action now. Only through fast, bold change can we alter the course of history. 'The window of opportunity is open - but only just. Climate science still provides hope, but the time for political talk has long gone. People are clamouring for action. Children are walking out of schools, the vulnerable are calling for justice or launching lawsuits and communities are standing up to defend their forests.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA14","The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice Draws to a Close; Whilst Alarm Bells are sounding, Neutrino Energy offers answers","December 21, 2018 Friday 1:45 PM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire \~While the participants of this year's Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland tried in vain to replace the voluntary commitments agreed upon in 2015 at the Climate Change Conference in Paris with binding agreements, Germany's Neutrino Energy Group was busy working on a solution to the global climate problem with its team of international partners: ""Ignorance of the long-term consequences of global warming is nothing short of criminal negligence towards the coming generations, especially when one considers that science now has knowledge that can help us to find alternatives to our dependence on fossil fuel. This is a fact that cannot be denied!"" said Holger Thorsten Schubart, CEO of the Neutrino Energy Group, after one of many successful demonstrations of the Neutrino Power Cube in Berlin. Parallel to the occasion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, the Neutrino Energy Group presented a detailed demonstration of its Neutrino Energy Cell for a select audience. According to Neutrino Energy, this successful demonstration confirmed a notarized certification in which it had been documented that electricity can indeed be derived by using a small piece of neutrino foil coated with a layer of nanoparticles without the implementation of batteries or power cables. ""Energy converted from the invisible radiation spectrum is reality - measurable reality,"" summarized Holger Thorsten Schubart. The demonstration itself was conducted under the strictest of security conditions in the presence of journalists and experts in the field, and a video of the proceedings was made.\~ It is already possible to cause light-emitting diodes to glow and to power small electrical devices through the use of neutrino energy - without cables, without batteries, without a generator. This method is similar to that used in the process of converting solar energy into electricity, but neutrino technology relies upon an invisible portion of the spectrum instead of light. The advantage of this method is obvious: Energy is available even in total darkness - 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. And comparable to the process of solar energy conversion, neutrino technology is scalable: The amount of energy produced stands in direct relation to the size of the power cells. ""In its early stages solar energy could only be used to power small electrical devices such as calculators,"" explained Schubart, ""but now we're seeing large-scale photovoltaic systems that produce enough energy for industrial applications. The same applies to neutrino energy. Of course, it takes time for people to accept technological innovations as reality, but scientific knowledge is in a process of constant development. The technological possibilities open to us today would have appeared utopic just a few short years ago."" Now that today's electrical devices are beginning to require less and less power, the time has finally come to move away from the large, centrally located power production facilities that date back to the early stages of western industrialization. Today it is much more sensible to think in terms of decentralization and low-voltage. None of the typical household electrical appliances in use today really needs 220 V of alternating current, but they still exist because manufacturers are forced to produce devices that are compatible with the present system. In the future, however, 12/24 or 48-volt direct current will be the norm for most daily applications, and the electricity required will not come from an environmentally unfriendly power plant, nor will it be transported long distances in a costly and wasteful process. There is no future for such outdated, ecologically unsound methods. The solution to today's energy problems is the neutrino. Neutrinos are high-energy subatomic particles from space that reach the earth by the billions in a constant flow. They also possess mass and are able to undergo weak interactions with other particles. This makes it possible for neutrinos to be used for the purpose of producing electricity by means of their kinetic energy, but it is important to note that neutrinos can be found everywhere, and they are influenced neither by the time of day nor by the prevailing weather conditions. The neutrino energy which reaches our planet on a daily basis is greater than that of all of the world's remaining fossil fuel reserves combined, and for this reason, neutrinos present humanity with a virtually unlimited source of energy.\~ In the past, a disturbing amount of misinformation has been spread regarding the neutrino, but the actual method of implementing these particles to produce electrical energy is in fact characterized by\~simple wisdom - that strength and beauty\~are both elegant and at the same time highly logical. After the successful demonstration of a Neutrino Energy Cell, Schubart commented: ""Neutrinos are not captured when one converts their energy into electricity, just as a windmill doesn't capture the wind. They cause vibrations on an atomic level not unlike those of a miniature generator. And although the effect of this invisible radiation is extremely weak, this seeming weakness proves ultimately to be the strength of neutrino energy, because it is available everywhere in equal concentrations. This renders centrally located power plants and extended electrical grids spanning thousands of miles completely unnecessary."" In the end, it is the duty of mankind to seek out alternatives to the inefficient methods of energy production that are presently destroying our planet, and neutrino energy represents a way to finally end our dependence on fossil fuel and nuclear power.\~ Press contact:\~ Heiko Schulze Haus der Bundespressekonferenz 0413 D-10117\~Berlin Telephone: +49 30 20924013 E-Mail:\~ HYPERLINK press@neutrino-energy.com Website:\~ HYPERLINK http://neutrino-energy.com NEUTRINO Deutschland GmbH is a German-American research and development company under the direction of the mathematician Holger Thorsten Schubart.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA15","All Pilgrim Routes Lead to COP24","December 11, 2018 Tuesday 8:01 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: Pilgrims coming from Germany, Italy and Norway ended their journeys for climate justice on 7 December upon arrival at the St Stephen's Church in Katowice, Poland, where the United Nations (UN) climate conference is underway. They were warmly welcomed by the delegations of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) that are attending the 24th Conference of Parties of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ). Led by Yeb Sano, former lead climate negotiator for the Philippines, the pilgrimage from Rome had representatives from seven countries and covered 1,500 kilometers on foot during 62 days. It was aimed at lifting up calls to action for an ambitious global rule book that can ensure a quick end to the fossil fuel era; a just transition to the clean energy economy; and a new practice of integral ecology by individuals and communities. During the welcome, an emotional Sano paid tribute to a fellow pilgrim, Canadian peace advocate and Quaker, Alan Burns, who passed away on 11 November while carrying out the pilgrimage. ""His pilgrimage was a testament to the human spirit and brought out many stories of hope"", said Sano. A Norwegian bike pilgrim, pro cyclist Jonas Orset, traveled 1300 kilometers over six days from Oslo to Katowice. While most participants to the COP 24 arrived by plane, Orset chose an emission-free if challenging mode of travel to bring attention to the growing climate crisis and alternative transport systems. All three pilgrim teams joined WCC and LWF delegates in the march calling for immediate climate action, on 8 December, in Katowice, which drew an estimated 3,000 people. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5 C reveals that we have a window of 10-12 years to act decisively on climate change and prevent catastrophic climate impacts.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA16","WATERING THE PARIS AGREEMENT AT COP24","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Most people will experience climate change in the form of water - higher frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, an increase in waterborne diseases, and overloaded sewage systems that are unable to cope with new demands. At the same time, water offers some of the best solutions for reducing our climate impact and tackling effects of climate change. Yet, the role of water is poorly understood and often forgotten in the international climate debate. The Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 24 At the meeting in Poland, the parties need to agree on the ""rulebook"" for the agreement, i.e. how it should be implemented. But water is largely absent from the agreement. However, many of the parties who ratified the Paris Agreement made water a central component of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). At the doorstep of finalizing the road map for implementing the Paris Agreement, the water community fears a missed opportunity to leverage water's full potential to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. With recent estimates saying that emissions must come down dramatically in the next few years, this is a risk the world cannot afford. Similarly, the most powerful manifestations of climate change are water-related and if that is not acknowledged, it will be difficult for countries to respond adequately. Climate change will also exacerbate water quality and variability, through changed precipitation patterns and changes to evapotranspiration and ultimately the water balance. Trees, landscapes and agriculture are, for example, key for reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Forests and wetlands act as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and play a central role in the hydrologic cycle, filtering, storing and regulating surface and groundwater flows. Forest and wetlands can also act as buffers and provide nature-based solutions to many infrastructure problems that increasingly need to be addressed by decision-makers, not least to make human settlements more resilient to floods and droughts. To ensure sustainable development, food security and economic stability in face of climate change, it is essential that water is acknowledged and integrated into efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its adverse effects. To take action is also a question of climate justice; the people most affected by effects of climate change are seldom themselves causing major emissions. Yet, at the same time they can be strong agents of change. Inclusion of marginalized groups and stakeholders is consequently key in resilient decision and policy making. The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and AGWA, a network hosted and co-chaired by SIWI, are honoured to be official co-coordinators of the MPGCA (Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Agenda) at COP24 . Along with other partners, we have organised several climate resilient water related events. See our activities on our SIWI at COP webpage, and follow our activities on social media using #SIWIatCOP.

That is why the Government of Canada is following through with this commitment by holding, with France, a training workshop on climate negotiations for 15 francophone negotiators from the sub-Saharan African region--in Dakar, Senegal--from October 22 to 25, 2018. The workshop, which will be offered in French for the first time, aims to help participants develop the personal skills, competencies, and knowledge they need for international negotiations, decision making, and the development of climate change policies. These skills will be especially useful ahead of the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), which will be hosted in Poland, in December 2018. The project follows the launch of the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, in April 2018. This partnership includes several Franco-Canadian cooperation actions for 2018-2019, such as including climate in development assistance actions. In addition to supporting the Franco-Canadian participation in climate issues, this workshop encourages a diversity of voices at the negotiation table, by supporting the participation of francophone women.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA18","COP 24: Good News And Bad","December 16, 2018 Sunday 6:06 AM EST","PA Pundits","Dec 16, 2018( PA Pundits: HYPERLINK http://papundits.wordpress.com http://papundits.wordpress.com COP24 , two groups showed up with news - one group predicting a catastrophic disaster and the other with a message of hope and encouragement. Monday the U. S. held an event featuring U.S. government and industry officials showcasing the newest innovations in fossil fuels. These innovations will reduce emissions, create jobs and still provide reliable and affordable energy. The event was disrupted, with the sanction of the U.N., by youth standing and chanting 'keep it in the ground' and then exiting yelling 'shame on you, shame on you.' These young people had no desire to hear the good news about this cheap abundant energy. In contrast, Al Gore held an event on Wednesday walking out on stage like a rockstar. His presentation began with a slideshow of a satellite picture of planet Earth. He said we are using our £tmosphere like an open sewer' and in that sewer we are dumping 'man-made global warming pollutionequivalent to exploding 500,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year'. He spent the first hour of his 1 1/2 hour speech showing slides of the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters from all over the world. And of course, he blamed this on global warming. He claimed the civil war in Syria was caused by global warming not Hamas and the caravans headed toward the U.S. are migrants escaping a drought caused by global warming, not the crime and corrupt governments of their countries. When he made derogatory comments about fossil fuel companies and President Trump, the crowd laughed accordingly. When he concluded, the crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked off the stage. In the real world he might have been called on his lies, but the reality of COP24 is built on his lies. COP24 is working on a rulebook on how to implement the Paris Agreement. The rulebook will include a section called a 'Just Transition.' It refers to societies transitioning from fossil fuels to a carbon free society. This section is to soften the hard fact that there will be no 'just' transition, there will only be a 'forced' transition by governments. Most of the world is completely unaware that the United Nations is planning a complete 'transformational change' in their lives. To reach a carbon free atmosphere, which is impossible, but just trying to get there, will begin this transformational change with governments telling it's citizens what to eat, where to live, and what to drive. Al Gore said in a few years there will no longer be a combustible engine. A carbon free environment will require governments to take over farm and grazing land telling this sector what to grow and what animals to raise. One event on 'Food Systems and Climate Change' claimed that to keep the temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees, western countries will have to eat 50% less meat and more food will have to be grown on less land. Citizens of western countries will have to convert from a diet of meat and potatoes to a diet of vegetables, fruit, nuts and some grains. Government regulations will be required to change this behavior. Al Gore and the United Nations have been telling the world since the United Nations' Framework on Climate Change UNFCCC treaty was ratified by the U. S. Senate and signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, that we are experiencing global warming. And if the planet gets hotter than 1.5 degrees Celsius, oceans will rise, glaciers will melt and there will be no more planet Earth. But Earth's temperature has increased less than one degree Celsius. So to speed this process along, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC issued a new report right before COP24 predicting that mankind has 11 years to drastically change its behavior or the temperature is 'likely' to rise above 1.5 degrees C. This report is driving everything at COP24 and the words 'transformational change' are used in every conversation and event. The good news is COP24 was unable to include the IPCC report into its language because four countries refused to recognize it - the U. S, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia. The four largest oil producing countries. The good news is fossil fuels are not our enemy. This abundant, easily accessed energy lifts societies out of poverty. The bad news is societies will never be able to reach a carbon free atmosphere even with heavy government interventions and alternative energy is so expensive poverty will only increase. The bad news is the climate change train has left the station and it seems, it will not be stopped. The good news is the U.S. has president Trump.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA20","EXPERT ON CLIMATE CHANGE: GIVING UP IS NOT AN OPTION","December 13, 2018 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of Tennessee: Hundreds of diplomats from around the world are gathered in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), a two-week series of negotiations addressing the problem of rising global temperatures. The annual meeting is a chance to solidify the rules set in place by the Paris climate agreement, which was adopted at COP21 in 2015. The agreement established ways in which each of the world's developed nations could reach set climate goals, specifically the goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Between COP21 and COP24 a lot has happened: the United States pulled out of the Paris agreement, and despite the dire warnings of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, more and more policies are being geared toward environmental deregulation. As COP24 Why is this meeting important? Continued attention at a global scale is critical for solving the crisis our civilization is currently facing. Meetings like COP24 and reports like those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the US Fourth National Climate Synthesis are ways of keeping the matter in the public view. Is it still possible to keep global temperatures from reaching the 2 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris agreement? It is indeed possible to achieve these goals, but only if immediate serious action is taken to reduce emissions and sequester carbon and other greenhouse gases. The longer we delay, the harder it will be to reverse or slow the pace of change. What role does the United States plays in reaching the goal? What about other countries? At the national level I do not expect changes will be adopted in the near term, unless some major event or grassroots activity leads to a groundswell by citizens for change. I am, however, optimistic that as people become increasingly aware of what is happening, they will engage in the political processes necessary to change minds and policies. As result, effective solutions will be found and adopted. This is a matter that everyone on the planet needs to be addressing. Fortunately more and more people are doing something. What changes can we expect to see after COP24 ? I think public concerns about the impacts of climate change are going to continue to grow as more and more people realize that serious things are happening now and that conditions will only get worse in the years to come if no action is taken. In the fight against climate change, doing nothing or giving up is not an option for anyone who cares about the well-being of our country, children, and the beauty and diversity of life on our planet. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA22","COP24 Fails to Deliver on Mandate for Carbon Market Cooperation - IETA","December 16, 2018 Sunday 6:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Emissions Trading Association issued the following news release: IETA is deeply disappointed that climate negotiators failed to fulfil their mandate to deliver rules for market cooperation as part of the Paris Agreement ""rule book"" at COP 24 in Katowice today. In a year when the scientific community urged governments to scale up action to address climate change towards achieving a 1.5 degree Celsius goal, negotiators delayed decisions on rules that would have delivered a valuable signal to business. These decisions would have offered guidance on how international markets could be harnessed to enhance ambition. Instead, negotiations stalled, and Parties deferred this item for further work in 2019, missing an opportunity to inspire businesses to accelerate action. ""If countries want to ramp up climate action, they must get more serious about international cooperation through market incentives,"" said Dirk Forrister, IETA President and CEO. ""But we should not let this slow us down - we don't have time to waste. While we wait for the rules to firm up, committed countries and businesses should team up to start building cooperative markets - and the rule writers can catch up later."" ""Sound environmental accounting is the bedrock of market-based climate policies,"" said Stefano De Clara, IETA's Director for International Policy. ""Nearly every country recognises this essential element. Yet a slim minority blocked agreement in Katowice and insisted that the new crediting mechanism should not require a project host to properly reflect exports in their Nationally Determined Contributions."" ""This would invite double-counting and erode confidence in both the public and private sector. So it is a good thing that the majority rejected this weakening measure."" At COP24 , IETA and Environmental Defense Fund launched the Katowice Declaration on Sound Carbon Accounting to highlight the need for a robust system to avoid the double-counting of emission reductions. The likely impacts of the delayed decisions on emissions markets are unclear. The UNFCCC's new mechanism planned under Article 6.4 will remain closed until rules are agreed. This means project developers, who aim to apply to the UNFCCC for carbon credit approvals under the Paris Agreement, will remain on hold. However, they may pursue the growing markets being run by individual governments, or voluntary markets served by independent standards organisations. In addition, markets set up under the Kyoto Protocol will remain open, although their future, meant to be defined by the rule book, is uncertain. Importantly, Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement allows countries to link markets ""consistent with"" UN guidance. In the absence of such guidance, they are free to set up market systems that link together to meet targets and accelerate action at lower cost. A number of countries have already banded together to explore market harmonisation and future linkages under Article 6.2. Voluntary markets are also growing more vibrant as corporate leaders respond to investor and customer interest in climate responsibility. Domestic and international action through markets will continue to grow and deliver emission reductions, despite the anti-climatic end of COP24 . MSTRUCK-6554399 MSTRUCK \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA23","COP24: what to expect","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 5:41 AM EST","Phil's Stock World","Dec 04, 2018( Phil's Stock World: HYPERLINK http://www.philstockworld.com http://www.philstockworld.com COP24 : what to expect COP24 venue Spodek arena in Katowice, Poland. Milosz Maslanka/Shutterstock[1] Courtesy ofFederica Genovese[2], University of Essex[3] Representatives of almost all the countries on the planet are gathering in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They will set the course for action on climate change by discussing the implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement[4] which aims to coordinate international effort to halt warming at 1.5C. The COPs receive significant media attention and, sometimes, even notable public interest[5]. They take place every year as an opportunity for countries to collectively assess progress on dealing with climate change. In 2018 the negotiations kick off barely two months after a report[6] by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the international community only has a 12-year window to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, 24 years after the first COP there is a deep disconnect[7] between how urgently the world needs effective climate policy and the pace of discussing global mechanisms on how to abate greenhouse gas emissions. A history of failure The first COP meetings held in the 1990s led to the creation of the Kyoto Protocol[8] in 1997, which set binding emissions targets for developed countries over two 'commitment periods' (2008-2012 and 2013-2020). However, the Kyoto agreement failed as the US did not ratify it and because several inconclusive conferences followed its implementation. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 also failed to yield any agreement on binding commitments for the second commitment period. A few major countries agreed to a short accord recognising the need to limit global temperature rises to 2C, but there were no substantial guidelines on how to do so. Similarly, COP19 in Warsaw four years later did not finalise any binding treaty. It only recognised £ flexible ruling' on differentiated responsibilities and loss and damage. In Warsaw, the international community failed[9] to take essential steps for the future. Some even think that the 2013 conference cast some doubt[10] on the capacity of the Polish government to successfully lead COP24 in 2018. Against this backdrop, COP21 in Paris in 2015 appeared to generate the most optimistic outcome in two decades of international climate negotiations. In Paris, the world leaders agreed on a general action plan that legally binds countries to have their progress tracked by technical experts. The countries who signed up also agreed on a 'global stocktake' - a process for reviewing collective progress towards achieving the long-term goals of the agreement. However, lots of details about the Paris Agreement still have to be nailed down. This is precisely what the international community seeks to do this December in Poland. The focus of COP24 and the likely outcomes The major objective for COP24 is to agree upon the so-called Paris 'rulebook' - the details of how nations should implement the Paris Agreement and report their progress. Three major areas of political discussion will receive most attention: finance, emission targets, and the role of 'big' states. Finance In 2015, richer countries pledged US$100 billion a year by 2020[11] for poorer nations to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, the climate funding is still about US$20 billion short[12]. COP24 delegates will need to discuss in more detail on when the rest of the money will be generated before committing to the rulebook. Perhaps even more importantly, rules for where that money comes from, and particularly whether international loans are acceptable, still have to be agreed on. Because finance is closely linked to issues of justice and fairness in the international system, it is unlikely that this discussion will lead to more generous levels of climate aid - although there is space for improvement, and some past conferences have actually provided small but significant advances[13] on this front. Emission targets COP24 also needs to set some form of flexible yet comparable rules that will govern the Paris Agreement. One groundbreaking feature of the Paris Agreement is that all parties agreed to commit to national contributions to climate action. In other words, the agreement is based on a bottom-up process in which countries largely determine their own contributions, and then act upon them. This COP may settle on some basic strategies for verifying climate actions, but it is very unlikely that the international community will agree on any mechanisms for delivering sanctions to states that do not meet their targets, because of the high sensitivity towards financial costs for non-abatement[14]. The role of 'big' states Finally, while 'small' countries will have an important role to play at the negotiations as usual[15], there are several question marks around the large countries that need to bear a lot of the efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It will not help that President Donald Trump, who intends to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, decided in 2017 to cancel climate funding for poor nations[16]. The US position at COP24 will also affect China and India, which are likely to continue disagreeing[17] with rich countries on some fundamental issues. Additionally, the domestic politics of Russia[18] and Brazil[19] point to more uncertainty for cooperation. Looking ahead from COP24 The urgency to reach key milestones in the Paris Agreement and deal with climate change puts a lot of high expectations on COP24 . Unfortunately, many challenges stand ahead of international climate cooperation. Approaching the negotiations with the right level of reason and determination will be critical to manage expectations and avoid any media 'hysteria', as media coverage can hurt[20] the climate talks by shifting attention from the policy issues to unproductive discussions of whether climate change is influenced by humans. For a credible and valid rulebook, we need frank conversations about energy transition and compensating the 'losers' of climate policies, such as people working in high-emission sectors[21]. There might be the opportunity to do so in Katowice, an industrial hub and coal-mining city. We will see if this COP will highlight the necessary transition from fossil fuel industry to renewable solutions as the negotiations unravel.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA24","Investor and Company Leaders Welcome COP 24 Progress","December 18, 2018 Tuesday 8:02 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Ceres, a non-profit organization that is mobilizing many of the world's largest companies and investors to take stronger action on climate change, water scarcity and other global sustainability challenges, issued the following news release: U.S. Investor and business community leaders welcomed the results of the international climate talks, known as COP 24 , particularly the adoption by world leaders of a shared ""rulebook"" for implementation of the Paris Agreement. These new rules will help ""create a stronger foundation for countries to implement the historic accord,"" said Ceres CEO and President Mindy Lubber. Investors and businesses will benefit from the new rules as they will ""improve transparency and allow for consistent reporting and monitoring for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, enabling stepped-up climate ambition"" she added. Lubber said: The urgency to tackle the world's greatest sustainability and climate challenges has never been greater. That urgency was on full display at COP 24 , especially on the heels of a sobering report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that called for dramatically increasing the pace and scale of greenhouse gas emission reductions. The investor and business community is acutely aware of the economic imperative of climate action. That's why a record number of investors -- 415 investors with $32 trillion in assets under management -- called on governments last week to not only scale up ambition to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to also put a price on carbon and phase out thermal coal power. And, at the U.S. Climate Action Center at COP24 , We Are Still In leaders highlighted the 500 companies that have already committed to science-based targets to reduce emissions, and the hundreds of other companies that have already committed to power their operations with 100 percent renewable energy. It is clear that the transition to a low-carbon economy is well underway and momentum is building. But, we know there is much more work to be done, and government and private sector leaders will need to step up climate action by 2020 in order to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals of limiting warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5-degrees Celsius Ceres and its network members are more committed than ever before to ensuring that the U.S. is on track to meet and ratchet up the ambition of its goals under the Paris Agreement. The next year will be critical for leadership that accelerates climate action and strengthens policies both at home and abroad. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6555286 MSTRUCK \"

COP24 set in motion the momentous Paris Agreement[1], wherein 196 countries agreed to keep global average temperature to 2C above pre-industrial levels while striving to hold temperature increase below 1.5C. At COP24 , countries decided on rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement (the Paris Rulebook), including guidelines for nationally-determined contributions (NDCs), transparency, and finance. Island states also pushed countries to act fast to limit global warming given the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5C Special Report[2] which cautions that global warming could reach 1.5C, an existential threshold, as soon as 2030. With the release of the IPCC 1.5C Report and a Global Carbon Project study[3] that shows that carbon dioxide emissions will rise 2.7% by the end of this year, COP24 was the time to act. 'We need to move,' the Polish COP24 President announced days from closing, as major issues remained unresolved. 'Climate change will not wait for us.' The following are some of the key issues that brought the work of reaching a COP24 agreement[4] down to the wire. NDCs: The Paris Rulebook specifies the information Parties are to include in their NDCs, and sets guidelines for the accounting methodology for emissions and removals. Parties to date have included widely varying information in their NDCs making it hard to assess the progress towards the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming. (Recent data from Climate Action Tracker[5] shows that current government pledges, including NDCs, only add up to limiting warming to 3.0C above pre-industrial levels). COP24 sets out new NDC rules, requiring Parties to include information like a quantified reference point, time frame for implementation, scope and coverage of the NDC target, and how the NDC contributes towards achieving the Paris temperature goal. Parties also decided that the IPCC will set the accounting methodology for anthropogenic emissions and removals. All NDCs will be available in a public registry. Transparency: The transparency rules are key to making sure Parties stick to their stated goals because of Paris' bottom-up approach. Key issues for this section of the Paris Rulebook included the flexibility available for developing countries and the transparency rules' start date:Flexibility: The transparency rules apply to all countries, replacing the approach of a bifurcated set of rules for developing and developed countries whereby only Annex I and Annex II[6] countries submitted biennial reports. The U.S. has long been keen to have a common set of rules for all parties, an approach which won out at COP24 . The new transparency rules, however, do allow for developing countries to self-determine whether they need flexibility in light of their capacities. Any developing country making use of the flexibility carve-out must specify to which provision it is applied, spell-out capacity constraints, and determine a time frame for improvement. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) can submit a national inventory of emissions, progress towards implementing their NDCs, and information on financial, technology transfer, and capacity-building support needed at their discretion. Transparency rules start-date: Countries facing the most severe impacts of climate change were eager to start the new transparency regime as soon as possible. Parties decided that the first biennial transparency and national inventory reports will be submitted by the end of 2024. This falls after the date of the first global stocktake, 2023, which will assess progress towards reaching the Paris temperature goal. The transparency and national inventory reports would have provided critical information on gaps for the global stocktake. Finance: Finance remains one of the most contentious issues in the UN climate negotiations. At COP24 , countries were to work out financial reporting under Article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement, whether the Adaptation Fund would be transferred from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, and the details of setting a new quantified finance goal after 2020.Information to be provided under Article 9.5: Developing country parties have long insisted that clear finance reporting is essential for planning and implementing their mitigation and adaptation actions. The final text provides that developed country Parties 'shall biennially communicate indicative quantitative and qualitative information' regarding finance. However, the text includes the caveat that this information will be communicated £s available.' While the inclusion of both quantitative and qualitative information is important for setting clear expectations on the amount of finance developing countries can expect, the conditionality of the language means that this reporting may be less than useful. COP24 also supports a balance between mitigation and adaptation finance. The Adaptation Fund: The Adaptation Fund, which is primarily funded by the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, provides finance to developing countries for adaptation measures. Parties decided that the Adaptation Fund would serve the Paris Agreement. The Adaptation Fund will continue to be funded by the Clean Development Mechanism until the market mechanism set up by Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is operational (see Article 6 section below). New collective quantified finance goal: Conference of the Parties Twenty-One (COP21) urged developed countries to scale-up climate finance to reach the goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020. At COP24 , Parties agreed to start the discussion on setting a new collective quantified goal in November 2020, using the $100 billion goal as a floor. The textual changes to paragraph 20 of the COP24 decision during the last week highlight the ongoing debate over developed countries' commitment to climate finance. Instead of calling the $100 billion goal a commitment and highlighting gaps in current levels of finance as it did in earlier versions, the final text for paragraph 20 recycles Paris Agreement language urging developed country Parties to scale up financial support. Germany and Norway doubled their contributions to the Green Climate Fund this COP24 , and multilateral development banks announced a joint framework for aligning activities with Paris goals. Article 6 Market Mechanisms: The Paris Agreement allows for countries to implement their NDCs through cooperative approaches 'that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes,' a new market mechanism, and non-market-based approaches under Article 6. However, Parties were unable to decide on the rules for Article 6 at COP24 . Brazil played hardball, pushing against double counting rules that aimed to prevent both buyer and seller from counting a traded emissions reduction towards their NDCs. The final Article 6 rules have been deferred until next year. Talanoa Dialogue, the IPCC 1.5C Report ...creasing ambition: The Talanoa Dialogue, set up at COP23 in Bonn, aimed to raise ambition in light of the Paris temperature goal. The Dialogue could have resulted in Parties renewing their NDCs to reflect the fact that they currently miss the Paris target. COP24 takes note of the Dialogue outcome, and asks Parties to raise ambition at the United Nations Secretary General's 2019 Climate Summit. In a touch of irony, Parties could not agree to welcome the IPCC 1.5C Report, although they commissioned the report in Paris. The U.S. joined Russia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in watering down the language; COP24 'welcomes the timely completion' of the report rather than the report itself. The most up-to-date version of the COP24 agreement is a whopping 150-plus pages, signaling the amount of work Parties undertook to iron out the details of the Paris Agreement. The final text is balanced, showing concessions to get the world moving on climate action. Even amidst the climate-unfriendly federal position of both the U.S. and Brazil, COP24 showed that the Paris Agreement rolls on.

The IDB joined 14 other organisations, including all 68 agencies of the United Nations, in Katowice, Poland, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), to launch a multi-organization effort at ""walking the talk."" As part of this, the IDB outlined its existing and planned efforts to measure, reduce and offset its unavoidable carbon emissions. ""The science is increasingly clear that the world needs to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and we're proud to have the IDB already meeting this goal internally"", said Amal-Lee Amin, Chief of the IDB's Climate Division, and head of the IDB delegation at COP24 . Some of the IBD's significant steps to reduce its carbon emissions have come from lowering energy use in its offices by upgrading mechanical equipment, replacing inefficient lighting with LED bulbs, and renovating more than 100,000 square feet of office space to open layouts that take advantage of natural light. In addition, on-site solar power systems have been installed in IDB's offices in Bahamas, Brazil, Haiti, and Jamaica as part of a plan to accelerate use of renewable energy (renewable energy credits already cover 100% of electricity use at IDB headquarters). The Bank plans to expand its roster of LEED-certified buildings. Currently, six offices are certified, two in Washington DC and four in the region (Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru and Panama). The IDB is pursuing LEED certification in Jamaica and will also do so for an office under construction in the Dominican Republic. The Bank's main challenge is addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel. To mitigate these and other unavoidable emissions, the IDB has a robust program to invest in carbon offsets, recently supporting reforestation, clean cookstove distribution, and wind energy projects in the region.

Yet, the Paris Agreement falls short in integrating a system that monitors and reports cities and regions' commitments and achievements in reducing CO2 emissions. The call for sub-national determined contributions to complement national pledges in the Paris rule book is gaining echo in Katowice as it is increasingly considered central to bridge the current emissions gap. The European Committee of the Regions took the floor at the plenary room of the United Nations (UN) COP24 Climate Change Conference to claim for a formal role for cities and regions in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels. Click here to access the photo album of the CoR Delegation @ COP24 . COP24 in Katowice with a clear mandate. That of defending a formal role for local and regional governments in the global climate governance and in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Three years after the signature of the Paris climate accord, Katowice is the voluntary deadline to adopt a robust work programme to put the agreement into motion. This is a highlight summary of the activities and statements of the CoR @ COP24 . 13 December 2018 The CoR 1st Vice-President Markku Markkula (FI/EPP) addressed a closing keynote at the EU pavilion in a special session on the drivers to achieve carbon neutrality in the European industry. The Chair of the Espoo City Board said: ""We welcome the positive intentions and trends of energy intense industries to decrease their carbon footprint. You can count on our support to develop partnerships to maximise the potential of the SET Plan and promote research and innovation while driving cooperation between the EU, Member States, regions, industry and research institutions. Europe's industrial transformation must be a priority of Horizon Europe and for regional and private investments. Without the decarbonisation of the industry sector, we will not be able to reach the 2030 energy and climate targets, neither to honour our commitments under the Paris agreement, let alone the objectives of the 2050 climate-neutral strategy. We must now work hand in hand for a mutual beneficial shift towards a low carbon economy."" The event 'Towards a Thriving Carbon Neutral Industry in Europe' was co-organised by the European Commission's DG RTD, Carbon Market Watch and SPIRE PPP. 12 December 2018 COP24 hosted the Cities and Regions Talanoa Dialogues closing session with the opening remarks of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. In an unusual format, the high level session was chaired by two COP presidents, COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama and Michal Kurtyka, Secretary of State of the Polish Ministry of Energy and Plenipotentiary for the Presidency of the COP24 . Cor Lamers said: ""On behalf of the LGMA constituency, we call on the Parties of the Paris Agreement to extend Talanoa dialogues beyond COP24 and to include Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions within Nationally Determined Contributions in the Paris Agreement. In addition, we commend the COP24 Presidency to formally acknowledge the commitments and achievements of local and regional governments in the COP24 final declaration. Local governments worldwide are ready to deliver. You can count on us."" Through the LGMA constituency, local and regional governments worldwide urge all Parties to ensure that the following reference is included in the final COP24 declaration. ""We welcome the outcome and outputs of Talanoa Dialogues and invite Parties to use them for their NDCs"". Local governments commend to the COP24 Presidency that the paragraph is strengthened with reference to multilevel action and fully embedded into the COP24 final declaration. The UN confirmed in its last Emissions Gap Report the potential of cities and regions in the fight against global warming while acknowledging their impact to be ""poorly documented"". Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions (RLDCs) are designed to palliate that lack of data while reducing the emissions gap along with raising climate ambition. At the end of the session, the COP23 and COP24 Presidencies announced a Talanoa Call for Action. Talanoa Dialogues were launched last year by the COP23 Fiji Presidency as global facilitative framework for dialogue to take stock of the collective climate efforts undertaken by sub-national governments, civil society and businesses for better decision-making on climate at the UN level. Throughout 2018, the LGMA constituency participated in more than 60 Talanoa Dialogues in 40 countries, out of which 52 were hosted by local and regional governments, their networks or partners. On December 12, the CoR's ENVE Chair Cor Lamers met with his counterpart at the European Parliament, Adina-Ioana Valean (RO/EPP), Chair of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). They both attended the COP24 negotiations briefing chaired by EU Commissioner for Climate Action Miguel Arias Canete. 11 December 2018 On December 11, the CoR took part in the European Union's Energy Day at the COP24 EU pavilion. In a special session on coal regions Markku Markkula (FI/EPP), CoR's 1st Vice-President said: ""The case of coal regions shows how crucial is multilevel governance to put the energy transition in place. National governments, cities and regions, industry, academia, citizens and the EU need to work together to make this transformation a success. New technologies and capacity building are crucial to go out of coal. Coal regions need robust and tailored financial measures. We therefore welcome the proposal of MEP Jerzy Buzek, Chair of the European Parliament's ITRE Committee, to allocate Euros4,8 billion in the next EU multi-annual budget for the Just Energy Transition Fund"". The CoR is giving its support to the Coal Regions in Transition Platform, created just one year ago by the European Commission as part of the Clean Energy Package. EU Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete stated ""Across the EU, 240,000 workers are employed in the coal industry. 41 regions across 12 Member States are actively mining coal today. I want to turn the transition challenge into an opportunity for coal regions. This is possible and feasible. We have already delivered structural reforms assistance in 13 pilot regions in Slovakia, Poland, Greece, Romania, Czech Republic, Germany and Spain. To reinforce its strategic partnership, the CoR and ICLEI - local governments for sustainability, held a bilateral meeting at COP24 on December 11.""As climate talks are ongoing, it is an excellent moment to meet and reiterate our past, present and future cooperation in the field of climate action but also in biodiversity protection and conservation"", said Markku Markkula (FI/EPP). Ashok Sridharan, ICLEI president and Mayor of Bonn, call on CoR members to keep ensuring the implementation of the climate and biodiversity targets in Europe along with pushing for more ambition and financial mechanisms. On December 11, the CoR delegation attended the European Commission briefing on the progress of the COP24 COP24 political text and have a formal role for local and regional authorities. We want recognition that we are the ones who will deliver on the ground. We need to be included and we need to be counted"". Commissioner Arias Canete said: ""We are very conscious that implementing climate policies needs cites and regions. We do not know yet the text that will be delivered by the presiding officers this afternoon. Such reference was included and we will try to support this idea."" 10 December 2018 Andrew Cooper (UK/EA) addressed the audience at the EU pavilion to reiterate the CoR's call that ""national inventory reports of the Paris Agreement transparency framework must include a section on mitigation actions undertaken by subnational governments."" Rapporteur Cooper had the chance to share these messages at the German pavilion together with Ashok Sridharan, ICLEI president and Mayor of Bonn, in a session dedicated to ""Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators for cities: and inspiration to raise ambitions of locally determined contributions."" On December 10, at the Global Covenant of Mayors Day in the EU pavilion, Markku Markkula (FI/EPP) said: ""It is time for higher climate ambition and actions. Cities and regions are ready to increase their climate contributions to complement national pledges. The slogan of the COP24 Polish Presidency is 'Changing together'. We, local and regional governments, are ambitious, inclusive and innovative. We know how to deliver on climate action. Today, we say to the UN Parties: You can count on us."" The event has been co-organised by the European's Commission DG CLIMA, ICLEI, the Covenant of Mayors office and the CoR. Markku Markkula met with Marcin Krupa, Mayor of Katowice and congratulated the COP24 hosting city for joining the Covenant of Mayors as ""more and more cities championing climate action are needed to deliver on the promises of the Paris Agreement."" Sirpa Hertell (FI/EPP), rapporteur of the CoR opinion on the EU climate change adaptation strategy and member of the city council of Espoo, held a bilateral meeting with Climate Alliance on December 10. Rapporteur Hertell said: ""We agree with our partner networks that it is time to scale up local climate action. To reverse global warming we need a new economic and social model and this can only be successful if it's locally grounded."" The CoR delegation to COP24 was invited by the Mayor of Katowice, Marcin Krupa, to the Katowice Climate Shift: Culmination of cities and regions at COP24 on December 10. It was the occasion to showcase the more than 60 Cities and Regions Talanoa Dialogues along with a panel discussion on climate action at the local level in which CoR's 1st Vice-President Markku Markkula shared the CoR's key political messages to COP24 . COP24 In addition to the COP24 special best practice brochure and to keep increasing the visibility of cities and regions delivering on climate action, the CoR has coordinated the presence at COP24 of the 2018 winners of the Covenant Cities in the Spotlight awards. The CoR delegation has been joined this second COP week by Roberto Campelli, Mayor of Monsano, Erik Lauritzen, Mayor of Sonderborg, and Frederic Ximeno, Commissioner of Ecology of Barcelona's City Council. Background: The CoR delegation to COP24 is composed of Markku Markkula (FI/EPP), CoR 1st Vice-President and Chair of the Espoo City Board, Cor Lamers (NL/EPP) Chair of the CoR's ENVE Commission and Mayor of Schiedam, Valter Flego (HR/ALDE) 2nd Vice-Chair of the CoR's ENVE Commission and Prefect of the Istra County, Andrew Cooper (UK/EA), CoR ENVE EA coordinator, CoR rapporteur on post-2020 climate governance and Member of UK's Kirklees Council, Marco Dus (IT/PES), rapporteur on climate finance and Member of the Vittorio Veneto Municipal Council, Sirpa Hertell (FI/EPP) CoR rapporteur on the EU climate change adaptation strategy and City Councilor of Espoo, Andres Jaadla (EE/ALDE) CoR ENVE ALDE coordinator and Member of the Rakvere City Council, Daiva Matoniene (LT/ECR) CoR ENVE ECR coordinator and Member of the Siauliai City Municipal Council and Andre Van De Nadort (NL/PES) CoR ENVE PES coordinator and Mayor of Weststellingwerf.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA29","Ahead of COP24, Schneider Electric strengthens its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030","December 6, 2018 Thursday 1:59 PM GMT","Product News Network","- The Group will present innovative solutions to fight climate change in Katowice - Schneider Electric's experts & leaders will actively participate at COP24 BOSTON, Mass.,\~Dec. 3, 2018\~/PRNewswire/ -- At a time when the latest IPCC report calls for urgent action to fight climate change,\~Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, is accelerating its contribution to meeting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. To mark the occasion of\~ COP24 \~in\~Katowice\~(Poland), from December 3\~to\~14, 2018, Schneider Electric is strengthening its commitments to become carbon neutral by 2030 using solutions that will help accelerate the transition towards a low carbon economy. Carbon neutral by 2030 ""The climate emergency is growing, and new players are emerging to tackle the issue. The Paris Agreement signed three years ago provides us with a much clearer understanding of what is at stake. We're now at a tipping point in limiting global warming to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels to avoid a major ecological disaster"", says\~Gilles Vermot Desroches, Sustainability Senior VP at Schneider Electric. In\~November 2015, on the eve of\~COP21, Schneider Electric announced its plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. To mark the occasion of\~ COP24 , Schneider Electric is stepping up its ambition and strengthening its commitments to fighting climate change, based on three complementary initiatives: 1.\~\~\~\~\~Before 2020: meet the 21 new commitments of the 2018-2020\~Schneider Sustainability Impact\~barometer, outline a specific trajectory based on the assumption that Earth will breach the 2\'b0C warming limit by 2050 and validate it through the\~Science Based Targets\~initiative, signed by the Group in 2016. 2.\~\~\~\~\~Achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 at its plants and sites, in a cohesive industry ecosystem encompassing both suppliers and clients. To that aim, the Group will quantify carbon emissions saved by its customers thanks to its EcoStruxure offers switch to 100% renewable electricity, use 100% recyclable or reusable packaging, and recover 100% of its industrial waste and double its energy productivity against a 2005 baseline. Building a sustainable future together, thanks to energy efficiency ""The decisions we make today are critical to ensuring a safe and sustainable world for everyone, both now and in the future. At Schneider Electric, we believe that sustainability\~and\~innovation\~is technologically possible today.\~ COP24 , in\~Poland\~this year, is an opportunity for us to demonstrate our contribution through solutions that are a genuine remedy for climate change and to show how we can help meet the United Nations' 17\~Sustainable Development Goals"", said\~Gilles Vermot Desroches. What is good for the climate is good for the economy. Schneider Electric's solutions help accelerate the transition towards a low carbon economy offering numerous opportunities, from sustainable growth to job creation, improved public health and more. A number of Schneider Electric projects in\~Poland\~demonstrate this: Schneider Electric completed an electrical distribution modernization of the Saint Gobain glass factory in D browa G\'f3rnicza in 2017. The replacement and optimization of transformers, thanks to EcoSruxure Power Consulting Services, led to a 16% drop in energy losses (OPEX) in 2018 as well as a 30% drop in capital expenditure. Schneider Electric has also equipped the International Conference Center of\~Katowice, where\~ COP24 Addressing energy poverty and the climate emergency COP 24 , the\~Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Foundation de\~France, together with social entrepreneurship organization Ashoka, will pursue this commitment to tackling fuel poverty in\~Europe\~by launching a new call for projects for 2019. Climate change is another key issue, as many people have already been forced to leave their homes due to extreme natural disasters. Those situations call for mobile, clean, reliable and affordable energy access solutions. At\~ COP24 , Schneider Electric will launch its Villaya Emergency solution for easier access to energy in emergency situations. This solar microgrid solution is ready to use in any situation thanks to a system combining Schneider Electric technologies and the expertise of innovative start-ups. The entire solution is fitted into a standard shipping container for fast, easy transportation or relocation to anywhere worldwide. Schneider Electric at\~ COP24 COP24 \~will bring together around 20,000 participants (political leaders and representatives from NGOs, business and science and research) from more than 190 countries, all working to accelerate the implementation of solutions by 2020. Schneider Electric's experts and executives will participate in a series of events and round tables. About Schneider Electric Schneider Electric is leading the Digital Transformation of Energy Management and Automation in Homes, Buildings, Data Centers, Infrastructure and Industries.With global presence in over 100 countries, Schneider is the undisputable leader in Power Management - Medium Voltage, Low Voltage and Secure Power, and in Automation Systems.

Experts listed below are available for media interviews and contactable on the details provided. Professor Mark Howden, Director ANU Climate Change Institute ""The forthcoming COP is a critical one in setting the 'rulebook' for the Paris Agreement. Australia is likely to be under some pressure from other nations to play a positive hand due to the Government's own reports showing continuing increases in our national GHG emissions and that projections of emissions to 2030 indicate reductions of 5 per cent against 2005 levels rather than the 26-28 per cent of the Paris Agreement. Additionally, the UN Emissions Gap report out today states that Australia does not have the policies in place that they assess are needed to meet the Paris Agreement targets and that our per capita emissions in 2030 are thus likely to be the third worst in the G20 (behind only Saudi Arabia and Russia). Australia has the capacity to contribute significantly to progress various aspects of discussions especially the transparency mechanisms, capacity-building and finance and to the 'Talanoa Dialogue' which is a step towards decisions to ratchet up emission-reduction targets.""

Developing countries will help make Paris work only if they are sure the developed world will deliver on its commitment to mobilise $100 billion each year in climate finance by 2020.

This is a gargantuan task. Negotiators have two weeks to cut down 300 pages of extremely technical negotiating text into a single cohesive rulebook. However, as important as Katowice will be, nothing can change the fact that executing actual emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement is voluntary.

All six companies are state-owned.Relying primarily on coal for some 80 percent of its energy, Poland is among the EU's most polluted members.In a policy paper published this week, its right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) government said it aims to reduce reliance on coal to 60 percent by 2030 by boosting renewables and adding nuclear energy to its mix.The UN's climate chief Patricia Espinosa insists the summit in Poland must produce a detailed programme to move the Paris climate accord forward. World leaders have been trying to breathe new life into the 195-nation Paris Agreement amid backsliding from several nations -- most notably the United States -- over commitments made when it was signed in December 2015.It is to take effect in 2020 and calls for limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Experts warn that the global measure is on track to surpass three degrees by 2100 and urge governments they must now do even more than first planned if global warming is to be reined in at all. \"

During the ceremonies on 3 December, Secretary of State in the Ministry of the Environment Micha\'c5, Kurtyka, the plenipotentiary for COP24 Presidency, officially took over the annual COP Presidency from Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama. The Polish Presidency of COP24 will be based on three main pillars: Man, Technology, Nature. The main aim of the COP24 climate summit is to adopt a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines implementing the Paris Agreement that will make its full implementation possible. During the summit, the political phase of the so-called Talanoa Dialouge will be carried out to take stock of the collective efforts in relation to progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. At the conference, the chief of Polish diplomacy Jacek Czaputowicz met with the President of the UN General Assembly Maria Espinosa. Among the topics discussed were Polish priorities in the UN Security Council. They also addressed the challenges facing the organisation today, including the reform of the United Nations system and increasing the role of the UN General Assembly. International security, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine, was also discussed. The MFA head also met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Congo Jean-Claude Gakosso. The ministers discussed prospects for closer trade relations and economic cooperation between the two countries, specifically in the mining and agricultural sectors and in green technologies. ""Poland wants to step up its presence Africa. I have recently paid a visit to Senegal where I opened our embassy in Dakar. We are also interested in cooperating with the Republic of the Congo,"" said the MFA head. The inauguration of the COP24 coincided with the so-called Leaders' Summit, during which heads of state and government from many countries, at the invitation of the Polish President, will specifically discuss fair and solidarity-based transformation that will allow to develop towards low-emission economy while maintaining economic growth and jobs. The conference ends on 14 December 2018. \"

While in Poland, the President delivered his national address at the 12-day meeting of COP24 , and met with several world leaders. He also visited the impressive Nigerian pavilion at the climate summit. President Buhari on Tuesday visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, in O#347wi#281cim, Poland where he paid tribute to Holocaust victims. Before leaving the Museum, which included the Nazi concentration camps Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Buhari fielded questions from State House Correspondents traveling with him. The president described those fanning embers of discord in Nigeria as illiterates and ignorant'. President Buhari also held bilateral meeting with Swiss President Alain Berset, President of Poland, Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki as well as his Austrian counterpart, Alexander Van der Bellen. The Nigerian leader also met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and both leaders followed up on their past discussions, during their last meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, in July, which centred on trade, investments and partnerships in agriculture. The President welcomed the proposal by the Dutch Prime Minister to visit Abuja soon and promised that the Nigerian government would continue to provide a conducive business environment for existing and prospective Dutch investors. President Buhari met with the Prime Minister of Estonia, Juumlri Ratas. The Prime Minister of the Northern European country sought Nigeria's support on its bid for a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council for 2020 to 2021.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA37","Is COP24 One More Big Bust?","December 19, 2018 Wednesday 12:07 AM EST","Dissident Voice","Dec 18, 2018( Dissident Voice: HYPERLINK http://www.dissidentvoice.org http://www.dissidentvoice.org COP24 Poland just wrapped up two-weeks of climate meetings. If history is a guide, CO2 emissions will continue to accelerate until COP25 next year in Chile. Still, the delegates did adopt a rule book to put Paris '15 into action, Ahem! But, hark! There's a ray of sunshine peering out from behind the Katowice coal-clouded skyline because big money interests may be altering the landscape for combating global warming. According to reports out of Katowice1[1] global investors managing $32T issued a 'stark warning' that the world faces financial Armageddon worse than 2008 if carbon emissions are not cut, including a phase-out of coal. Wow! That sets the stage for proving/disproving the old maxim 'money talks.' If it does, there's a glimmer of hope for Miami's survival. Accordingly, some of the world's deepest pocket investors including pension funds, insurers, and asset fund managers exhibited their most impressive intervention ever by insisting that (1) fossil fuel subsidies must end and (2) substantial taxes must be slapped on carbon. According to the IMF, current subsidies for fossil fuels amount to $5T per year, which makes fossil fuel subsidies alone equivalent to some of the largest economies in the world. Ipso facto, if $5 trillion/year pivots from fossil fuel subsidies to renewable investments, just imagine the impact. By way of comparison, in 2017 total investment in renewables reached $280B. Of course, the big money interests would also be feathering their own nests by switching fossil fuel subsidies to renewables as the world economy accelerates with the thrust of a space shuttle blast-off, creating jobs, jobs, and more jobs in the Renewable Global Economy. Thus, a whole new world opens to massive infrastructure investments, accelerating global wealth creation, and the world turns clean, assuming it's not too late by the time they get serious, a big assumption, indeed. In stark contrast to that message from 415 financial institutions, ever since Paris 2015, the US, China, and Japan provided $500B in financing for new coal plants. Oops! The day after the closing of COP24 Mexico announced plans to spend $3.65B to boost crude oil production 45% by 2025. This is comparable to stabbing COP24 in the eye with a sharp stick. Nothing mentioned about renewable energy. The following statements by big money interests at Katowice tells an interesting story: 'The long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many,' said Chris Newton, of IFM Investors, which manages $80Bn and is one of the 415 groups that signed the Global Investor Statement. 'This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic.'2[2] 'Investment firm Schroders said there could be $32Tn of global economic losses a year in the long term without rapid action. This permanent economic damage would be almost four times the scale of the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis. Standard and Poor's rating agency also warned leaders: 'Climate change has already started to alter the functioning of our world.'((Ibid.)) 'Thomas DiNapoli, of the $207bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, another signatory, said taking action on global warming not only avoids damage but could boost jobs and growth. 'The low-carbon economy presents numerous opportunities and investors who ignore the changing world do so at their own peril.'2[3] Heretofore, the nations of the world have failed miserably for nearly three decades. At COPs there's always plenty of pomp and ceremony, cocktail parties, caviar, formal dinners, and millions upon millions of dollars spent staying in fancy hotels but nothing positive on CO2 emissions in 26 years, other than increasing public awareness and adding more scientific studies, all of which increasingly point to rapid deterioration of ecosystems around the world, way beyond prior estimates. This trend negatively surprises the scientific community, but it has not moved nation/states to take action. Thus, the world is at serious risk of collapsing ecosystems, which can happen with remarkable suddenness and without warning. The telltale signals are already present, as lesser species are already going extinct in all-time record numbers, 1,000-10,000 xs the normal background rate. This current rate of extinction makes the dinosaur-era extinction rate 65M yrs ago look like a walk in the park and should be taken very seriously. In point of fact, climate change/global warming has worsened considerably ever since the Kyoto protocol (1992), aka Conference of the Parties3 or COP3, which was the first agreement to mandate country-by-country reductions in greenhouse gas emissions ('GHG'). Ever since, GHGs have gone straight up (with one small hiatus), not down. Meanwhile, fossil fuel usage has remained static at approximately 80% of worldwide energy production for the past 40 years. No change, which is the perfect setup for unmitigated climate disaster. The most recent readings of CO2 shows Mauna Loa (Hawaii) CO2 @ 408.2 ppm as of November 2018 versus 405.12 ppm in November 2017. According to NASA, in 1992 when Kyoto met, CO2 was 356.42 ppm. Consider: Over the past 40,000 years, up until 200 yrs ago, CO2 was 200-300 ppm, the Holocene Age with its Goldilocks Climate not too hot, not too cold but rapidly coming to an end. Then, what? The global warming risk indicator: In 1850 human-generated CO2 was 50 million tons/yr. Nowadays, it only takes 12 hours, not a year, to put out that same 50 million tons (USGS analysis). Try that one on for size Mister Global Warming! Here's the crux of the issue that makes it nearly impossible to tackle the global warming crisis w/o US help (P.S.- the US delegation at COP24 promoted fossil fuels - honestly, they did.): 'Ten percent (10%) of the global population (hint-hint- mostly the US) are responsible for 50% of carbon emissions and twenty percent (20%) of global population are responsible for 70% of all global emissions tells us that we need to be tailoring our policies towards that small group rather than trying to squeeze the emissions out of the majority of world population who are hardly emitting anything at all if the 10% reduced their carbon footprint to the level of the average European citizen, that would be equivalent to a 1/3rd cut in global emissions, even if the other 90% did nothing for example, the average Rwanda citizen emits 0.10-0.50 tons CO2 versus the average American at 30-35 tons.'3[4] As it happens, the rate of CO2 growth is itself growing, having now reached about 2.3 ppm/yr the highest growth rate in modern times. It is not just a 'business as usual' scenario. it is worse than that, as we are movingbackwards, becoming more and more unsustainable with every year. This shows unequivocally that the efforts undertaken so far to limit GHGs are woefully inadequate. Every COP meeting since 1992 has been greeted with higher CO2 emissions than the year before, now accelerating faster than ever in paleoclimate history. That locks-in, guarantees big time troubles down the road, when least expected. Postscript: For 25 years, countless people have come to the U.N. climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions, and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise. So, I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future. I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA38","Six Takeaways From COP24 Business, Industry Day","December 10, 2018 Monday 5:47 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news: As new scientific research elucidates the need to take urgent and comprehensive climate action on the global level, business charted paths to a low-carbon economy at a major event in Katowice, Poland. At what has been billed as the most important global climate conference since the Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) three years ago, business discussed how to collectively raise climate ambition at the COP24 Business and Industry Day in Katowice. Business Day was hosted by ICC, which is the business and industry 'Focal Point' to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - making ICC the voice of business in the UN climate process. We would like to thank the partners who helped make this day possible. Here are six key takeaways from the day's discussions: 1. The time to act is now ICC's Director of Green Growth Majda Dabaghi, who leads the ICC delegation to COP24 , opened up the event, highlighting the ground-breaking report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 C of Global Warming. The report warns that urgent changes are needed to avoid the vast economic and social costs of climate change. Governments and business need to collectively ramp up plans to cut carbon emissions and the time to act is now, Ms Dabaghi said. 2. We're all in this together Many of the day's speakers from both the public and private sectors expressed the fundamental need for collective action in raising climate ambition. At COP23 last year, the Fijian host government introduced the world to the concept of 'Talanoa', referring to the country's national tradition of inclusive and constructive dialogue. ""We all need to work together to tackle climate change. Working in coalitions is key to succeed. That's the spirit of the Talanoa Dialogue we launched at COP23 under the Fijian presidency,"" said Inia Seruiratu, Fiji's Climate Champion. 3. Climate action is a business opportunity In one of the day's most engaging presentations, Bertrand Piccard, the Initiator and Chairman of Solar Impulse, delivered a powerful speech without even mentioning the phrase 'climate change, because ""building energy efficient and environmental friendly solutions is the biggest business opportunity of the century"". 4. Delivering the Paris Rulebook will empower companies for good ""If you could say one thing to governments here at COP24 , what would be it be?"" Ms Dabaghi asked before one panel discussion closed. The responses from the business leaders speaking were remarkably clear. Enabling policy frameworks and delivering the 'Paris Rulebook' - an implementing framework that shows how governments plan on reaching Paris Agreement goals - are key to giving companies the certainty they need to take ambitious climate action. 5. We need to talk about gender A powerful series of remarks also came from Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg, Director of African Women in Agriculture, in Kenya. Ms Kamau-Rutenberg explained that it is impossible to talk about climate adaptation in Africa without talking about agriculture - and the way African agriculture is produced is very gendered. In Africa, women play a central role in agricultural production. Climate discussions thus need to link both to agriculture and gender. 6. We can increase climate-friendly investment if we protect it In the final Business Day panel, Wendy Miles, Partner at Debevoise &#38; Plimpton and Vice-Chair of the ICC International Court of Arbitration, offered an overview of how contractual arrangements and dispute resolution can help to give companies the certainty they need to pursue both climate change mitigation and adaptation investment opportunities.

On Sunday, the United Nations will kick off critical negotiations on how to address the problem collectively and urgently, during a two-week climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, known as ' COP24 '. IOM/Amanda Nero A boy watches the shore from a boat near Sirajganj, a community affected by severe erosion that has left many displaced. Sirajganj, Bangladesh. October 2016Thousands of world leaders, experts, activists, creative thinkers, and private sector and local community representatives will gather to work on a collective action plan to realize critical commitments made by all the countries of the world in Paris, three years ago. UN News put together this guide to COP 24 to answer some of the biggest questions you may have and make sure you're all caught up, with a ringside seat on the action.1. The basics: UNFCCC, UNEP, WMO, IPCC, COP 24 , Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement... can someone please make sense of all this? These acronyms and place names all represent international tools and terms that, under the leadership of the UN, were created to help advance climate action globally. They all play a specific and different role in focussing us all on achieving environmental sustainability. Here's how it fits together: In 1992, the UN organised a major event in Rio de Janeiro called the Earth Summit, in which theUN Framework Convention on Climate Change[2](UNFCCC[3]) was adopted. In this treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere' to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories. Every year since the treaty entered into force in 1994, a 'conference of the parties' - a COP - is held to discuss how to move forward and, since there have been 23 COPs so far, this year's will be the 24th, or ' COP 24 '. Because the UNFCCC had non-binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and no enforcement mechanism, various 'extensions' to this treaty were negotiated during these COPs, including: the famousKyoto Protocol[4]in 1997, which defined emission limits for developed nations to be achieved by 2012; and theParis Agreement[5], adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing. Two agencies support the scientific work of the UN on climate change: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP[6]) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO[7]). Together, they set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC[8]) in 1988, which is made of hundreds of experts, dedicated to assessing data and providing reliable scientific evidence for the climate action negotiations, including the upcoming ones in Katowice. 2. The UN seems to be having a lot of conferences and summits on this subject Is any of it, well...fruitful? These meetings have been vital to find a global consensus on an issue that requires a global solution. Although progress has been much slower than needed, the process  which has been as challenging as it is ambitious - has worked to bring all countries with very different circumstances, together. Progress has been made every step of the way. Some of the concrete actions taken so far prove one thing: climate action has a real positive impact and can truly help us prevent the worst. Here are some notable achievements so far: -At least 57 countries[9]have managed to bring their greenhouse gas emissions down to the levels required to curb global warming. - There are at least51 'carbon pricing' initiatives[10]in the works; charging those who emit carbon dioxide per tonne emitted. - In 2015,18 high-income countries[11]committed to donating US$100 billion a year for climate action in developing countries. So far, over $70 billion have been mobilised. 3. Why is everyone talking about the Paris Agreement? The Paris document - which provides the world with the only viable option for addressing climate change - has beenratified by 184 parties[12], and entered into force in November 2016. The commitments contained in it are significant: - Limit global average temperature rise to well below 2C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. - Ramp up financing for climate action, including the annual $100 billion goal from donor nations for lower-income countries. - Develop national climate plans by 2020, including their self-determined goals and targets. - Protect beneficial ecosystems that absorb greenhouse gases, including forests. - Strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. - Finalize a work programme to implement the agreement in 2018. The United States, which joined the Agreement in 2016, announced its intention in July 2017, to withdraw from it. However, the nation remains a party to the Agreement at least until November 2020, which is the earliest that it can legally request to withdraw from it. 4. Why is +1.5C a critical line? According toscientific research assessed by the IPCC[13], keeping global warming to no more than 1.5C global average over pre-industrial levels, will help stave off devastating permanent damage to the planet and its people, including: the irreversibleloss of habitat[14]for animals in the Arctic and Antarctic; much more frequent instances of deadly extreme heat[15];water scarcity[16]that could affect over 300 million people; thedisappearance of coral reefs[17]which are essential for entire communities and marine life; sea level rise which is threatening the future and economy of entiresmall island nations[18], etc. All in all, the UN estimates that 420 million fewer people could be affected by climate change if we manage to stick to a 1.5C increase, instead of 2C. We are still far from turning the corner toward a carbon-neutral future, and the need to move forward is greater than ever. The data tells us it is still possible to limit climate change to 1.5C, but the window of opportunity is closing and it will require unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. 5. So why is COP 24 important? This year's COP in Katowice, Poland, is particularly crucial because 2018 is the deadline that the signatories of the Paris Agreement agreed upon in order to adopt a work programme for the implementation of the Paris commitments. This requires the singular most important ingredient: trust between all countries. Among the many elements that need to be ironed out is the financing of climate action worldwide. Because the clock is ticking on climate change, the world cannot afford to waste more time: we must collectively agree on a bold, decisive, ambitious and accountable way forward. The discussions will be based on scientific evidence gathered over the years and assessed by experts. Namely and primarily the following reports: - October's 'wake up call'Report on Global Warming of 1.5 C[19], by the IPCC. -2018 Emissions Gap Report[20], by UNEP. -2018 Bulletin on greenhouse gas concentrations[21], by the WMO. -2018 Ozone Depletion Assessment[22], by the WMO and UNEP. 7.

As the UN is mainstreaming environmental sustainability across is work, UN News has been highlighting some examples of projects, supported by UNEP or the UN Development Programme (UNDP), that show the pathway to climate action: inrural eastern Europe[29], farmers and entrepreneurs can cut emissions, one bog at a time; in theLake Chad region[30], tens of thousands of drought-resistant trees are being planted; inGuatemala[31], the reintroduction of smallholder cocoa production in Guatemala is helping address both economic and environmental problems; inBhutan[32], the power of traditional knowledge is being harnessed to support livelihoods and nature preservation; inTimor-Leste[33], a new generation of green infrastructure is being built; in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo[34], small behavioural change is leading to great impact. 10. Why is the UN also planning a Climate Change Summit in 2019? To build on the outcomes of COP 24 , and to strengthen climate action and ambition at the highest possible levels, UNSecretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres[35]is convening aClimate Change Summit[36]next September. In advance of the 2020 deadline for countries to finalize their national climate plans, the Summit is designed to focus on practical initiatives to limit emissions and build resilience. The Summit will focus on driving action in six areas: transition to renewable energy; funding of climate action and carbon pricing; reducing emissions from industry; using nature as a solution; sustainable cities and local action; and climate change resilience.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA40","ARE STATES AFFECTED BY CONFERENCES LIKE COP24?","March 12, 2019 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the National Conference of State Legislatures: By Kim Tyrrell and Riley Hutchings As state legislatures continue to deal with the impact of changing weather patterns that are producing increasingly ferocious hurricanes, tornados, snowstorms and wildfires, climate conferences such as COP24 can highlight additional factors to be considered during legislative debates. Since 1992, when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was ratified, parties to it have met in a new city each year to negotiate agreements, exchange ideas, announce progress or renew commitments. Between Dec. 3 and Dec. 16, 2018, 30,000 people gathered in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC ( COP24 ) to negotiate details of the Paris Agreement, which was ratified in 2015 at COP21. The Paris Agreement provides a framework for its 198 signatories, including the United States, to approach mitigation, adaptation, finance and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, parties committed to submitting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years that outline specific targets and timetables according to common but differentiated responsibilities and each nation's respective capabilities. Negotiating teams at COP24 set out to finalize a rulebook that would set detailed guidelines for parties to write their NDCs. Although the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, it remains a party to the agreement until Nov. 4, 2020, at the earliest because of stipulations in the text. The U.S. sent an official delegation of 35 people to COP24 , which consisted of scientists, foreign service officers, environmental lawyers and communications specialists. Judith Garber, principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs at the Department of State, led the delegation. Taken in whole, the events of COP24 have widespread social and economic implications for states, regardless of whether the U.S. remains a party to the Paris Agreement. Key considerations for states Changes in the climate affect affordable access to clean water, nutritious food, reliable energy and resilient infrastructure. Indigenous nations and low-income and minority populations are likely to be the first and most severely hurt by changes in the environment. The global movement to mitigate and adapt to anticipated changes in the environment is influencing government policies in at least 198 countries. States will be affected by those policies as standards, preferences and entire markets change. As grids transition toward variable energy sources, they must continue to provide reliable and affordable electricity. U.S. Energy Administration data reveals that in 2016, 78 percent of U.S. energy subsidies went to fossil fuels, a number that has steadily risen since 2010. If other countries continue to incentivize renewable adoption and global use of fossil fuels declines, economic growth could be stunted. Several states have taken steps to address some of these key considerations. For example: Arizona's House and Senate chambers have current resolutions pending that call for members of the legislature to commit to working constructively with the governor to create and support economically viable and broadly supported private and public solutions to manage climate change, including in rural communities. The resolution calls on the state to prioritize its understanding and use of science to address the causes of a changing climate and support innovation and environmental stewardship to realize positive outcomes. In Nebraska, Legislative Bill 83 (2019) calls on the University of Nebraska to develop an evidence-based, data-driven, strategic action plan to provide methods for adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change. As states face the uncertainties of a changing climate, collecting and analyzing data may help guide investments in mitigation and adaptation. Kim Tyrrell is director of NCSL's Environment Program. Riley Hutchings is a senior at Colorado College and former NCSL intern. \"

COP24 will take place in Katowice, Poland beginning Sunday, December 2nd and closing on December 14th. COP24 , May Boeve, Executive Director of 350.org, issued the following statement: ""Trump's COP24 coal convention is a disgraceful clown show. As the world transitions away from coal, oil, and gas, fossil fuel CEOs and their political puppets are trying to keep us hooked. Meanwhile, communities here at home -- from California to Puerto Rico and more -- are attempting to rebuild from devastating and worsening fires and storms. ""Last week's National Climate Assessment doubled down on IPCC warnings: the climate crisis is already here, and the costs are being paid for in our lives and livelihoods. Instead of propping up sunset industry, we should be investing in a Green New Deal that prioritizes frontline and coal-communities, nurtures a livable planet, and creates millions of good jobs in the process. ""Led by Indigenous Peoples, youth, and frontline communities, people across the US are already hard at work building real solutions to the climate crisis: from solar panels in the path of Keystone XL, to offshore wind, and a community-owned solar plant in Brooklyn. In the face of a federal administration exploiting our health and safety, we need to pressure elected officials at all levels to take action at the scale of the crisis; that means stopping all fossil fuel projects and transitioning to 100% renewables for all."" The UN Summit is a key opportunity for governments to respond to October's IPCC Report (the UN climate science panel), which shows we must stop all fossil fuel projects to meet the 1.5 Degree Celsius goal set in Paris. Organizations across the US, including 350.org, are using the opportunity to highlight the People's Demands for Climate Justice. Globally, 350.org will use COP24 to highlight specific fossil fuel projects that must be stopped, as well as examples of real climate action taking place in Eastern Europe, in financial markets, and across the world.

The fashion industry emits more greenhouse gas than all international flights and maritime shipping journeys combined, and it's estimated that a garbage truck's worth of clothing is either burned or sent to a landfill every second. On top of that, thanks to our powerful washing machines, our clothes pollute the ocean with microfibers equating to approximately 50 million plastic bottles each year. Conversation and action around sustainability and climate change has been quiet and slow to come within the sector, but Monday marks another move toward collective change. A fashion industry charter for climate action was formally launched at this year's United Nations climate change conference , COP24 , in Katowice, Poland. Support for the new charter has come from high street retailers, luxury fashion houses and other suppliers within the sector. Stella McCartney, Burberry, Adidas and H&M Group are included in the list of 40 signatories. Stella McCartney, whose eponymous label is already a leading player in sustainable fashion, was one of the founding signatories. She announced her involvement in late November during Voices, a fashion industry conference staged in the English countryside, where she was also honored for her work in the sector. During an interview at the conference, she acknowledged the complexities of working sustainably and responsibly: ""There are millions of limitations from a design and creative point of view. There are millions of limitations from a sourcing and manufacturing point of view. But for me, all of those challenges are part of being a designer and part of being a businesswoman."" McCartney called upon her peers in the industry to sign the charter, urging the industry to work together. ""It's a no-brainer but there has to be a collective conversation,"" she said. ""I think that's what's so powerful and exciting and promising about COP24 ."" \"

In particular, the Minister and his Department officials will participate in ""Act!on Agriculture"" events which aims to explore how governments, agriculture businesses and others are pushing the frontier of agriculture evolution. ""Act!on Agriculture"" is a series of events to share knowledge of best practice in agriculture production. The Minister outlined, ""Agriculture is Ireland's largest indigenous industry. We are therefore rightly situated to talk of our experiences in such a global forum as this in terms of how we are endeavoring to balance agriculture's food and environmental credentials."" The Minister will also participate in an EU high-level event entitled ""The possible role of agriculture in long term decarbonisation seen from different perspectives"" this evening. The Minister stated: ""I look forward to working constructively with European colleagues in developing a vision for a climate smart agriculture that meets our future need for food while limiting its impact on climate."" Minister Creed said: ""A significant decision on agriculture was reached at COP 23 recognising the role of agriculture in tackling climate change and achieving the Paris Climate Agreement, including improved soil carbon, soil health, soil fertility and improves livestock systems."" This decision (known as the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture) is a major step to help create an enabling environment for countries and non-state actors to conduct activities in the agricultural sectors that are key to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The first discussions on content are happening as part of COP24 and it is important for Ireland to support this work. While Irish agricultural production is recognised by independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon-footprints internationally, in recent years there has seen an increase in overall emissions. Reducing emissions is challenging and it is a challenge the sector must engage with. The Minister stated: ""While we already have an efficient and productive agricultural system, there is no room for complacency - we must and can continue to make improvements in terms of sustainability and environmental performance on all our farms.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA45","As Talks Get Underway at COP24, MERCOSUR Ministers of Health Commit to Prioritize Health in Climate Change Adaptation Plans","December 10, 2018 Monday 1:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The United Nations Pan American Health Organization issued the following news release: Ministers of Health from MERCOSUR and Associated States have signed a declaration to place health at the front and center of national climate change adaptation plans. This aims to ensure that health systems become climate resilient, and that health prevention and promotion are fully integrated with climate services, as per recommendations from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The declaration was signed at the XLIII Meeting of Health Ministers of MERCOSUR and Associated States, which took place on 23 November in Montevideo, Oriental Republic of Uruguay. It comes at a time when leaders from all over the world are gathering at the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. There, countries will discuss the implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to coordinate informational efforts to reduce global warming. ""Climate change has increasingly become a huge threat to both health systems and public health in the Region of the Americas."" Climate change has been deemed ""the biggest global health threat of the 21st century."" Indeed, climate and weather impact health in a variety of ways, including via extreme weather and disasters, heatwaves, food and water contamination, and an increase in vector-borne diseases. Climate and weather changes also impact socioeconomic systems which can affect public health, including through food and water insecurity, resource scarcity and forced displacements. ""Climate change has increasingly become a huge threat to both health systems and public health in the Region of the Americas,"" said Dr. Marcos Espinal, Director of Communicable Diseases and Environmental Determinants of Health at PAHO. ""It is vital that countries in the Region commit to fully integrating health into all their climate change adaptation plans. The Mercosur declaration is a great example of this commitment."" Impacts of climate change on health are already being felt throughout the Americas. Rising temperatures can provoke heat stroke, particularly in the elderly, and increase the duration of droughts and the risk of wildfires. Over the past two years alone, more than 200,000 people in the Americas were displaced as a result of forest fires, and millions of dollars incurred in structural damages. Rising temperatures also increase the number of intense tropical storms and floods hitting the Region, with 335 climate-related disasters occurring between 2005 and 2014, a 14% increase from the previous decade. In 2017, more than 625,000 people were affected by intense rains in Peru, and over 270 deaths were registered in Colombia due to mudslides. Climate change is also likely to expand the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases. PAHO is working to support regional initiatives and actions on climate change and health, including through the provision of capacity building and technical support for multi-hazard early warning systems, and on the preparation of Health National Adaptation Plans to Climate Change (N-NAPs). PAHO is also supporting the health sector to lead by example, through sustainable procurement and the implementation of ""Smart"" health care facilities, which aim to increase their resilience to disasters while reducing their environmental impact. The Mercosur declaration The Mercosur declaration commits Ministries of Health of member countries to lead the development of health strategies as essential elements of National Climate Change Adaptation Plans (H-NAPs). These strategies focus on recognizing health vulnerabilities relating to climate change and propose ways to increase health system resilience and reduce inequalities. The declaration also commits countries to generate evidence on health and climate change in order to develop indicators, facilitate information exchange and inform decision-making. Health and climate change at COP24 COP24 is taking place in Katowice, Poland, from 3-14 December 2018. The primary aim of the Conference is to come to a consensus on how countries should implement the Paris Agreement and report their progress. On 5 December, the World Health Organization launched its report - COP 24 Special Report: Health and Climate Change. This Report highlighted that while there has been positive progress in tackling health and climate change issues, there is still a long way to go. The report provides a series of recommendations for governments on how to maximize the health benefits of tackling climate change and avoid the worst health impacts of this global challenge.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA46","#COP24 - Poland, Europe, and coal: trolling or misunderstanding?","December 18, 2018 Tuesday 12:55 PM EST","EU Reporter","Dec 18, 2018( EU Reporter: HYPERLINK http://www.eureporter.co http://www.eureporter.co COP24 , international media coverage has harshly criticized the event's Polish hosts for their 'provocative[1]' spotlighting of Poland's coal industry and broader 'coal addiction[2]'. The controversies in Katowice have re-ignited tensions between Poland and the European Union over emissions targets, energy transitions, and the country's enduring reliance on coal power. Beneath the surface, however, they may also help representatives from the industrialized countries at the event better appreciate just how much of a sacrifice they are asking their counterparts from the world's emerging markets to make, writes Louis Auge. Located in the coal mining region of Silesia, Katowice was always going to be a controversial choice for the COP24 climate talks. Michal Kurtyka, the COP24 's president and a state secretary in Poland's Ministry of Energy, described[3] the decision to bring the conference to Katowice as a strategic attempt to put on display a city and region that is being asked to transition away from its lifeblood. While outside criticisms of Poland are severe, a closer look at the domestic context explains the country's enduring attachment to coal power. Coal accounts for 80%[4] of Poland's electricity generation and employs 85,000 people, serving as a key pillar of an economy that has only been considered 'developed[5]' as of the past three months. These factors are critical to understanding Warsaw's opposition to the European Union's carbon emissions reduction aims and decarbonization plans. While most of Europe expects[6] to be coal-free by 2025, Poland recently announced[7] it expects coal to meet 60% of its energy needs in 2030. As Kuryka put it[8]: 'How does one tell a region of 5 million people - in over 70 cities across the region - to just move on, your world is that of the past?' Of course, Poland is hardly the only COP24 participant that relies on coal to meet its energy needs. In fact, the Poles are merely saying loudly what a number of emerging economies have been telling the international community for years. Key players in the global climate debate, including India and China but also the ASEAN countries and major economies in sub-Saharan Africa, rely on coal and will continue to do so for decades to come. While coal has been dying out in other parts of the world, Southeast Asia's appetite for coal has been on the rise. With an aim to achieve universal access to electricity by the early 2030s, and a projected 60% increase[9] in energy use by 2040, coal power is expected to account for 40% of the growth in energy demand in the region. Not only does Asia currently account for three-quarters[10] of global coal consumption, but three-fourths of coals plants either in the planning stages or under construction are located in Asia. Even in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touted himself as a proponent of clean energy, the government continues to build coal mines and plants. As an affordable and easily accessible energy source, coal is the bedrock of the power grid in a country where up to 400 million people[11] still lack access to reliable electricity. Switching away from coal presents unique challenges for emerging countries, most of which are still working towards providing their citizens with reliable electricity. 'With the Germans, they can say 'We're moving from driving a Corolla to a BMW', while we are still trying to get the bicycle,' said[12] Themisile Majola, South Africa's deputy energy minister. 'They're talking about different technologies, we're talking about access.' Recent comments by World Bank president Jim Yong Kim helped highlight this dichotomy between industrialized and emerging economies, with the developing world facing energy shortages and resenting outside pressure not to exploit coal. As Kim encapsulated[13] the arguments put forth by developing countries: 'You've come to us in Africa who have put almost none of the carbon in the air and you can tell us we can't have baseload electricity. You're outraged by climate change, we have almost no responsibility for putting the carbon in the air and yet you're telling us we can't develop and have baseload energy because we can't use a single drop of fossil fuel for our own energy needs. And I can tell you, when I hear that from our leaders, from people in industry, in places like Africa, it's compelling to me.' What, then, are the ways forward for those COP24 participants who see greater urgency to reduce carbon emissions? One avenue is to dedicate greater focus to carbon capture and utilization[14] (CCU) or storage[15] (CCS) technologies. These can both reduce emissions from coal plants around the planet and reduce them from other industrial sources. Simply put, CCS is a process of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it, whereas in CCU, the CO2 is used to make other substances, like plastics, concrete or biofuel. Another path forward: working closer to home. Coal has become the global fossil fuel bogeyman, but oil and natural gas are also largely responsible[16] for failures to meet global emissions goals. The continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions, even as coal power generation declines across much of Europe and North America, has been attributed to a stronger demand for natural gas and oil due to cheaper gas prices and people driving longer distances. The activists and groups criticizing Poland for its attitude at the COP24 , or pressuring countries in Asia and Africa to switch technologies they are not necessarily equipped to adopt, may want to spend some of their energy lobbying their neighbours to take up less-polluting forms of transportation. Western environmentalists may ultimately have an easier time getting their compatriots out of their cars than asking Asians and Africans to make energy sacrifices they can ill-afford.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA47","Climate Emergency Demands Action, and COP24 Must Deliver Ambition","December 10, 2018 Monday 7:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Greenpeace Canada issued the following news release: As the UN climate talks in Poland entered their second week, Greenpeace activists projected a message to world leaders at COP24 demanding urgent action to turn the tide on the worsening climate emergency. Activists projected the words: 'Politicians Talk, Leaders Act' and 'No Hope Without Climate Action' onto the roof of the COP24 venue, the Spodek, in Katowice. The activity took place as the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights dawned in the Asia-Pacific region, where some of the world's most climate vulnerable people are calling for countries to align their national climate action targets with the 1.5 C target. Greenpeace Canada Climate &#38; Energy Senior Strategist, Keith Stewart, said: ""While there are some bright spots, Canada's current efforts fall far short of what scientists and doctors are telling us is required to protect our health and meet our commitments under the Paris climate agreement. Rather than finding new ways to prop up the oil industry, Canada needs to implement climate solutions that are as big as the problem. This requires great public transit and vehicles powered by 100 percent renewable energy; homes, offices and factories that produce as much clean energy as they use; durable products that aren't thrown away moments after purchase; and genuine progress on Indigenous reconciliation. We need a Green New Deal."" Greenpeace International's head of delegation at COP24 in Katowice (Poland), Jens Mattias Clausen said: COP24 , but for the world, to deliver the kind of climate action we're in desperate need of. This is a climate emergency and only through a shared commitment to action will we prevent a system collapse. ""There's no excuse for divisions not to be bridged here in Katowice. While a lot of politicians talk about climate action, their words fail to inspire hope and ring like empty promises in the COP24 corridors unless they stand up and be counted. ""What we need is a strong commitment to ramp up the current grossly insufficient climate plans by 2020 at latest, a strong set of rules to govern action and real money for real action so that we get to work rescuing our climate. Those who irresponsibly fail to deliver or negligently try and block climate action will be held accountable.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA48","Ahead of COP24, Schneider Electric strengthens its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030; - The Group will present innovative solutions to fight climate c....","December 3, 2018 Monday 5:00 PM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire At a time when the latest IPCC report calls for urgent action to fight climate change,Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, is accelerating its contribution to meeting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. To mark the occasion of COP24 in Katowice (Poland), from December 3\~to\~14, 2018, Schneider Electric is strengthening its commitments to become carbon neutral by 2030 using solutions that will help accelerate the transition towards a low carbon economy. Carbon neutral by 2030 ""The climate emergency is growing, and new players are emerging to tackle the issue. The Paris Agreement signed three years ago provides us with a much clearer understanding of what is at stake. We're now at a tipping point in limiting global warming to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels to avoid a major ecological disaster"", says Gilles Vermot Desroches, Sustainability Senior VP at Schneider Electric. In November 2015, on the eve of COP21, Schneider Electric announced its plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. To mark the occasion of COP24 , Schneider Electric is stepping up its ambition and strengthening its commitments to fighting climate change, based on three complementary initiatives: 1.\~\~\~\~Before 2020: meet the 21 new commitments of the 2018-2020Schneider Sustainability Impactbarometer, outline a specific trajectory based on the assumption that Earth will breach the 2\'b0C warming limit by 2050 and validate it through theScience Based Targetsinitiative, signed by the Group in 2016. 2.\~\~\~\~Achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 at its plants and sites, in a cohesive industry ecosystem encompassing both suppliers and clients. To that aim, the Group will quantify carbon emissions saved by its customers thanks to its EcoStruxure offers switch to 100% renewable electricity, use 100% recyclable or reusable packaging, and recover 100% of its industrial waste and double its energy productivity against a 2005 baseline. 3.\~\~\~\~Starting today and by 2050: cut its scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions by more than 50% vs. 2015, in line with the guiding principles of the Science Based Targets initiative. Building a sustainable future together, thanks to energy efficiency ""The decisions we make today are critical to ensuring a safe and sustainable world for everyone, both now and in the future. At Schneider Electric, we believe that sustainability\~and\~innovation\~is technologically possible today. COP24 , in Poland this year, is an opportunity for us to demonstrate our contribution through solutions that are a genuine remedy for climate change and to show how we can help meet the United Nations' 17\~Sustainable Development Goals"", said Gilles Vermot Desroches. What is good for the climate is good for the economy. Schneider Electric's solutions help accelerate the transition towards a low carbon economy offering numerous opportunities, from sustainable growth to job creation, improved public health and more. A number of Schneider Electric projects in Poland demonstrate this: Schneider Electric completed an electrical distribution modernization of the Saint Gobain glass factory in Dabrowa G\'f3rnicza in 2017. The replacement and optimization of transformers, thanks to EcoSruxure Power Consulting Services, led to a 16% drop in energy losses (OPEX) in 2018 as well as a 30% drop in capital expenditure. Schneider Electric has also equipped the International Conference Center of Katowice, where COP24 will take place, and the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra Hall, location of the opening concert, with building energy management systems that significantly reduce their energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. Addressing energy poverty and the climate emergency COP 24 , theSchneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Foundation de France, together with social entrepreneurship organization Ashoka, will pursue this commitment to tackling fuel poverty in Europe by launching a new call for projects for 2019. Climate change is another key issue, as many people have already been forced to leave their homes due to extreme natural disasters. Those situations call for mobile, clean, reliable and affordable energy access solutions. At COP24 , Schneider Electric will launch its Villaya Emergency solution for easier access to energy in emergency situations. This solar microgrid solution is ready to use in any situation thanks to a system combining Schneider Electric technologies and the expertise of innovative start-ups. The entire solution is fitted into a standard shipping container for fast, easy transportation or relocation to anywhere worldwide. Schneider Electric at COP24 COP24 will bring together around 20,000 participants (political leaders and representatives from NGOs, business and science and research) from more than 190 countries, all working to accelerate the implementation of solutions by 2020. Schneider Electric's experts and executives will participate in a series of events and round tables. About Schneider Electric Schneider Electric is leading the Digital Transformation of Energy Management and Automation in Homes, Buildings, Data Centers, Infrastructure and Industries.With global presence in over 100 countries, Schneider is the undisputable leader in Power Management - Medium Voltage, Low Voltage and Secure Power, and in Automation Systems.

Experts warn that participants at the COP24 conference in Poland have to deliver on previous pledges.""We are the most vulnerable, we are the least responsible but we will suffer the most,"" Seyni Nafo, spokesman of the African delegation at the World Climate Conference summed up in an interview with DW. The African continent is already experiencing the effects of climate change. In many places drought, torrential rainfall or flooding are regular occurrences.The damage done amounts to five and 10 percent of individual countries' Gross Domestic Product.(GDP) ""The person on the street does not see the impact of what is decided at the COP meetings. But people are seeing the real impact of global warming every day,"" said Nigerian environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey.Read more: Crunch time for the climate at COP24Pledges must be fulfilledThe worst is still to come, the UN warns. In 2020 up to 250 million people could be affected by serious water shortages as a result of rising temperatures. If the rise exceeds two degrees Celcius, half the population of Africa could be affected by malnutrition. ""Climate change has the potential to destroy our development,"" Nafo warns. The hope is that the COP24 conference in Poland can be a launchpad for meaningful action. Delegates from all over the world have converged on the city of Katowice. For James Murombedzi, a climate expert with the UN Economic Commission for Africa, this is the most important climate conference so far. The goal is to reach agreement on a detailed set of rules that would implement the decisions taken at the Paris conference of 2015. Global warming, it was agreed, should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celcius. This can only succeed if emissions of greenhouse gases cease entirely from 2050 onwards - and they must be drastically reduced in the years leading up to that deadline. However, experts agree that measures taken so far by the international community fall far short of that goal. Mandatory measures are needed, they say. Read more: Greens: Don't delay ambitious climate actionFunds to adapt to climate changeHigh on the agenda of the African delegation is also a second pledge made in Paris, namely that poor countries would receive financial help to enable them to adapt to climate change. Starting in 2020 rich industrial nations are expected to pay an annual amount of 100 billion US dollars. Here, too, no concrete commitments have been made. For negotiator Seyni Nafo, it is vital to ensure that the funds agreed are made available.For some experts, the sum of 100 billion dollars is not enough. Africa is dependent on agriculture and measures must be taken to ensure climate damage is kept to a minimum. More investment in irrigation systems is needed, says UN expert Murombedzi. For Nnimmo Bassey, this is not a question of charity or benevolence but of justice. 'The planet is burning'Can these goals really be achieved? The US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, although, as Seyni Nafo puts it: ""Climate change is a common problem and we can only find a common solution."" He adds optimistically: ""We see great interest in many countries in salvaging the multilateral process, in salvaging the outcome of Paris."" There is no guarantee of success for COP24 . Fighting climate change means changing the way economic systems function and changing the lifestyle of entire societies, particularly where consumer behavior and mobility are concerned, says Murombedzi. ""Especially in the highly developed countries, there appears to be not enough political will to take on necessary costs.""Nnimmo Bassey is also skeptical about the chances of COP24 marking a new beginning. ""I hope the delegates, both ministers and technocrats, will actually begin to talk from their hearts and not just from political considerations. If that is not done, it will be just another COP and it will be like fiddling while the planet burns."" Abu-Bakarr Jalloh contributed to this article \"

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki acknowledgeas that coal is very important to the Polish economy, referring to it as ""our black gold.""Coal provides about 80 percent of Poland's electricity, compared to an average of 30 percent among International Energy Agency member countries. And even though coal is responsible for about half of global CO2 emissions worldwide, Poland, along with other coal-dependent countries is grappling with trying to adapt to cutting emissions. However, Polish representatives have been completely quiet on one of the key objectives of COP24 [2]- reducing the use of fossil fuels, and a collective decision to revise and increase all climate pledges by 2020. Perhaps more importantly, they have also failed to state their support for the need to increase the EU's climate targets, undermining the EU's leadership role in the negotiations. Guests arriving at the COP24 UN climate change conference in Poland today were greeted in the lobby by a coal-miners band XAPEjiZee8  Notes from Poland (@notesfrompoland) December 3, 2018[3]On the opening day of the conference, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that there was ""no contradiction between burning coal and climate protection and that Poland had no intention to phase out coal,"" claiming incorrectly that it has 200 years of coal reserves, according to a UN Climate Action report.[4] Coal and more coal plus a shameful awardOn Tuesday November 27,[5] the Polish environmental minister announced that the state-owned coal company along with energy companies PGE and Tauron both of which lean heavily on coal to produce power would be partners with the conference. To make their point that coal is vital to society, coal, lots of coal is to be found inside the Polish exhibition hall, including a band made up of coal miners [6]who greeting conference-goers as they come inside from the outside air, thick with coal-fired power plant haze.

On Tuesday, Poland won the shameful Fossil of the Day Award from Climate Action Network International. The dubious award was handed down to Poland for promoting coal interests and turning a blind eye to the need to ramp up climate pledges by 2020. While Poland says it is trying to turn away from coal, it's not happening fast enough for many people. ""The government targets are not in line with the Paris Agreement,"" Client Earth's Ilona J drasik told CNN.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA51","COP24: Sitting down to take a stand for real climate action","December 15, 2018 Saturday 2:07 PM EST","Mongabay News","Dec 15, 2018( Mongabay News: HYPERLINK http://news.mongabay.com http://news.mongabay.com That they still haven't been able to agree over how to move ahead with a pact they signed three years ago grates on Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old from Sweden. 'I think I'm doing more good sitting here than being inside the negotiation room,' she tells Mongabay. Despite her diminutive stature and shy demeanor, Thunberg has captured the world's attention at the U.N. talks here in Poland, formally known as the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ). She's been sitting in an act of protest against politicians and policymakers who she says have failed to act swiftly to humanity's greatest threat, and says they're 'behaving like children.' Her protests didn't start at COP24 . Thunberg began cutting class back home to sit outside the Swedish parliament to protest against what she saw as a lack of ambitious climate actions by her government. This year, Sweden experienced its hottest summer since records began 262 years ago, with heat waves and wildfires roiling the country. 'I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future,' read the leaflets that she handed out during her school strike. Thunberg says she believes that developed countries like Sweden should be held accountable for burning fossil fuels to grow their economies and bear more responsibility for tackling climate change compared to developing countries. 'We have higher emissions, we need to reduce emissions,' she says. 'We need to do that to give a chance to developing countries to improve their standard of living. For example, buildings and infrastructures. How can we expect developing countries to care about climate change if we, who already have everything, don't care?' The frankness of her arguments has inspired school strike movements around the world, with more than 20,000 students joining in, from Australia, Britain, Belgium, the United States and Japan. It's also resulted in Thunberg being named one of the most influential teens[1] of 2018 by Time magazine. 'I've learned that you're never too small to make a difference,' she says. 'And if a few people can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we all could do together if we really wanted to.'Greta Thunberg, the founder of the school strike movement, sits in protest on the final day of the U.N. climate talks in Katowice, Poland. Image by Hans Nicholas Jong/Mongabay.It's a message that Thunberg says the leaders and policymakers gathered in Katowice need to hear. This year's climate talks have been dubbed the most important since the Paris summit in 2015. They come on the heels of a U.N. scientific report that warns there are only 12 years left to halve global greenhouse gas emissions to have a chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) to avoid catastrophic climate-induced disasters. Thunberg says she didn't make the 1,600-kilometer (1,000-mile) trip (by electric car) to beg the COP24 delegates to take action. Instead, she says, she's here to tell them that change is coming, regardless of what they do. In her speech at the conference's plenary session on Dec. 12, she didn't mince her words when she told world leaders that she had zero belief in them to save the planet from catastrophic climate change. 'We have not come here to beg world leaders to care,' she said[2] as reported by Democracy Now. 'You have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. You have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know changes are coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.' She also demanded that they stop ruining the future of young people. 'You say you love your children above all else, and yet you're stealing their future in front of their very eyes,' she said in her speech. And as the climate negotiations entered their final day on Dec. 14 with a deal over the Paris Agreement guidelines still not in sight, Thunberg has called on other students to follow her in her footsteps. 'We are week two of negotiations here, and as of now, there are no sign of commitments to climate actions,' she said in a video[3] that had been watched more than 130,000 times on Twitter as of Dec. 14. 'This Friday, Dec. 14, I am calling for an international climate strike. Please strike with us to let them know we demand climate action.' The call was heeded, with students from 16 schools in Poland and from 14 cities in Germany striking on Friday. Thirty 30 students from schools in Katowice were granted special access to enter the U.N. talks and carry their message to the delegates and Polish government: with only 12 years left to get the world off fossil fuels, leaders must act now.A group of students from Katowice stages a protest inside the Spodek conference venue during COP24 . Image by Hans Nicholas Jong/Mongabay.Ma gorzata Czachowska, 15, was among those who joined the protest. She said she was inspired by Thunberg to hold politicians accountable for their inaction. 'I'm here to support Greta because what she did was amazing,' she said during the protest. 'She inspired many people, she's very brave and she's an example that one person could do a lot.' But unlike Thunberg, who is skeptical that the climate negotiations will yield any results, Ma gorzata says she's crossing her fingers that the negotiations don't fail. If they do, then 'I will watch how we destroy our world,' she says. 'Some people, maybe those from poor countries, will die, and with them, their cultures will die as well, including many species.' Young people like Thunberg and Czachowska symbolize a growing youth movement to combat climate change, with young people having a greater presence than ever at this year's climate talks. The third day of the talks was called Youth and Future Generations Day[4], dedicated entirely to showcasing children- and youth-focused climate action. Young climate activists spoke at press conferences. It's this kind of pressure from a wider cross-section of society that many say was missing at past climate negotiations. As her movement grows around the world, Thunberg implores young people to keep up the momentum and be even more vocal in their demands for action. 'I think it's great that they're making their voices heard and we need to continue like this,' she says. 'We need to get angry and hold the older generation accountable for the mess they have created. We must say that this is enough, stop risking our future.' Even for seasoned delegates, an event like COP24 is a grueling experience, with its late nights and constant negotiations. Thunberg has been more than a match, for them, addressing the U.N. secretary-general during the first week of the conference, speaking at a panel hosted by the World Bank, and being shuttled from one event after another. She hasn't had time to explore Katiwice, she says. 'Of course it's exhausting to do all of this,' she says with a yawn. 'It comes with a price and you just have to take that because the climate is more important.' Banner image of U.N.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA52","COMMENTARY: FIVE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM COP24 FOR ENERGY","January 25, 2019 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the International Energy Agency (IEA): In the late evening of December 15 2018, the gavel came down on the 24th Conference of Parties (COP) in Katowice, Poland, with the President of the conference leaping over the dais in celebration. The outcome of COP24 was heralded by many as a success in multilateralism and diplomacy, and the adoption of the Paris Agreement rulebook, a set of rules and guidelines designed to bring the Agreement to life, was no small achievement. But how does this achievement translate to energy systems in the real world? What signals does it transmit to domestic policymakers and energy sector investors? We outline five key takeaways of COP24 for the energy system and energy transitions. 1. A positive step forward for multilateralism on a common path forward Consensus agreement on the 133-page Paris Agreement rulebook by almost 197 Parties (196 countries and the EU) represents no small feat in multilateralism. One particular success was the emergence of a single set of transparency guidelines for all countries to report and review information, such as their latest greenhouse gas emissions and progress towards meeting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs, representing national pledges to address climate change under the Paris Agreement). This approach represents a notable shift away from the existing bifurcated approach whereby industrialized and developing countries have different reporting and review obligations, though it still provides flexibility for developing countries who lack capacity. The collection, reporting, and review of energy and emissions data are fundamental to tracking and driving progress of energy transitions and are also at the core of IEAs work. The new, enhanced transparency framework negotiated in Katowice reflects a positive step in bringing all countries under a single, robust system, while allowing flexibility to those who need it. One element of the Rulebook that has yet to be agreed upon regards market mechanisms, covered by Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Negotiations on this topic will continue through 2019. 2. A call for ambition: energy transitions are underway but must be urgently accelerated Inspiring stories of energy transitions from all corners of the globe were heard around COP24 : Iceland now generates 100% of its electricity from renewable sources, China forges ahead with the worlds largest emissions trading scheme, and Costa Rica is advancing on its plan to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world. But despite such signs of progress, the pace of global energy transitions is woefully off-track from what is needed to meet global climate targets, and the Paris Agreement has yet to prove itself up to the task of bending the curve. The IEA estimates that energy-related emissions rose in 2018, including in advanced economies for the first time in five years, signalling emissions are moving in the exact opposite direction in which they should. This stark reality was underscored even further by the release of the IPCCs Special Report on 1.5 Degrees last October, shifting the goal post on the challenge of meeting Paris targets. With the rulebook in place, the next big challenge for the Paris Agreement is to show that it can result in greater ambition. Countries are expected to submit revised, more ambitious NDCs by next year, returning the spotlight firmly to policymakers in national capitals and subnational jurisdictions, in particular those responsible for energy policy development. But a delicate process of diplomacy, both inside and outside of the negotiations, is important so that no country feels as if it is acting alone. 3. Rising fossil fuel consumption remains at odds with meeting climate and energy objectives It was no coincidence that COP24 was held in the heart of Polands Silesia coal region. A priority of the COP Presidency was to highlight and spark discussion on the challenges of fossil fuel transition, including the just transition of workers in these sectors. Coal contributes to 80% of Polands electricity generation mix, one of the highest shares in the world and 5 million homes in Poland are heated with coal, a fact that could not escape COP24 participants as the smell of coal smoke lingered over the city centre each evening. These challenges experienced in Poland, but also in many other countries, highlight opportunities for integrating the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with other priorities such as air pollution reduction, sustainable employment, and clean economic development. Globally, fossil fuels continue to form the backbone of the economy, accounting for 81% of global energy supply, a figure that has remained stubbornly unchanged in the last three decades. IEAs Coal 2018 report showed that despite the advance of renewables, coal remains the largest source of electricity globally and global coal demand is in fact forecast to rise. Yet the IEAs Sustainable Development Scenario, describing an energy sector aligned with the Paris Agreement, points to a need for global coal use to peak and enter a rapid decline. The tension between objectives and reality is troublingly, still rising. 4. Tracking the progress of energy transitions is fundamental to raising ambition, and IEA has a key role to play COP24 also saw the culmination of the Talanoa Dialogue, an important process to assess global progress towards Paris goals. Tracking progress is a critical driver of raising ambition and enhancing energy transitions efforts. Not only does it highlight progress made, but it reveals areas of action moving forward as that which is measured, improves. The Talanoa Dialogue drew political attention to the value of tracking progress to meet Paris goals. Looking ahead, collective progress will be assessed every five years starting in 2023 through a more comprehensive assessment process called the Global Stocktake, considering not only emissions reductions, but also adaptation to climate impacts and finance. The IEA is at the heart of global efforts for tracking energy transitions through a range of analytical tools, including Tracking Clean Energy Progress, the Global Energy and CO2 Status Report, and tracking progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7. 5. Beyond solar and wind: all low-carbon options are vital Another welcome development from COP24 was growing acknowledgment for the need to explore the full range of options in accelerating energy transitions. While much attention in recent years has been justifiably paid to the impressive growth of variable renewable energy sources, low carbon energy as a whole still only comprises 19% of total energy supplied. To make real progress in decarbonising the energy system, energy transitions must rely on more than just variable renewables but on all available options. COP24 saw increasing recognition of the need for a range of technologies to be deployed at scale, including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, nuclear energy, sustainable bioenergy, hydrogen, and of course energy efficiency. All of these have a role to play in addition to, not in lieu of, the rapid scale-up of renewables. Despite the lack of a final agreement on market mechanisms, the adoption of the Paris Agreement rulebook should be recognized as the multilateral success as it was. However, the pace of energy transitions is far from what is required to meet Paris Agreement goals, and translating intention to practice will require strong, well-coordinated policies that rely on the full array of low-carbon options. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA54","EPISCOPAL DELEGATION HERALDS PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AT COP24 IN POLAND","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Episcopal Church: By David Paulsen COP24 President Micha\'c5, Kurtyka speaks at a briefing Dec. 13 in Katowice, Poland. Photo: Episcopal Church, via Facebook [Episcopal News Service] A delegation of Episcopalians who represented Presiding Bishop Michael Curry at this month's United Nations climate conference in Poland is heralding the conference members' agreement on next steps toward reining in global warming and the successful resolution of a key impasse over word choice. The Episcopal delegation ""bore witness to significant developments in international climate change policy,"" the delegation's leader, California Bishop Marc Andrus, said this week in a written statement about the conclusion of COP24 , known officially as the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Nearly 200 countries met Dec. 2-14 in Katowice, Poland, with the goal of developing a framework for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep global warming under the threshold of 2 degrees Celsius that scientists predict is necessary to prevent a spiraling catastrophe of melting glaciers, rising sea levels and related weather extremes. In 2016, the Episcopal Church was granted U.N. observer status, which allows members of the delegation to brief U.N. representatives on the Episcopal Church's General Convention climate resolutions and to attend related meetings. At COP24 , the delegation promoted a more ambitious goal of keeping global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius. Andrus said most member nations ""acknowledged the need to ramp up ambitions for reducing carbon emissions, while also attending to a 'just transition' for the most heavily impacted countries who are also the most under-resourced for adaption."" COP24 President Micha\'c5, Kurtyka called the successful negotiations on implementing the Paris Agreement ""a great achievement."" ""Our common efforts didn't consist solely of producing texts or defending national interests,"" Kurtyka said in an online statement. ""We were conscious of our responsibility to people and commitment for the fate of Earth, which is our home and the home of future generations who will come after us."" Andrus was joined for both weeks of COP24 by Lynnaia Main, the Episcopal Church's representative to the United Nations, and Andrus' wife, Sheila Andrus, an ecological entomologist representing the Diocese of California. The rest of the delegation was split between the conference's two weeks, with the first week including the Rev. Lester Mackenzie of Laguna Beach, California; Alan Yarborough, Office of Government Relations communications officer, and the Rev. Melanie Mullen, the Episcopal Church's director of reconciliation, evangelism and creation care. For the second week, they handed off to Andrew Thompson, an environmental ethicist at Sewanee: The University of the South, and Jack Cobb, Office of Government Relations domestic and environmental policy adviser. ""Our delegation, through our meetings with negotiators, our presentations and our side events, worked tirelessly to bring our church's own unique voice to COP24 ,"" Andrus said. They also participated in panel discussions, conferred with ecumenical partners and joined worship and prayer services. # COP24 COP24 team. Dzi\'c4kuj\'c4, kochamy Ci\'c4! #EpiscopalClimate #EpiscopalUN. pic.twitter.com/b0WrLdC8CO One of the highlights of the delegation's second week at COP24 was a statement it drafted to join a chorus of support among partner delegations for a climate science report by the International Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Most COP24 member parties had sought to ""welcome"" the IPCC report, but that wording raised objections from the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. ""The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement quoted by the Associated Press. ""As we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies, the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report."" That response ""was far from adequate to forward the climate action needed now,"" Andrus said. He wrote an initial draft of an Episcopal delegation statement, and he and his team spent five hours revising it until it was ready to present to the U.S. delegation on Dec. 11. The statement referenced resolutions passed by the Episcopal Church's General Convention and invoked some of the consequences of climate change already being experienced across the church, from rising sea levels to wildfires. ""It was a clear stand based on the Episcopal Church's policy and actions to say that words matter and that the science-based goals of a global climate agreement, which can avert the worst climate impacts, also matter,"" Andrus said. In the end, COP24 ""What I hope Episcopalians will know from our small, singular experience in Katowice is that their voices matter,"" Andrus said, and he encouraged anyone interested in these issues to follow the Episcopal Public Policy Network. ""Advocacy is the way we express our faith in action."" David Paulsen is an editor and reporter for the Episcopal News Service. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA55","POWERING SMALL DEVELOPING ISLAND STATES WITH 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY","December 21, 2018 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group: At the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP24 ), in Katowice, Poland, the global community fleshed out the rules to govern the Paris Agreement. Rules necessary to ensure the most vulnerable communities are not left alone to deal with the adverse effects in a world in which global warming has risen above 1.5C. The effects of global warming are already affecting countries and regions around the world. This is especially the case for Small Developing Island Nations (SIDS) like the Seychelles. The Republic of the Seychelles is one of the island nations that could completely disappear fom the earth due to sea level rise. So what can a country with one of the smallest GDPs in the world do to prevent the global catastrophe lapping at its shores? ""Although we are challenged due to our small size and isolation from other nations, the Seychelles is incorporating the sustainable development goals into [its] businesses and communities, to make its economy more resilient and to help protect the people of our global community,"" explained Wallace Cosgrow, Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change of the Republic of the Seychelles, during a side event at COP24 . ""With regards to The Seychelles' greenhouse gas emissions, 90% come from its energy sector, almost all of its energy is fossil fuel based. Now we have decided to lead by example and have turned to the path of renewable energy,"" said Theodore Marguerite an Analyst from the Seychelles Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. ""The SIDS have historically lagged behind with in the transition to sustainable energy sources; they have been highly dependent on coal. But we are driving the change by going 100% renewable,"" Minister Cosgrow added. Similar challenges and ambitions can be found in other Small Developing Island States. Mauritius, for example, ""has plenty of sunshine and wind it could use, but it relies on fossil fuel sources for its energy instead,"" lamented Jugeeswar Seewoobaduth from the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of the Republic of Mauritius. The Republic of Mauritius has traditionally shown a progressive stance on climate policy within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of the Climate Vulnerable Group (CVF), a group of countries vulnerable to climate impacts and known for pushing for higher climate ambition and leading by example within the UN climate talks. Despite their high ambitions, several SIDS have to deal with barriers to access concessional finance for their mitigation and adaptation plans; most are considered middle-income countries due to their small population size. Davinah Milenge Uwella from the African Development Bank highlighted the range of financial institutions and mechanisms that the Bank has deployed to support Regional Member Countries including Seychelles and Mauritius, to transition to green growth. These include financial facilities such as the Facility for Energy Inclusion (FEI); and the green mini-grid programme under the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa. To make this shift to 100% renewable energy generation and use, investments and integrated policy are crucial, adds Stefan Wehner from the Thinktank greenwerk: ""If we want these countries to succeed, we need to provide integrated energy roadmaps, investments infrastructure, technology and policy creation."" \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA57","COP24: A QUICK POST-MORTEM","December 20, 2018 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The Conference of the Parties 24 ( COP24 ) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has ended on December 15, with the usual extension of more than a day to complete the deliberations. Almost 25,000 delegates from the government, non-government, private sector and faith community attended the meeting, which was mandated to adopt the Rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement (PA). Analysis of the event is forthcoming yet, but based on my experience as a member of the Bangladesh delegation, I regard the ultimate outcome as not satisfactory, almost frustrating, but way better than the ""Brokenhagen"" of 2009. The most rancorous elements that appeared at the meeting are: recognition of the science of climate change as presented by the IPCC 1.5C Special Report; urgency of ramping up the mitigation ambition to match the call of science; fixing the share/levy of emissions trading transferable to a yet-to-be structured mechanism, replacing the Clean Development Mechanism under the soon-to-die Kyoto Protocol; the issues of climate finance (CF); and the agenda of Loss & Damage (L&D). Some elements have been agreed upon: that all countries will have to report their emissions and show progress in cutting every two years from 2024, after the global stock-taking at COP29 in 2023. The contestations cantered particularly on two issues: how to recognise the latest IPCC Report, which entails how clearly countries should signal the need for greater mitigation to stay below the temperature limit of 1.5 degrees, the aspirational goal set under the PA. The agreed text just hints, instead of using strong language, at the need for more ambitious emission reduction pledges before 2020, which frustrates the most vulnerable countries, UN organisations and NGO activists. With tensions mounting, the UN Secretary-General Guterres had to visit the meeting several times to plead for progress. Despite settling on some parts of the Paris Rulebook, countries failed to agree on substantive issues, such as defining the ex-ante and ex-post provision of information on CF. Actually, CF continues to be one of the most rancorous issues in all COPs, since 2015 when developed countries pledged to deliver USD 100 billion a year from 2020. Even before COP24 , the rules governing CF reporting under Article 9 of the PA were expected to be direly contentious. The rules cover Article 9.5 of the PA (reporting on the projected availability of CF in future), and Article 9.7 (reporting on money already delivered). The agreed text now says developed countries ""shall"" and developing countries ""should"" report on any CF they provide, but the sought-after criteria-based common reporting format could not be agreed. But in absence of an agreed understanding of what CF is, countries have wiggle room for creative accounting. This was starkly evident again at COP24 . The decision language under both parts of Article 9 is relatively permissive, which allows countries to report the full value of loans, rather than the ""grant equivalent"" share as CF. Another persistent issue is the ""double/triple"" counting of the same money, provided through all the Rio conventions or different delivery channels. The fixing of accounting methodologies subjectively by finance providers does not allow any comparability among them. An additional prick in CF is its extreme fragmentation in delivery, with channels both public and private ranging from 99 to over 500 including over 22 multilateral CF funds. There are too many overlaps involving huge transaction costs, generating frustrations both at delivery and receiving ends. This warrants a ""thinning out"" of weedy tendrils of CF bureaucracies, which often clog the money to reach the target communities. So, one good decision at COP24 was the organising of a workshop next year on ""effectiveness"" of CF to measure its impacts at the ground. The Bangladesh delegation strongly pushed for this. Just weeks before the meeting in Katowice, the OECD published a report on CF, which shows that in 2017 their members have provided USD 56.7 billion as CF to developing countries, but it did not specify the methodologies of reaching this number. We may recall the episode of 2015 in Paris when an OECD representative in a session on long-term finance mentioned that in 2014 they provided USD 62 billion as CF, the Indian delegate, based on their analysis, responded that only USD 2.2 billion could be regarded as credible CF. This Himalayan gulf in numbers of claimed CF delivery and actual receipt shows no sign of bridging yet. Another interesting facet is that though grants account for over a third of bilateral CF, it is a measly 10 percent of multilateral funding. But the most vulnerable countries' persistent demand has been to have grants as CF mainly to enhance their adaptive capacity. Also the adaptation finance remains at one-fifth of total CF, though the pledge has been to maintain a balance in support between mitigation and adaptation. What is more frustrating is that the long-agreed principles of CF under the UNFCCC, such as ""new and additional"" CF has been totally diluted, with no signs of resuscitation. However, amidst the clouds shrouding the canvas of CF, there is some money flowing in to the Adaptation Fund, to the tune of USD 129 million, and some new pledges of replenishment to the Green Climate Fund, where Germany pledged an amount of USD 1.5 billion, followed by countries like France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, UK and others. It is expected that the EU will lead to fill the gap left by the US-declared withdrawal from the PA. Finally, the Bangladesh delegation, I must say, fared well in the negotiations in the streams of Adaptation, Mitigation, CF, and Loss and Damage. In the future, it has the potential of doing a lot better, given that more rigorous homework is done before the meetings. This warrants analytical deliberations well before each meeting to generate novel ideas for consensus-building among like-minded alliances. As climate negotiations now stand as the number one global public diplomacy issue involving all countries and thousands of diverse stakeholders, our government is expected to put greater efforts in capacity building of the negotiators, particularly young ones, to carry our flag aloft in the most visible and most widely-publicised diplomatic forum.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA58","Menendez Delivers Floor Speech on COP24 Climate Change Conference Negotiations","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington, DC: U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has issued the following press release: Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered a speech on the Senate Floor on the ongoing negotiations at COP 24 \- the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference \- where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue. In calling for the President to reconsider his calamitous decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, Menendez described how New Jersey, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is already doing its part as a national leader for clean energy jobs and climate change resilience.  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice, Poland to finalize the rulebook on implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality. For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable. Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone. That includes reports from the world\' s top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts. What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth\' s climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American. There\' s a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract. Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises. Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy. While we shouldn\' t point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change\' s harsh reality are undeniable. It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8\'b0 Celsius (1.4\'b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks. It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average the highest annual average in the satellite record. None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, \' We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.\' This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week. Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement\' s entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures. The Paris Agreement also clearly outlined robust and transparent reporting, so that parties can hold each other accountable via diplomatic engagement as opposed to binding legal punishment. Of course, success comes down to execution. That is what makes the development of the implementation rulebook so consequential, and President Trump\' s decision to abandon the Paris Agreement so antithetical to our own interests. The current administration\' s wholesale rejection of meaningful engagement with the global community is disturbingly na\'efve and is bound to result in repeating past mistakes and detrimental outcomes. China is emboldened by President Trump\' s plan to abandon the Paris Agreement. China effectively slowed progress at COP23 and will continue its efforts. In the leadership vacuum President Trump has created, China is stepping in to write the rules. It is completely absurd to assume that the U.S., by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, is somehow immune to the global economic implications of climate change. The President couched his decision to abdicate American leadership regarding the Paris Agreement as putting \' America First\' in a June 2017 announcement riddled with inaccurate characterizations of the Paris Agreement and \' alternative facts\' on climate change. There is no truthful, factual, or reality-based argument to justify how allowing every country in the world, except the United States, to build the clean energy economy of the future and confront our most pressing global challenge puts America First. Continued U.S. leadership and climate diplomacy can only yield economic benefits for United States workers. More than 900 U.S. businesses support keeping the United States in the Paris Agreement, including more than 20 Fortune 500 companies. Acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for New Jersey and our Nation. I am proud to say that New Jersey is a national leader in deploying clean energy technologies, creating clean energy jobs, and planning and investing in climate change resilience. New Jersey is home to 417 solar energy manufacturing and installation companies employing more than 7,000 workers. New Jersey is also competing hard to become the first mid-Atlantic state to produce offshore wind energy, supported by the recent enactment of legislation establishing a 3,500 megawatt production goal for offshore wind energy. New Jersey has also recently increased its renewable energy standard to 50% by 2030 and set a new state carbon emissions reduction goal of 80% by 2050. New Jersey\' s leadership among the states working to combat climate change is rooted in our vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The fact is, if we continue on our current emissions trajectory the world could see global average temperature increase by 3 degrees Celsius. This would devastate New Jersey, risking $800 billion in coastal property value, along with the health, security, and livelihoods of millions of our residents. The potential losses from sea level rise, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather associated with climate change would cost my state\' s economy billions in economic losses. Just yesterday, the Star Ledger - a statewide paper -published a column by Robert Kopp, the director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, highlighting many of these consequences, as outlined by the recent National Climate Assessment. Our winters have been warming faster than our summers. Pests like the pine beetle and ash borer are no longer kept in check by winter freezes. Perhaps even more alarmingly we\' ve seen our crops begin to bud earlier and earlier, only to see them decimated by cold snaps later in the season. In the Garden State, famous for our tomatoes, cranberry bogs, blueberries, and other specialty crops, that\' s a big deal. As temperatures rise, we also expect to see a surge in heat-related deaths and illnesses due to allergies and asthma, while disease carrying bugs like mosquitos and ticks thrive in increased seasonal moisture. Our fisheries the lifeblood of so many of our coastal communities have already begun to see how changing water temperatures are changing fish migrations, making it harder for us to manage historic fisheries and harder for our fishermen to earn a living. And of course, perhaps the clearest threat to New Jersey from climate change comes in the form of coastal flooding from sea level rise and extreme weather events. We saw it with Superstorm Sandy, and we understand the devastating consequences it can have for our families, our communities, and our infrastructure. There is no convincing me that ignoring climate change and walking away from the world\' s only mechanism for holding countries like India, China, and Russia accountable for their emissions puts New Jersey First. The Trump Administration\' s failure to recognize this potential, and its refusal to recognize the growing market demand for clean energy is a stunning example of transactional relationship this President has with the fossil fuel industry. He is putting wealthy, politically connected, corporations ahead of the best interests of the American people. Proof of the Administration\' s political favoritism for fossil fuels is exemplified by the only U.S. government sponsored event at COP24 in Poland titled: \' The Future of Coal\' . Never mind how insulting and tone deaf it is to sponsor an event to promote dirty, coal-powered energy at a climate change conference, while countries like the Marshall Islands, Maldives, Mongolia, and Mozambique--that face existential crises from climate change-- look on. Even more than that, this public forum flaunts the administration\' s wholesale sellout to the industries the government is tasked with regulating. It also shows this administration\' s contempt for the U.S.\' s booming renewable energy sector, which according to Trump\' s own Department of Energy, employs more Americans than the U.S. fossil fuel industries, by a five-to-one ratio. All told, nearly 1 million Americans work in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors. That equals nearly 5 times the number of workers employed in the fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and oil workers. As Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I believe climate diplomacy must be a priority for U.S. foreign policy. Climate change poses an imminent and long-term threat--not just to U.S. national security, but also to the long-term prosperity of this country and of our world. Addressing the crisis requires collective action and cooperation by local and national representatives, small and large businesses, and every one of us. If the U.S. is to maintain our status as the world\' s super power, it is in our best interest to lead the global cooperative effort to address the serious challenges posed by climate change, and to promote stability and resilience by helping developing countries reduce their vulnerability to the effects of climate change. If we stand alone on the sidelines as these changes in international economics take shape we will ultimately be the loser. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on the administration to continue advancing U.S. climate diplomacy and reconsider the decision to withdraw. It is essential to U.S. national security interests as defined by our own Department of Defense and growing U.S. economic opportunity. \"

(TBM), a company that develops, manufactures and sells paper and plastic alternative products made from a limestone-based material known as 'LIMEX', is close to launching LIMEX and Plax bags on the market as alternatives to single-use plastic bags. Furthermore, TBM is honored to participate in COP24 (Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) as a delegation of Japan. On 12th December 2018 (Local Time 13:15-14:30), TBM will host an event, 'LIMEX - Limestone paves the road to a de-carbonised circular economy', in Japan Pavilion. Here, TBM will introduce the concept model of alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEX and Plax. BackgroundCompanies today are expected to take actions against environmental issues to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to combat plastic pollutions. Regulations against plastics have been enforced in recent months internationally and there is a growing demand for plastic alternative materials.Anticipating the demand growth for biomass-based biodegradable resin, TBM has announced the 'Biodegradable LIMEX' at 'Brussels SDG Summit 2018,' which TBM has partnered with. The Biodegradable LIMEX is composed of limestone as the main raw material and biomass-based biodegradable resin.Furthermore, by working together with Bioworks, TBM's subsidiary that develops a highly functional modifier for bioplastics, we will promote the market application of Plax (Modified Polylactic Acid Compound), the biomass-based new material. We strive to contribute to a decarbonized society and a circular economy. Given the situation that only 9 % of plastic waste, which cumulatively accounts for 6.3 billion tons until 2015 globally,is recycled, TBM has partnered with local governments and companies to promote 'LIMEX Upcycle' to contribute to raising resource efficiency. Overview of the alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEXPlastic packaging including single-use plastic bags accounts for the largest market share in the plastic industry. Considering the plastic waste issue, progressive regulations against single-use plastics, and greenhouse gas emissions, there is significance in replacing the conventional single-use plastic bags with more environmentally friendly material. Within this context, TBM will introduce the products below at COP24 . TBM aims for these products to be launched in the Spring of 2019.

COP24 Official Booklet and the LIMEX novelty products distributed at the Japan PavilionAn article on LIMEX is featured in the COP24 Official Booklet, 'CLIMATE CHANGE The New Economy COP 24 Katowice, Poland'. Through this article, TBM suggests opinions and knowledge regarding ways that LIMEX contributes to decarbonization. Furthermore, the LIMEX novelty products will be distributed at the Japan Pavilion. Introduction of the new material 'LIMEX' [What is LIMEX?]LIMEX is made mainly from limestone. It is an environmentally and economically viable new material that can substitute paper and plastic. 2013TBM was chosen by the Ministry of Economy,Trade and Industry as one of the Innovation Base Promotion Businesses to be aided by ""Subsidy for Advanced Technology Demonstration and Evaluation Facility Development."" 2014Patent Approval for the new material technology in Japan. International patent applications have been approved or await approval in 43 countries. 2015Construction of Shiroishi Plant was completed. (Shiroishi city, Miyagi)The capacity of Shiroishi Plant is 6,000 tons annually. 2016TBM received The Social Impact Award by Plug and Play Tech Center. 2017TBM was selected as one of the five top companies to participate in the Innovation Showcase of Japan US Innovation Awards program. [Paper alternative (LIMEX sheet)] LIMEX uses almost no water and no trees while 1 ton of paper is made from around 20 trees and 100 tons of water. One ton of LIMEX Sheet is made from 0.6~0.8 tons of limestone and 0.2~0.4 tons of polyolefin resin. Japanese Paper manufacturers plant trees overseas for sustainability. If used LIMEX sheet is to be disposed in Japan, it is generally categorized as combustible waste, and cannot be recycled with paper. [Plastic alternative (LIMEX pellet)] While conventional plastic is made from petroleum-derived resin, LIMEX pellet is made mainly from limestone. LIMEX pellet can reduce the amount of petroleum-derived resin used. Limestone costs lower than petroleum-derived resin. LIMEX sheet can be up-cycled to LIMEX pellet. [Deposits of limestone] Limestone is self-sufficient in Japan. Limestone is abundant around the world. TBM Co., Ltd.

With COP24 COP24 President Kurtyka Michal urged ministers meeting in Krakow to find common ground and to seek compromise so that December conference in Katowice is a success. Addressing the Business PreCOP24 in Krakow, UNFCCC Deputy Executive Secretary Ovais Sarmad, said, 'You have all highlighted that economic growth and tackling climate change are compatible. We need to have a Just Transition to low carbon, but time is running out.' According to UNFCCC, there is $26 trillion worth of economic opportunities for the business community in Climate Action. 'But we must both protect the climate and protect jobs,' the UN said. UNFCCC stressed in a tweet that, as of last week, 181 countries have ratified the Paris Agreement. 'No other multilateral, global agreement enjoys that kind of political commitment. We now need to unleash the Agreement's full potential by finalizing its implementation guidelines,' Sarmad said in Krakow. Referring to the Paris Agreement, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said, 'I asked ministers and government delegates to take one central message back to their countries: That people of the world want us to achieve results at COP24 in December and that we intend to reach those goals.' Earlier in October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its Special Report on October 8 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. The Special Report confirms that limiting climate change to 1.5C is necessary to avoid the worst impacts and reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events., The report also demonstrates that human-induced global warming has already reached 1C above pre-industrial levels and is increasing at approximately 0.2C per decade.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA64","U.S. NATIONAL STATEMENT AT COP24","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the U.S. Department of State: Remarks Judith G. Garber Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary , Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Katowice, Poland December 12, 2018 President of COP 24 , Excellencies, and Distinguished Delegates; I am so pleased to be with you today. I am grateful to our gracious hosts here in Poland for their hospitality, excellent preparation, and leadership. The United States supports a balanced approach that promotes economic growth, improves energy security, and protects the environment. The U.S. record of accomplishment and leadership is clear: Our energy-related CO2 emissions have fallen by 14 percent since 2005, even as our economy has grown by over 19 percent. As President Trump announced last year, the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, absent the identification of terms that are more favorable to the American people. He also made clear that the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy, innovation, and emissions reduction. Our National Security Strategy declares The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while expanding our economy. This achievement, which can serve as a model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains, not from onerous regulation. The global climate conversation needs to embrace not only aspiration but todays reality. The U.S. approach incorporates the realities of the global energy mix and uses all energy sources and technologies as cleanly and efficiently as possible, including fossils fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable energy. This diverse energy portfolio is possible thanks to early stage research and development and private sector finance and innovation. A quarter of our energy-sector CO2 reduction has come from utilizing natural gas. The U.S. natural gas boom is the result of years of U.S. innovation and RandD investment. General Electric, the U.S. National Laboratories, and American entrepreneurs all played a role in perfecting the extraction techniques that unleashed Americas natural gas revolution. RandD and operational experience are bringing down the cost of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage or CCUS. One hybrid coal and gas power plant in Texas captures more than 90 percent of the emissions from its flue gas stream. CCUS enhances our energy security and economic development and preserves the environment. The United States is home to the worlds largest nuclear power industry. Thanks to significant investment by the U.S. Department of Energy and the private sector, the first Small Modular Reactors will be operational by the mid-2020s. They will be flexible, scalable, easier to finance, and capable of powering remote areas and micro-grids. In 2017, the United States exported more advanced energy technology than any other country in the world. The United States is also the worlds largest oil and gas producer and the second largest producer of renewable energy. In 2018, the United States announced new RandD funding in nuclear, solar, marine, and fossil energy. We are making significant progress in Smart Grids, advanced storage technologies, wind, and hydropower. In sum, the United States will continue to engage our many partner countries and allies around the world to reduce emissions, to continue to adapt to climate change, and to respond to natural disasters. We will also work with other countries to develop and deploy a broad array of technologies, as we continue to promote economic growth, improve energy security, and protect the environment. Thank you. \"

RICS stressed the importance of factoring in embodied carbon as part of countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for setting science-based targets for buildings and construction; and for implementing the circular economy within the sector by building on its professional standard on whole-life carbon assessment for the built environment. To deliver tangible financing solutions, RICS are in partnership with the 41 members of the Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEM) Initiative, who attended the Climate Summit to unveil the definition of energy efficient mortgages and launch a valuation due diligence checklist for mortgage lending purposes. The shift towards 'green' mortgages and circular thinking in the real estate sector is gaining traction to respond to climate change. Therefore, RICS have been developing a comprehensive package including guidance, research, capacity building and strategic partnership to forge a two-pronged approach. Climate-change-carbon-emissions The built environment sector's carbon emissions Whole Life Carbon Assessment for the Built Environment, 1st edition (3.10MB) 20 Nov 2017 Our approach is essentially about equipping professionals with the necessary tools to reflect sustainability aspects within their daily valuation practice and at the same time to work with other organisations to sensitise investors vis-a-vis the risks of not future-proofing their buildings against forthcoming legislation and changing market trends. We therefore actually require the inclusion and consideration of these aspects as part of valuation reports. Ursula Hartenberger, RICS Head of Sustainability RICS have played a key role in developing the Energy Efficient Mortgages Action Plan (EeMAP) definition of what constitutes an energy efficiency mortgage and developing EeMAP's supporting tools, such as a valuation checklist and the accompanying guidance for mortgage lending valuers. Given the importance of the project for market transformation across Europe, it was presented by one of the project's pilot-scheme banks as part of a dedicated Human Settlements Action Event on financing multi-level action at COP 24 this week. It is estimated that across the EU, Euros100 billion will need to be invested annually in building renovation to achieve the region's climate targets. Historically, financing energy efficiency was regarded largely as a public finance exercise. This will change rapidly with the participation of private sector funds, especially banks or specialist lenders for whom lending against real estate represents up to one-third of their loan book. In view of the involvement of a significant and broad stakeholder base representing over 2000 banks; and value of outstanding mortgage loans in Europe over Euros6.8 trillion, the energy efficiency mortgage initiative has the potential to transform the European housing stock and help the EU meet its climate goals. The definition is intended as a concrete response to the efforts of the European Commission to construct a capital markets union, to facilitate the clean energy transition in line with the Paris Agreements, and in this context, to build a financial system that supports sustainable growth. It will provide a market benchmark to operationalise the integration of energy efficient mortgages into the business lines of the 41 pilot lending institutions. At the end of 2017, these lending institutions represented 55% of mortgages outstanding in the European Union, equal to 25% of EU GDP, constituting significant critical mass in the market.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA66","Tata Steel's 'The Green School Project' Makes Its Way to the UN Climate Change Conference","December 18, 2018 Tuesday 8:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Tata Steel, a subsidiary of Tata Group, issued the following news release: The Green School Project, an initiative by Tata Steel in association with TERI to spread awareness about environment issues in school campuses, made its presence at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Poland. A case study on 'The Green School Project' was presented at the India Pavilion in Katowice, Poland on December 13, 2018 during a session on 'Capacity Building for Climate Change' hosted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Mr. Pankaj Satija, Chief Regulatory Affairs, Tata Steel highlighted environment and climate related actions taken by the Company. On the sidelines of COP24 , a pavilion was set-up to create awareness about India's positive climate actions in various sectors of the economy. The theme of this year's India Pavilion was 'One World One Sun One Grid.' India Pavilion was a platform for exchange of innovative ideas for the world to come together and act. Mr. Pankaj Satija, Chief Regulatory Affairs, Tata Steel said, ""We have been engaging with the tribal people in our mining areas for their traditional knowledge on climate change. Sustainability is at the core of everything we do at Tata Steel. The Green School Project is one of such initiatives undertaken to enable a sustainable future. This project, done in partnership with TERI, has shown a positive impact amongst the school children in terms of making them environment conscious."" Apart from the Indian government officials, the session was also attended by delegates from counties like Austria, Namibia, Germany, Poland, Indonesia and Zimbabwe. The 24th meeting of Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held at Katowice, Poland from 3rd December 2018 to 14th December 2018. Under the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015, the countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed to an international agreement - Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) - whereby they would reduce their respective greenhouse emissions and thereby contribute individually to climate change mitigation. In order to tackle the issue of climate change at the national level, an important step would be to create awareness amongst citizens and enhance their understanding about the ways of implementing sustainable practices, at the individual and community levels, which reduce emissions. Since children will be the responsible citizens of tomorrow, it is required to emphasize on building their knowledge and skill sets along with helping them develop an attitude of conservation and efficient use of resources. Thus, to add to India's contribution towards INDCs, Tata Steel and TERI envisioned the Green School Project, with a sharp focus on augmenting the capacities of students through activity-based teaching programmes, which not only involve and connect them with nature but also train them to promote the message of climate change mitigation in the wider society. Mr. RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, said ""This is an area which is at the heart of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Children are attached to things in their immediate environment and it is important to keep them in mind while framing policies."" The Green School Project was launched in April 2017 with select schools with an overarching goal of creating amongst students, awareness on climate change and the ways in which a sustainable lifestyle can help mitigate the adverse impact of climate change. This is achieved by promoting environmental stewardship through both classroom and outdoor activities like teachers training workshops on digital pedagogy, development of green curricula, community impact projects, outdoor educational activities, development of Information Education and Communication (IEC) resources for joyful learning activities. This further helps to improve their critical, interdisciplinary, and holistic thinking. The project cycle will continue for years with addition of schools in new and existing locations to work continuously with the communities in and around remote areas of mining operation to ensure economic, environmental and social sustainability. With the success of phase-I implementation in 10 schools across the states of Jharkhand and Odisha, this initiative was extended to 20 additional schools in phase-II this year.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA67","HEALTH BENEFITS FAR OUTWEIGH THE COSTS OF MEETING CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS","December 5, 2018 Wednesday 8:06 PM  EST","US Fed News","UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 5 -- The United Nations World Health Organization issued the following news release: Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. The latest estimates from leading experts also indicate that the value of health gains from climate action would be approximately double the cost of mitigation policies at global level, and the benefit-to-cost ratio is even higher in countries such as China and India. A WHO report launched today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 Exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. In the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP. Actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around 1% of global GDP. ""The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. ""The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health - clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter - and will undermine decades of progress in global health. We can't afford to delay action any further."" The same human activities that are destabilizing the Earth's climate also contribute directly to poor health. The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution. ""The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself,"" says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. ""When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost."" Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. WHO's COP-24 It describes how countries around the world are now taking action to protect lives from the impacts of climate change - but that the scale of support remains woefully inadequate, particularly for the small island developing states, and least developed countries. Only approximately 0.5% of multilateral climate funds dispersed for climate change adaptation have been allocated to health projects. Pacific Island countries contribute 0.03% of greenhouse gas emissions, but they are among the most profoundly affected by its impacts. For the Pacific Island countries, urgent action to address climate change - including the outcome of COP24 this week - is crucial to the health of their people and their very existence. ""We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change - from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind,"" said Dr Joy St John, Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health. The report calls for countries to account for health in all cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation. It also recommends that countries use fiscal incentives such as carbon pricing and energy subsidies to incentivize sectors to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. It further encourages Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to remove existing barriers to supporting climate-resilient health systems. WHO IS WORKING WITH COUNTRIES TO:  Assess the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from the more ambitious action required to meet the goals of limiting global warming to 2oC or 1.5oC.  Ensure climate-resilient health systems, especially in the most vulnerable countries such as small island developing states (SIDS); and to promote climate change mitigation actions that maximize immediate and long-term health benefits, under a special initiative on climate change and health in SIDS, launched in partnership with the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Fijian Presidency of COP-23 and operationalized by the Pacific Islands Action Plan on Climate Change and Health.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA69","COP24: Climate conference in the heart of Poland's coal country","December 2, 2018 Sunday 9:32 AM GMT","CNN Wire","(CNN) -- There's a certain irony that when world leaders meet in early December at the COP24 global climate conference, they will be doing so in the heart of Poland's coal country. Coal is hugely important for Poland. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently referred to it as ""our black gold."" The country is the biggest producer of hard coal in the EU and coal power provides about 80% of Poland's electricity compared to an average of 30% among International Energy Agency member countries. But coal accounts for almost half of global energy-related CO2 emissions, and like other coal-dependent countries, Poland is trying to adapt to a world that needs to cut emissions to slow global warming. The EU has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and last week unveiled a plan to be net zero by 2050. Poland's CO2 emissions per capita are slightly above the EU average, but its emissions per GDP are third-highest in the EU. But there are signs that is changing. Marek Wasinski, an analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, a government-funded think tank, told CNN: ""Like other EU countries, Poland is also moving away from coal. It's not a revolution, it's a slow evolution of the energy sector."" Although it makes up less than 10% of its energy mix, Poland has around 6,000 megawatts of wind power capacity, putting it among the leading nations in the EU. Construction of the Baltic Pipe Project is set to start in 2020, which will supply natural gas from Norway to Poland. Natural gas produces much less CO2 than coal when it's burned for energy, but methane leakage can limit its climate benefits. The Ministry of Energy's draft energy policy, published last week, said that by 2030, 60% of power will come from coal. It expects to have up to 9,000 MW of nuclear power by 2043, and 30,000 MW of off-shore wind and solar power by 2040. Coal legacy Michal Kurtyka, COP 24 President and Secretary of State in the Ministry of Environment, told CNN that Poland inherited a legacy of coal from its decades in the Eastern Bloc -- which ended in 1989 -- but had since managed to successfully transition its economy. ""In 1990 the Polish energy mix was 96% coal,"" he said. ""There was a very high share of employment in coal and very big industrial production, the result of this communist conviction that only through industrialization could the Soviet Bloc compete with Western economies. ""When we entered into the transformation phase, this idea of transition of employment and changing industrial structure in many industrial regions, but starting with Silesia, was a very big challenge, but it's working very well right now. ""Katowice is an example of the transformation. It's a green city, 40% of the city is covered with parks, and quite a substantial part of production and employment is going to IT, business centers, value-added services, and new industries."" But the move away from coal isn't happening fast enough for some environmental groups. Client Earth is a charity that uses legal avenues to protect the environment. ""The government targets are not in line with the Paris Agreement,"" Client Earth's Ilona Jedrasik told CNN. ""To have so much electricity still come from coal by 2040 is impossible from an economic point of view. By then renewables will be way cheaper than coal -- keeping coal at that point makes no sense."" Economics is another argument against Polish coal. Last month, Client Earth launched a lawsuit against the construction of the long-proposed 1,000 MW Ostroleka C coal power station in northern Poland -- a joint venture between power companies Enea and Energa. Enea and Energa didn't respond to repeated requests from CNN to comment, but Energa President Arkadiusz Siwko said in July that the power plant ""contributes to the process of modernizing national power sector ... and, what is important, will be fired with Polish coal."" He added that it would provide ""a satisfactory rate of return for our shareholders."" The mayor of Ostroleka said the power plant would provide jobs for the city. 'Just transition' It's with an eye on the 90,000 Polish jobs in the coal sector that the Polish government has drafted the Silesia Declaration on Solidarity and Just Transition, which heads of state will be asked to adopt at the opening of COP24 . Kurtyka says Poland must look for opportunities to create jobs at the same time as tackling climate change. ""There are technologies that provide not only environment and climate benefits but also social and industrial benefits,"" he said. ""For example there's a growing industry in Poland around electro mobility and batteries, especially in Silesia. ""The message is that we want to operate this transition together with people and not against them."" TM & \£9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA71","SEN. MENENDEZ DELIVERS FLOOR SPEECH ON COP24 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE NEGOTIATIONS","December 11, 2018 Tuesday 9:55 PM  EST","US Fed News","WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 -- Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member issued the following news release: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered a speech on the Senate Floor on the ongoing negotiations at COP 24 - the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference - where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue. In calling for the President to reconsider his calamitous decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, Menendez described how New Jersey, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is already doing its part as a national leader for clean energy jobs and climate change resilience. CLICK TO WATCH ( HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIz6YlhC9x4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIz6YlhC9x4 ) ""Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice, Poland to finalize the rulebook on implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality. For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable. Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone. That includes reports from the world's top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts. What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American. There's a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly-the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract. Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises. Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy. While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable. It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8 degree Celsius (1.4 degree Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks. It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average-the highest annual average in the satellite record. None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, 'We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.' This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week. Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement's entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures. The Paris Agreement also clearly outlined robust and transparent reporting, so that parties can hold each other accountable via diplomatic engagement as opposed to binding legal punishment. Of course, success comes down to execution. That is what makes the development of the implementation rulebook so consequential, and President Trump's decision to abandon the Paris Agreement so antithetical to our own interests. The current administration's wholesale rejection of meaningful engagement with the global community is disturbingly naive and is bound to result in repeating past mistakes and detrimental outcomes. China is emboldened by President Trump's plan to abandon the Paris Agreement. China effectively slowed progress at COP23 and will continue its efforts. In the leadership vacuum President Trump has created, China is stepping in to write the rules. It is completely absurd to assume that the U.S., by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, is somehow immune to the global economic implications of climate change. The President couched his decision to abdicate American leadership regarding the Paris Agreement as putting 'America First' in a June 2017 announcement riddled with inaccurate characterizations of the Paris Agreement and £lternative facts' on climate change. There is no truthful, factual, or reality-based argument to justify how allowing every country in the world, except the United States, to build the clean energy economy of the future and confront our most pressing global challenge puts America First. Continued U.S. leadership and climate diplomacy can only yield economic benefits for United States workers. More than 900 U.S. businesses support keeping the United States in the Paris Agreement, including more than 20 Fortune 500 companies. Acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for New Jersey and our Nation. I am proud to say that New Jersey is a national leader in deploying clean energy technologies, creating clean energy jobs, and planning and investing in climate change resilience. New Jersey is home to 417 solar energy manufacturing and installation companies employing more than 7,000 workers. New Jersey is also competing hard to become the first mid-Atlantic state to produce offshore wind energy, supported by the recent enactment of legislation establishing a 3,500 megawatt production goal for offshore wind energy. New Jersey has also recently increased its renewable energy standard to 50% by 2030 and set a new state carbon emissions reduction goal of 80% by 2050. New Jersey's leadership among the states working to combat climate change is rooted in our vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The fact is, if we continue on our current emissions trajectory the world could see global average temperature increase by 3 degrees Celsius. This would devastate New Jersey, risking $800 billion in coastal property value, along with the health, security, and livelihoods of millions of our residents. The potential losses from sea level rise, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather associated with climate change would cost my state's economy billions in economic losses. Just yesterday, the Star Ledger - a statewide paper -published a column by Robert Kopp, the director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, highlighting many of these consequences, as outlined by the recent National Climate Assessment. Our winters have been warming faster than our summers. Pests like the pine beetle and ash borer are no longer kept in check by winter freezes. Perhaps even more alarmingly we've seen our crops begin to bud earlier and earlier, only to see them decimated by cold snaps later in the season. In the Garden State, famous for our tomatoes, cranberry bogs, blueberries, and other specialty crops, that's a big deal. As temperatures rise, we also expect to see a surge in heat-related deaths and illnesses due to allergies and asthma, while disease carrying bugs like mosquitos and ticks thrive in increased seasonal moisture. And of course, perhaps the clearest threat to New Jersey from climate change comes in the form of coastal flooding from sea level rise and extreme weather events. We saw it with Superstorm Sandy, and we understand the devastating consequences it can have for our families, our communities, and our infrastructure. There is no convincing me that ignoring climate change and walking away from the world's only mechanism for holding countries like India, China, and Russia accountable for their emissions puts New Jersey First. Proof of the Administration's political favoritism for fossil fuels is exemplified by the only U.S. government sponsored event at COP24 in Poland titled: 'The Future of Coal'. Never mind how insulting and tone deaf it is to sponsor an event to promote dirty, coal-powered energy at a climate change conference, while countries like the Marshall Islands, Maldives, Mongolia, and Mozambique--that face existential crises from climate change-- look on. Even more than that, this public forum flaunts the administration's wholesale sellout to the industries the government is tasked with regulating. It also shows this administration's contempt for the U.S.'s booming renewable energy sector, which according to Trump's own Department of Energy, employs more Americans than the U.S. fossil fuel industries, by a five-to-one ratio. All told, nearly 1 million Americans work in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors. That equals nearly 5 times the number of workers employed in the fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and oil workers. As Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I believe climate diplomacy must be a priority for U.S. foreign policy. Climate change poses an imminent and long-term threat--not just to U.S. national security, but also to the long-term prosperity of this country and of our world. Addressing the crisis requires collective action and cooperation by local and national representatives, small and large businesses, and every one of us. If the U.S. is to maintain our status as the world's super power, it is in our best interest to lead the global cooperative effort to address the serious challenges posed by climate change, and to promote stability and resilience by helping developing countries reduce their vulnerability to the effects of climate change. If we stand alone on the sidelines as these changes in international economics take shape we will ultimately be the loser. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on the administration to continue advancing U.S. climate diplomacy and reconsider the decision to withdraw. It is essential to U.S. national security interests-as defined by our own Department of Defense-and growing U.S. economic opportunity.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA72","At COP24 in Poland, nations aim to craft Paris rulebook","December 10, 2018","SNL Electric Utility Report","Climate talk experts say the outcome of these negotiations are critical to the success of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit global warming ideally to 1.5 degrees C and to 2 degrees at the most from pre-industrial levels. Delegates from more than 190 nations are slated to descend on Katowice, Poland, the first two weeks in December to hash out a set of implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement. ""This is really where the rubber meets the road on the Paris agreement translating the high-level provisions of Paris into nuts and bolts operational details,"" Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, or C2ES, said in a Nov. 26 press call. Moreover, countries feel a collective political pressure to deliver an implementation rulebook, he said. ""Governments know that a failure in Katowice will be seen as as the unraveling of the Paris agreement and as another blow to multilateralism and that's something most would like to avoid."" The 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24 , runs December 2 through 14. In addition to rulebook negotiations, the gathering will feature discussions around the need for countries to ratchet up their emissions reductions pledges, also known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, to achieve the broader goals of the Paris accord. The current NDCs of countries collectively fall short of the target but parties to the accord pledged to increase their ambitions over time. The first opportunity countries will have to announce new NDCs will be in 2020 and pressure is building on the countries to begin working on those announcements now. Officials from Fiji are leading the talks on national ambitions, also known as the Talanoa Dialogue, which have also included non-governmental organizations and officials from the private sector. Another top topic at COP24 will be financing the transition to a low-carbon global economy, particularly refining the process by which developed countries will meet their prior pledge to provide climate financing of $100 billion annually from 2020 through 2025 to developing countries. Although President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. from the Paris accord, he is sending a delegation to COP24 that includes officials from the U.S. State Department; White House; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; the U.S. departments of Treasury, Energy and Agriculture; and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. is participating in the negotiations ""to ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests,"" the state department said. The heaviest lift for COP24 negotiators, say experts, will be getting parties to agree to one set of Paris implementation guidelines for both developing and developed countries. The rulebook would spell out how countries would plan, implement and track their individual emissions reduction goals. The rulebook could also set out a common time frame for all counties to announce more ambitious targets, create a process by which countries' progress and plans would be reviewed by peers and outside experts, and outline how parties will communicate on adaptation and finance. Counties are at different stages of implementation and have used a wide variety of formulas and scopes in their individual NDCs, which will make creating a uniform set of rules a challenge. Moreover, until now, the process has allowed for a bifurcated approach for developed and non-developed countries and consolidating them will prove politically challenging. But clarifying the guidelines around NDCs is critical to achieving the Paris goals given that the current pledges do not account for all of the emissions going into the atmosphere, The Nature Conservancy Director of International Climate Policy John Verdieck said in an interview. Although some countries and private sector financers and corporations may make pre-planned announcements throughout the COP24 talks, experts say broader deals may not be reached until the last day of the talks. Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to, said Karl Vella, climate policy manager at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a CEO-led organization of over 200 international companies. The trick will be ""tying together all the different elements under the rulebook in a manner that is politically acceptable for all countries,"" he said in an interview Because financing the transition to a low-carbon global economy will require work by both the public and private sectors, Vella also noted that the outcome of the talks will need to send a signal to the business community ""not only of the ambition from governments but also on the certainty and credibility of the mechanisms that will be developed under the Paris agreement."" \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA73","Canada Highlights Reduction in Federal Emissions during COP24","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","Wireless News","The Government of Canada is committed to leading on climate change action both at home and on the international stage. According to a media release, Joyce Murray, Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government, shared Canada's progress at the UN Climate Change Conference COP24 where representatives from around the world are working to finalize the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement. Canada is on track to reach goals set in its Greening Government Strategy. As of March 2018, Canada had reduced emissions from its federal operations by 32 percent relative to 2005 levels, a 4 percent improvement from last year's report. Canada's Greening Government Strategy was introduced in 2017. The strategy established climate and sustainability commitments for the government's operations, including a target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from federal facilities and fleets by 40 percent by 2030 (or earlier) and 80 percent by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. While in Poland, Murray met with officials from France as a follow-up on the France-Canada Climate and Environment Partnership established last April. She also met with representatives of Finland, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands to discuss ways our countries can collaborate to achieve the Paris Agreement's targets. Murray commented, ""If we're asking Canadians and other countries to partner with us to quickly address climate change, then we should lead by example. At home, we are doing our part by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from federal operations and transitioning to a greener, low carbon and climate-resilient economy.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA74","COP24: CITIES AND REGIONS WILL CONTINUE PRESSING FOR HIGHER CLIMATE AMBITION","December 19, 2018 Wednesday 10:23 PM  EST","US Fed News","BRUSSELS, Belgium, Dec. 19 -- The European Union's Committee of the Regions issued the following news release: The European Committee of the Regions reiterates the imperative need to raise national climate ambitions while welcoming the Paris rulebook as it opens the door to reinforced multi-level climate governance The COP24 COP24 . The Paris rulebook 'Invites Parties to consider the outcomes of Talanoa Dialogues in preparing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and in their efforts to enhance pre-2020 implementation and ambition."" The inclusion of this paragraph in the Paris rulebook was defended and addressed by Cor Lamers (NL/EPP), CoR ENVE Chair and Mayor of Schiedam to the COP23 and COP24 Presidencies at the Talanoa Dialogues closing session on December 12. As a concrete achievement for cities and regions worldwide, the Paris rulebook therefore opens the door to reinforced multi-level climate governance by inviting national governments to cooperate with local and regional authorities in the definition of their NDCs, climate strategies and action plans. Amongst the inputs of Talanoa dialogues, which the Paris rulebook recommends national governments to consider, is the CoR's call for the ""integral participation of subnational actors in climate policy making and in the implementation of nationally determined contributions."" Markku Markkula (FI/EPP), CoR's first Vice-President ""While it is clear that national governments worldwide have failed in sufficiently raising their level of climate ambition, the Katowice agreement nevertheless remains a turning point in our collective efforts to win the fight against global warming. We must therefore not undervalue the great achievement of having agreed on common guidelines to implement the Paris agreement. Neither must we take complaisance in rapidly engaging to set up market mechanisms and tailored financed mechanisms that contribute to global emissions' reductions. Undoubtingly, local and regional authorities have seen their voice increasingly heard in international climate talks. COP21 explicitly recognised the crucial role cities and regions play in fighting climate change for the first time. Three years after, the Paris rulebook calls on the Parties to further integrate subnational actors in the design and implementation of their climate strategies. It is a clear success and we are confident that effective multi-level cooperation will progressively improve as the Paris agreement is implemented."" Cor Lamers (NL/EPP), CoR ENVE Chair and Mayor of Schiedam said: ""From the European Committee of the Regions, we look forward to engaging further with Parties, as shown through Talanoa Dialogues, to build a stronger partnership for multi-level action and to have it reflected in future decisions. We expect the Paris rulebook to foster the inclusion of local and regional governments in the definition of NDCs, in particular in the context of the next global climate action stock-taking in 2019. We still need to agree on fair and flexible carbon markets to reduce GHG emissions in a cost-effective way and to explore the opportunities of carbon taxes to encourage investors and consumers to choose lower-carbon paths. Together, we can maximise the potential of the much needed clean energy transition. Through flagship initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, the local and regional level will continue both delivering and pressing for higher climate ambition."" Andrew Cooper (UK/EA), member of the UK's Kirklees council and rapporteur of the CoR opinion on Climate Governance after 2020 said: ""We welcome the direct call to Parties to consider the proposals included in the Talanoa Dialogues as it opens the door to sub-national contributions in the preparation of national climate inventories, strategies and action plans. We nonetheless stand firm in our call to formally integrate Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions (RLDCs) as to ensure the integral participation of subnational actors in climate policy-making and implementation, including in the preparation and implementation of NDCs."" The call for Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions (RLDCs) to complement national pledges in the Paris rulebook has multiple goals: to provide cities and regions with a formal role in the implementation of the Paris agreement, to raise local and regional government's accountability in climate action, to increase data accuracy in the global stocktake process and to contribute to bridge the current emissions gap. The next global climate action stock-taking is planned for 2019. Global stocktake is a process to assess collective progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals. It considers climate mitigation, adaptation, finance and implementation support. Cities account for 70% of world GHG emissions, with local governments being responsible for more than 70% of climate change reduction measures and up to 90% of climate adaptation actions To incentivise climate action in urban areas, the UNFCCC 2019 Forum of the Standing Committee on Finance will focus on climate finance and sustainable cities. COP24 failed to agree on the global rules for market mechanisms such as carbon markets, an instrument to reduce the costs of cutting emissions. The discussions to operationalise market mechanisms will continue in the coming year and global guidelines are to be adopted at COP25, to take place in Chile from 11-22 November 2019.

The Paris Agreement rulebook contains detailed rules and guidelines for implementing the landmark global accord adopted in 2015, covering all key areas including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation. Key COP24 outcomes include:  The first ever universal system for the Parties to track and report progress in climate action, which provides flexibilities to those countries that genuinely need it. This will inspire all Parties to improve their practices over time and communicate the progress made in clear and comparable terms.  A good, consensual outcome on adaptation issues. The Parties now have guidance and a registry to communicate their actions as regards to adapting to the impacts of climate change.  As to the global stocktake process, it invites Parties to regularly review progress and the level of ambition based on the latest available science.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA75","American Forests Joins U.S. Climate Alliance Impact Partnership","December 10, 2018 Monday 1:17 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","American Forests issued the following news release: As the COP24 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( https://cop24.gov.pl/ https:// HYPERLINK https://cop24.gov.pl/ cop24 .gov.pl/ ) in Katowice, Poland enters its second week, American Forests is proud to announce it has accepted the invitation to join the U.S. Climate Alliance's Impact Partnership ( \~ HYPERLINK https://www.usclimatealliance.org/uscaimpactpartnership https://www.usclimatealliance.org/uscaimpactpartnership ), an innovative model to engage private sector partners in helping states to craft the most powerful strategies for climate action and climate resilience. Building on past collaboration, American Forests will support the Alliance's Natural and Working Lands Initiative that is focused on mobilizing forests, farms, and other lands to capture and store carbon. ""The new U.S. Climate Alliance Impact Partnership creates a powerful, collaborative platform that will help states access the best insights and innovations that the private sector can offer,"" said Jad Daley, President and CEO of American Forests. ""American Forests and our 46 partner organizations in the Forest-Climate Working Group have developed new science-tested approaches and tools to drive forests as a climate change solution, and we are ready to help the courageous states of the U.S. Climate Alliance to lead in this arena."" U.S. forests and forest products already provide net carbon sequestration equivalent to almost 15 percent of U.S. carbon emissions. New research led by The Nature Conservancy suggests that increased investment in natural climate solutions like forests could make up 37 percent of the additional reductions needed to achieve the climate targets set in the Paris Climate Accord. This immense potential is complicated by the rising stress on forests as a result of climate change, including increased wildfire, which must also be addressed. ""The science is clear. Forests and other natural lands are the swing vote on whether we can overcome climate change,"" said Daley. ""With the right policies and investment in the health and resilience of natural and working lands, the Climate Alliance states could dramatically increase the power of the land to absorb and store carbon. This will show the way for other states and eventual federal action."" American Forests' role in the Impact Partnership will build on past successes in working with the Alliance. In July of 2018, American Forests hosted an unprecedented Natural and Working Lands Learning Lab in Washington, D.C. that drew delegations of state officials and partners from 16 Alliance states. The Lab was staffed with more than 50 leading experts in the field of land-based carbon mitigation from federal and local government, academia, nonprofits, landowners and industry, and has already led to development of new policy proposals and establishment of financing mechanisms. As part of the new Impact Partnership, American Forests expects to host additional Learning Labs on land sector climate action working with fellow impact partners The Nature Conservancy, World Resources Institute, The Trust for Public Land, American Farmland Trust and The Coalition for Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. American Forests is well positioned to lead this effort. American Forests is the nation's first forest conservation organization, founded in 1875, and leads the 46-member Forest-Climate Working Group, the nation's only sector-wide coalition working on forest-based carbon mitigation. Jad Daley of American Forests was the co-founder of the Forest-Climate Working Group in 2007, and has served as co-chair since that time. American Forests has 25 years of experience advancing carbon sequestration through reforestation projects conducted in partnership with federal and state agencies and other partners, having planted more than 60 million trees in all 50 states.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA76","COP24: 4 Business Priorities for a Pivotal Climate Summit","December 3, 2018 Monday 8:11 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news: Business is stepping up climate action and a Paris Rulebook will give business the framework it needs to go further, says the International Chamber of Commerce, which represents business and industry at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ). COP24 - is a pivotal moment in the global effort to combat climate change. Taking place in the southern Polish city of Katowice three years after the landmark Paris Agreement was successfully negotiated, COP24 marks the deadline for Parties to agree on the 'Paris Rulebook'. This implementing framework shows how governments plan on reaching the ambitious goals the agreement sets out - namely, keeping the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 C. Recent scientific research has shown just how urgent and fraught it is to reach these global climate goals. The latest special report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that urgent changes are needed to avoid the vast economic and social costs that global warming of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels will entail. As COP24 1. Step up climate ambition More companies than ever before are taking transformative climate action and the reason is simple: climate change is everyone's business. A failure to mitigate the impacts of climate change would wreak catastrophic damage on things we all share --our common planet and the prospects for future generations. It would also be extraordinarily bad for business and the global economy as a whole. There are also great gains to be found in leading the charge towards emerging low-carbon markets. ICC is calling on Parties to raise the ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and foster global efforts to reach net greenhouse gas neutrality as soon as possible. ""A failure to address climate change will hurt us all,"" said ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO. ""Countries must go beyond the bare minimum and take transformative action if we are to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement."" 2. Adopt the Paris Rulebook In order for companies to fulfil their positive potential for climate action, greater certainty on long-term climate policies and required investments is needed. This Paris Rulebook would allow business to increase their investments in innovation, research, infrastructure and new technologies and solutions that will be essential to achieving the emissions targets and ambitions of the Paris Agreement. ""We encourage all Parties at COP24 to finalise the key details that will enable full implementation of the Paris Agreement,"" said Justin Perrettson, Head of Global Engagements at Novozymes and Chair of ICC's Commission on Environment and Energy. ""This will encourage more ambitious NDCs, as well as innovation to support climate change issues."" 3. Bring business to the table The climate rules and policies that are agreed at the international and national levels will have an enormous impact on how business can help combat climate change, affecting companies' domestic and international operations, supply chains, planning and investments. This means that business has uniquely relevant insights, technical expertise and case studies that will be critical to ensuring the effectiveness of NDCs. While business is participating in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the dialogue could be much more effective. In the spirit of the Talanoa Dialogue - the Fijian tradition of inclusive, participatory and transparent decision-making - ICC urges Parties to include business in developing climate change policy, to accelerate and encourage private sector innovation in game-changing technologies through appropriate fiscal policies and de-risking flows of private capital into climate change adaptation and mitigation investment opportunities. 4. Design transformative climate policies that work for everyone, every day, everywhere As the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 states, urgent and transformative policies are needed to reach the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Such changes will have dramatic implications for workers around the world and their communities - especially those in industries with larger carbon footprints. As we work to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it will be necessary for all society's stakeholders to set a sustainable path for communities, workers and the climate that leaves no one behind. Business is a key agent in this regard and ICC has launched a new paper setting out the global business community's principles for a just transition - safeguarding the economic and social viability of communities throughout the global shift to a net-zero emissions economy by working together with all stakeholders.

The partnership, which was made in the spirit of SDG-17, is between leading Canadian-based global travel risk management and travel insurance provider Ingle International Inc., and SUNx (Strong Universal Network), which focusses on Climate Friendly Travel. The partnership is founded on a shared commitment to develop the Maurice Strong Legacy Scholarship Program, with Ingle International as its first global sponsor. Speaking from COP 24 - the United Nations Climate Change Conference , Professor Geoffrey Lipman, Co-founder of SUNx, said: ""We are honoured to announce our partnership with Ingle International to launch the global rollout of the Maurice Strong Legacy Scholarship Program. This will create 100,000 ""Strong Climate Champions"" by 2030, in every UN State, to help to drive the behavioural change and influence the fundamental government and industry actions needed to tackle Climate Change. We need to realize the exposure to our children and grandchildren. We need to stop talking amongst ourselves and engage directly with future generations. SUNx - a legacy initiative for Maurice Strong, the father of global Sustainable Development Action - will spearhead a movement for 100,000 climate activists by 2030, responding creatively to the Paris Accords and SDG-13. By the simple act of a Scholarship Plan for graduates committed to help society take action towards more stable temperature levels, we can empower the next generation, who are the ones that will have to really deal with the transformation to the New Climate Economy."" Robin Ingle, CEO of Ingle International said: COP 24 meeting. At the same time, we identify ways to mitigate and respond to these risks positively, and we see no better means in doing this than to empower the next generation with the knowledge base that they will need to take action. Also, as a Canadian, I recognise the immense contribution that Maurice Strong made for half a century to help put in place the actions we are taking today. These are some of the reasons why Ingle International is proud to be the first global sponsor of this important program.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA78","COP24 GETS POLITICAL AFTER FIRST WEEK","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The first week of the two-week 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) being held in Katowice, Poland has just ended with a major political difference between the countries who wish to raise ambitions to take faster action to tackle climate change in light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5 degrees, and those who are associated with fossil fuel interests. The IPCC report was asked for by the COP in 2015 and was produced by the best scientists around the world. It was then adopted by all governments who are part of the IPCC in October this year. The report shows that there is a very significant difference between a world with a 1.5 degree and a 2 degrees higher global atmospheric temperature. It will affect all countries, not just the poorest. The report also said action was still possible if all countries agree to raise their ambitions for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. The need is for all countries to be reliant on 100 percent renewable energy no later than 2050. The IPCC presented their report to COP24 in Katowice last week. Normally it would be a very routine matter for the COP to acknowledge it and take its findings into the COP decision making process. However in this case it was not accepted and the argument took place over one word: ""welcome"". The vast majority of countries said they would like to ""welcome"" the IPCC report. However the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia would not accept that word and would only allow the COP to take ""note"" the IPCC report. This may sound like a trivial play of word but it signifies a major stand from the fossil fuel interests which are being represented here by Saudi Arabia, US and Russia. To give an example of how the US is doing that, there are two sets of events being hosted by the US, one by the Trump administration and the second by others including states like California, cities like New York, and companies and universities. This second pavilion has the slogan of ""we are still in"" the Paris Agreement. It is one of the most popular pavilions at the COP! On the other hand the official Trump delegation is holding a special event to promote coal as the future which has been paid for by the coal industry in the US. Many countries are asking why Trump has even bothered to send a delegation to the COP if he wants to leave the Paris Agreement? The answer is that he doesn't just want to leave it but rather to prevent other countries from making progress. In this goal he has gained the support of Saudi Arabia and Russia (which is really a trio who are becoming a major global partnership on more than climate change). So it is now clear that the division of interests is very clear between those who wish to take real action to tackle the global emergency of climate change and those who want to promote fossil fuels sales. It is no longer the case that those questioning the reality of human induced climate change is doing so because of ignorance, but rather that they are deliberately trying to subvert action. The answers may well lie in Saudi Arabia and Russia joining Trump to leave the Paris Agreement and let the rest of us carry on tackling this global emergency.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA79","3 RANIMALS IN POLAND OUR TAKE ON THE COP24 CLIMATE TALKS","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by Rainforest Action Network (RAN): Three of us from RAN's climate and energy teamPaddy, Jason and myselfhave just arrived in Katowice, a small city in the heart of Polish coal mining country for COP24 , the 2018 United Nations climate talks. The city is hosting nearly thirty thousand visitors, as heads of state, environmental ministers, lobbyists, researchers, and activists are making their way to southern Poland for the conference, the most important climate meeting since the Paris talks in 2015. You may remember all the buzz around COP21 three years ago. With the Kyoto Protocol expiring, almost every nation in the world came together around the Paris Agreementpledging to pursue a goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. The overall rulebook of the agreement was not hashed out in Paris, and that unfinished business is at the heart of the talks here this year: questions like how to standardize emissions reductions plans (or Nationally Determined Contributions in UN jargon speak), what the key metrics for reporting on emissions reductions should be, and who is responsible for financing new technologies in developing countries. The conference is taking place in the midst of a global groundswell of for climate action. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report detailing how hugely destructive 2C of warming would be, and what it will take to limit warming to 1.5C: global carbon emissions have to fall by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, reaching zero around 2050. Even the International Energy Agency (IEA), a notoriously pro-fossil fuel think tank, gets it. As we noted on our blog last week, the IEA's executive director is now on record saying that ""We have no room to build anything that emits CO 2 ."" These numbers have caught the world's attention and galvanized unprecedented action. Tens of thousands of youth are striking from school in Australia over the Adani Carmichael coal mine, and across the U.S., young people are flooding the offices of their congressional representatives calling for a Green New Deal. In the U.K., thousands are blocking bridges and roads in an Extinction Rebellion. Despite this clear mandate to keep fossil fuels in the ground, governments, corporations, and financial institutionsnot just fossil fuel companies!are continuing to support the expansion of coal, oil, and natural gas. Take the case of this conference. As the New York Times has reported, co-sponsors of COP24 include Polish coal companies, and Polish exhibits here promote the wonders of coal. You'll be unsurprised to learn, then, that the Polish government is actively expanding coal mining and constructing new coal-fired power plants. And, as we reveal in a briefing paper published this week, they wouldn't be able to do so without the financial backing of JPMorgan Chaseand other international banks and insurers. RAN is here at COP24 to highlight the role of financial institutions in the unconscionable expansion of coal and fossil fuels in general. Governments and fossil fuel companies rely on banks for the financing of projects and insurance companies to offload the risks related to construction, operation, natural disasters, and anything else that may threaten this infrastructure. Banks and insurance companies are crucial elements of the fossil fuel supply chain, without which the physical infrastructure cannot be built and carbon cannot be extracted and combusted. Yet, as these companies fund and insure carbon-intensive projects that are not compatible with a 1.5C world, they proclaim their sustainability on panels next to government ministers and release reports on how they're working to address the Sustainable Development Goals. This week at COP24 JPMorgan Chase and Polish Coal: With our Polish partners Fundacja RT-ON, we dove into the financial records and investigated JPMorgan Chase's role in funding Energa, a Polish state-owned utility company that plans to build a notorious new coal-fired power plant called Ostro\'c5,\'c4ka C. We explore how Chase is exploiting a loophole in their coal policy to provide a lifeline to the Polish coal industry, despite the industry's environmental destructiveness and dire financial situation. Check out the full briefing in English and Polish on our website. Lagging US Insurance Companies: On Monday, we and our allies launched the 2018 Insurance Scorecard, a report on the role of insurance companies in insuring and investing in coal and tar sands. The takeaway: as European companies shift away from coal, US companies are enabling coal expansion and undermining global efforts to stop climate change. With the US-based Insure our Future coalition, we'll be calling on US insurers to step up and take action, including vowing to stay away from Adani's Carmichael coal mine in Australia. Follow our adventures at COP24 as we demand that banks and insurance companies align their policies and practices with a 1.5C world that respects human and indigenous rights. We'll be reporting live on RAN's Facebook, twitter, and Instagram. \"

UConn has sent students and faculty to the climate change summits since 2015. This year's summit, COP24 , was held in Katowice, Poland, Dec. 2-14, with delegates from around the world convening to continue negotiations regarding climate change. Read more about UConn's representatives in action through the UConn Office of Environmental Policy's Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram account, or by foll0wing the #UConnTalksClimate hashtag. The following are excerpts from blog posts by some of the student participants: Brazil's New President Putting Climate &#38; Amazon Rain Forest at Risk By Charlotte Rhodes, Junior, Environmental Studies Walking into COP24 , I was immediately struck by the Brazil Pavilion. Decorated with bright colors and large displays, the pavilion is a demonstration of the immense biodiversity and vital ecosystems housed in the region. But after my initial excitement set in, I was reminded that the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, has decided to take all of this away from the world. Bolsonaro has rebuffed climate change, and promised during his campaign to rollback protections on the Amazon rain forest for economic gain. This plan is toxic, and because of the significant influence the Amazon has over the environment, will have a rippling effect throughout the environmental community. The Amazon rain forest is a significant carbon sink and one of our most valuable resources against climate change. It can sequester millions of tons of carbon, successfully removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. This is such an important resource and if Bolsonaro goes through with his plans for clear-cutting the Amazon, more action will be required by everyone else to meet the 1.5 degree goal. ... Are we changing? Yes. Can we change? Can we listen? Heading to the COP24 , I was hoping to find new ideas and insights within the field of environmental economics and policy, but I realize now I had subconsciously put my expectations for those new ideas within the familiar frameworks of thought and governance I was comfortable with. As a result, the most meaningful parts of my experience at the UN's Climate Summit in Poland have been interactions and conversations with people with rather different perspectives from my own. During a Climate Hub workshop entitled, ""Women for Climate Justice: Local Struggles, Global Actions,"" we were led through a meditative contemplation and drawing of the ""territory of our bodies."" To invoke contemplation, the facilitator asked us how and where we felt the impacts of climate change and its potential solutions, including poverty, water scarcity, renewable energy, collective action, and 'extractivism' (the first time I had encountered the term). As an example, the leader of our guided contemplation shared ""market solutions"" as something that greatly troubles her. Market solutions make up a significant portion of what I have been studying thus far (with a large exception perhaps being independent study of behavioral economics). Naturally, her statement prompted me to take a renewed look at the conflicting ideologies about the best ways to combat climate change. This is a conflict I have examined more closely this semester through the juxtapositions of my resource economics classes and an English class on the history and human experience of capitalism. ... I found that the ""territory of our bodies"" workshop proved the most productive in inspiring conversation and sharing by providing a common ground of others' often similar interpretations of the personal impacts of climate change. Just as behavioral economics works to better represent the often-flawed nature of humanity, sharing personal stories from a starting point of some common perspective appears to be a vital part of the shift towards actively reducing the effects of climate change. The Talanoa Dialogue is Making People Care! By Katarina Konon, Junior, Chemical Engineering Most people, especially in light of the most recent IPCC report, know something about climate change. Some people focus on the science behind it, others focus on the consequences, and still others decide to ignore it altogether. It can be hard to process all the warnings, statistics, and charts that we learn about in school or see on the news. Because of this, Fiji introduced the Talanoa dialogue at COP23, which aims to give people a platform to ""share stories, build empathy, and to make wise decisions for the collective good."" This concept carried over into COP24 . Another speaker from China talked about how 10 years ago, when she was a child, she could see the stars. Now, she looks up and they're not there because of pollution. If you can't imagine wildfires or floods destroying your home, try to imagine this. It just makes me feel so sad. There are a ton of reasons to care about climate change. So many, in fact, that it can be overwhelming. So start here. Start with the people who have to face it every day. Show some empathy, and do your part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You'd hate to be in their shoes someday. The Emotional, Psychological, and Mental Impacts of Climate Change By Leann Mclaren, Senior, Political Science and History During my time as a member of the UConn@ COP24 cohort attending the United Nations' Conference on Climate Change in Poland, I had the opportunity to participate in an event titled ""Intergenerational Inquiry: Youth Stepping Up for Climate Action."" The event showcased multiple speakers, from the UN Secretary General for Youth to delegates from Ghana and students from many different countries. What I found especially provoking was the testimony from a youth activist from the island of Jamaica. He described his struggle of being exiled from his community as a kid due to his LGBTQ identity. From his story of homelessness, he described how the impacts of climate change took an emotional toll on him in addition to his family problems. In Jamaica, he described how as a developing island nation, many of the national disasters have the ability to wipe out entire nations of people. The harsh effects of climate change disproportionately affect people who were not primary contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, with another student from India, he described how his motivation to become an activist for climate justice stemmed from his childhood. Memories of morning runs with his father in India became progressively dangerous, as temperatures increased to over 125 degrees Fahrenheit. The harsh effects of climate change affected not only his health but also his emotional connections with his father. He explains how these changes impacted his psychological development and contributed towards his activism. Overall, the students and speakers in this event resonated with me. The narrative of their personal stories allowed me to see how climate change produced much more than physical effects, but negative emotional and mental health side effects as well. This event made me more aware of the totality of impacts caused by climate change and more motivated to take action as a result of these realizations. I now aim to reduce my personal emissions and raise awareness to promote behavioral change among others, not only for the sake of preventing the catastrophic increase in global temperatures, but also for the mental, emotional, and psychological well-being of others all over the world. ... While the Paris Climate Agreement was a historical step for humankind, it's not nearly enough to save us. The agreement was the beginning of this world transformation; true change will require continued, tenacious, collaborative effort. ... Even if we do not reach our goal of 1.5 degrees C, or even that of 2 degrees C, any change we make now will still have an important effect on generations to come. So get out there and make some change happen. Reduce your carbon footprint. Vote ... Start improving your community. Collaborate with friends and neighbors. Have meaningful conversations with those around you. We are each just one person, but we still have an important, irreplaceable influence on the world around us.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA82","US reportedly refused to endorse major climate change report at COP24","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","SNL Power Daily with Market Report","During weekend climate talks in Poland, negotiators for the U.S. and three other countries refused to endorse a recent landmark study that suggested the world needs to phase out emissions from fossil fuels entirely by 2050, the Associated Press reports. The U.S. on Dec. 8 sided with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in their efforts to stop the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24 , from endorsing the October report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, the Associated Press reported. The scientists who wrote the IPCC report found that the world needs to quickly ramp up efforts to reduce emissions over the next decade if it is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C from preindustrial levels, which is the most aggressive of two targets set under the Paris Agreement on climate change. In a statement provided to the Associated Press, the U.S. State Department said, ""The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report."" President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. from the Paris deal. While that country saw its emissions decline in 2017, global emissions climbed during that year, and researchers have predicted that they will be even higher in 2018. The Associated Press article suggested that the floor fight over the IPCC report casts doubt on whether countries will be able to reach a deal on important climate-related issues by the end of the second week of the talks, which are being held in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators hope to leave COP24 with at least some rules in place for implementing the Paris accord. But in a Dec. 10 press conference at the event, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who served as president of COP20 and now leads the climate and energy practice of WWF International, said he is ""sure"" negotiations will ""take into consideration the 1.5 (degree) report"" regardless of whether all countries support the IPCC's findings. Pulgar-Vidal, who also previously served as Peru's minister of state for environment, warned against giving up hope. ""Everybody knows its a complex process ... in which every step counts and every day counts,"" Pulgar-Vidal said of the COP24 negotiations. ""It is not a good idea to pre-judge what it could be because sometimes we are used to being pessimistic but, by the end, the outcome is better."" He later added, ""I am sure ... by the end we are going to have a very strong outcome."" But former climate negotiator for Saudi Arabia Mohammad Al Sabban in a Dec. 10 post on Twitter said the Paris agreement already is dead. In a tweet to National Geographic Society climate writer Andrew Revkin, Sabban asked, ""Are you still following the dead Paris Agreement?"" Sabban said the negotiators ""will go from one meeting to another forever till it's officially announced its death."" \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA83","THE LESSON FROM COP24 IS THAT BUSINESS CAN LEAD THE CHANGE","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI): By Vincent de Rul Community This years COP24 event takes place at a crucial time. The UN conference, which brings together the worlds leaders to tackle climate change, follows the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which questions whether our current targets will do enough to prevent the damaging impacts of global warming. Were likely to see further targets set by governments to curb emissions and waste, to meet national and global commitments. But, according to the BBC, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider. How we respond to this challenge will shape the future of business. The environmental challenge facing countries, governments and businesses, when laid out at events like COP24 , can seem intractable. The pressures we face can seem to undermine the very principles our business models and economy are built on. The truth is, they do. Environmental issues, and the associated regulatory, commercial and societal pressures that come with them, throw into question the economic model our businesses have relied on to drive profit and growth. But this should help future-ready leaders to realise that, through a series of practical, everyday changes, businesses can transform the way they are creating growth. Its time to draw the line, and that line is circular. Opportunities in the circular economy Shifting from a linear to a circular model, in which waste materials and discarded products have another useful life as a resource, enables businesses to decouple growth potential from the finite supply of new raw materials. The World Economic Forum calls the circular economy a trillion-dollar opportunity, and estimates suggest it could generate $4.5trn in the global economy by 2030. Businesses have a clear opportunity to show leadership in this area. A data-driven approach, upon which best practice business decisions are based, can help organisations to identify the most efficient, effective ways to make a change. The government has estimated that businesses in the UK could save a substantial 23bn per year, simply by making low or no-cost efficiency improvements in their use of resources. Its clear that good-for-business and business-for-good can be reconciled, and that businesses can make changes which make a difference. The question now is not Should I make change? but How can I make a change? Energy use is perhaps the most immediate, effective place to start. Every small, achievable change businesses make to how they purchase, use, flex or generate energy will flow through their entire value chain, creating multiple opportunities to bring greater resource, cost and carbon efficiency. One change can make a big difference. Those companies taking a circular approach to their energy are driving down their operating costs, increasing their supply resilience, developing new revenue streams, creating more sustainable production methods and cutting harmful emissions. As a business community, we must seize the opportunity that events like COP24 give us to consider new ways of working and the value they can bring. We have the chance to benefit from solutions that are both competitive and collaborative, good for profit and good for the planet. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA85","#COP24: EESC President Luca Jahier Calls for New EU Governance on Climate Action","December 10, 2018 Monday 7:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Union's European Economic and Social Committee issued the following news release: Non-state and subnational actors have so far played a decisive role in action on climate, but they often face unsurmountable obstacles. At the COP 24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, on 2-14 December 2018, the president of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), Luca Jahier, stressed how urgent it was to tackle climate change and underlined the fact that Europe needed to embrace a new mechanism for sustainability that included multi-stakeholder governance. ""When we look at where we are today,"" said Mr Jahier, ""seeing how strong the disconnect is between the absolute urgency to act now and the slow pace in which the governments are moving or even regressing in some cases, we understand how important it is for others to assume leadership and demonstrate the strong determination and huge potential from the bottom-up movement."" Sending a clear message at COP 24 , the EESC president highlighted the absolute necessity of urgent climate action: ""We either invest in concrete action against climate change or we will have to bear serious consequences. It will be too late to save our planet and our future generations. We need to involve civil society. We have to act now and we have to do it quickly!"" It is essential to embrace a new EU governance structure on climate action and sustainability by adopting a coordinated and multi stakeholder approach. ""Europe must be sustainable - or it will simply cease to be,"" declared Mr Jahier, adding that only by combining efforts from local communities, non governmental and civil society organisations, businesses, researchers and multi-level governments would it be possible to spur robust climate action and effect positive change and thus speed up both low-carbon development and sustainable development. ""Climate action must become the new 'business as usual' and must involve all actors in the transformation,"" Mr Jahier went on to note. ""Nobody must be left behind. We cannot develop solutions without including the voices of those who are most impacted and vulnerable."" The EESC delegation at COP 24 also included EESC vice-president for communication Isabel Cano and EESC members Stefan Back, Rudy De Leeuw, Tellervo Kyla-Harakka-Ruonala, Cillian Lohan and Mindaugas Maciulevicius. They discussed the vital contribution of bottom-up initiatives and how to fund climate action with representatives of civil society and other organisations from all over the world. Permanent involvement of grass-roots organisations These non-state and subnational actors face many difficulties when it comes to stepping up climate action. For this reason, the EESC has called for a ""European Dialogue on Non-State Climate Action"" to strengthen such climate action by European non-state organisations. Multi-stakeholder dialogue, policy instruments and toolkits, for instance through the International Climate Governance Coalition (ICGC), could help their climate action to take place worldwide. Funding a sustainable Europe In order to guarantee the appropriate funding needed to achieve the transition to a zero-carbon economy and a sustainable Europe by 2050, we need to support projects that can unite Europe's strengths in the interests of workers, businesses and all Europeans. The EESC has recently proposed a finance-climate pact for high-quality jobs. The aim is to redirect the money that could otherwise bring about a new financial bubble towards the fight against climate change and the real economy, providing a new roadmap and an integrated plan. In the words of Mr De Leeuw, author of the EESC opinion: ""40 percent of the EU budget should be devoted to the fight against climate change and its consequences from the environmental, economic and social perspective."" It is important not only to provide financial support, but also to make existing financing mechanisms accessible for non-state climate actors. ""We need to unlock more and better climate action by shifting the approach to climate finance access,"" said Mr Lohan, who drafted the EESC opinion that will be put to the vote at this week's plenary session. He went on to conclude: ""It is crucial to develop and adapt financial mechanisms, provide access to information and knowledge sharing on sources of finance, adapt finance allocation criteria to the specific needs of local actors and, finally, propose a strategy for financing micro-projects.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA86","COP24: Clean Energy Highlights From the First Week of Climate Talks in Poland","December 8, 2018 Saturday 2:08 PM EST","Greentech Media","Dec 08, 2018( Greentech Media: HYPERLINK http://www.greentechmedia.com http://www.greentechmedia.com COP24 talks ends, more grave warnings surrounded the conversations. Research released this week showed that global emissions are again on the rise, after a brief break. In 2018, scientists said emissions would rise 2.7 percent. This year's levels hit a record high, driven[1] mostly by energy use. Growth in oil and natural gas generation, as well as persistent coal use, means energy produced from thermal sources is still outpacing the decarbonization of the energy sector. According to authors of one report[2] released this week,'peak emissions will occur only when total fossil CO2emissions finally start to decline despite growth in global energy consumption, with fossil energy production replaced by rapidly growing low- or no-carbon technologies.' The news, which joins a series of reports released in recent months with concerning climate warnings, adds more urgency to the clean energy announcements that global governments, corporations and advocates aligned with the meeting in Katowice, Poland. Clean energy targets, but coal, too During climate talks, the Council of the European Union signed[3] revised directives on renewable energy and energy efficiency. By 2030, the council said, renewables will account for 32 percent of energy use in the European Union (EU), an increase from its previous 27 percent target. To drive that growth, the council said it would reduce charges and fees for rooftop solar and step up supportive market designs. For its efficiency targets, the EU will increase energy savings by 0.8 percent each year between 2021 and 2030. It set a topline energy efficiency target of at least 32.5 percent by 2030. At the same time, the EU said it would increase renewables in transport to 14 percent. The EU's announcement may act as a challenge to other global economies. Countries are set to revisit and increase ambition on their Paris commitments before 2020. Though countries such as Canada have said[4] at the talks they'd do so, that depends on progress made in Poland. Royal Dutch Shell also dropped[5] an ambitious climate announcement this week, pledging to set short-term climate targets and tie the goals to executive salaries. Shell said the targets would help it 'thrive through the energy transition.' The major has slowly, but increasingly moved into clean energy with investments in companies like NewMotion and GI Energy. Other energy companies are also speaking up about the global transition at COP24 . The Business Council for Sustainable Energy, with members including Enel, National Grid and Austin Energy, hosted a Friday event and published a solution paper[6] boosting the business case for clean energy. At the same time though, coal kept a strong presence in the first week of COP24 . On Wednesday, the conservative Heartland Institute and Solidarity, a Polish trade union, published a joint declaration[7] that denied the consensus on climate change. The groups also said they do not support eliminating coal from global energy portfolios. Polish President Andrzej Duda, in a COP24 speech, also looked to assuage possible concerns from the country's coal miners. 'As long as I'm president of Poland,' he said[8]. 'I won't let anyone murder coal-mining.' The U.S. is also gearing up for a pro-fossil fuels event, slated for next week. Axios reported[9] that speakers will include Steve Winberg, who works in fossil energy at the Department of Energy, as well as speakers focused on natural gas and advanced nuclear power. Red light for French fuel tax and other clean transportation efforts As climate talks got underway, French president Emmanuel Macron announced[10] he would nix a planned increase in fuel taxes in order to quell protests in the very same city where the Paris agreement was brokered. France's 'Yellow Vest' movement demonstrates that climate action can be tenuous in any country. Jacky Roy, mayor of France's Vouvant, told[11] Bloomberg that people are upset about higher fuel costs and still waiting to see the advantages of tax cuts. In Katowice, that frustration was linked to greater efforts to push forward carbon taxes. 'People worry about worsening climate impact costs, but they are also genuinely concerned about the economic impact carbon pricing will have on their lives,' said Joe Robertson, Global Strategy Director of Citizens' Climate Lobby, at a COP24 event. 'We can allay these fears by taking the revenue from carbon fees and giving it to the people.' Reuters reported[12] that though some COP24 delegates were disappointed the tax was pulled back, others said it was somewhat half-baked because it would disproportionately impact rural areas. Stepping into its hosting shoes, Poland this week submitted a declaration called 'Driving Change Together,[13]"" which proposes e-mobility as a permanent topic of discussion at future COPs. The initiative also creates a partnership of organizations, subnational governments and cities that will work internationally on e-mobility and meet at least once a year. So far, 40 countries have signed onto the initiative (the U.S. has not). Washington state, Quebec, and organizations like the We Mean Business Coalition joined national governments in signing the declaration. Coinciding with the effort, Poland said it would invest \€ 3 to \€ 4 billion (about $3.4 to $4.5 billion) in low-emissions public transport. It's looking to buy over 1,000 electric busses. World Bank and the International Association of Public Transport also launched a new report[14] on electric mobility and development that lays out policy suggestions for countries to advance clean transportation using examples from around the world. 'Uncertainty is an overarching theme above all, considering the nascent state of eMobility uptake globally,' the report's authors wrote. But they added that governmental initiatives like vehicle subsidies and charging infrastructure could push forward 'policy predictability' to help the deployment of electrified transport. At the same time that many parties were encouraging clean transportation targets, though, the Trump administration said[15] it is looking to remove tax credits for electric vehicles. Congress has final say over the subsidies. But the White House's stand this week is another example of America's faltering leadership.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA87","Agreed Rules, COP24 And Climate Change Protest - OpEd","December 20, 2018 Thursday","Eurasia Review","""If children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we can all do together if we really wanted to."" - Greta Thunberg at COP24 , Dec. 2018 The world, if it goes off in a burn, will do so courtesy of the rules - or their elastic interpretation. It was a fine show of contradiction at Katowice, and the Polish hospitality did not deter the 14,000 delegates drawn from 195 countries from bringing forth a beast of regulation to delight climate change bureaucrats for years. Everyone clapped themselves in way emetic to any bystander suspicious about what had actually been achieved. The question to ask, of course, is whether this fluffy, self-congratulatory exercise makes it past the canap\'e9s and becomes a genuine policy document. Little progress was actually made on the issue of commitments to cut emissions, even if there was, in principle, an agreement on a set of rules to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. As things stand, the planet is set to reach 3\'b0C, while the Paris Agreement stresses the need to keep matters manageable to an increase of 1.5\'b0C, which would lead to more modest environmental destruction. Considerable troubling silences persist on the issue of technicalities. What, for instance, constitutes a suitable, measurable reduction in emissions or who monitors a country's progress. There were certain concessions. Poorer states received more solid reassurances of assistance from wealthier states to deal with greenhouse-gas emissions and attendant environmental challenges. China was pressed into accepting certain uniform guidelines to measure those emissions. States who cannot follow the ""rules"" to reduce emissions must explain why and show a pathway to redress that failure, more a case of nudging than punishment. Coal advocates would not, however, have left COP24 dispirited. Poland's own president, Andrzej Duda, gave a rumbustious display of refusal: his country, with 80 percent of its energy derived from coal, could not be asked to abandon 200 years' worth of reserves before the idealistic abstinence of any green lobby. Poland, not the planet, came first. Michal Kurtyka, COP24 's chair and secretary of state in the Ministry of Environment, saw little by way of contradiction in a performance run by the Polish Coal Miners Band during the talks, nor coal displays in the foyer greeting guests. It would have been silly, surmised Kurtyka, to dismiss the coal industry. ""There are also energy companies of course engaging in a path of sustainable development."" But a certain smell lingered at COP24 , the sense that the conference had been sponsored by the very same entities whose behaviour was to be controlled and, in the future, abolished altogether. Kurtyka did little to dispel the aroma. ""I don't sense that there is a problem with anybody's participation, provided that we have the same goal."" The climate change talks were also being held, as it were, in the den of fossil fuel symbolism. Katowice was made by the legacy of coal rich reserves discovered in the mid-eighteenth century. Such delightful irony, as well, that the city could play host both to such a conference and the largest coal company in the European Union. This did not deter Joanna Flisowska, a Katowice native and policy coordinator on coal for Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe. ""We can be such a bright example for the transition away from coal if only we could put effort into using these opportunities."" On other fronts, the climate change lobby has taken something of a battering. France's Emmanuel Macron granted some concession to massive protests against fuel-tax rises supposedly designed to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Living standards have squared off against environmental policies. The result of the foot dragging has been to illustrate a growing divide between citizen and government official. ""Hope,"" claimed a despondent May Boeve, executive director of the climate change campaign group 350.org, ""now rests on the shoulders of the many people who are rising to take action: the inspiring children who started an unprecedented wave of strikes in school to support a fossil-free [sic] future; the 1,000-plus institutions that committed to pull their money out of coal, oil, and gas, and the many communities worldwide who keep resisting fossil fuel development."" Australia is particularly illustrative of this point, something emphasised by Greenpeace chief executive David Ritter. ""The divide between the Government and the young people of Australia is probably the greatest it's been since those huge protests of the Vietnam War era, and I think it's for a similar reason."" Students of varying ages certainly add to Ritter's suggestions, with thousands of Australian school children taking to the streets in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Coffs Harbour and Bendigo, to name but a spread of Australian cities, insisting that Prime Minister Scott Morrison heed their calls. ""The politicians aren't listening to us when we try to ask nicely for what we want and for what we need,"" suggested an irate Castlemaine student Harriet O'Shea Carre. ""So now we have to go to extreme lengths and miss out on school."" It was, however, a 15-year-old Swede by the name of Greta Thunberg, whose single person vigil outside Sweden's parliament building featured the sign ""school strike for climate change"". Three weeks were spent sitting in front of the Parliament during school hours, though she did return to classes for four days, using Friday as her weekly day of protest. At Katowice, she made her own mark, a scolding aunt in the body of a disturbed teenager. ""You are not mature enough to tell it like is,"" she told delegates in her capacity as a representative of Climate Justice Now. ""Even that burden you leave us children."" Thunberg is right about one fundamental point. ""You have ignored us in the past, and you will ignore us again."" But to ignore the future in favour of the present, to cobble together an ineffectual regime that privileges current living standards in the hope that devastation can be postponed, is an inherent condition of the species. Fiddling as the planet burns will continue. \"

The conference will be held in Katowice, Poland from December 2 ndash 14, 2018. The conference is organized by the Bonn-based UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC/UN Climate Change) and is presided over by Poland. The key objective of the meeting is to adopt the implementation guidelines of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Climate experts say the meeting is crucial because it ensures the true potential of the Paris Agreement can be unleashed, including ramping up climate action so that the central goal of the agreement can be achieved, namely to hold the global average temperature to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In 1992, countries joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as a framework for international cooperation to combat climate change by limiting average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change, and coping with impacts that were, by then, inevitable. By 1995, countries launched negotiations to strengthen the global response to climate change, and, two years later, adopted the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol legally binds developed country Parties to emission reduction targets. The Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. The second commitment period began on 1 January 2013 and will end in 2020. There are now 197 Parties to the Convention and 192 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The 2015 Paris Agreement, adopted in Paris on 12 December 2015, marks the latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change regime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. The Paris Agreement charts a new course in the global effort to combat climate change. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA90","Earth, meet Polo","April 18, 2019 Thursday","Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)","NEW YORK -- Polo Ralph Lauren on Thursday launched a version of its iconic polo shirt made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and dyed through a process that uses zero water. David Lauren, the youngest son of the company's founder and its chief innovation officer, told The Associated Press ahead of the announcement that the new shirt is part of a broader strategy of fresh environmental goals throughout the manufacturing process. ""Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference,"" Lauren said. The Polo isn't the first of its kind. Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average of 12 bottles. The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibers will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibers, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture. The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment. Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP24 , in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action. As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibers that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is ""much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean."" The broader question of biodegradability of such fibers remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said. ""There's so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities,"" he said. ""Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem? I think we're creating solutions, or at least trying to find solutions."" \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA91","GET READY FOR COP24: TRANSITION TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE","December 3, 2018 Monday","IPS - Inter Press Service","COP24 is the time for governments to act and increase their pledges to prevent global warming ensuring a just transition that leaves no one behind. The Paris Agreement and the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deliver a clear and potent message: we urgently need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius if we want to protect our ecosystems as well as the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. To prevent severe consequences caused by the devastating effects of climate change, it has become evident and imperative that ""business as usual"" is not possible anymore. We need a transformation to a zero-carbon world in pretty much all sectors; we need to decarbonize our energy systems, our industries as well as our transport systems, we need to establish sustainable ways to do agriculture, and we need to re-think the way we build cities. The challenges we are facing are enormous, but they come with endless opportunities as well. For the necessary transformation processes to be successful, they must be managed in a just and inclusive fashion: we need a just transition to a sustainable future! In December 2018, heads of State will gather for the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), in Katowice, Poland, to continue discussing ways to implement the Paris Agreement. A just transition will be high up on the political agenda. But what does it encompass? A just transition is defined by the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, as stated in the Paris Agreement, but in a way that the well-being of all people is protected. The recent IPCC report on 1.5 degrees spotlights the need for early action, once again reinforcing that a rapid transition across all sectors of the economy is necessary to mitigate the most catastrophic risks of climate change. There is great urgency involved-we only have 12 more years to turn things around! The lives and livelihoods of millions of people, especially in Global South countries, depend on fast action and ambitious climate policies to prevent the worst-possible impacts. For them, climate change is already a harsh reality, even though they have contributed almost nothing to its creation. A just transition can only be successful if it brings all affected groups to the table. It maximizes climate protection while minimizing the negative impacts of climate change and climate policy on societies, lives and livelihoods. Climate change will influence every sector of our lives. This includes the employment sector, which will be impacted by climate change as well as by climate change policies. Workers in the fossil industries and their families and communities are at the front line of the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energies. Their interests need to be considered in the process. Structural-change processes always have a strong regional component as sometimes it is coal or oil extraction which serves as the only source of employment in certain parts of a country. Good alternatives must be made available for people who will be affected by the phasing out of coal, oil and gas-even more so because that phase-out needs to happen fast to stop global warming. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius through a just transition of the world economy opens up many opportunities, including possibilities for decent work and quality jobs. Communities least responsible for and most negatively affected by climate change can and must profit from a Just Transition through poverty eradication, sustainable development opportunities and the creation of decent and quality jobs. There is huge job-creation potential in renewable energies. The jobs of the future need to be green jobs with decent working conditions everywhere in the world. A just transition is a time-limited opportunity to shape the necessary change. If we do not act now, the risks could be uncontrollable, not only for workers and their communities but also for societies, lives and livelihoods of all people worldwide. A Just Transition starts with a high level of ambition and accelerated climate action. This is the only way to ensure that there is sufficient time to implement the transition in a just way. Currently, countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not nearly ambitious enough, putting us on a pathway to global warming of 3-4 degrees celsius. What does that portend? Unbearable extreme weather conditions, sea-level rise that threatens the existence of many people, loss of biodiversity, lack of food security, disappearing coral reefs that are essential to a healthy balance of our ecosystems as well as an increasing number of climate refugees and violent conflicts fuelled by the consequences of climate change. Do you want to live in a world like this? COP24 is the time for governments to act and increase their pledges to prevent global warming. https://www.fes-connect.org/spotlight/get-ready-for-cop24-four-things-to-know-about-a-just-transition-to-a-sustainable-future/ https://www.fes-connect.org/spotlight/get-ready-for- HYPERLINK cop24 -four-things-to-know-about-a-just-transition-to-a-sustainable-future/ \"

Nongovernmental groups and UN human rights experts have urged governments to explicitly reference human rights in these rules. But detracting from focused negotiations and effective climate action is the Polish government's crackdown on civil society activists and nongovernmental groups. Following the adoption of a Polish law passed earlier this year restricting protests and increasing police surveillance powers during COP24 , many environmental groups championing a strong Paris Rulebook have struggled to make their voices heard at the Katowice meeting. Over the last week, several environmental defenders and activists have been barred from entering the country. Human Rights Watch also documented that Polish border guards went to the hotel rooms of some activists, including people accredited for COP24 , and asked them for their passports and travel history. Two were detained and questioned for several hours, without being able to communicate their location or contact a lawyer, before they were released. Beyond the immediate impact on those prevented from speaking out in Katowice, these intimidation tactics are diverting resources and media attention. Instead of advocating for ambitious, rights-based climate action, many COP participants had to redirect most efforts towards defending their rights. The repression of environmental defenders at COP24 underscores the necessity of integrating a rights-based approach into the global climate framework. At a defining moment in international climate diplomacy, and with only four days left until the official end of the negotiations, states should find guidance in the human rights language in the preamble of the Paris Agreement and adopt climate policies that respect their human rights obligations. If governments fail to address human rights, they will fail to effectively address climate change. \"

ISO is holding a side event as part of the 24th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP24 ) taking place in Katowice, Poland, from 2-14 December 2018. Organized by the ISO Climate Change Coordination Task Force (TF7), in conjunction with the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), the ISO event will feature talks and discussions about the use of International Standards for driving action, performance and transition on climate change. The Task Force works with experts from across ISO committees, guiding them to address critical aspects of climate change in ISO standards. The opportunities that International Standards bring to the global challenges of climate change will be discussed, such as mainstreaming climate action, supporting measurement and monitoring techniques, facilitating technology and non-technology innovation, and promoting behavioural changes and climate change adaptation. ISO standards can also contribute to the progress of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction that sets the pace for disaster mitigation by 2030. Nick Blyth, Vice Chair of the ISO TF7, said that International Standards are fundamental in helping organizations advance climate change actions, whether they be management system standards that shape organizational culture and processes or new ISO technical standards. ""ISO standards are built on international collaboration and consensus, by some of the world's leading experts in the field,"" he said. ""They are relevant and powerful tools to help organizations not only measure their impact on climate change, but take strategic actions to transition towards the zero-carbon future and prepare for the inevitable challenges that result from our changing climate.""

These are: 'market mechanism' (A.6), which allows a country to fund green projects in another country and buy credits; 'finance' (A.9); 'technology development and transfer' (A.10); 'capacity building' (A.11); 'transparency framework' (A.13), which deals with reporting of each country's actions; and 'global stock-take' (A.14), which calls for periodic review and improvement of each country's commitment and action for fighting climate change.Finance rulesThe most critical of these is 'finance'. India is satisfied with what the rulebook says on this count. There are two broad aspects to this. One, where the developed countries shall provide visibility on the quantum of funds that would be made available to developing countries' efforts for fighting climate change(under Article 9.5). India is satisfied with the level of detailing in such reporting, an Indian negotiator said.The second aspect is when developed countries are to state, under Article 9.7, how much funding they have provided. Here, too, the Indian team seems to be okay, but some independent observers, such as Harjeet Singh, of the NGO ActionAid, observed that India should have bargained more.Now, developed countries are not going to be forced to make a distinction between any grants they may give and commercial loans that would have to be repaid with interest.'Rich countries have a moral and legal responsibility to provide money and technology to developing countries to make their economies greener. Instead of taking this seriously, they pushed through a rulebook riddled with loopholes allowing them to avoid this responsibility,' said Singh. But Indian officials did not seem to think much on the provision of 'finance', perhaps because India is not a prominent claimant of global climate funds. India is also satisfied with the flexibility developing countries would be allowed in the stringency of reporting its climate actions, even though India has the capability to report pretty granular details.On the whole, India is fine with the rulebook. Some independent observers, though, are unhappy that there's not enough emphasis on the adaptation finance needed for developing countries to cope with effects of climate change and 'loss and damage', which is important for poor, island nations to cope with the after-effects of climatic events.Some reservationsIndian negotiator Ravi Shankar Prasad intervened in the closing plenary session to say that India had reservations over the rules related to a global stock take.He later told BusinessLine that the aspect of equity has not been sufficiently captured in the text.India would write to UNFCCC to elaborate on its point, he said.Climate expert Alden Meyer, Director of Strategy and Policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, noted that while 'some elements of the rulebook still need to be fleshed out,' the agreement 'lays a solid foundation for implementation and strengthening of the historic Paris accord'.Negotiations were scheduled to be completed by midnight on Friday, but they dragged on till the later hours of Saturday, mainly because Brazil had some objections to the rules for a 'market mechanism', or emissions trading.Turkey, too, delayed the proceedings by asking to be removed from the list of developed countries. However, in the end, the text was adopted and negotiators hugged each other emotionally.Speaking at the closing plenary session, the President of COP24 , Michal Kurktya, summed up the negotiations saying: 'We have done our best not to leave anyone behind.' \"

Campaigners have accused the rulebook of being a compromise favouring corporate interests and countries which have been the most obstructive in the negotiationprocess. Vitumbiko Chinoko, from CARE  an international humanitarian agency  in Southern Africa, accused £ few powerful countries' of holding multilateralism 'hostage' during theconference. 'Vulnerable countries cannot carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. It is unacceptable for governments to continue to cower behind the inaction of the US and other big polluters,' hesaid. Patti Lynn, executive director of NGO Corporate Accountability, said the climate talks had ended 'without delivering what the worldneeds'. 'Governments fell far short of crafting a just and equitable roadmap to Paris' implementation. The root cause of this failure  the fossil fuel industry's interference  was on full display at these negotiations,' shesaid. Compromise For those deeply involved in the process, the fact countries managed to agree on a single set of rules to implement the Paris Agreement  with flexibility in some areas  was a victory for multilateralism diplomacy in the face of growing populist movements rejecting climateaction. 'Despite all the headwinds, the Paris Agreement has stayed course at COP24 , demonstrating the kind of resilience it has been designed for,' said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of NGO the European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the ParisAgreement. The climate negotiations are a unique and very technical diplomatic exercise in which every country around the world have to agree on how to save theplanet. As Spanish ecology minister Teresa Ribera told the BBC[5], this is a 'difficult'process. 'It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat.

Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of UN Climate Change (UNFCCC), said the rulebook was £n important step' but that 'no one is entirely happy withit'. Reflecting on the final hours of the negotiation, Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at the environmental think tank E3G, told Climate Home News[7]: 'We are not going to agree what is necessary for the climate but we are going to agree what is possible in these politics. And that has gone a step further than what we have seen before going into thesenegotiations.' Faced with the lack of leadership during the talks, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was forced to intervene during the conference and warned: 'To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would besuicidal.' In many ways, the talks have shown some of the limits of international diplomacy to deliver on climate action in line with the scientificconsensus. Urgency Versus diplomacy Urgency was very much the watchword for thetalks. In October, leading climate scientists from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warned that the world had 12 years to take 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes[8] in all aspects of society' to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsiusand avoid the worst impacts of climatechange. To achieve the 1.5 degree target, global emissions need to fall by 45 percent by 2030, according to the report. But the current trend is in the oppositedirection. During the first week of the talks, the Global Carbon Project[9] launched a report estimating that global CO2 emissions will rise by 2.7 percent in 2018[10]  the fastest increase in sevenyears. One of the biggest setbacks in the negotiations was the joint effort from the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait to block the 'welcoming' of the IPCC's findings, and instead simply 'note' thereport. The final text 'welcomes the timely completion' of the report, rather than the findings themselves. Instead, the rulebook 'invites parties [countries] to make use of the information contained in thereport'. For campaigners and NGOs pushing for a radical system change, this was a failed opportunity to raise the level ofambition. Mohamed Adow, international climate lead for Christian Aid, said: 'This was the first opportunity since the IPCC report for countries to prove to the world that they were taking thisseriously. 'But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up to the urgent call of the IPCCreport.' Countries' current emission reduction pledges are on track to reach three to four degrees of warming  far from the 1.5 degree target. According to a UN report[11], countries have to raise their current targets fivefold in order to meet the 1.5 degreegoal. In the final text agreed at Katowice, countries are not specifically asked to increase their ambitions but simply 'invited' to consider enhancing their pledges by 2020. The Paris Agreement will kick in that year, and countries are set to re-submit or update their climatepledges. In a statement[12] read out in Katowice when the text was adopted, UN chief Guterres said, 'from now on my five priorities will be ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition andambition.' Corporate Capture and Article 6 One of the most technical parts of the rulebook has been left as unfinishedbusiness. Rules around 'voluntary carbon markets'  known as Article 6  were delayed because of obstruction from Brazil, which tried to water down efforts to stop 'double counting' emissionscuts. DeSmog UK reported that Article 6 is also one of the sections of the Paris Agreement most vulnerable to corporate capture[13]. The CEO of IETA, a business lobby representing big corporations and fossil fuel companies, told DeSmog UK that the group was engaging in the negotiations under Article 6 and hoping to influence its outcome[14].# COP24 [15] just got a major shake-up - hundreds of people from around the world took over the main hall to demand real solutions ... end to polluter influence.

Sara Shaw, co-coordinator of Friends of the Earth International, said: 'We stand on the brink of catastrophe because corporate interests and fossil fuel money have infiltrated the climate talks to perpetuate the dirty energy system regardless of the cost for people andplanet.'Radical Action in the 'Real World'One of the most memorable part of this year's talks was the presence of 15-year-old Greta Thunberg, who warned the conference that adults were behaving like children and that it was time for young people's voices to be heard[19].

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA98","COP24 climate talks end in agreement -- barely","December 15, 2018 Saturday 9:45 PM GMT","CNN Wire","KATOWICE, Poland (CNN) -- After two weeks of discordant and emotional negotiations, the nations of the world agreed Saturday night on a set of rules meant to help curb global warming. But scientists and even the negotiators themselves know the so-called ""Paris Rulebook"" won't be enough on its own to stop carbon pollution from reaching critical levels. Countries would have to do far more to curb fossil fuel use and deforestation to avoid the droughts, superstorms, deadly heat waves and coastal floods associated with global warming. This rulebook is supposed to put into motion the Paris Agreement on climate change, a landmark 2015 accord that the US Trump administration has promised to abandon. After fraught and much-delayed talks at the COP24 climate change conference here in Polish coal country, more than 190 countries agreed to the rules. They punted, however, on a critical but complicated issue involving how countries trade and account for certain pollution. Brazil nearly blocked the process amid concerns that its proposals would lead to ""double counting"" and, essentially, cheating, according to observers and a senior negotiator involved in the discussions. That issue will have to be taken up at a later date in 2019. Ministers also did not agree to emphatically embrace the latest climate science, which stunned some attendees. Countries reached a ""compromise"" statement in which they welcomed the publication of an alarming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They stopped short, however, of welcoming its actual findings. That ""administrative"" compromise fails to underscore the extreme urgency posed by the climate crisis, said Simon Stiell, Grenada's minister for climate resilience and environment. Vulnerable countries, including small island states that could see their entire territories disappear as seas rise, agreed to the text to ensure the rulebook moved forward, he told CNN. ""We understand the need to consensus-build,"" he said. ""And for small island developing states we have achieved our minimum -- minimum -- asks with regard to key issues."" The IPCC report says the world has only about 12 years to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels, which is one of the goals of the Paris Agreement. That report is an ""ear-splitting wake-up call,"" UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said upon its release. The science crunched the timeline for doing something and upped the stakes of inaction. In Poland, Guterres said it would be ""suicidal"" and ""immoral"" to fail at COP24 . President Trump has promised to withdraw the United States, which has done more to cause climate change historically than any other country, from the Paris Agreement. That withdrawal can't fully take place until 2020, however, so the United States did have a presence at these talks -- at times humming along in negotiations and at times promoting coal technology. Observers disagreed about whether the United States aimed to spoil talks here. The talks were supposed to end Friday but were delayed repeatedly over disagreements about the basics of climate science and some aspects of how the rulebook would function, technically. Observers also said there were disputes about how money would be transferred from rich to poorer countries to help with projects meant to blunt the severity of climate impacts like drought -- and to whom it would be transferred. COP24 was met with repeated protests from environmentalists and young people, who have more to lose than adults because they will live longer into the warming future. Inspired by a Swedish 15-year-old who called for a global school walkout to demand climate action, dozens of Polish students left school and marched into the conference center in Katowice on Friday. ""You are not mature enough to tell it like it is,"" Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old activist from Sweden, said in the speech before negotiators. ""Even that burden you leave to us children."" At the walkout, the children held pieces of a sign reading, ""12 years left."" In order to avoid 1.5 degrees of warming, the IPCC says carbon pollution must be cut almost in half by 2030, less than 12 years away, and then reach ""net zero"" by mid-century. That would require a massive reworking of the global energy and transport systems, experts said. The Paris Agreement is meant to help avoid that level of warming by creating a sort of peer pressure system that encourages countries to abandon dirty energy sources like coal, oil and natural gas, which already have contributed to 1 degree of warming. The pledges that countries have made as part of the agreement, however, put the world on track for about 3 degrees of warming by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent research effort. Human-caused climate change has been shown to contribute to rising seas, stronger storms, deadlier heat waves, extinction in the natural world, crop failures and more severe drought. Warnings on global warming are becoming increasingly dire. Despite the fact that the White House has denied the strong consensus on the science of climate change -- and has tried to boost coal extraction and reduce pollution controls -- US federal agencies in November put out a report saying runaway climate change is both dangerous and costly. ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century -- more than the current gross domestic product of many US states,"" the US National Climate Assessment found. In worst-case scenarios, climate change could cost more than 10% of US gross domestic product by the end of the century, the report said, and kill thousands of Americans. Diplomats convene at the end of each year for negotiations that are part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Countries are expected to renegotiate open questions about emissions trading next year. New pollution-cutting pledges are due in 2020. TM & \£9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

'We've been in a dozen transport energy events so far.'The Message \~ HYPERLINK http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2081.jpg http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_2081.jpg Climate Ethanol Alliance's James Cogan handing out bio-oriented t-shirt messaging at COP 24 . 'Fortunately the IEA had their big event today, and they shouted it loud and clear.. 'use bioenergy in transport or suffer the consequences'. The Brazil pavilion just had a good event too. We've giving them t-shirts with the IPCC Report findings.''The BuzzMost discussions here about climate progress in transport get to the hand-wringing stage of recognizing the urgency and scale of progress needed, but falling short of saying what should be done, Cogan adds. 'So it's a lot of armchair generals. We've been intervening at every point to say (a) the UN's Special Report says bioenergy is as important as electromobility for the next four decades and (b) no policy discussion can be meaningful unless it looks at the cost of the different measures, and regular ethanol is the cheapest climate measure in transport by a long shot. We believe we're being successful in getting people to listen and to make the step forward.'The New ReportA landmark new multi-country report launched today states that the world's greenhouse gas reduction goals cannot be met without greater use of biofuels and bioproducts, and reveals the four largest barriers currently impeding further progress. The report, Creating the Biofuture: A Report on the State of the Low Carbon Bioeconomy, affirms - in line with models and scenarios by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - that biofuels and bioproducts must play an integral role in the global energy transition, in tandem with other complementary mitigation efforts across all sectors. HYPERLINK http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-10-at-11.34.11-AM.pngAccording http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-10-at-11.34.11-AM.pngAccording to the report launched today, around 130 billion liters of biofuel were produced annually in 2016, in a market worth approximately US$170 billion annually, mostly from sales of first-generation ethanol and biodiesel. Global biofuel output must rise to more than 200 billion liters annually by 2025 and more than 1100 billion liters annually by 2050 to be in line with long-term climate change mitigation scenarios developed by the IEA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Second and third generation biofuels are emerging but must grow dramatically if Biofuture Platform targets are to be met. These can be made from inputs such as non-food crops, agricultural or industrial waste and algae, although much of the technology is still evolving and hence not yet commercially deployed at large scale. The report  which you can download here[1] identifies key barriers as:  High levels of perceived risk affecting the availability of financial resources for commercial-scale production, holding back necessary research, development and deployment.  Lack of competitiveness for biofuels and other bioproducts relative to fossil fuel-based alternatives in many markets, taking into account fossil fuels subsidies and the comparative cost reductions achieved in a mature industry.  Unfavorable policy frameworks that do not effectively coordinate the competing needs of the agricultural economy and food system, a secure and clean energy supply, and the protection of the natural environment.  Insufficient, unreliable or expensive supplies of sustainably-sourced feedstock to use in the production of biofuels and other bioproducts. The Creating the Biofuture report was commissioned by the Biofuture Platform - a government-led, multi-stakeholder initiative created to support the development of the sustainable, low carbon bioeconomy. It is based on insights and data from 19 countries and the European Commission, collaborating as members of the Biofuture Platform coalition and the Mission Innovation Sustainable Biofuel Innovation Challenge multilateral initiative. The original technical draft of the report was prepared by the Carbon Trust and Way Carbon consultancies, submitted for review by the participating governments, agencies, and partners, and published by the Government of Brazil in its capacity as the Biofuture Platform Interim Facilitator (a role similar to a Secretariat for the initiative).IEA Designated to Become Biofuture Platform's FacilitatorThe Biofuture Platform also announced today[2] that the IEA was designated to assume the role of Facilitator, following the Government of Brazil's interim tenure. This development comes as part of a major governance overhaul to reinforce the Platform's position as a key driver of international collaboration to overcome barriers to growth and accelerate the deployment of a sustainable low carbon bioeconomy. With these internal governance changes, the Biofuture Platform expects to improve its position to drive the reinforced international collaboration called for in its Vision Declaration and in the Creating the Biofuture report, mobilizing governments, industry, academia, and related international initiatives, agencies and organizations.The Bottom Line: Notes from The Been Here Before DepartmentGiven that the COP24 is meeting in Katowice in Poland, it seems the right time to relate the situation of one of the more interesting characters ever to hail from Katowice, Lady Margaret Noszak of Ciezyn. Doubly so because so many leaders currently struggling with climate change, Brexit, open borders, and international trade flows are directly descended from her family. Lady Margaret lived at the time of last great climate disaster that beset Europe, the Little Ice Age of the 14th century. A time when a version of a Paris Agreement over the relations of Europe was in constant jeopardy, border disputes raged over Bohemia, Prussia, France, England and elsewhere. Bandits were on the borderlands. Emperor Wenceslaus would have fractious relations with the Imperial Diet over questions of the legitimacy of his election. There was a turbulent shuffle of officials, and an energy shift owing to deforestation. The monarch of France was widely suspected to have gone quite insane. Debate raged across Europe over the revival of trade, but on fair terms, and the securing of borders. Enter Lady Margaret, arriving in England as lady-in-waiting to Anne of Bohemia, betrothed to Richard II. It was a controversial tie-up, owing to questions of payments that were supposed to flow between Europe and Britain as a result of the marriage, and the question of whether closer ties with Europe would result in more trade or less sovereignty. Meanwhile, there were Irish border troubles and Richard II's mishandling of them caused the downfall of his government and the loss of his life. All of which to say, we've been here before, in so many ways. Time to get it right.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA100","EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN KATOWICE","December 17, 2018 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): Concrete outcomes from UN climate change talks in Poland mean it is time to get to work New York, Dec 17 When ministers concluded negotiations on Sunday morning, 30 hours beyond the allotted time frame, a final deal on climate action at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) in Katowice, Poland, was to some extent achieved. The 'Katowice Climate Package' is the name given to the basket of issues that have been negotiated and agreed upon. Together this makes up the majority of the 'rulebook' by which the Paris Agreement can be implemented by countries around the world. The key elements that were agreed upon include how countries will both define and provide information on national climate action under the Paris Agreement, how to measure cumulative global efforts by 2023, as well as a process to mobilize financing to support this action. Yet several issues remained contentious, such as rules for carbon markets and trading, referred to under 'Article 6' of the Paris Agreement, which have been deferred until next year. Some were also critical that the text was not forceful enough in demanding more urgent and ambitious action. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres returned in the final days of the conference, reinforcing the message that climate change is the number one priority for the United Nations. In his speech he said ""We must beat climate change before it beats us. It is a race we can win. It is a race we must win."" Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UN Assistant Secretary General and Director of UNDP's Policy and Programme Bureau, highlighted how UNDP's work is driving the climate action agenda through the support it provides across 140 countries: ""At UNDP we focus on the alignment between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that climate change not only threatens development outcomes but ambitious climate action can provide opportunities to unlock economic and social gains."" Throughout the two weeks of negotiations, UNDP shared its country-level programming experiences through numerous events, all aimed at advocating for three key ingredients needed to scale up countries' action to meet their national pledges, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This is necessary in order to ensure the urgency and ambition needed to implement the Paris Agreement. Some of the highlights were as follows: First, foster public-private partnership to scale up finance . With estimates suggesting 85 to 90 percent of Paris Agreement funding needs to come from the private sector, UNDP demonstrated ways to use limited public funds to unlock private investments. For example, together with the World Bank, UNDP developed and implemented the first ever Investment COP, convening investors and public sector actors to identify country-level business opportunities that advance climate action. In addition, initiatives such as Indonesia's green sukuk the first of its kind sovereign Islamic green bond provided a prime example of how to bring additional, private finance into the climate change sphere. Second, enhance adaptation . The recent IPCC report indicating the catastrophic impacts of our warming world put pressure on negotiators to not only take urgent mitigation action, but also to prioritize adaptation. UNDP engaged in over 15 adaptation related events throughout the two weeks of COP, often with other UN agencies such as FAO and UN Environment. Two flagship adaptation reports were launched, reflecting on years of country experiences in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Africa. Third, leverage nature-based solutions . UNDP celebrated the 10th anniversary of the UN-REDD initiative, and advocated the need to engage non-state actors, particularly indigenous peoples, to leverage the benefits of forest and land use management, more broadly known, along with other approaches, as nature-based solutions. In this regard, a key outcome of the conference was the 'Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform,' putting in place a formal channel for indigenous peoples' views and interests to be communicated to the UNFCCC process. The outcomes of COP24 are lauded as an impressive achievement, given the scale of work negotiators were tasked with over these two weeks; yet, the work has just begun. With this new 'rulebook' in place, it is now the responsibility of countries, with support from organizations like UNDP, to turn their pledges into concrete adaptation and mitigation action. This includes revisiting their national climate pledges by 2020 with the aim to increase ambition in order to meet the Paris goals. This will require mobilizing political will and leadership, becoming the focus of the SG's Summit in September 2019. UNDP welcomes the progress made thus far, and welcomes the challenge and opportunity to deliver on Paris and Katowice, now and well into the future. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA101","At COP24, Humane Society International Provides Policy Recommendations for Moving Towards Plant-based Diets","December 13, 2018 Thursday 7:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Humane Society International issued the following news release: At the United Nations' global climate change conference, COP24 , animal welfare charity Humane Society International and Israeli environmental organization Green Course held an official side event that brought together experts and policymakers to discuss pathways to incentivise plant-based diets and reduce reliance on meat, dairy and egg products from animals housed in intensive factory-farming environments. The Mitigation Potential of Plant-based Diets: From Science to Policy ( HYPERLINK http://www.hsi.org/issues/climate_change/cop24.html http://www.hsi.org/issues/climate_change/ HYPERLINK cop24 .html ) gave delegates a toolkit of policy recommendations and inspiration to see them implemented. The focus of the panel was summed up by Florent Marcellesi MEP, ""If we are what we eat, nowadays we are climate change. Around 15 percent of greenhouse emissions come from animal farming, almost as much as cars and planes. This is the result of our current unsustainable food system, based on the overproduction of low-cost meat. This means huge consequences over the climate, but it also impacts our health, the lives in rural areas and the animal welfare. Civil society is already organising to fight against the low-cost meat industry and its impacts, but we need policy measures. Let's build an ecological food system that creates good quality jobs while protecting the climate, our health and the animals."" With the key message that we must take action to ensure a sustainable future, Marie Persson of the Nordic Food Policy Lab said, ""Governments play a key role in facilitating the necessary shift to healthy and low-climate impact diets. In the Nordic countries sustainable and healthy diets are moving up the agenda and while we are not seeing very harsh regulation, soft policy tools working in tandem with changing consumer preferences are proving to be a recipe for success."" Give now to help animals all over the world ( HYPERLINK https://donate.hsi.org/page/21771/donate/1?&#38;ea.tracking.id=pr&#38;_ga=2.220486424.1032241160.1546680975-1172566609.1546680975 https://donate.hsi.org/page/21771/donate/1?&#38;ea.tracking.id=pr&#38;_ga=2.220486424.1032241160.1546680975-1172566609.1546680975 ). Dr. Marco Springmann from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food at the University of Oxford highlighted the need for dietary changes to stay within planetary boundaries of the food system, saying, ""Without large-scale dietary changes towards more plant-based diets, there is little chance to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. Incentivising such dietary changes will require integrated, multi-component approaches that include providing information, access, and setting clear economic incentives. Important starting points would be to update national dietary guidelines to reflect the latest scientific evidence on healthy and sustainable diets, explore the use of full cost accounting of foods, and align agricultural policies with health and sustainability concerns."" Dr. Cristina Tirado, director of International Climate Initiatives for the Center for Urban Resilience at Loyola Marymount University, said, ""There are many opportunities to achieve co-benefits from actions that reduce emissions and at the same time improve health by shifting consumption away from animal products, especially from ruminant sources, in high-meat consumption societies, toward less emission intensive healthy more plant based diets, with more vegetables, fruits and pulses."" Ifat Zur of Green Course said, ""There is much policy discussion when it comes to sectors like transportation or energy, yet none relating to animal products. This is absurd, as the livestock industry is responsible for even higher greenhouse gasses than those other sectors, and livestock reduction involves several benefits on both individual and national levels. Policy should not only comply with research and public trends but also aim to take a leading role in the movement."" The HSI/Green Course panel was the only event to directly address the implementation of national policies to shift towards more plant-based diets in order to combat climate change. And it was a message very much needed, as COP24 's meat- and dairy-focused menu options became the topic of much discussion amongst participants. HSI experts encouraged organizers of the massive two-week conference to replace its meat-dominated menus with more planet-friendly foods in the future, offering them culinary training on vegan cuisine from its Forward Food programme, which works with institutions and corporations to put more plants on plates. Alexandra Clark, Humane Society International's food policy consultant, said: ""Industrial animal agriculture is a major cause of greenhouse gasses. While policies exist to reduce the climate impact of the energy and transport sector, Western governments have yet to adopt policies to reduce the climate impact of large-scale factory farming. Globally, 90 billion farm animals are raised for food each year - and the ramifications to the environment and animal welfare caused by the systems in which the majority of those animals are housed in are far too big to ignore. Governments must act. And with scientists warning that we are nowhere near on track to meet the 1.5 degrees necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change, it is critical that action is taken to move to more plant-based diets. COP24 's meaty menus symbolise the ostrich-like attitude of policy makers around the world. We hope they take us up on our offer of vegan culinary training to ensure that future climate change conferences offer more planet-friendly plant based food."" Forward Food encourages universities, caterers, and other institutions to provide more plant-based options as the number of people wanting meat-free and dairy-free meals increases rapidly. In the UK, the programme is led by HSI's Forward Food Chef, author and 2016 UN Special Ambassador for pulses, Jenny Chandler. Speaking at the COP24 event, Chandler said ""Everyone is seeing increased interest in meat-free eating and I love showing people that plant-based food can be really delicious and vibrant and not tasteless or worthy as is often assumed. HSI's Forward Food programme is a fantastic way of getting chefs to embrace this trend and it feels great to be part of something that really can make a difference to people's health, the environment and animal welfare.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA102","'A huge mess': Failure at COP24 climate talks would be 'suicidal'","December 12, 2018 Wednesday 10:22 AM EST","CNN.com","The heads of state for some of the main countries causing climate change -- the United States, the UK, Germany, China, Canada and India among them -- are not present here in Poland to try to keep the wheels from falling off an agreement meant to save humanity and the planet. So the weight of the world at the COP24 climate talks here in Poland appears to be falling on tiny nations like Vanuatu, which saw more than half of its GDP vanish after a recent cyclone. That nation's minister of foreign affairs, Ralph Regenvanu -- call him ""Minister Ralph,"" his delegation says -- has emerged as one of the few clear, moral voices present at these talks, which are seen by some scientists, environmentalists and policy experts as a ""huge mess"" that threaten to cause calamity if they fall apart entirely this week. The UN Secretary-General Ant\'c3\'b3nio Guterres on Wednesday said it would be ""suicidal"" for these global warming negotiations to fail. Regenvanu stood at a lectern wearing a green tie and glasses, indicting the global community. ""[P]arty negotiators rocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience,"" he told diplomats on Tuesday. ""There is no political argument to counter atmospheric measurements showing that CO2 emissions have risen since Paris and are on track for a 2.7% rise in 2018,"" he said, referencing the 2015 UN climate negotiations in Paris -- a moment when the world stood in unison demanding an end to fossil fuels. ""Whether you 'welcome' or 'note' or shamelessly ignore the science all together, the fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity."" In the guarded world of climate diplomacy, Regenvanu's statement is a massive burn to the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Over the weekend, those nations refused to ""welcome"" the latest scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which makes clear urgent action is needed to avoid catastrophe, including superstorms, deadlier heatwaves and floods. Those countries instead asked to simply ""note"" the report's existence. The United States issued a statement questioning the well-established science. As did Saudi Arabia. ""The time for limitless negotiations on climate change has passed,"" Regenvanu said. ""It pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate induced tragedies while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris Guidelines,"" he added, ""and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity's most existential threat."" A US State Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on that critique. Important aspects of the talks, which aim to create rules for tracking carbon emissions cuts as part of the Paris Agreement, which was hashed out three years ago, have become ""a huge mess,"" said Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a research group based in the UK. ""What we're seeing now is that many countries are exploring the bottom of the drain when it comes to ambition -- and in a surprising way,"" said Hare, who is a climate scientist and physicist. ""For those in the scientific community following this here, the levels of concern are rising."" The rules as they were being discussed early Wednesday would allow for ""massive loopholes"" and ""double counting"" that would create confusion about how much countries really were doing to curb greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, he said. It's so bad that he's started to wonder if it might be better for countries not to agree on anything at all -- rather than to codify lasting rules that are weak to the point of irrelevance. Hare's teenage kids have been asking him if the whole process is, in fact, irrelevant. ""If at that moment we can't see progress then people can legitimately ask what is going on with this,"" Hare said. ""What exactly is this (Paris) Agreement doing -- and how can it be fixed? Right now, I think concern is rising but the moment of truth is not quite there yet."" The final test, Hare said, will be 2020, when countries submit updated pollution-reduction plans. Jeff Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said the discord is a sign that ""this process is not working."" ""Leading countries -- especially the United States -- are fighting hard against,"" the Paris rulebook, he said. ""These meetings go on and on. It's very sad ... There are not more than a handful of countries that are going to determine the fate of the world."" Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said a severe lack of leadership at the UN COP24 talks is resulting in mass confusion at this ""critical"" stage. It's like the talks inside this sterile conference center are on another planet from the real world, she said, where wildfires, storms and other climate calamities are becoming more severe, where the science of climate change never has been starker, and where people are demanding action. ""There is a way forward, but it requires leadership,"" she said. ""That's the gap -- the leadership."" Instead, said Eliza Northrop, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, there's ""bickering"" about basic science showing more than 1.5 degrees of warming would be disastrous. People already have warmed the climate 1 degree since the Industrial Revolution. COP24 talks are being held in Katowice, Poland, which is the heart of European coal country. Poland has the reputation for being a laggard in climate negotiations and some observers say the country's leadership at the talks has been lacking, perhaps related to those interests. The COP President, Micha? Kurtyka, from Poland, told delegates late Tuesday that there had been ""insufficient progress"" at the talks. That was bold considering the sensitivities, said Jake Schmidt, who directs the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Schmidt said no one is expecting wild success from COP24 -- they best to hope for is a ""B"" grade, he said. It's worrying that these rules don't often get stronger as negotiations trod on, he said. ""It's rare that the thing gets better. It does sometimes. Paris was a rare exception,"" he said. ""It's pretty rare to start with a low bar and work your way up at this stage ..."" Delegations from rich countries with some moral high-ground -- Germany, New Zealand and Canada, among them -- are not doing enough to rally support, observers said. The United States used to fill that role as a sheep herder, said Hare, but is noticeably absent here. US President Donald Trump's administration promotes increased coal extraction and questions the basics of climate change, despite longstanding scientific consensus that burning coal, oil and natural gas for electricity and other purposes dangerously warms the atmosphere. The US delegation drew protests here this week at an event promoting fossil fuels and technology. The negotiations are expected to continue through Friday or likely beyond. ""The window of opportunity is closing,"" said UN Secretary-General Guterres. ""We no longer have the luxury of time. That's why we need to have the work of Katowice finalized -- and finalized in three days."" ""Minister Ralph"" is willing to hold onto whatever hope he can grasp. The nations of the world are more linked together than ever by this common enemy, he said in an interview. And this is a problem too significant to give up. ""We live on one planet,"" he said. ""We're all affected by the same climate. ""We hope there will be some compromise."" \"

Judith Garber, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) at the U.S. Department of State, served as head of the U.S. delegation and delivered the U.S. National Statement. The United States expresses its appreciation to Poland for its hospitality, excellent preparation, and leadership at COP24 , which concluded in Katowice on December 15, 2018. The Administration\' s position on the Paris Agreement remains unchanged. On June 1, 2017, the President announced the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement absent terms more favorable to the American people. During COP24 , the United States highlighted its balanced approach that promotes economic growth, improves energy security, and protects the environment. This balanced approach is gaining traction with pragmatic partner countries who recognize we can protect economic growth and energy security while preserving the environment. U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions have fallen by 14 percent since 2005, even as the U.S. economy has grown by 19.4 percent. This world-leading achievement and a diverse energy portfolio is possible thanks to early stage research and development and private sector finance and innovation. As U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said,  In America [w]e\' ve unleashed our energy companies to innovate and compete. And our carbon emissions have declined dramatically. The United States takes note of the negotiated outcome and appreciates the hard work of our negotiators. The outcome took a significant step toward holding our economic competitors accountable for reporting their emissions in a manner consistent with standards the United States has met since 1992. The United States is not taking on any burdens or financial pledges in support of the Paris Agreement and will not allow climate agreements to be used as a vehicle to redistribute wealth.We will work with our many partner countries to innovate and deploy a broad array of technologies that promote economic growth, improve energy security, and protect the environment. \"

The common rulebook is designed to provide the guidelines and framework to operationalise and implement the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. Negotiators from nearly 200 countries and the European Union worked for two weeks on the Katowice Climate Package to address issues ranging from finance, transparency, mitigation and adaptation. The talks resulted on a set of strong monitoring, verification and accounting rules for climate protection. Welcoming the adoption of the Katowice Climate Package, Executive Adviser to the Global CCS Institute John Scowcroft said: ""We welcome the successful conclusion of the negotiations to produce a rulebook that will implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. This gives a strong signal to business and society as a whole that action on climate change is moving forward."" The UN climate talks were framed by the scientific findings presented in the latest IPCC 1.5 Report. The role of CCS in meeting climate targets was repeatedly underlined in Katowice, as it became clear that the recent IPCC 1.5 report is becoming the key reference for governments, businesses and NGOs in setting out climate strategies. The IPCC report, which features significant CCS deployment in 3 of the 4 pathways in the report, confirmed that CCS is the only technology capable of decarbonising major industry, particularly the high emitting cement, steel and petrochemical sectors. The European Union along with 13 other countries mention CCS in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Those countries are Bahrain, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Malawi, Mexico, Montenegro, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. Ahead of 2020, Parties to the Paris Agreement must continue their work to step up their climate ambition while preparing to deliver strengthened and enhanced NDCs. The Institute looks forward to more countries including CCS in their plans as they review their NDCs and submit their mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emissions strategies.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA106","COP24: Can leaders agree to climate rules in time?","December 7, 2018 Friday 4:02 PM EST","CNN.com","This week, governments have gathered in Katowice, Poland, for COP24 -- the annual UN climate change conference. It's been dubbed ""Paris 2.0"" and ""the most important COP since the Paris Agreement,"" and many believe that what happens there over the remaining week is crucial to the fight against climate change. What is the Paris Agreement? In 2015, COP21 led to the landmark Paris Agreement, where almost 200 countries committed to keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and, if possible, below 1.5 degrees. 2018 is the deadline for the rulebook to be adopted. Any delay could slow down the implementation of the Agreement. What's at stake? In October, a report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the planet will reach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. Dramatic reductions in global carbon emissions would be needed to avoid that. What will be covered in the Paris Rulebook? Under the Paris Agreement, each country produces its own climate action pledges, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Part of the Rulebook will involve finalizing details of how countries should format and report on their NDCs, so others can monitor their progress. Micha? Kurtyka, President of COP and Secretary of State in the Ministry of Environment, told CNN. ""The Paris work program will give us rules for the coming years for global climate policy: what nationally determined contributions mean, how countries contribute, how they're being accounted for, how they are implemented, and what information is shared."" Other key negotiations Also up for discussion at COP24 is climate financing. In 2009, wealthy countries agreed to provide $100bn a year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. ""In 2025 the countries will set a new collective finance target,"" explains Steffen Kallbekken, research director at The Center for International Climate Research, based in Norway. ""In Katowice this year they're discussing the process for negotiating and agreeing that target."" Others hope to see countries at COP24 show they will adopt more ambitious climate pledges when NDCs are updated in 2020. ""We need to see in the outcomes here that governments will commit to reviewing their targets,"" said Lou Leonard, WWF senior vice president for climate change and energy. ""Then, they can spend the next year working within their national context to develop their new targets, so in 2020 they can put those new targets on the table."" Potential sticking points When it comes to rules around the NDCs, one key issue is ""differentiation"" -- essentially, the idea that developing countries should be subject to less stringent rules around reporting on NDCs than developed nations. China, representing a group called the Like-Minded Developing Countries, which includes India, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Indonesia, among others, is pushing for differentiation, according to Kallbekken, who has been monitoring negotiations from Katowice. ""Essentially, it's a two-tier system at the least ensuring that developing countries don't have to take on obligations that are too demanding for them to meet,"" he says. ""Rich countries insist on one common rulebook, that all rules apply to all, with some concessions."" Another key issue is whether NDCs must include mitigation measures -- that is, actions to reduce carbon emissions -- or if it's enough for them to include actions like adaptation (preparing for the damaging effects of climate change). Finance is another potential stumbling block. Developed countries are reluctant to give this longer-term information, saying they are constrained by their annual budget cycle, according to Kallbekken. Adaptation will also be on the table. ""There are going to be a lot of discussions about the issue of adaptation,"" said Kurtyka, ahead of the talks. ""Not every country has the same challenge of reducing emissions -- many countries are trying to adapt to climate change that's already happening, already impacting their society and economies. So we must work out a balanced outcome in Katowice between mitigation, adaption and finance in order to accommodate all these points of view."" What progress has been made? The first week of COP meetings is traditionally about technical talks. In Katowice, negotiators have been working to produce a streamlined text for the Rulebook, so there are only a few clear options to be negotiated by the politicians who will arrive next week. ""So far, negotiators have resolved minor disagreements and it's clear what the options are, but there's still lots of work to do next week,"" said Kallbekken. While some heads of state have been in attendance, those from the biggest countries, and biggest carbon emitters, have yet made an appearance. If they do show up, that could help smooth negotiations, according to Kallbekken. ""The professional negotiators in the first week have limited mandates, they can only yield so much in the negotiations,"" he said. ""The ministers who arrive in the second week have quite a bit more to give, and heads of state have even more flexibility in negotiations. ""If more world leaders were present it probably would have been easier to achieve an ambitious outcome."" Although he is hopeful that the talks will be successful, Kallbekken says he's not ruling out that a rulebook won't be finalized, and that negotiations will have to continue next year. That would be a grave outcome, according to Kurtyka. At the opening ceremony on Monday, he told attendees, ""Without success in Katowice there is no success of Paris."" \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA107","TACKLING TRADE IN TRYING TIMES - 19 DEC -","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development: Trade is an unspoken element in the Paris Agreement, yet it will have broad impacts on climate change-focused nationally determined contributions. Striking the balance between the environment and economics and ensuring humans benefit from trade while climate change measures are in place is a tricky act. A new 'rulebook' to deliver the 2015 Paris Agreement was achieved at the COP24 global climate summit in Katowice, Poland in December. But the role of trade, which is not directly mentioned in the Paris Agreement, is still not central despite its impacts on carbon emissions and other mitigation areas. UNCTAD and the trade community are working to make trade part of the climate change solution. This was the subject of debate on fiscal policy, financial markets and trade on the sidelines of COP24 The discussion highlighted research and perspectives on interrelationship between trade and climate change from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), International Monetary Fund (IMF), UNCTAD, United Nations Environment (UNEP) and World Trade Organization (WTO). A key concern for UNCTAD is the potential in and necessity of the expansion of global value chains (GVCs) for economic diversification of developing and least developed countries' economies facing the biggest environmental threats. New methods that take climate change's impact on everything from infrastructure to trade flows into account, while factoring in green methodologies to keep countries on track to meet the mandates of the Paris Agreement on climate change, need to be considered. This is difficult when trade is neither mentioned nor discussed in the forums focused on climate change, UNCTAD believes. ""Both trade and climate change are central to the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations. But trade has become a taboo subject when talking about climate change. This should not be the case,"" said UNCTAD senior economic officer Alexey Vikhlyaev, speaking at COP24 . ""This will happen both as a response to climate change and an economic necessity. Many developing, and least developed, countries have to look at ways to diversify their economies from overdependence on oil, energy intensive trade-exposed goods, tourism and agriculture."" While there is no mention of trade in the Paris Agreement, several nationally determined contributions (NDCs) contain trade elements. This means signatories must consider trade in compliance efforts. NDCs is a term for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that all signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) were asked to publish in the lead-up to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, also known as COP21 Balancing trade and climate scales Trade has always been thought of as part of the problem in climate change. But it could and should be part of the solution as well. UNCTAD's work, discussed on the panel, brings into focus the large and unexplored role of trade in implementing the Paris Agreement. ""We want to promote a positive agenda on climate and trade, demonstrating how they are linked and what the co-benefits are,"" Mr. Vikhlyaev said. ""It is common to think of trade as competing with climate change. However, trade has an enormous cooperation potential. For instance, trade can shorten distances in the delivery of goods and services."" Response measures and their impacts can also be an opportunity for cooperation between trading partners. ""The challenge is changing the approach from trade restrictive measures to figuring out how trade can help countries share the benefits of transforming their economies,"" he said. But co-benefits, or win-win outcomes, do not mean there are no losers. ""The current disaffection with globalization is rooted in the same legitimate concerns that give rise to the desire for a just transition, mainly concerns about the inequity of economic transitions. How these are balanced, taking climate change into consideration, is critical,"" he said. UNCTAD has developed a concept note on climate policies, economic diversification and trade, to highlight the big issues and debates and to highlight trade in climate debates. Trade on the table UNCTAD's work focuses on the role of trade in delivering and ratcheting up NDCs, as well as on promoting cooperative approaches to response measures. The WTO and UNEP's recent joint study, ""Making Trade Work for the Environment, Prosperity and Resilience"", sees trade as an ""amplifier"" in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The study, presented at the panel, underscores that the WTO and WTO rules can make a positive contribution to climate action by ensuring that trade-related measures are coherent and fit for purpose. The panel also discussed carbon pricing and other mitigation policies and the importance of mobilizing climate finance as important in the trade-climate change debate. Promoting a better understanding of the economics-environment contradiction, and areas of convergence will be part of ongoing UNCTAD efforts. \"

In his remarks, Senator Carper also highlighted the agreements reached at COP24 , the Trump Administration's ignorance of this issue and the economic, environmental and public health consequences of inaction. Following the conclusion of COP24 , Senator Carper on Saturday released a statement responding to the multilateral agreement reached to implement the Paris Climate Accord. Read that response HERE. ""This agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade,"" said Senator Carper. ""Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every day...Yet, as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate change, the Trump Administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies."" Senator Carper continued, ""We don't have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up and get going. That's why, as the senior Democrat and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I'm anxious to help lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate future. If we're honest with our children and grandchildren, we don't have any other choice..."" Today's speech can be viewed by clicking HERE. Below are Senator Carper's full remarks, as prepared for delivery: ""Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley to reflect on the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that concluded this past weekend in Poland. This important conference, which is better known as COP24 , met there for the past two weeks as leaders from nearly 200 countries worked to reach agreement on how the world will actually implement the Paris Climate Agreement. ""The stakes could not be higher. The future of our planet and the futures of our children and grandchildren hang in the balance. It was a positive step forward that the international community could come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change on a global scale by finally beginning to implement the Paris Agreement into practice. Having said that, however, this agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade. ""The entire world must be doing even more to address this problem. That includes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead. While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable. ""But reaching bolder future agreements is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeavor - and that includes saving our planet. Unfortunately, our President - along with many of those within his Administration - continues to reject climate science and deny the reality of the problems we are facing. ""Well, Mr. President, here's the reality. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced 16 extreme weather-related disasters that exceeded $1 billion in 2017. In the past year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges, flooding, wildfires, crop freezes and droughts - a new record! ""Thirteen of our nation's leading scientific federal agencies recently reported to us in the National Climate Assessment that, if we do nothing to address our carbon emissions, today's extreme weather-related events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead. ""In the future, we can continue to expect rainfalls where precipitation is measured by the foot, not in inches. We can continue to expect more wildfires out West burning areas larger than my home state of Delaware. And we can continue to expect extreme flooding to devastate small communities like Ellicott City Maryland, which has been hit by two 1,000-year-floods in the past two years alone. Think about that! Two in the past two years alone! ""Mr. President, one of the most memorable lyrics from singer-songwriter Stephen Stills goes something like this, 'Something's happening here. Just what it is ain't exactly clear.' Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and it IS exactly clear.' What's also clear is that there's still time to do something about it and actually foster economic growth in the USA and beyond our borders. Climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists and from leading scientists around the world.

""While we are disappointed that the Parties were unable to complete the section of the Rulebook related to Article 6 (co-operative approaches, a new market mechanism and non-market-based approaches), this result demonstrates to the global business community and society as a whole that efforts to tackle climate change are moving forward. This will give impetus to businesses everywhere to continue to enhance their actions and investments. We're greatly looking forward to the completion of work on Article 6 next year."" Business demonstrated the positive actions that it is taking to raise ambitions to reduce emissions as well as to increase investments at numerous events during the climate talks. Many businesses are aiming to become carbon neutral by 2050. For many companies the recent IPCC report on 1.5 C has become the new reference in guiding actions and long-term strategies, and reinforcing the need for a just transition for workers during the global transformations to come.

In a year-long pilot, due to start next year, HyDeploy will blend up to 20% of hydrogen (by volume) with the normal gas supply in part of Keele University's private gas network, serving 17 faculty buildings and 100 domestic properties. Customers will continue to use gas as they do today, without any changes needed to gas appliances or pipework. The Keele campus was viewed as the perfect test site, with the University owning and operating its own private gas network, independent of the UK's wider gas network, as well as the University's sustainability ethos and expertise. Professor Mark Ormerod, Deputy Vice Chancellor and Provost of Keele University, said: ""Energy and sustainability is a key overarching institutional priority for Keele University, and we are delighted to be a partner in this important, highly relevant and prestigious project. This collaborative project tackles one of the major societal challenges and has the potential to be highly impactful and lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions. It is fantastic to see HyDeploy showcased at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 )."" Heat currently contributes to a third of the UK's carbon emissions. Reducing the carbon intensity of heating using green gases such as blended hydrogen has the potential to contribute to the UK's substantial carbon savings commitments, with minimal disruption to customers, as it uses their current gas supply and needs no changes to the existing pipework or appliances. If hydrogen were blended with natural gas across the UK at a similar level to HyDeploy, it could save around six million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year, the equivalent of taking 2.5 million cars off the road. The HyDeploy project will be the first UK practical deployment of hydrogen onto a live gas network since the transition from town gas. Successful demonstration of the project has the potential to unlock savings of pound sterling8 billion to customers and avoid 120 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Keele University's Institute for Sustainable Futures is leading the way in SMART and low carbon energy research, using Keele's unique campus setting as a 'living laboratory' where innovative approaches to low carbon energy can be trialled. Key to this is the HyDeploy project, a pioneering hydrogen energy project which aims to reduce UK carbon dioxide CO2 emissions through blending Hydrogen with natural gas for cooking and heating buildings and homes across the private gas network on Keele University's campus. Professor Chris Fogwill, Director of Keele's Institute for Sustainable Futures, states: ""HyDeploy will provide the first at-scale demonstration of blended Hydrogen in the UK, and is driven by the UK's commitment to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 80% by 2050 guided by the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Given that the implementation of the Paris Agreement is a key focus of discussions at the Katowice COP24 Meeting, it presents an ideal opportunity to highlight HyDeploy."" Zoe Robinson, Director of Education for Sustainability at Keele University, said: ""The HyDeploy project on the Keele campus gives us the opportunity to understand the consumer experience surrounding sustainable energy transition developments in the gas supply. Understanding of the social aspects and how this influences customer acceptance is as important as our learning about the technical aspects, and HyDeploy at Keele gives us the chance to increase our understanding of both.""

EMPHASISES the EU's commitment to develop a robust and fully functioning set of rules as the outcome of the Paris Agreement Work Programme at COP24 , which is essential for laying the groundwork for enhanced ambition, support and investment to enable the achievement of the Paris Agreement's objectives. REITERATES the importance of making swift and ambitious progress on making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. UNDERLINES that progress towards this objective is necessary to meet the long-term mitigation and adaptation objectives of the Paris Agreement and that it should be given due consideration within the UNFCCC architecture. STRESSES the need to encourage and effectively assess collective progress towards the objective of Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement, including, but not limited to, through the global stock-take, and to undertake further work to develop methods and modalities towards this end. EMPHASISES that public finance alone can never be sufficient to finance the transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. HIGHLIGHTS the need to ensure an enabling environment for sustainable investments and STRESSES the important role of public policy in this regard. WELCOMES recent developments in this area in the EU, including the ambitions of the European Commission's action plan on financing sustainable growth, and at national and international level.

In October, a long-awaited IPCC report exposed the urgency and necessity to limit global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius and warned of the dire consequences for human rights, human lives, and the global environment if we fail to do so. In Katowice, Parties arrived with a clear mandate: translate the IPCC's findings into a commitment to raise ambition; deliver a climate action package commensurate with the level of ambition and committed resources required to reach this goal; and adopt a rulebook to guide how it happens. ""We are deeply disappointed with the outcome of these negotiations,"" said Erika Lennon, CIEL Senior Attorney. ""Simply put, the outcome of COP24 is not compatible with the Paris Agreement, which promised to protect, respect, and consider human rights in climate action. In the final hours of negotiations, the only reference to human rights disappeared from the text when Parties punted a decision on carbon markets for another year.1 The rulebook gavelled in at the Spodek Center in Katowice offers too little people-centered, rights-based guidance for countries to jointly deliver on the Paris promises, conditions that the IPCC recognizes as necessary to keep global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius. As delegates return home and countries work toward increasing ambition and enhancing national climate commitments, they must also remember that they are already bound by international agreements to respect human rights, and that these must drive how they implement necessary climate action and ensure equity."" ""The IPCC report made clear that respect for human rights and robust public participation are a prerequisite for effective climate action,"" said Sebastien Duyck, CIEL Senior Attorney. ""Not only have countries largely failed to adopt these recommendations in Katowice, but the COP itself casts a long shadow on the role and value of stakeholder engagement in UN climate processes. Poland's overt exclusion of and attacks against civil society participants at the COP sends a chilling message about the direction of human rights protections at the UNFCCC. We look to Chile, a country that championed the adoption of the Escazu Agreement, the regional agreement on environmental democracy, to facilitate this process in a truly participatory manner going forward."" ""The failures here won't stop the climate crisis, but nor will they stop people worldwide from taking urgent action to confront climate change,"" said Carroll Muffett, President of CIEL. ""Where negotiators are failing, people are rising--in the streets, in the courtrooms, in boardrooms. People are fighting against rising climate chaos with every tool they can find. And the governments and corporations must now decide if they will take bold action on climate or accept responsibility for failing to do so.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA118","COP24: A Chance For Companies To Act On Climate","December 6, 2018 Thursday 4:08 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Dec 06, 2018( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP24 kicks off this week in Katowice, Poland. When events like this take place, it does truly feel as if the whole world is focused on addressing climate change. However, I have to remind myself that nearly40 percent of Fortune 100 companies[2]haven't set even a single climate target. I don't want to sound like just another environmentalist waving my hands, jumping up and down that we need to act to reverse climate change NOW. The truth is simply this: I know it can be done, sustainability targets create business value and companies stand to lose big financially if they don't act. If your company falls in this bucket, listen up. I have helped Walmart, Starbucks and other household names get started with sustainability. I can help you too, using all the lessons I've learned from them.Don't take my word for it. Take it from the White House, which recentlyreleased a report[3]showing a side of climate change that many people haven't yet seen - the precise price tag of climate impacts to the U.S. economy. Projected climate impacts by the end of the century include $141 billion from heat-related deaths, $118 billion from sea level rise and $32 billion from infrastructure damage. Think back to the recession of a decade ago. Remember the devastating impact on our economy (and possibly your business)? This will be double that. What does this mean for the companies that haven't set a climate target - or more broadly, any U.S. company? Supply chains will be disrupted here in the United States and overseas. Disasters will impact factory production, transportation will be disrupted, costs will increase and agricultural productivity will suffer.Almost no industry here in the U.S. will be able to escape the negative effects of climate change on their business. Therefore, I have an offer for you: pick up the phone andcall me[4]. Let's get started on your company's sustainability journey. If you are feeling shy, but want some direction on the way forward with sustainability,here is some free advice: the three reasons for you to set a goal in 2019. Reason #1: Savings The first reason for you to set a goal in 2019 - money.A report from CDP[5]- which holds the world's largest collection of self-reported corporate environmental data, and other public sources - finds that nearly 80,000 emission-reducing projects by 190 Fortune 500 companies reporting data showednearly $3.7 billion in savings in 2016 alone. Reason #2: Your Family The recent wild fires in California, that killed people and destroyed homes and businesses, caused toxic air up and down much of the state. We took a surreal picture from our rooftop apartment in San Francisco when the air quality was so unhealthy that I couldn't let my kids play outside. I keep telling my children - ages 11 and 13 - that 'this is not normal!' However, unfortunately, as Governor Jerry Brown recently said, 'This is the new abnormal.' According toGallup[6], more than half of Americans think that climate change won't affect them personally. If you fall in this category, please take it from me - the effects to my family are as real as they can get. Youwillbe affected one way or another - maybe severe weather, maybe dramatically more expensive food, or maybe living through one of these traumatic events directly yourself. Reason #3: Science Which leads me to the third reason you should act on climate - science. The White House report comes just after another report from theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries. The report shook me to my core and as theNew York Timesreports[7], it 'describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 - a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.' The bottom line: We need to not only reduce emissions but start to actually pull emissions from the atmosphere. And we need to do it all now. This means cutting emissions from factories, implementing full energy efficiency in every sector, ramping up renewable energy, designing products to minimize greenhouse gases, protecting tropical forests, planting trees, and improving agriculture to increase soil carbon and reduce fertilizer pollution. If you needed more reasons than savings, your family and science, how about supply chain risk reduction, new product innovation and employee and customer engagement? Whatever your reason, now is the time for you to act. While world leaders are focused on climate change this week at COP24 , I challenge you to be the leader in your company focused on climate change. Now that you have (hopefully) a reason for setting a sustainability goal in 2019, here's my final piece of advice - how to do it:Start by evaluating your operations and supply chain before you set a goalin order to figure out your environmental impact and find the quickest wins and biggest opportunities to reduce that impact. Use tools likeThe Sustainability Consortium[8]orCDP[9], to report publicly. This will help you set audacious,public and science-based targetsfor greenhouse gas emissions. Collaborate for scale by working with others- including NGOs like EDF, companies and governments - in strategic and selective ways to create change beyond your boundary of control. Engage proactively on environmental policyto ensure long-term competitiveness, innovation and bottom-line efficiencies. We can't get where we need to go without driving large-scale change and we cannot do that without policy. Accelerate environmental innovation.21stcentury problems require 21stcentury solutions. Using technology, data analytics and visualization, companies and investorscan make environmental problems visible and actionable[10]- and even profitable.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA119","Faith Groups at COP24 Advocate for Just Transitions","December 5, 2018 Wednesday 7:33 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: Faith-based groups gathered on 2 December, the eve of the opening of the United Nations climate conference, in Katowice, Poland, for an Interfaith Talanoa Dialogue to take stock of the collective global efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Talanoa Dialogue is a process designed to help countries implement and enhance nationally determined contributions to combat climate change by 2020. It is a year-long process that will culminate in political discussions at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2-15 December. Gathered at the historic St Stephen's Church, the participants reflected on the findings of the recently released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on 1.5 degree Celsius, that reveals that the planet is on-track to surpassing the relatively safer limit of 1.5 degree Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels in around two decades with potentially catastrophic effects, especially on the poorest. Just transitions was one of the key themes of the dialogue. Representatives from the city of Katowice shared that their city is in many ways built on coal. Many derive their livelihoods from it. Addressing climate change entails a shift away from these polluting industries. Initially coined by labour and environmental movements, the concept of ""just transitions""aims to ensure that the burden of adjustment does not fall on those who contributed least to climate change, are most vulnerable to it, and have the least resources to deal with it. For Athena Peralta, programme executive for Economic and Ecological Justice at the World Council of Churches (WCC), who facilitated the discussion, a just transition is first of all a rapid and drastic shift from a fossil-fuel driven and extractive economy to a carbon-neutral and regenerative economy. ""This demands nothing less than systemic changes towards an alternative development paradigm that holds justice and sustainability together,"" she said. Ovais Sarmad, UNFCCC deputy executive secretary, expressed deep appreciation to the religious sector for their passionate engagement in the global issue of climate change. ""All religious traditions view creation as a sacred gift and have a critical role to play in calling for climate justice"", he said. Following the dialogue, an interfaith service was held, reflecting on just transitions in the context of Poland, and featuring prayers and songs from various religious, spiritual and indigenous traditions. A single flame was lit to celebrate the start of Hanukkah. The event was co-organized by the WCC, Brahma Kumaris, Franciscans International, Dominicans for Justice and Peace, Quakers United Nations Office, Islamic Relief, GreenFaith, Religions for Peace, ICE Network, CIDSE and the Global Catholic Climate Movement.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA121","SIERRA CLUB STATEMENT ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE COP24 UN CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS","December 15, 2018 Saturday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Sierra Club: Today, the 24th annual UN Climate Negotiations ( COP24 ) concluded. During the talks, countries met to hash out the details of the Paris Agreement rulebook, which will provide guidance for the implementation of the landmark climate deal. To date, Donald Trump is still the only world leader to announce his intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016, has been signed by every nation on earth. The earliest Trump will be able to complete his withdrawal from the deal is November 4, 2020, one day after the next U.S. Presidential election. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: ""There's simply no debate; fossil fuels have no place in a liveable future. While Donald Trump may seek to further isolate the U.S. on the world stage, leaders from across the globe continue to work together to tackle the climate crisis. At a time when science makes it clear that we have only 12 years to deeply cut carbon pollution to avoid climate chaos, the climate negotiations have continued to bring the world together to move towards a sustainable climate and healthy communities. ""Following yet another year of devastating and historic hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts, it has been the unstoppable power of people that has continued to drive climate progress, from retiring more than half of the U.S. coal fleet to moving cities to 100 percent clean energy. The American people are joined by the rest of the world in signaling that they will not tolerate any more of Trump's shameful blustering and inaction, and they have taken up the mantle of climate action while Trump abdicates any semblance of global leadership. The Sierra Club is proud to continue to join with allies in the movement driving that progress and ensure the transition to clean energy leaves no one behind."" ### Despite the Trump administration's inaction on climate, progress has continued to march on in the halls of the COP24 climate negotiations and beyond. Here's a short recap of some of the progress the world made over the past two weeks that you may have missed: Over 300 elected officials from 40 U.S. states released a letter calling for a Green New Deal and an end to fossil fuel use. Cincinnati, Ohio became the United States' 100th city to transition to 100 percent clean energy. The current total for cities committed to 100 percent clean energy is up to 102, meaning over 15 percent of the U.S. population now lives in an area that is Ready For 100. 1,000 groups announce that they're divesting $8 trillion in assets out of fossil fuels. Washington Governor Jay Inslee introduced a new bill to transition the state to 100 percent clean energy by 2035. Colorado's Xcel Energy announced ambitious plans to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced that he's moving up the timeline for the city to become carbon neutral to 2030. Canada announced that they will have a more ambitious climate pledge by 2020. About the Sierra Club The Sierra Club is America's largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 3 million members and supporters. In addition to helping people from all backgrounds explore nature and our outdoor heritage, the Sierra Club works to promote clean energy, safeguard the health of our communities, protect wildlife, and preserve our remaining wild places through grassroots activism, public education, lobbying, and legal action.

Experts from the Overseas Development Institute will be attending the conference throughout the fortnight of meetings and will be available for interviews with media. Shelagh Whitley, head of the Climate and Energy Programme at ODI, said: 'Three years on from the Paris Agreement, governments are still failing to make sure investments and expenditure are consistent with reducing emissions and building climate resilience, which was one of the three key commitments made in 2015. 'With the recent UN warning that emissions are on track to exceed the 1.5C rise by 2030, it is imperative that all parties at COP24 work together to realign finance flows to meet this crucial commitment. 'Our research highlights four tools governments can use to realign finance towards low-carbon and climate resilient development. These include financial policies and regulations, fiscal policy levers, public finance and information instruments such as voluntary standards and labelling.' Rebecca Nadin, head of the Risk and Resilience programme at ODI, said: 'Adapting to climate change is a global issue that cannot continue to be dealt with piecemeal. This year's summit must move on from the business-as-usual approach of treating the way we adapt to climate change as a national or local issue only. 'Countries are already experiencing transboundary risks which can destabilise international supply chains, migration patterns, financial systems and shared ecosystems. It is crucial that regional and cross-border adaptation plans are part of efforts to build resilience to the worst effects of climate change.' ODI experts attending COP who will be available for interview include: Shelagh Whitley, head of the Climate and Energy Programme at ODI, will be at COP from Thursday, December 6 until December 12. Shelagh has recently written a report on how to make finance flows consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, which will be an important aspect of the discussions at this year's COP. Rebecca Nadin, head of the Risk and Resilience programme at ODI, will be at COP from Thursday, December 6 until Friday, December 14. Rebecca will be available to discuss issues including how the international community should use this year's COP to start to work together to meet the global challenge of adapting to climate change and challenge the consensus that this is an issue to be dealt with at a local and national level only.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA124","DECODING ARTICLE 6 OF THE COP24 CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS","December 14, 2018 Friday","IPS - Inter Press Service","It is close to curtain call for the United Nations' Climate Conference in Katowice, Poland, with ministers from around the world negotiating the text for a ""rulebook"" to implement the historic 2015 Paris Agreement for climate action. Amidst the various issues being debated, one of the most technical and complicated is Article 6 of the agreement, which focuses on the country plans for climate action. While the world has been having climate conferences since 1992, the tide turned with the Paris Agreement when all countries agreed to play their part to undertake climate action. ""Developing countries now have a strong political will to contribute to the greenhouse gas reduction,"" said Hyoeun Jenny Kim, Deputy Director General at the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an international organisation that promotes balancing economic growth without harming the environment. This political will was manifested in Paris with countries voluntarily submitting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for reducing carbon emissions and building climate resilience, taking into account their respective circumstances. ""But at the same time, they need support to affectively implement their NDCs,"" Kim said, at a side event at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which was organised by GGGI and focused on transparency and NDC implementation. In order to get support from outside, Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of a country's carbon emissions reduction is almost a precondition as many donor agencies and even private sector organisations want to know how much greenhouse gases a developing country is emitting before they make a decision to support it. ""MRV is key for developing countries to get access to financial, technical and capacity building support, and that's why we are supporting developing countries to set up more proper and internationally acceptable MRV scheme,"" Kim said. GGGI's interventions in this area include preparing a low emissions development strategy for Fiji, Colombia's national green growth strategy and Mongolia's national energy efficiency plan. The organisation is also working on building capacity to implement MRVs in various countries around the globe, including, Mozambique, Senegal, Nepal and Laos. ""We will continue to support our members and partners in their efforts of effectively implementing NDCs with robust MRVs, so they can access more finance,"" Kim said. ""We are committed to reminding countries that green growth can happen."" One of the speakers at the panel was Ariyaratne Hewage, Special Envoy of the President on Climate Change, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, in Sri Lanka, which is on track to become a member of the GGGI. He said Sri Lanka anticipates extensive support from GGGI in the years to come for its preparation of various project proposals to fight climate change. ""The present situation in Sri Lanka is severe droughts in one part of the country and heavy floods in another,"" Hewage said. During a 2016 survey conducted by the Bonn-based NGO Germanwatch, Sri Lanka was awarded the fourth place in terms of climate vulnerability. ""We are severely affected by climate change, so we are very keen in developing climate change programs to ensure these problems are properly addressed,"" Hewage said. The proposed emission reduction i.e. mitigation targets of Sri Lanka's NDCs include 30 percent reduction in the energy sector and 10 percent reduction in transport, industry and waste by 2030. ""For energy and transport sector we already have developed MRV systems, but for the other sectors - industry, waste, agriculture, livestock, forestry - we need help,"" he added. The need for support was also stressed by Ziaul Haque who leads the Bangladesh delegation's COP24 negotiations on Article 6. ""Our main issue is lack of capacity to address this enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement at both the institutional level and the individual level,"" said Haque, highlighting the need for accurate data. ""We need to bring data on green house gas emissions from different institutions and whether they are collecting and archiving the data in the right manner is an issue that needs to be looked at. In this regard our institutional arrangement is not very strong at the national level,"" he said, stating that strengthening the capacity of institutions and individuals who will be dealing with the transparency issue is crucial. Rajani Ranjan Rashmi, a Distinguished Fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and former Special Secretary of India's Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, said at the side event that one of the fundamental issues to deciding a transparency framework is that of flexibility. ""Developing countries should be able to make gradual progression on the quality of data,"" he said. ""We have so far not been able to agree in the discussions on this level of flexibility."" Moreover, whether the same guidelines regarding MRV of greenhouse gases should be applied to all countries is also an issue of contention at COP24 , he added. Jae Jung, Deputy Director of the Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center (GIR), another panelist at the side event, said having common metrics and structured summary is crucial. ""At this moment we don't have the final text of the Paris rulebook, but we do have a very clean text of the common metric with no bracket, so there might be agreement on that,"" Jung said. ""In terms of global stock take of emissions we don't have to have a common metric in our inventory. But when we do the global stock take every five years there has to be someone doing the conversion applying the same common metric to all countries' inventories,"" he added. He also stressed the importance of ""structured summary"" - a form of presentation of aggregated presentation of data that makes it possible to see the level of carbon emissions of one country - stating that helps to avoid double counting issue. ""There is opposition to structured summary because some parties want to use qualitative indicators and narrative descriptions of their NDCs,"" he said, ""But how does it make sense logically to have qualitative results when you have a quantitative target?"" One way to address the multifaceted challenges to NDC implementation would be through engagement of the private sector, according to experts. ""Many people think Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is about the market itself, but it is about increasing cooperation,"" said Dr. Suh-Young Chung, Director of Center for Climate and Sustainable Development Law and Policy (CSDLAP). ""If you look at the Paris landscape to meet the 2-degree Celsius temperature target, you realise it is not enough and you need to bring in private sector investment. And countries need to work together on this,"" he said, adding that Article 6 eventually needs to promote cooperation with the private sector, via incentive mechanism to engage businesses and addressing the risks they face. ""Article 6 is about bringing more opportunities for developing countries, but to do so, you need MRVs first,"" he said. \"

The deportations follow the enactment of national legislation earlier this year passed by the Polish Government in relation to the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC CoP24 ) currently underway in the southern city of Katowice, from 2 - 14 December 2018. Several United Nations human rights experts have publicly questioned the compatibility of the law with international human rights standards. ""The fact that these are not isolated instances are extremely worrying and we view the actions by the Polish border authorities in an extremely serious light"" Dr. Stephan Singer, Interim Executive Focal Point at Climate Action Network (CAN). CAN is a network comprising of more than 1,300 organisations working in over 120 countries. Under its network CAN convenes the largest share of environmental non-governmental organisations under the UN climate convention. ""The full and effective participation by civil society is entrenched in the Convention and, in fact, is imperative in our efforts to urgently transition to a new climate regime."" Several civil society organisations have registered strong objection to the incidents that occurred since the beginning of the UN conference. ""We strongly condemn the denial of entry and deportation of colleagues who have not been allowed into Poland in order to take part in COP24 . From what we understand the reasons for refusing entry are due to allegations that they are a 'threat to national security.' These staff members and volunteers are individuals committed to tackling the climate crisis the world faces through campaigning for sustainable solutions."" said May Boeve, Executive Director of 350.org. ""It is the belief of all of us at 350.org, and our partners, that the biggest threat that we face to our international and national security is that of not tackling the climate crisis and taking the urgent and necessary action to leave fossil fuels in the ground now. This is underscored in the recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5C Global Warming."" The voices of those denied entry to COP24 are essential to the unfolding climate talks and it is unacceptable that their presence at the climate talks should be impeded in this way.

After a long and complex debate, they have found a consensus on the rulebook for the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. We are grateful to the leaders from States and other stakeholders who contributed to this multilateral dialogue and the writing of the rulebook. The consensus on the final document, rather complex and technically detailed, represents a confirmation of the commitments made three years ago in Paris and of the significance of multilateralism. Unfortunately, we must also note that the rulebook does not adequately reflect the urgency necessary to tackle climate change, which ""represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day"" (LS, 25). Moreover, the rulebook seems to downplay human rights, critical in reflecting the human face of climate change, which affects the most vulnerable people on earth. Their cry and that of the earth demand more ambition and greater urgency. The Holy See Delegation, led by the Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, explained that advancing the dignity of the human person, alleviating poverty by the promotion of integral human development, and easing the impact of climate change through responsible mitigation and adaptation measures go hand in hand. We need a just transition period with all parties assuming their respective responsibilities according to the principle of equity. As the IPCC Special Report issued in October 2018 distressingly indicated, we are called to limit responsibly the average global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Therefore, we encourage much greater ambition in delivering Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and stronger mechanisms toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, managing the decarbonisation of the current fossil fuel-based economy, transparently sharing the way each nation implements its commitments, addressing the issue of loss and damage, ensuring solid financial commitments, and promoting education in sustainability, responsible awareness, and lifestyle changes. Faith and reason must come together enabling us to make positive choices in our lifestyles, in how our economies are run, and in building a true global solidarity necessary to avert this climate crisis. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA129","COP24 And The Silesia Declaration: Impact On Palm Oil - Analysis","December 29, 2018 Saturday","Eurasia Review","The negotiations in the recently concluded COP24 in Katowice produced a critical rulebook for the 2015 Paris Agreement. Equally important is the Silesia Declaration signed during the conference. It exhorted relevant stakeholders to ensure a just transition for segments of populations affected by climate agenda. By Margareth Sembiring The latest round of climate negotiations at the COP24 (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) in Katowice, Poland recently highlighted the perennial tension between environmental and economic concerns. This was evidenced in one key point of contention surrounding the position of oil-producing countries namely the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait that did not wish to ""welcome"" the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5oC launched in October 2018. Instead, they were only willing to take ""note"" of it. Indeed, the tension between caring for the environment and ensuring income streams has to date failed to halt the Earth's temperature from increasing. Environmental vs Economic Concerns: The Silesia Declaration Considering these countries' reliance on fossil fuels for their national revenues, it is not too difficult to understand their reluctance to fully sign up to the report. The fossil fuels sector is believed to be the main culprit behind the changing climate. Climate mitigation efforts that are commonly referred to as, among others, low-carbon economy and sustainable development normally target this sector. They often suggest a transformation towards the use of cleaner energy such as renewable energy sources. Although the solutions seem straightforward, the mechanisms behind them are less so. Not only such transition entails economic risks for countries that have thus far relied on fossil fuels for domestic growth, it may also mean a loss of livelihoods for a large number of people who have depended on the sector for a living. This concern was captured in the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration championed by the host Polish government. Poland currently uses coal to produce about 80% of its electricity and it aims to reduce coal use as part of its efforts to fight climate change. While getting onboard of climate actions, it also recognises the need to address the issues surrounding potentially-affected workforce. Most notably, the Silesia Declaration emphasises the need for ""creation of decent work and quality jobs"" for segments of society that will have to transfer to other sectors or lose their sources of income because of the climate agenda. This will facilitate a successful transition to low carbon and climate resilient economy. In light of the tension between environmental and economic concerns, this is arguably one of the most critical aspects that states and relevant stakeholders must address to fully embrace sustainable development. The Silesia Declaration is not the first to highlight its importance. In 2015, the International Labour Organization (ILO) published ""Guidelines for a Just Transition towards Environmentally Sustainable Economies and Societies for All."" The document recommends comprehensive reforms in areas such as macroeconomic and growth policies, industrial and sectoral policies, enterprise policies, skills development, occupational safety and health, social protection, active labour market policies, rights, social dialogue and tripartism to allow states and societies embrace sustainable economies. However, under the shadow of other negotiated materials for the rulebook for the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was the main agenda of the COP24 , this critical concern seems to fall out of priority with only 54 leaders and parties signing the declaration. Case of EU and Palm Oil One example that can illustrate the urgency of such just transition is the case of the European Union (EU)'s plan to phase out palm oil use for its biofuel production by 2030. The Resolution that the EU Parliament passed in April 2017 clearly cited the environmental woes associated with palm oil plantations as the basis for such decision. These included deforestation, forest fires, biodiversity loss, and climate change. As the world's biggest palm oil producers, Malaysia and Indonesia reacted to the plan. They pointed out to the potential economic repercussions especially increased unemployment and poverty. Subsequent revised Renewable Energy Directive (REDII) agreed by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU in June 2018 in the end ascertained that palm oil imports to the EU will neither be banned nor restricted, but emphasising instead on the need to improve and clarify the sustainability of the sources. The dynamics at the international level coincided with the plunging global price of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) that has continued since mid-2017. Consequently in Indonesia, the price of palm oil fresh fruit bunches went down to Rp 600 (SGD 6 cents) per kg in November 2018. For smallholder farmers who accounted for about 40% of total Indonesian oil palm acreage, this was a devastating news as the sales of fresh fruit bunches can barely cover the costs of production. In response to increasingly anxious small farmers whose income mostly come from their palm oil crops, President Joko Widodo recently advised them to discontinue growing palm oil and plant other commodities like coffee, bitter bean and mangosteen instead. Notwithstanding other aspects, the proposed ban has largely been perceived as a major factor that contributed to the price downward trend. Indonesia and elsewhere remain uncertain for now, this case highlights the importance of a just transition that bridges environmental and economic concerns. Under climate actions, certain sectors like the fossil fuels and palm oil are under strong pressures to either go greener or lose market share. When millions of people depend on these affected sectors for their livelihood, it is critical that the right preparations are put in place to ensure that they can continue to live a decent life. Despite a lack of limelight, the Silesia Declaration therefore sent a very important message for states and relevant stakeholders to follow up.

The event will be attended by nearly 30,000 delegates from all over the world, including heads of governments and ministers responsible for the environment and climate issues. Two of the region's lead negotiators say the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) must be present, given that the plan for the COP24 summit to adopt a full package implementing the Paris Agreement. ""I agree with the saying that if you're not at the table then you're on the menu, and our priorities will suffer. We've got to be there to ensure that the special circumstances and unique vulnerabilities of small island states are protected. We need to be there for that,"" Spencer Thomas, Grenada's Special Envoy for Multilateral Environmental Agreements, told IPS. ""I think we need to be there to ensure that the resources are available to address the scourge of climate change, to build resilience in the Caribbean region. We need to be there to ensure that significant mitigation actions are taken in line with the 1.5 report. We need to be there to ensure that adaptation efforts are of the level to ensure that we have real activities on that line."" The Paris Agreement is the first international agreement in history, which compels all countries in the world to take action on climate protection. The implementation package will allow for the implementation of the agreement in practice. It will thus set global climate and energy policy for the coming years. Thomas pointed to recent devastating hurricanes and their impact on the region, saying the Caribbean must attend the COP to work towards resilience building, to make progress on; the issue of loss and damage, and the issue of technology development, especially since it relates to the changing energy sector. ""So, we need to be there to protect all of those gains that we have made so far and to consolidate our actions going forward in terms of climate action for the Caribbean,"" he said. ""Resilience is key. Building resilience across the Caribbean or across all Small Island Developing States is a key issue we need to be working on at the COP."" Thomas said the Paris Agreement is a framework agreement, setting out the platform for global action on climate change. He said the Paris Agreement deals specifically with the framework for mitigation, but also has a framework for adaptation, a framework for loss and damage, a framework for gender, a framework for agriculture, one for transparency, and it also has a technology framework. ""In my view, what needs to be done now is for us to elaborate and to implement those frameworks and to create the rules and guidelines for those frameworks,"" Thomas explains. ""So, in a sense, it is the platform for going forward. It changed the dynamics of the previous negotiations and it has centralised the issues, to the extent that all parties now, all countries have taken a commitment based on their own domestic situation to deal with the issue of climate change."" Meanwhile, Leon Charles, Advisor in Grenada's Ministry of Environment, said there are two outcomes that will result from the 2018 negotiations. He said the first is the elaboration of the framework for implementation of the Paris Agreement. ""The last two years we spent elaborating on what are these day-to-day rules to implement the agreement. So, for example, in terms of the national contributions of countries, we're negotiating how should these contributions be defined; what information should be presented so that we can actually measure that people have done what they said they are going to do. Then how do you report on what you said you're going to do, how is it validated and so on,"" Charles told IPS. ""There's a system called the compliance system for example, how do we measure whether or not countries have delivered what they said they were going to deliver, and more importantly, what's going to happen to those who have not met their targets. We're supposed to come up with something that's facilitative and should help them in future years to improve their targets."" Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa says with the devastating impacts of climate change increasingly evident throughout the world, it's crucial that parties achieve the primary goal of the COP24 : finalising the Paris Agreement Work Programme. This will not only unleash the full potential of the Paris Agreement, but send a signal of trust that nations are serious about addressing climate change, she said. Like Thomas, Charles agrees that it is important that the Caribbean is represented at the COP24 . \"

But Climate Activists we'll be on the Ground in Poland because Painting a Picture of a better Future, one in which we take down Big Oil and do everything we can to help those Devastated by Climate Change, is Key to making Progress towards Climate Justice.Partners from every Corner of the Globe will Demonstrate a Groundswell of Support for the People's Demands, a Joint Global Call to Governments Demanding that this year's Climate Talks actually Lead to Meaningful and Just Climate Solutions that will keep Fossil Fuels in the Ground and Protect the most Vulnerable.We've seen in years past that when We Speak with One Voice, we can make Real Progress and Change the Conversation. The People's Demands for Climate Justice have been shaped by Peoples' Movements from Dozens of Countries where Climate Change is making Ordinary Life Impossible. We're joining Hundreds of Partner Organizations to come Together and make a Clear, Unmistakable Demand for Climate Justice.The People's Demands:- Keep Fossil Fuels in the Ground. - Reject False Solutions and Advance Real Solutions that are Just, Feasible, and Essential. - Honor Climate Finance Obligations to Developing Countries.- End Corporate Interference In and Capture of the Climate Talks. - Ensure Rich Countries Honor their 'Fair Shares' for largely Fueling this Crisis.Already, Big Polluters and their Allies are Working to Block Progress at this year's Climate Talks at COP24 . Corporations like Exxon and Shell have Profited Enormously from Driving the Climate Crisis, they don't want Real Change. And in the U.S., the Largest Historical Contributor to Climate Change and One of the World's Biggest Producers of Fossil Fuels, the Trump Administration is Lining up yet again to Promote Deadly Fossil Fuels and Wreck any Chance of Progress.The World's Leading Climate Scientists tell us we have just 12 years to Avoid the Worst Effects of Climate Change. Deadly Wildfires are Raging in California and Monster Typhoons are Tearing through Countries in Asia.CLICK HERE[2] to Sign onto the People's Demands for Climate Justice and Bolster Our Call for Real, People-First Solutions like a Managed Decline of the Fossil Fuel Industry and a Just Transition to Renewable Energy for All.Towards a Brighter Vision!NYC Wins When Everyone Can Vote!

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA134","World faces 'impossible' task at post-Paris climate talks","November 30, 2018 Friday 12:06 AM EST","Digital Journal","Nov 29, 2018( Digital Journal: HYPERLINK http://www.digitaljournal.com COP24 [4] partners> \~ HYPERLINK https://t.co/Ql7crty8yZhttps https://t.co/Ql7crty8yZhttps The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reportThe conference is vastly overshadowed by the climate report [9]issued on October 8 by the IPCC. The Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its gloomy report at a meeting in Incheon, South Korea, with the warning that time is running out if the world wants to keep warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The pledges nations made in the Paris agreement in 2015 are 'clearly insufficient to limit warming to 1.5 in any way,' one of the study's lead authors, Joerj Roeglj of the Imperial College in London, said. The world has already seen one-degree Celsius rise in temperatures since the start of the industrial age. The Katowice Conference [10]will have 'quite significant consequences for humanity and for the way in which we take care of our planet,' Kurtyka told the Associated Press ahead of the talks. This is because the Paris agreement let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. And this is a problem. The conference also comes at a time when the World Meteorological Organization[11] released a statement last week saying globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide [12]reached 405.5 parts per million in 2017, up slightly from the previous year and from 400.1 in 2015. Concentrations of other heat-trapping gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, also rose. This year, the world can expect a 2-3 percent increase in carbon human-made emissions as the construction of coal-fired power plants in Asia and Africa continue while carbon-absorbing rainforests in the Amazon and Asia are felled faster than they can regrow. 'Everyone recognized that the national plans, when you add everything up, will take us way beyond 3, potentially 4 degrees Celsius warming,' said Johan Rockstrom, the incoming director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. 'We know that we're moving in the wrong direction,' Rockstrom told the AP. 'We need to bend the global carbon emissions no later than 2020  in two years' time  to stand a chance to stay under 2 degrees Celsius.' In the last few months people all over the world have lost their lives and homes to horrific wildfires fuelled by #climatechange[13]. Time to stop the fires. Time to stop burning fossil fuels. pic.twitter.com/lqIqADX7p6[14]  Climate News Hub (@ClimateNewsHub) November 29, 2018[15]The key challenge in KatowiceIt will be a challenge convincing countries to set tougher targets - and stick to them to get us past 2020. And it will require a transformation in all sectors of their economies, including energy, agriculture, and other industries. And we really have to do away with fossil fuels to make the transition work. Countries will also need to get past the argument that large industrial countries should be paying more than small or poorer nations for mediating the impacts of climate change. Rich countries say they're willing to lead the way, but only if poor nations play their part as well. 'Obviously not all countries are at the same stage of development,' said Lidia Wojtal, an associate with Berlin-based consultancy Climatekos and a former Polish climate negotiator. 'So we need to also take that into account and differentiate between the responsibilities. And that's a huge task.' All in all, in the three years since the climate agreement was drawn up, there have been critics from different parts of the political spectrum trying their best to diminish its importance on a global scale. But the agreement should be defended for many reasons, primarily because of what former U.S. President Barack Obama said in 2015. The Paris Agreement may prove to be 'the best chance we have to save the one planet we've got.' Don't expect to see President Donald Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin at the conference that is expected to have nearly 40,000 guests from 200 countries. According to Russian News Agency, Tass,[16] Putin is not planning to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland's Katowice on December 2-15, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. ""The president's schedule does not have this [event],"" Peskov said, noting that Russia may be represented at this conference by a government official. As for the U.S., Trump is using the conference to illustrate the importance of pushing ""clean coal.""[17] Proponents of coal and natural gas will dominate the panel, which will also likely feature a U.S. Energy Department representative. There are no plans to include a representative for the green energy industry.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA136","COP24: We have solutions, now we need to stand united on climate action","December 6, 2018 Thursday 9:05 AM EST","ACTmedia News","Dec 05, 2018( ACTmedia News: HYPERLINK http://actmedia.eu http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex) This month, all eyes are on the Polish city of Katowice, where the global climate community is meeting for COP24 . Katowice is an important step to make the Paris Agreement a success by defining a robust transparency and accountability system to track progress towards the long-term goal, writes Bernard Respaut n euroactiv.com. Bernard Respaut is the chief executive of the European Copper Institute. The summit comes on the heels of a long-anticipatedreportby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C, we need rapid and far-reaching transitions in buildings and cities, energy, industry, land and transport. Global carbon emissions would have to fall by as much as 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050. We therefore need to decarbonise together, now. The European Parliament hascalled onworld leaders to strengthen their post-2020 climate commitments and mobilise adequate climate financing for developing countries. Beyond strengthening commitments, though, we must implement them, and COP24 will be crucial in providing a 'real time' overview of how far committed partners have come with actioning their goals. Europe should continue to lead the charge, but it is imperative the rest of the world follows. Copper: the metal of the energy transition The good news is we have solutions, and copper is central to many. It is the metal of the energy transition, facilitating production of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency in products and systems, and supporting the electrification of transport, heating and cooling. Based on the EU's 2050 scenario, we estimate the energy transition may increase demand for copper by up to 6-times (approx. 25 million tonnes in 2050). This makes recycling pivotal and, fortunately, a well-established recycling chain already exists, enabling the endless reuse of copper. The copper industry is energy intensive. Energy makes up 20-30 percent of production costs, meaning it is vulnerable to increasing energy and climate costs. To preserve the production of copper and other raw materials in Europe, and unleash their many benefits supporting climate solutions in addition to the jobs and growth associated with a sector in growing demand we need a legislative framework that supports their continued contribution. Key to that is a level playing field with other developed or transitioning nations, such as the USA or China, when it comes to energy and climate costs. Energy efficiency: widening the scope As economic growth and urbanisation demand ever more energy, using it efficiently is pivotal. A recentreportby the International Energy Agency shows that without energy efficiency policies, we would have consumed 12% more energy and produced 12% more greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. It also found there is substantial potential to save more. To achieve our full energy saving potential, however, global annual energy efficiency investments must double by 2025 and double again by 2040. Recently, the implementation of energy efficiency measures hasslowed, and European policies are not delivering the greatest possible energy savings. Yet significant opportunities remain, including in the EU energy system. The scope of EU energy efficiency policy should be widened to include measures in all energy-using sectors, and implement some more complex measures offering significant energy savings, such as building automation and electrification of heat and transport. These savings can be realised at costs well below the price of energy supply, and thus make great financial sense. They are also important in an increasingly renewable energy system. Connecting solutions through copper Products containing copper tend to operate more efficiently, with typical cost-effective reductions in energy use in the range of 20-30% t. Copper is thus a connector to energy efficiency solutions, and it also connects on a policy level. In 2017, the European Copper Institute launchedDecarbEurope: an initiative bringing together partners from across sectors and markets to facilitate a truly low-carbon economy by presenting an integrated vision for how to achieve a deep, cost-effective, circular-oriented and consumer-centric energy transition. As DecarbEurope, we believe decarbonisation will only happen through a symbiosis of policy and business, so we bring tangible solutions to the table showing how that transition could look. One example is sector coupling: the development of multiple integration vectors such as electricity, bioenergy, cogeneration, hydrogen and district heating, to name a few. European leadership The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement represents an opportunity for Europe to lead by example on global climate action. The new EU strategy for long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions can provide a robust framework that if effectively implemented could make a significant contribution to the Paris goals. With this year's COP24 summit being held in a major European mining and industrial region, it is more relevant than ever to discuss the key role of raw materials in mitigating climate change. For Europe to successfully lead global action on climate change, we need more dialogue, collaboration and joined up efforts across sectors. We need not one but many solutions, that together allow us to meet our Paris Agreement commitments and stay competitive in the long term. The copper industry has some of the solutions, and we are committed to finding and implementing more. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA138","MENENDEZ DELIVERS FLOOR SPEECH ON COP24 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE NEGOTIATIONS; ""IT IS COMPLETELY ABSURD TO ASSUME THAT THE U.S., BY WITHDRAWING FROM THE PARIS ....","December 11, 2018","Congressional Documents and Publications","WASHINGTON - Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered a speech on the Senate Floor on the ongoing negotiations at COP 24 - the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference - where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue. In calling for the President to reconsider his calamitous decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, Menendez described how New Jersey, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is already doing its part as a national leader for clean energy jobs and climate change resilience. Below are his remarks as delivered: ""Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice, Poland to finalize the rulebook on implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality. For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable. Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone. That includes reports from the world's top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts. What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American. There's a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly--the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract. Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises. Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy. While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable. It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8[degrees] Celsius (1.4[degrees] Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks. It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average--the highest annual average in the satellite record. None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, 'We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.' This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week. Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement's entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures. The Paris Agreement also clearly outlined robust and transparent reporting, so that parties can hold each other accountable via diplomatic engagement as opposed to binding legal punishment. Of course, success comes down to execution. That is what makes the development of the implementation rulebook so consequential, and President Trump's decision to abandon the Paris Agreement so antithetical to our own interests. The current administration's wholesale rejection of meaningful engagement with the global community is disturbingly naive and is bound to result in repeating past mistakes and detrimental outcomes. China is emboldened by President Trump's plan to abandon the Paris Agreement. China effectively slowed progress at COP23 and will continue its efforts. In the leadership vacuum President Trump has created, China is stepping in to write the rules. It is completely absurd to assume that the U.S., by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, is somehow immune to the global economic implications of climate change. The President couched his decision to abdicate American leadership regarding the Paris Agreement as putting 'America First' in a June 2017 announcement riddled with inaccurate characterizations of the Paris Agreement and £lternative facts' on climate change. There is no truthful, factual, or reality-based argument to justify how allowing every country in the world, except the United States, to build the clean energy economy of the future and confront our most pressing global challenge puts America First. Continued U.S. leadership and climate diplomacy can only yield economic benefits for United States workers. More than 900 U.S. businesses support keeping the United States in the Paris Agreement, including more than 20 Fortune 500 companies. Acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for New Jersey and our Nation. I am proud to say that New Jersey is a national leader in deploying clean energy technologies, creating clean energy jobs, and planning and investing in climate change resilience. New Jersey is home to 417 solar energy manufacturing and installation companies employing more than 7,000 workers. New Jersey is also competing hard to become the first mid-Atlantic state to produce offshore wind energy, supported by the recent enactment of legislation establishing a 3,500 megawatt production goal for offshore wind energy. New Jersey has also recently increased its renewable energy standard to 50% by 2030 and set a new state carbon emissions reduction goal of 80% by 2050. New Jersey's leadership among the states working to combat climate change is rooted in our vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The fact is, if we continue on our current emissions trajectory the world could see global average temperature increase by 3 degrees Celsius. This would devastate New Jersey, risking $800 billion in coastal property value, along with the health, security, and livelihoods of millions of our residents. The potential losses from sea level rise, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather associated with climate change would cost my state's economy billions in economic losses. Just yesterday, the Star Ledger - a statewide paper -published a column by Robert Kopp, the director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, highlighting many of these consequences, as outlined by the recent National Climate Assessment. Our winters have been warming faster than our summers. Pests like the pine beetle and ash borer are no longer kept in check by winter freezes. Perhaps even more alarmingly we've seen our crops begin to bud earlier and earlier, only to see them decimated by cold snaps later in the season. In the Garden State, famous for our tomatoes, cranberry bogs, blueberries, and other specialty crops, that's a big deal. As temperatures rise, we also expect to see a surge in heat-related deaths and illnesses due to allergies and asthma, while disease carrying bugs like mosquitos and ticks thrive in increased seasonal moisture. And of course, perhaps the clearest threat to New Jersey from climate change comes in the form of coastal flooding from sea level rise and extreme weather events. We saw it with Superstorm Sandy, and we understand the devastating consequences it can have for our families, our communities, and our infrastructure. There is no convincing me that ignoring climate change and walking away from the world's only mechanism for holding countries like India, China, and Russia accountable for their emissions puts New Jersey First. Proof of the Administration's political favoritism for fossil fuels is exemplified by the only U.S. government sponsored event at COP24 in Poland titled: 'The Future of Coal'. Never mind how insulting and tone deaf it is to sponsor an event to promote dirty, coal-powered energy at a climate change conference, while countries like the Marshall Islands, Maldives, Mongolia, and Mozambique--that face existential crises from climate change-- look on. Even more than that, this public forum flaunts the administration's wholesale sellout to the industries the government is tasked with regulating. It also shows this administration's contempt for the U.S.'s booming renewable energy sector, which according to Trump's own Department of Energy, employs more Americans than the U.S. fossil fuel industries, by a five-to-one ratio. All told, nearly 1 million Americans work in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors. That equals nearly 5 times the number of workers employed in the fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and oil workers. As Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I believe climate diplomacy must be a priority for U.S. foreign policy. Climate change poses an imminent and long-term threat--not just to U.S. national security, but also to the long-term prosperity of this country and of our world. Addressing the crisis requires collective action and cooperation by local and national representatives, small and large businesses, and every one of us. If the U.S. is to maintain our status as the world's super power, it is in our best interest to lead the global cooperative effort to address the serious challenges posed by climate change, and to promote stability and resilience by helping developing countries reduce their vulnerability to the effects of climate change. If we stand alone on the sidelines as these changes in international economics take shape we will ultimately be the loser. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on the administration to continue advancing U.S. climate diplomacy and reconsider the decision to withdraw. It is essential to U.S. national security interests--as defined by our own Department of Defense--and growing U.S. economic opportunity.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA139","Poland and UNECE Raise Awareness About the Benefits of Wood As a Low-Emission Construction Material at COP24","December 12, 2018 Wednesday 6:41 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe issued the following news release: The 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), taking place in Katowice, Poland, from 2 to 14 December 2018, is discussing global action to reduce emissions and keep global warming within the temperature limits of the Paris Agreement. While negotiations take place, a number of events focus on practical solutions to help humanity face the challenge. In this context, UNECE is raising awareness of the role that wood can play in cutting down emissions when replacing more carbon-intensive materials in the construction sector. This takes the form of a cartoon entitled ""The Three Little Pigs and Climate Change"", jointly developed with the Polish Ministry of the Environment and State Forests Poland, which revisits the classic fairy-tale. In this new version, it is no longer the wolf that threatens the life of the three little pigs, but climate change - a scarier and stronger adversary. The cartoon, made for a young audience, contains messages for all ages alike. It reminds us that carbon emissions of concrete and steel respectively are 40 and 30 percent higher than those of wood. It highlights that global CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to 31 percent if builders used wood instead of steel and concrete. This would reduce global fossil fuel consumption by 12 to 19 percent. ""It was time to change the narrative on buildings and climate change, starting from the little tales we tell our children"" said Ms. Paola Deda, Officer in Charge of the Forests, Land and Housing Division of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, while launching the cartoon in Katowice. ""We cannot continue telling the same stories; climate change is changing needs, habits, solutions and indeed, also fairy tales that cannot longer afford promoting unsustainable ways of life"", she concluded. ""We are proud of this cartoon, as it highlights the connection between our choices and their impact on their environment, in the context of climate change. The COP24 in Katowice is also about raising awareness of solutions, and sustainable paths to reduce the climate change thereat"" said Mr. Andrzej Konieczny, Director General of the State Forests Poland, at the launching event. ""And we are happy this video about buildings is presented in an event dedicated to forests: wood continues to be a sustainable material and it will be increasingly the choice of the future for smart and energy efficient buildings"", concluded Mr. Konieczny.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA142","POOR PROGRESS AND NO FINANCE COMMITMENTS AT COP24 IN KATOWICE","December 8, 2018 Saturday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change is in limbo as developed countries remain noncommittal to financial obligations at the ongoing negotiations in Katowice, Poland. Professor Seth Osafo, the Advisor to the Africa Group of Negotiators (AGN), said today, Dec. 8, that his colleagues from the developed world were shifting goals to put the burden of financing the implementation of the Paris Agreement on the private sector. Osafo was addressing the Pan African Parliament and civil society organisations under the umbrella of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) during COP 24 . The Paris Agreement is an agreement reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, France, where the world's nations undertook a determined course to reduce climate change. Among the commitments was to keep the increase in global temperatures under 2 degrees Celcius. Osafo's concerns were confirmed by Mohamed Nasr, Chair of the AGN. He said that during this past week there had been very little progress with regards to financial commitments from the developed world to address loss and damages related to past injustices, adaptation, gender equality, and the empowerment of women, among other issues. The seeking of a commitment from developed nations on this is being spearheaded by the African team. ""The progress so far is not up to expectations, and if this is the way [negotiations will] go, it means we will not be able to implement what we agreed to in Paris,"" said Nasr. ""We should not choose parts of the agreement to implement and leave other parts behind,"" he told IPS in an interview on Friday. Despite the challenges, a document for negotiation must be drawn up by tonight. This past week, negotiators representing different Parties (countries) have been discussing the outline of what is known as the 'Rulebook' for the Paris Agreement. This includes the rules, procedures and guidelines that countries should follow to enable them implement the Paris Agreement at national level. The outcome of the week-long negotiations will then be submitted to ministers of the various countries on Monday for deliberations to decide whether or not to adopt positions taken by technical teams. ""We are hoping that we will finish drafting the rules of implementation today, so that we have a document to show to the ministers when they arrive for political engagements next week,"" said Osafo. Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries committed to availing 100 billion dollars by 2020 to finance implementation of the accord through the Green Climate Fund (GCF). However, there have been setbacks. During the Paris negotiations the United States, which is considered to be one of the main polluters of the environment, pledged to deposit three billion dollars to the GCF. Under former President Barrack Obama's administration, the country delivered one billion dollars. But since President Donald Trump assumed power he has rejected the agreement, adding that climate change is a hoax. At the Katowice negotiations, the U.S. and the European Union are asking for a Rulebook that will not demand they divulge the exact amounts of money they provide to poorer nations for climate finance, especially to cater for loss and damages. This has not gone down well with African civil society organisations who have demanded the fulfilment of the pre-2020 climate finance commitments at the onset of the negotiations earlier this week. ""We see a clear intent from the developed country parties to shift their convention obligations on the provision of climate finance to private institutions and, worse still, to developing countries. This is not, and will not be, acceptable,"" said Mithika Mwenda, the Executive Director at PACJA. ""If it continues like this, we will be forced to protest or even pull out from the negotiations altogether,"" he told IPS. Augustine Njamshi, the executive director of the Bioresources Development and Conservation Programme in Cameroon, said: ""We have no option, but to use all available means to make things happen."" ""A man who is drowning has no luxury of a choice. Africa is drowning and we have no choice, other than using all means to salvage the continent,"" he told IPS. Nasr said that the African negotiators have been forced to send messages through informal discussions with colleagues from the developed world to salvage the situation. ""We are just telling them that if we do not have the components that we have asked for, the package will not be for Africa, and Africa will not be part of it,"" he said. \"

The group reminded the political leaders that the current federal plan will not allow us to reach our Paris climate targets and that the conclusions of the latest IPCC report must be respected if we are to mitigate the climate crisis. The IPCC report highlights that we have 12 years left to act. Global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 C and avoid catastrophic climate change (). In Canada, we are far from reaching the GHG emissions reduction target that we set for 2030, and the current target falls short by 66 million tonnes of CO2. The welcoming committee called for Canada to adopt much more ambitious targets and a plan of action that respects climate science and Indigenous rights, and that will lead us towards a just transition for all workers, youth and future generations. The committee also demanded that Premiers recognize that decreasing oil and gas production is necessary if Canada is to comply with the Paris Agreement and avoid a massive increase in extreme weather patterns, a phenomenon that we are already seeing all over Canada.

We cannot allow our politicians to sell our futures to oil companies, to jeopardize the health of our planet, and to further endanger the nations most vulnerable to climate change. It's our future that's at risk."" Patrick Bonin, Climate &#38; Energy campaigner with Greenpeace Canada: "" Heat waves, wildfires and extreme weather are becoming more frequent and intense. They will only worsen if no real action is taken. Our Premiers can still save the situation if they act immediately. They bear a very heavy responsibility on their shoulders and they cannot back out now, especially not after the UNEP's report just underlined, a couple of days back, that countries must work five times harder if they care to respect climate science and limit global warming to a 1,5 C."" Aurore Fauret, Tar Sands Campaign Coordinator with 350.org : ""We've run out of time to implement small changes and incremental solutions to climate change. We need a bold, progressive vision for tackling climate change, supporting workers through the transition and living up to promises of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. We need something like the Green New Deal, or a Good Work Guarantee that will transform Canada from one of the world's highest per capita emitters into a real climate leader."" Footnotes:  The First Ministers meeting takes place a few days after the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) published a report showing that countries' current ambition level ""must be almost tripled if aiming for a 2 C scenario and multiplied by five if aiming for a 1.5 C scenario.  In Quebec, 50,000 people participated in a climate march on November 10 in Montreal; 250,000 signed the Transition Pact; more than 200 municipalities representing more than half of Quebec's population have adopted a climate emergency declaration.

The summit -- COP24 , for the 24th convening of the Conference of the Parties -- will discuss a myriad of climate-related issues, like U.S. President 's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris agreement and complaints from Brazil under president-elect Jair Bolsonaro. ""This is the most important COP since the signing of the [Paris] agreement, and we need initiatives like yours to testify that governments, the private sector and individuals can work together to tackle climate change by committing to multilateralism,"" Ovais Sarmad, U.N. climate change deputy executive secretary, said in a statement Monday. The World Meteorological Organization reported last week the global temperature has continued to rise to its fourth highest on record. It pointed out the 20 warmest years have been seen in the past 22 years. That's sparked a rise in sea levels, record ocean heat and acidification and sea ice and glacier melting at an accelerated pace. Michal Kurtyka, COP 24 president and Polish secretary of state, noted his country's coal dependence and called for a ""just transition"" to aid Poland and other governments to change. ""The world is a global village,"" Kurtyka said. ""We are all interdependent and need to come together to protect our planet. The world needs solidarity to pursue a path of just transition. The first step is to change the way we think, the way we move around and the way we consume."" U.N. General Secretary said in a report by CNN more needs to be done -- sooner rather than later -- because ""climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late.""

As the Washington Post[1] explains, ignoring Climate Change won't make it go away: Global emissions of carbon dioxide have reached the highest levels on record, scientists projected Wednesday, in the latest evidence of the chasm between international goals for combating climate change and what countries are doing The expected increase, which would bring fossil fuel and industrial emissions to a record high of 37.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, is being driven by nearly 5 percent emissions growth in China and more than 6 percent in India, researchers estimated, along with growth in many other nations throughout the world. Emissions by the United States grew 2.5 percent, while emissions by the European Union declined by just under 1 percent. As nations are gathered for climate talks in Poland, the message of Wednesday's report was unambiguous: When it comes to promises to begin cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change, the world remains well off target. 'We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change,' [Pols emphasis] United Nations Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said this week at the opening of the 24th annual U.N. climate conference, where countries will wrestle with the ambitious goals they need to meet to sharply reduce carbon emissions in coming years.As the World Health Organization[2] explains, the damage we are doing to our planet is being reflected back upon us in turn: A WHO report launched today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland highlights why health considerations are critical to the advancement of climate action and outlines key recommendations for policy makers. Exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. [Pols emphasis] In the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP. Actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around 1% of global GDP 'The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself,' says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. 'When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost.' President Trump has made it abundantly clear that he doesn't believe in Climate Change (or, really, in science in general), so the United States is probably going to need a new President if it hopes to see action to mitigate the problem. Climate Change as a political issue has not generally driven people to the polls in large margins, but as more information like the above studies become widely available, that may shift. Perhaps it is time we stop talking about 'Climate Change' as something that is being doneto the earth and start framing it according to the harm we are doing to each other. What we're experiencing now is 'Human Change.'

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA148","STEPPING UP ON CLIMATE AT COP24","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the World Bank: New WBG climate targets. Kicking off COP, the WBG announced a major new set of climate targets for 2021-2025, more than doubling current 5-year investments to around $200 billion in support for countries to take ambitious climate action.WB CEO, Kristalina Georgieva, made the announcement at the packed opening plenaryPhoto Credit: Kaia Rose, World Bank/Connect4Climate It was warmly received during the session, with a spontaneous round of applause, and was referenced multiple times in plenary speeches and side events as a major boost for greater ambition.The new plan significantly boosts support for adaptation and resilience, recognizing mounting climate change impacts on lives and livelihoods, especially in the world's poorest countries. By ramping up direct adaptation finance to reach around $50 billion over 2021-2025, the World Bank will, for the first time, give this equal emphasis alongside investments that reduce emissions. MDB Alignment and a Dedicated Pavilion. Nine MDBs the African Development Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank Group, the Islamic Development Bank, the New Development Bank, and the World Bank Group issued a declaration announcing a joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement, reinforcing their commitment to combat climate change.The MDBs plan to break the joint approach down into practical work on six core Paris Alignment areas, including ramping up climate finance, capacity building support for countries and other clients, and an emphasis on climate reporting. At next year's COP25 gathering, the MDBs will report back on their progress with the six building blocks.For the first time, the World Bank, along with six other MDBs and the CIFs shared a dedicated pavilion. The common space served as a convening and networking hub to promote, discuss and share climate solutions with global leaders, media and online influencers. It also hosted popular daily Facebook Live interviews.Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, during a speech at the MDB Joint Pavilion. Photo Credits: Kaia Rose, Connect4Climate A Significant Boost for Climate-Smart Development in Sectors. For cities: A new IFC report was published which found that cities in emerging markets alone could attract more than $29.4 trillion in climate-related investments in six key sectors by 2030. It analyzed cities' climate-related targets and action plans in six regions and identified opportunities in priority sectors such as green buildings, public transportation, electric vehicles, waste, water, and renewable energy. For energy: According to the new RISE report, the number of countries with strong policy frameworks for sustainable energy more than tripled from 17 to 59 between 2010 and 2017, and many of the world's largest energy-consuming countries have significantly improved their renewable energy regulations since 2010. A separate study found that in Poland, host country of COP24 , scaling renewable energy sources could provide major benefits for the economy, health and environment. And the report, Managing Coal Mine Closure: Achieving a Just Transition for All, outlined how governments can prepare for and manage coal mine closure, particularly the social and labor impacts, and implement the transition to cleaner, less polluting energy sources. For food and land use: From 2015-17, 51 countries provided approximately $590 billion in public support for agricultural producers. A new report examined realigning agricultural support to deliver public goods outcomes and promote climate-smart agriculture. For Infrastructure. Low-carbon, resilient infrastructure has a central role in ensuring development, economic and climate objectives are met. A joint report with OECD and UN Environment laid out what public and private actors can do to align financial flows in infrastructure. For Transport. A technical paper on Electric Mobility was published to help support countries ensure that climate and environmental concerns as well as regulatory, labor, and fiscal implications were taken on board as they embark on e-Mobility pathways. The report was welcomed by the Polish government who will provide support to a trust fund that will support cutting edge research on e-mobility. For Disaster Response and Preparedness. 2017 was a stark reminder that disasters have the capacity to destroy in one day what took years to build and they inevitably place a huge financial strain on countries and poor people. A number of announcements were made, aiming to boost support for countries to minimize the impacts, manage the risks of climate change, and support them to access a wider range of financial instruments, including insurance (for instance, the InsurResilience Global partnership, the KfW contribution to the Central America and Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Program and support growing for early warning systems). The Big Takeaway Now that the ""Paris rulebook is in place, we can move forward on bold implementation. The big messages that will resonate clearly into 2019 are that the needs for climate action and ambition are great, the opportunities of climate-smart growth are bigger, and our commitment on climate, as the WBG, is as strong as ever. \"

The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA's views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration's response to its own report. ""If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating,"" wrote Senator Carper. ""This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists.

The Bank at the forefront of Climate Change and ready to ensure the voice of 54 African countries is heard. At the forefront of the fight against climate change in Africa, the African Development Bank, strongly represented in previous COP summits is, once again, present in Katowice to ensure that the voice of Africa is heard loud and clear in global climate negotiations. The Bank, representing Africa's 54 nations, stands ready to defend the continent's interests on the international arena. At COP24 To this end, Amadou Hott, the Bank's Vice President for power, energy, climate change and green growth, will lead a delegation of climate change experts in various fields (water and sanitation, transport, urbanization and sustainable cities ...), able to shed light on the diversity and complexity of the issues raised by climate change. The Bank also has its own Pavilion, branded in its colors. An intense program, several conferences and daily round tables will be featured in the Pavilion, throughout the two weeks of the event. Africa, on the front line of climate change impact The degree of urgency is especially acute in the case of Africa, one of the regions of the world most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as evidenced again by the terrible drought in East Africa in 2017 and the drought endured by South Africa in 2018. In the 10-year period from 1995 to 2015, the African continent has suffered 136 episodes of drought, 77 of which have been in East Africa alone. Drought, flood, rising sea levels, extreme weather events that threaten people's food security, ""climate migrants"" - the list goes on, and the ""bill"" for climate change proves a high one for the African continent, despite its contributing less than 4% of world greenhouse gas emissions. Of the 10 countries in the world considered most threatened by climate change, 7 are in Africa: Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. And climate change is even responsible for shaving off 1.4 points of GDP in Africa every year. As the president of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, has repeatedly said, it is urgent to act. At stake: the future of the continent - and its development and most importantly, the survival of the entire planet. ""With climate change there are no winners and no losers.

The organizations will measure their greenhouse gas emissions, reduce them as much as possible and compensate the currently unavoidable ones with credible carbon credits. With over 2 million tons of CO2 per year in emissions, and more than 50,000 staff, the aggregate action by this organizations represents an important example that may be taken at all levels of society. Some of the participating organizations have already achieved climate neutrality, while others are getting started in this journey. Still others were advanced in their sustainability strategy and are now going further by committing to go all the way to climate neutrality. Through this commitment, it is expected that organizations with more experience will support those that are at the early stages and that best practices will be shared. This initiative demonstrates the commitment of the participating organizations to climate action, while serving as inspiration for others to follow suit and contribute to the goal to achieve global climate neutrality before the end of this century, as established in the Paris Agreement. The international organizations that announced their commitment to climate neutrality are: 1. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Secretariat 2. Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa Secretariat (COMESA) 3. Eastern Africa Development Bank (EADB) 4. Western Africa Development Bank (BOAD) 5. Asian Development Bank (ADB) 6. Pacific Community 8. European Investment Bank (EIB) 9. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) 10. Southern African Development Community (SADC) Secretariat 11. Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 12. International Paralympic Committee (IPC) 13. Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) 14. World Travel &#38; Tourism Council (WTTC) These organizations join agencies throughout the United Nations (UN) system which in 2007 adopted a strategy and a roadmap to reach climate neutrality by 2020. Over half of all UN system entities are now climate neutral, representing 39% of total UN emissions as featured in the 2018 Greening the Blue report. The UN Headquarters is also becoming climate neutral for the first time in 2018. Some of the actions that these organizations are implementing to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions include the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, policies for reduction of air travel, upgrading of insulation and lighting systems in buildings, reduction of the amount of paper used at conferences, installation of efficient cooling systems, promotion of car-pooling schemes among employees, establishment of sustainable procurement policies, and enhanced collection and recycling of waste, among many others.

Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24 , parties agreed to rules for how participating countries will provide information about their emissions reductions targets, mitigation and adaptation measures; and assess progress on the development of related low-carbon technologies. The talks were extended by a day when an agreement could not be reached within the initial allotted time. The guideline also outlines the process by which developed nations may in later years pledge to provide additional financial support for developing countries such as China to take action on climate change. Developed countries had already committed to provide climate financing of $100 billion annually from 2020 through 2025 to developing countries. Climate talk experts have said a rulebook is critical to the success of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit global warming ideally to 1.5 degrees C and to 2 degrees at the most from pre-industrial levels. ""The agreed guidelines mean that countries can now establish the national systems that are needed for implementing the Paris Agreement as of 2020,"" the United Nations said in a release. But the countries could not reach a deal on the more thorny issues of market mechanisms for cutting emissions, such as carbon markets, and for ensuring each tonne of carbon dioxide released into the air is accounted for and not double counted among countries. Also, while the guidebook calls on nations to step up their climate ambitions, it does not mandate that the countries meet their goals, The Washington Post reported. Nations in 2020 will have their first chance to ratchet up their initial ambitions their current pledges fall far short of the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris goals. Meanwhile, scientists forecast global emissions in 2018 will have climbed for the second year in a row. The deal was reached even as President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. from the Paris agreement in 2020 and after the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, all refused to endorse a recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that found the world effectively has until 2030, much earlier than previously expected, to significantly reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. The next set of formal climate talks are slated to occur in Chile in 2019, although the exact dates of those meetings have yet to be announced. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA156","Support Grows for Early Warning Systems Initiative","December 11, 2018 Tuesday 1:19 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Meteorological Organization issued the following news release: Switzerland has announced a major contribution to an international initiative to strengthen early warning systems in vulnerable low-income countries to support climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. The announcement of 9 million Swiss francs in new funding came at the United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Poland ( COP24 ). In its efforts to improve resilience, the CREWS Initiative conducted an evidence-based assessment of the Early Warning Systems in the Caribbean. This followed a fact-finding mission and systematic review in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which hit more than 12 island States in the region in 2017. ""CREWS has proven, since its inception at COP21, the soundness of its concept: provide early warnings to the vulnerable populations of LDC and SIDS, in order to save their lives and protect their goods,"" said Ms Brune Poirson, Secretary of State, Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition, France. ""Results are already here : in Burkina Faso, 600 women farmers have been trained to proper use of climate and weather forecast; in DRC, flood mapping has been conducted to help poor municipalities prone to flash flooding; in Niger, population at high risk of flash or river flooding have been identified, and a disaster plan has been elaborated; in the Caribbean, the recent field study, in the wake of the 2017 hurricanes, has identified the investment and training gaps that will be filled in. CREWS will carry on its critical task!"" she told a side event at COP24 on 11 December. France spearheaded the launch of the CREWS Initiative at the Paris climate change conference in 2015. Switzerland now joins Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands in supporting CREWS, which seeks to enhance capacities of recipient countries, leading to added value and increased sustainability of overall hydrometeorological investments. ""Switzerland is well aware - from its own experience - that Early Warning Systems call for coordinated and joint efforts: Authorities need to ensure that information reach people in danger timely in order to minimize economic losses and causalities,"" said Marc Chardonnens, Secretary of State and Head of the Federal Environmental Office, Switzerland He expressed his hopes to meet the audience at the 6th Session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction to be held in May 2019 in Geneva (hosted by Switzerland). In 2019, CREWS is looking to start work in three additional countries - Afghanistan, Chad and Togo. These will join the active portfolio including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Papua New Guinea, as well as regional investments in the Pacific islands, the Caribbean and West Africa. CREWS is being implemented by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery, with the support of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR. ""2017 was a stark reminder that disasters have the capacity to destroy in one day what took years to build. And they inevitably place a huge financial strain on countries. At the World Bank Group, we want to help countries minimize the impacts and manage the risks of climate change and support them to access a wider range of financial instruments, including insurance,"" said Laura Tuck, World Bank Vice-President for Sustainable Development. ""It is very important to pay attention to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Investment in early warning systems is a very powerful way to adapt to climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""WMO is happy to have been able to contribute to the development of early warning systems in 19 countries so far and we look forward to supporting other countries."" Caribbean islands are among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change impacts and extreme weather. ""We are small and so when an extreme event hits us, it is national. Whereas in bigger developed countries, it is more manageable. What happens to one small member state impacts significantly on all of us and throws us back so far in our development,"" said Douglas Slater, Assistant Secretary-General of CARICOM. ""We are very grateful for CREWS financing and for this partnership."" Mami Mizutori, the UN Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, said the gender-sensitive focus of CREWS was key. ""Women are agents of change in resilience and disaster risk reduction. When iyou work with women, change happens,"" she said. Luxembourg, one of the founding countries, took over the Chair of the CREWS Initiative from France for the coming year. ""I am very grateful to France for the work accomplished over the past three years to successfully set up the CREWS initiative. CREWS perfectly fits into Luxembourg's international climate finance strategy. Assisting the most vulnerable countries to prevent damage and human losses remains a priority for us. Luxembourg is proud to be the next chair of the CREWS initiative,"" said Carole Dieschbourg, Minister of the Environment of Luxembourg on role on climate.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA157","350.org: COP24 Must Meet Test Set by IPCC","December 2, 2018 Sunday 7:30 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The 350.org issued the following news release: Another round of the annual UN Climate Summit (known as COP24 ) began today in Katowice, Poland. 350.org Executive Director May Boeve offered the following reaction: ""After the most devastating wildfire in California's history and other worsening impacts across the globe we will see if governments have paid attention to the recent IPCC report. That report sets out clearly what needs to happen to a ensure a just transition for the world to meet the 1.5C temperature limit goal."" The first day of the summit was delayed in starting due to procedural wrangling by Turkey over its categorisation as a ""developed country"" under the UN climate treaty. A coalition of Turkish civil society organisations responded by releasing the following statement (full text here): ""As the civil society representatives active in Turkey, we believe that it is crucial for the country to approach the UN Climate Summits with a broader presence, including pushing to improve its climate pledges rather than limiting itself to the issue of access to the Green Climate Fund."" In setting expectations for the remaining two weeks of the conference 350.org Executive Director May Boeve continued: ""We expect to see a way forward to upgrading action on climate prior to 2020, as our representatives promised in Paris. But the choice of fossil fuel companies to sponsor the conference casts a long-shadow over such hopes."" ""We also expect a strong and comprehensive Paris Agreement rulebook agreed in Katowice. A rulebook that ensures that governments stop all new fossil fuel projects, turn off the funding tap to dirty energy, and actually prepare, plan and invest in a just transition to 100 percent renewable energy."" ""But no matter what happens in the negotiating corridors in Katowice the change is already happening the world. Cities in Ukraine and Georgia have committed to go 100 percent renewable; community activists in Poland are shaping a new consensus on what the economy and development should look like; and financial markets are increasingly black-listing fossil fuel industries like coal."" In response to suggestions that the Trump Administration was intending to host an official side-event promoting coal at the Summit. May Boeve said: ""Trump's COP24 coal convention is a disgraceful clown show. As the world transitions away from coal, oil, and gas, fossil fuel CEOs and their political puppets are trying to keep us hooked. ""Instead of propping up sunset industry, we should be investing in a Green New Deal that prioritizes frontline and coal-communities, nurtures a livable planet, and creates millions of good jobs in the process."" 350.Org will have several accredited observers at the Summit and is actively engaging in the public civil society space the ""Climate Hub"" located outside of the official UN precinct. We will be promoting several stories that are important context for the UN negotiations. These are:  A clear statement from people across the world on their ""test"" for what the negotiations should achieve;  That the recent IPCC report requires urgent action to stop new fossil fuel projects - and we profile 8 such projects that will blow us through the 1.5C Paris temperature goal:  But that change is happening - including in Eastern Europe, Poland, and in the financial sector - with new reports and profiles of this transition;  However this is coupled with increasing state repression of climate activism which threatens lives as well as progress on climate goals. 350.org would be delighted to work with you to cover these stories and to help you dive into their details.  People's Demands In the lead up to the Katowice Summit a global alliance of civil society groups released a set of People's Demands. They already have 284,000 personal signatures, in 129 countries, from 335 organisations across the world. The easiest way for the world to assess the progress of the talks is against these demands. We will be promoting a press conference on the People's Demands as well as helping link to subject-matter experts and/or in-country activists. There will be actions/photo/video opportunities accompanying these demands throughout the two weeks of the Summit. It is particularly likely that the United States will be singled out as a target for this activism given its historical antipathy for climate action and its current Government's approach to the negotiations. 2. The IPCC Report Means No New Fossil Fuels The other objective measure of progress at Katowice is against the IPCC (the UN science panel)'s latest report. The report outlines what is required to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C - a ""rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems."" 350.org released a dossier to accompany the report in October. In Katowice we will be releasing a report and linking to spokespeople from campaigns against 8 key pieces of fossil fuel infrastructure that must be stopped if we are to meet the 1.5C goal. 3. The Change is Happening - Even Where You Least Expect It Although progress in the UN talks is slow - there are plenty of bright sparks and green shoots of climate action to look at. Many of them are occurring where you might least expect it. In Katowice we will be profiling: Eastern European Cities Committing to 100 percent Renewable Energy  Including a panel of 5 Mayors from the region outlining their plans to embrace renewable energy;  A report overviewing their plans and proposals; Polish activism  With the release of a video highlighting inspiring examples of grassroots activism in Poland;  Hosting events in the civil society space telling local stories. A new milestone in the global campaign to ""divest"" from fossil fuels  We are expecting an important divestment announcement in the second week of the negotiations  We will have a report outlining the history and trajectory of fossil fuel ""divestment"" movement and its successes  We will also link to experts on broader trends and changes in global finance and its role in driving climate action. 4. But state repression threatens lives and climate action Given the setting of Poland and recent developments in Brazil we will also be using the Katowice Summit to highlight examples of state repression against climate and environmental activists. This will include panels of speakers from countries and campaigns impacted by this repression, internal and cross-organisational strategy meetings to prepare for the threat, and links to stories and interviews from in-country campaigns. 5.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA158","""CLIMATE CHANGE WILL NOT WAIT FOR US""","December 13, 2018 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): At UN Climate Change Conference, MIT researchers share knowledge and tools to help nations meet Paris Agreement targets. Emily Dahl | MIT Energy Initiative Emily Dahl of the MIT Energy Initiative filed this report from the 2018 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, which runs Dec. 3 - 14. For the past two weeks, climate negotiations at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland a.k.a. COP 24 The process has left negotiators and observers alike frustrated as reaching consensus proves difficult on key issues, including how to ramp up climate finance for poorer countries and how to monitor and report emissions reductions. Some of the fiercest debates have arisen over whether to officially ""welcome"" the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the urgency of keeping emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius, which was opposed by just four nations: the U.S., Russia, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Speaking to the parties on Dec. 11, U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa asked them to stay the course, saying, ""Many political divisions remain. Many issues still must be overcome. But I believe it's within our grasp to finish the job."" She challenged them, ""Let's complete the Paris Agreement Work Program and, by doing so, immediately unleash the power of the Paris Agreement itself."" MIT participants are here at the conference to support that aim to help unleash the power of the Paris Agreement by sharing analyses and insights that can aid nations in determining the right policy and technology solutions for meeting emissions reduction targets. Searching for optimism amid dire climate scenarios Sruthi Davuluri, a master's student in the Technology and Policy Program (TPP) who attended the first week of the conference, came to Katowice looking to broaden and deepen her knowledge of different nations' policies and initiatives to address climate change. She says she felt discouraged for the first few days, especially given the dialogue around the IPCC's report. ""In the negotiations, there were clear tensions between countries trying to push through and those trying to slow down the process,"" she says. ""In some sessions, people from the developing nations said they feel panicked. They know how difficult it is to convince other nations to see beyond their own borders, and how a global temperature rise of 'even' 1.5 degrees Celsius is actually a 2-degree rise for some nations, with dire climate-related impacts."" ""The week was a roller coaster of thoughts,"" says Anthony Fratto Oyler, another TPP master's student, who is a research assistant with the MIT Energy Initiative. Since the seventh grade, he's dreamed of coming to the climate conference and seeing negotiations firsthand. ""During the week, I was struck by the severity of what we are facing, and as a young person, you can feel disheartened and small."" ""It's difficult to imagine countries coming together to a solution when they can't even agree on a single sentence for a guidance document,"" he says. ""More so when you realize the inspirational, progressive, and pragmatic leaders that came together to sign the Paris Agreement three years ago are no longer there and in some countries' cases have been replaced by leaders who refuse to accept facts of climate change."" Erik Landry SM '18, has also found the conference eye-opening: ""In some sense, the tone of the talks has been disconcerting, but this is balanced by a powerful feeling of inspiration and empowerment that you can see from extremely innovative and creative individuals and organizations presenting their initiatives here at the conference."" Landry, a research associate in the Office of the Vice President for Research, is at the conference to advance his research on climate finance and to bring back insights that could help MIT as the Institute continues to advance its own climate action plan. Davuluri and Oyler have found reasons for optimism as well. ""I loved hearing passionate people from developing countries and climate activists from small towns in the U.S., and getting the opportunity to have one-on-one interactions to hear their stories,"" says Davuluri, who enjoyed attending sessions with fellow researchers and having meetings with policymakers including the head of the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water, a global think tank based in India. ""By the end of my time I ultimately felt hopeful,"" says Oyler. ""It's inspiring to know there are tens of thousands of individuals from all the world working through research, policy, leadership, and other avenues to address climate change."" Best practices for carbon markets and emissions trading systems Carbon markets have been a major subject of discussion at the conference, and have figured prominently into MIT researchers' discussions here including at an official side event organized by the World Energy Council in collaboration with MIT, on innovative energy, environmental, and technological avenues for meeting Paris Agreement goals. The event featured government and industry leaders, including George Heyman, British Columbia's minister of environment and climate change strategy; Todd Muller, conservative opposition leader in New Zealand's parliament; Claude Nahon, senior vice president of sustainable development at Electricite de France; Matar Al Neyadi, United Arab Emirates undersecretary of energy; and moderator Sir Philip Lowe of the World Energy Council. At the event, Sergey Paltsev, a senior researcher at the MIT Energy Initiative and deputy director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, shared takeaways from new research on climate policy and technology pathways for nations to meet their Paris Agreement targets. The findings were drawn from analyses of selected Latin American nations and member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as best practices and lessons learned from these and other governments. Turning to Heyman, Paltsev said, ""Our best example in these reports is the carbon price in British Columbia and their approach to this issue, which scores very well in many dimensions. We need good examples. We need to show it is possible to do, it is possible to do it smart, and it is possible to do it with citizens approving the policy and continuing that support."" Michael Mehling, deputy director of MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, has been speaking at a number of events on carbon markets. ""Economists widely agree that putting a price on carbon is the most cost-effective way of dealing with the externalities that cause climate change,"" he says. At COP24 , Mehling has been discussing collaborative emissions reduction options for governments through a provision of the Paris Agreement, Article 6. He explains, ""Article 6 of the Paris Agreement contains an option for countries to cooperate across borders, voluntarily, by transferring mitigation outcomes. That allows one jurisdiction to meet its climate pledges with mitigation efforts achieved in another jurisdiction."" Using this option, countries can collaborate by buying and selling emission reductions across national borders which can dramatically reduce the cost of achieving collective mitigation targets compared to countries acting on their own. That, in turn, should enable countries to increase the ambition of their climate efforts, but it also requires observing certain safeguards. Mehling's research, outlined in a new paper, provides guidance for the governance of such cooperative approaches, to ensure transparency, accurate accounting, and environmental integrity while minimizing transaction costs and maximizing participation. Raising others' voices and building capacity for climate resilience Kathleen Kennedy, executive director of MIT's Center for Collective Intelligence (CCI) is at COP24 as part of a collaborative effort between CCI's Climate CoLab and the U.N. Climate Resilience Initiative A2R to empower communities to become more resilient to climate-related risks and impacts. Kennedy moderated a discussion at the conference with winners of a recent contest organized through the collaboration, which asked communities to propose local solutions to their climate challenges. ""How can at-risk communities around the world absorb climate change issues so they don't get completely devastated by a hurricane, a cyclone, or floods? How do they build the capacity to deal with these risks? We had two different winning groups that brought very innovative solutions,"" she says. On the panel, Kennedy talked with representatives of the two winning projects one from Nepal, the other from India, and both led by women in which each shared how they had used existing systems in their communities as the basis for new climate initiatives. Providing a way for communities to make these contributions to climate action is essential, she says. ""We need to be able to get deeper into the communities, and hear the voices of those on the ground who are experiencing issues related to climate change. The Climate CoLab is a really powerful platform that is able to reach into different communities and help the people who are actually experiencing the challenges put their proposals on the platform, then work collaboratively with people around the world on finding solutions."" Preparing for the future Oyler is thinking ahead to how he can translate his experience at the conference into future work. ""Rather than feeling burdened by the amount of effort needed to decarbonize our society, I feel empowered by my ability to at least try and build a better future,"" he says. Participating in the conference has also helped Davuluri think about her own career path. She says, "" COP24 really motivated me to focus on the local and state level particularly the state of California. I think I could bring my engineering, economics, and policy background to help the state reach its zero-carbon targets in a sustainable, low-cost, and equitable way that does not hurt marginalized communities."" ""I was impressed by the number of young participants in this event. The current policies and actions determine their future; therefore, it is tremendously important to reflect the views of those who will be especially affected by action or inaction by policy makers,"" says Paltsev, who led MIT's delegation. ""The urgency of climate tasks requires accelerated solutions, and people can make significant difference by actively participating in climate actions."" Landry reflects, ""Having grappled with the qualitative aspects underlying a lot of the issues being discussed throughout my time at MIT, I now have a level of confidence and understanding of the issues that allows me to contribute to conversations here. For me, this experience has reaffirmed the importance of our commitment to rigorous research at MIT and the necessity of sharing our work and engaging in dialogues with stakeholders around the world.""

I would sincerely like to thank all of you who have selflessly and tirelessly put effort into creating a better environment for the world so that future generations will be able to live a healthy, happy life. In spite of the huge technological developments that have taken place in our modern world, we have created many problems too. Experts tell us that human beings are responsible for global warming and the change in weather conditions. Logically this means that we human beings have a responsibility to reduce problems that we have caused and to finally eliminate them. Climate change is not the concern of just one or two nations. It is an issue that affects the whole of humanity and every living being on this earth. This beautiful planet is our only home. If, due to global warming or other environmental problems, the earth cannot sustain itself, there is no other planet to which we can move. We have to take serious action now to protect our environment and find constructive solutions to global warming. When we see photographs of the earth from space, we see no boundaries between us, just this one blue planet. This is no longer a time to think only of 'my nation' or 'our continent' alone. There is a real need for a greater sense of global responsibility based on a sense of the oneness of humanity. I want to thank UNFCCC for consistently working to reduce the negative impact of climate change and pray that this conference will be a success. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA160","Governor Brown Meets With Spain's Prime Minister in Sacramento","September 28, 2018 Friday 7:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., D-California, issued the following news release: Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today met with Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sanchez in Sacramento, where the two leaders discussed further bilateral trade and climate cooperation and action between California and Spain. ""California and Spain share common history and a common commitment to climate action. We will get it done together,"" said Governor Brown. ""The moment is now. We are the last generation that can stop the consequences of climate change,"" said Prime Minister Sanchez. Today's meeting between Governor Brown and Prime Minister Sanchez included Spain's Ambassador to the United States Santiago Cabanas, Secretary General of International Affairs Jose Manuel Albares and Director General of Economic Affairs Manuel De La Rocha and builds on this week's events and meetings in New York with world leaders at Climate Week NYC and the World Economic Forum's Sustainable Development Impact Summit. California's Leadership on Climate Change Reaffirming California's global climate leadership, Governor Brown convened the Global Climate Action Summit earlier this month in San Francisco, where grassroots activists, mayors, governors, heads of industry and nonprofits made hundreds of new commitments ahead of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ). This month, the Governor also signed legislation setting a 100 percent clean electricity goal for the state, and issued an executive order establishing a new target to achieve carbon neutrality - both by 2045. Additionally, the Governor signed bills to block new federal offshore oil drilling along California's coast, announced the state's opposition to the federal government's plan to expand oil drilling on public lands in California and committed to developing and eventually launching a satellite that will track climate change-causing pollutants with unprecedented precision and help the world dramatically reduce these destructive emissions. Earlier this year Governor Brown issued executive orders to improve the health of the state's forests and help mitigate the threat and impacts of wildfire, and get 5 million zero-emission vehicles onto California's roads by 2030. Last year, the Governor signed landmark legislation to extend and strengthen the state's cap-and-trade program and create a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. Under Governor Brown, California has established the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; set the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; and will reduce fossil fuel consumption up to 50 percent and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings by 2030. The state has met its 2020 target four years early, reducing emissions 13 percent while growing the economy 26 percent. From 2015 to 2016 alone, emissions reductions were roughly equal to taking 2.4 million cars off the road, saving 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Governor Brown has helped establish and expand coalitions of partners across the nation and globe committed to curbing carbon pollution, including the Under2 Coalition, an international pact of 222 cities, states, regions and countries on 6 continents committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. Coalition members collectively represent more than 1.3 billion people and $34 trillion in GDP - equivalent to 17 percent of the global population and 43 percent of the global economy. This includes the regions of Andalusia, Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarra in Spain. Governor Brown also partnered with Michael Bloomberg to launch America's Pledge, an initiative to quantify non-federal action in the U.S. to drive down emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and helped form the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance - which now includes 17 U.S. states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population - committed to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. California and 17 other states collectively representing more than 40 percent of the U.S. car market sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to preserve the nation's uniform vehicle emission standards that save drivers money at the pump, cut oil consumption, reduce air pollution and curb greenhouse gases.

Today, at the United National Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), 3M is building on its legacy of Sustainability leadership and announcing its first formal requirement that a Sustainability Value Commitment will be included in all new products introduced beginning in 2019. ""Sustainability is at the core of 3M-but we're looking to do more,"" said John Banovetz, Chief Technology Officer, 3M. ""Today at COP24 we are proud to formalize our commitment to this next step in innovating for a sustainable future."" Examples of 3M's Sustainability Value Commitment for new products include reusability, recyclability, energy, waste, water savings, responsible sourcing, and/or renewable materials appropriate to the specific product, from the beginning to the end of each product's lifecycle. This commitment also includes products with a core purpose of helping to solve an environmental or social challenge, such as improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving worker and patient safety in healthcare and industrial settings. 3M will measure progress and impact of this commitment and report on it annually. 3M invests approximately 6 percent of revenue into research and development, much of it for creating new products. The new requirement will take effect in 2019 and will apply to all five of 3M's business groups: Health Care, Consumer, Electronics & Energy, Industrial and Safety & Graphics. ""As a large and diverse global science company with customers spanning many industries and global markets, we have the opportunity to make an even greater impact in Sustainability,"" said Gayle Schueller, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, 3M. ""We've made such significant progress on the 2025 Sustainability goals we set in 2015 that we're raising the bar. The new product goal is an example of the aggressive targets we'll be setting in coming months as part our strategic focus on empowering science for Circular, Climate and Community."" 3M has a long-standing commitment to Sustainability from the Pollution Prevention Pays program that began in 1975 to 3M's 2025 Sustainability goals that include water, climate, and energy targets. 3M has long been a recognized leader in Sustainability and has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 19 consecutive years. Requiring Sustainability Value Commitments in all new products builds on 3M's history of creating products that emphasize reuse, recycling and reduced resource use for 3M's operations and for their customers. Those products range from energy-saving cooling immersion fluids for data centers and window and solar film, to lightweighting vehicles and shipping materials for fuel efficiency, to water and waste-reducing cleaning solutions. 3M leaders will participate in events during the UN Climate Change\~Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice. 3M is holding a HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapp.engage.3m.com%2Fe%2Fes%3Fs%3D837031577%26e%3D670323%26elqTrackId%3DC2E6CEB377B6162B411DDCFA8CBBF6BE%26elq%3D8bbf8cdac7564f0b8c35411991c6db88%26elqaid%3D19420%26elqat%3D1&esheet=51908261&newsitemid=20181204005469&lan=en-US&anchor=%E2%80%9CBusiness+for+the+Global+Good%E2%80%9D&index=2&md5=ec417d3233cc74548444e76510d97163 ""Business for the Global Good"" For more information about 3M's sustainability commitment, please visit HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.3m.com%2F3M%2Fen_US%2Fsustainability-us%2F&esheet=51908261&newsitemid=20181204005469&lan=en-US&anchor=this+website&index=3&md5=126c288771460c25f7180f600b00bb55 this website .

Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, said: ""When the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 we knew the pledges contained in it didn't add up to stopping climate change. The Paris Agreement as it stands now, only gets us to a world between 2.7 and 3.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, much higher than the agreement's goal of 1.5. The process to bridge this gap is the Talanoa Dialogue which is why it's such a vital part of these talks. ""No outcome here in Katowice will be acceptable without countries agreeing to review and strengthen their pledges by 2020. The recent IPCC report showed that we don't have the luxury of time, we need to start to close the gap now. ""The danger is that the Polish presidency is letting the Talanoa Dialogue turn into nothing more than a talking shop. This would be a travesty for the world's most vulnerable people.""

On one hand you have rich countries unwilling to cut emissions despite already being wealthy like the United States. They are largely indifferent to worsening the plight of poor countries which must bear the brunt of climate change, like those in sub-Saharan Africa[1]. On the other hand, you also have developing countries that do not want to sacrifice anything to economic growth despite having among the world's most polluted cities[2] on the face of the Earth. I'm talking about you, China and India. But there are ""good guys[3]"" here: Out of the sheer necessity of survival, small island nations at risk of being submerged by higher sea levels worldwide are leading the charge at climate negotiations to save them from literally disappearing off the map. Let's say their work is cut out against the likes of the United States--promoting coal at a climate conference, what a joke[4]--and China and India who are quite callous to the plight of fellow developing countries. So much for third world solidarity... The ongoing negotiations on how to implement the Paris Agreement aren't going well. The world's largest economies and top greenhouse emitters remain mired in decades-old arguments about who is responsible for addressing climate change and its impacts.Now, a group of small island nations have stepped in to save themselves. Countries like Kiribati, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands aren't your typical geopolitical movers and shakers, but here at the United Nations climate change conference [5] in Katowice, Poland these highly vulnerable countries have managed to reshape discussions with a simple but poignant reminder: if the world fails to halt global warming they may disappear for good.'We are not prepared to die, and the Maldives have no intention of dying,' Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives told reporters in Poland. 'We are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above the water.'They try, but the message sometimes falls on deaf ears: To do that, these countries have launched a last-minute blitz to rouse higher-emitting and slower-moving countries to action. They are pushing their counterparts to demand a more aggressive agreement in a series of closed-door bilateral discussions. And they've launched a messaging campaign to signal that they will not let other countries off the hook if they hold back.I am obviously sympathetic to small island states, but I do have to scratch my head about what kind of political leverage they can apply to get what they want achieved during these international talks. Literally, they are the smallest of fishes in a very big pond.

As part of the deal, every country will need to follow uniform standards for measuring carbon emissions. Ahead of 2020, countries will be required to raise ambition for reducing the emissions at the heart of causing climate change. ""Recent scientific reports showed a disturbing path toward global destruction due to climate change, but negotiations in Poland gave us a hopeful alternative roadmap for action,"" said Senator Markey. ""The rulebook agreed to at COP24 is a ray of hope despite President Trump's abysmal record on climate change.

Support from people around the world for the Paris climate agreement has never been stronger. Despite The Trump administration's giveaways to fossil fuel interests, the United States is still in, and we can make progress.

Secretary-General Issues Remark at E-Mobility Event at COP24","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 4:47 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued the following remarks at the E-Mobility Event at COP24 : ""I want to thank the Government of Poland and in-coming COP president Mr. Kurtyka and the United Kingdom for launching this initiative. ""This event is exciting because it is a key step towards the sustainability transition that we all know is needed. ""And this step is critically important for reaching the aims of the Paris Agreement - to keep global temperature rise this century to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C. ""Globally, transport accounted for one quarter of total emissions in 2016, a level 71% higher than what was seen in 1990. ""It is estimated that over 1 billion passenger cars travel the streets and roads of the world today. ""By 2040, the number of cars on the road across the globe is set to double to 2 billion at least. ""This illustrates the urgency for accelerated action to reduce emissions from transport. ""But the need is equally obvious when looking at air pollution. ""Air pollution is now the fourth-highest cause of death worldwide. Long-term exposure to air pollution contributed to the deaths of 6.1 million people in 2016. ""Clearly, we need to prevent this. Clearly, we need to act. ""Interestingly, the first electric vehicles were produced and sold at the beginning of the 1900s and sales peaked in the early 1910s. ""But technological developments and the discovery of large oil reserves displaced the electric vehicle in favour of the combustion engine. ""Now, almost 100 years later, electric vehicles are coming back and need to increasingly displace the combustion engine in favour of reducing emissions and air pollution. ""We need sustainable and clean transport systems. ""The growing awareness for clean air and climate change means that many governments around the world have begun embracing e-mobility. ""Many are putting in place the policy frameworks and infrastructure needed for sustainable transport. ""A growing number of countries and regions have announced plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles and to shift to e-mobility. ""Others are putting in place targets for the absolute number or overall share of electric vehicles by 2020 or 2030. ""And the International Energy Agency estimates that in 2017, there were already 3.5 million charging outlets for electric vehicles around the world. ""These policy initiatives have spurred market growth for electric vehicles. There is increasing demand and many businesses are embracing e-mobility and its new economic opportunities. ""By some estimates, this will displace 7.3 million barrels per day of transport fuel. ""This clearly shows the potential of e-mobility in contributing to climate change mitigation. Many sustainable transport strategies also have large, immediate health benefits for the majority of the world's population, and large equity benefits for vulnerable groups. ""But the growth in electric vehicles will have a significant impact on electricity demand - and this needs to be kept in mind. ""If not managed carefully, the additional demand will create challenges across all sections of the energy system, particularly at peak times. ""E-mobility that depends on a fossil fuel-based energy system would potentially significantly drive climate change and air pollution and not lead to the solution we want. ""According to IRENA, assuming all these new electric vehicles were to consume 100% renewable electricity, around 450 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year of additional renewable electricity would be required by 2030. ""We have the solutions at our finger tips. We have much of the technology in place. We have policies to drive and support sustainable transport. And market conditions and demand are responding positively. ""The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity. But the transition needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full. ""If we get this right, then a decarbonized transport system will be part of the solution. ""The ""Driving Change Together"" declaration is an essential step towards a decarbonized transport system. ""I applaud the Katowice Partnership for e-mobility and I urge all actors to support it. It provides all actors, including the private sector, with ever more clarity and confidence on the direction of travel. ""By supporting it, you will contribute to reaching the aims of the Paris Agreement. ""By supporting it, you will contribute to a sustainable future for the benefit of all.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA168","Governor Brown Meets with Spain's Prime Minister in Sacramento","September 29, 2018 Saturday","US Official News","Sacramento: Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., The State of California has issued the following news release: Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today met with Prime Minister of Spain Pedro S225;nchez in Sacramento, where the two leaders discussed further bilateral trade and climate cooperation and action between California and Spain.  California and Spain share common history and a common commitment to climate action. We will get it done together, said Governor Brown.  The moment is now. We are the last generation that can stop the consequences of climate change, said Prime Minister S225;nchez. Today\' s meeting between Governor Brown and Prime Minister S225;nchez included Spain\' s Ambassador to the United States Santiago Cabanas, Secretary General of International Affairs Jos233; Manuel Albares and Director General of Economic Affairs Manuel De La Rocha and builds on this week\' s events and meetings in New York with world leaders at Climate Week NYC and the World Economic Forum\' s Sustainable Development Impact Summit. California\' s Leadership on Climate Change Reaffirming California\' s global climate leadership, Governor Brown convened the Global Climate Action Summit earlier this month in San Francisco, where grassroots activists, mayors, governors, heads of industry and nonprofits made hundreds of new commitments ahead of this year\' s United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ). This month, the Governor also signed legislation setting a 100 percent clean electricity goal for the state, and issued an executive order establishing a new target to achieve carbon neutrality \- both by 2045. Additionally, the Governor signed bills to block new federal offshore oil drilling along California\' s coast, announced the state\' s opposition to the federal government\' s plan to expand oil drilling on public lands in California and committed to developing and eventually launching a satellite that will track climate change-causing pollutants with unprecedented precision and help the world dramatically reduce these destructive emissions. Earlier this year Governor Brown issued executive orders to improve the health of the state\' s forests and help mitigate the threat and impacts of wildfire, and get 5 million zero-emission vehicles onto California\' s roads by 2030. Last year, the Governor signed landmark legislation to extend and strengthen the state\' s cap-and-trade program and create a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. Under Governor Brown, California has established the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; set the nation\' s toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; and will reduce fossil fuel consumption up to 50 percent and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings by 2030. The state has met its 2020 target four years early, reducing emissions 13 percent while growing the economy 26 percent. From 2015 to 2016 alone, emissions reductions were roughly equal to taking 2.4 million cars off the road, saving 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Governor Brown has helped establish and expand coalitions of partners across the nation and globe committed to curbing carbon pollution, including the Under2 Coalition, an international pact of 222 cities, states, regions and countries on 6 continents committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. Coalition members collectively represent more than 1.3 billion people and $34 trillion in GDP \- equivalent to 17 percent of the global population and 43 percent of the global economy. This includes the regions of Andalusia, Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarra in Spain. Governor Brown also partnered with Michael Bloomberg to launch America\' s Pledge, an initiative to quantify non-federal action in the U.S. to drive down emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and helped form the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance \- which now includes 17 U.S. states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population \- committed to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and meeting or exceeding the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan. California and 17 other states collectively representing more than 40 percent of the U.S. car market sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to preserve the nation\' s uniform vehicle emission standards that save drivers money at the pump, cut oil consumption, reduce air pollution and curb greenhouse gases.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA169","COP 24: Big investors call for carbon price, end to subsidies","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","ClimateWire","Institutional investors increasingly concerned about climate change have teamed up to ask governments to set tougher policies. A group of 415 investors overseeing $32 trillion in assets have signed a letter asking governments to phase out thermal coal, set a price on carbon emissions and end fossil-fuel subsidies. The signatories, including Allianz SE, HSBC Global Asset Management and Schroders PLC, are presenting it in conjunction with the COP 24 global-climate conference in Poland. The fund managers said climate change could cause economic damage that threatens their holdings, and that government policy was key to reducing risk. Schroders estimated that if no action is taken and the world warms by 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit), that could cause $23 trillion in global economic losses over the next 80 years. ""This is permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, while continuing to escalate,"" the group said in a statement yesterday. ""Much more needs to be done by governments to accelerate the low-carbon transition."" While letters don't usually lead to immediate change, the combined efforts of asset managers have already stirred the private sector. Last week, Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it would set new public goals around cutting carbon emissions after months of pressure from some of the same investors who signed the new letter. The investor group also wrote a briefing paper for policymakers that says governments need to update and strengthen their commitments to the Paris climate accord. Among the recommendations are that nations put a price on carbon -- in effect a tax on greenhouse gas emissions -- between $38 and $100 a ton. Currently, three-quarters of emissions are covered by carbon prices of less than $10 a ton, the paper said. The COP 24 conference is in its second week and will end on Dec. 14. -- Kelly Gilblom, Bloomberg \"

It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade. ""The entire world must be doing even more to address this problem. That includes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead. While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable. ""But reaching bolder future agreements is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeavor - and that includes saving our planet. Unfortunately, our President - along with many of those within his Administration - continues to reject climate science and deny the reality of the problems we are facing. ""Well, Mr. President, here's the reality. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced 16 extreme weather-related disasters that exceeded $1 billion in 2017. In the past year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges, flooding, wildfires, crop freezes and droughts - a new record! ""Thirteen of our nation's leading scientific federal agencies recently reported to us in the National Climate Assessment that, if we do nothing to address our carbon emissions, today's extreme weather-related events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead. ""In the future, we can continue to expect rainfalls where precipitation is measured by the foot, not in inches. We can continue to expect more wildfires out West burning areas larger than my home state of Delaware. And we can continue to expect extreme flooding to devastate small communities like Ellicott City Maryland, which has been hit by two 1,000-year-floods in the past two years alone. Think about that! Two in the past two years alone! ""Mr. President, one of the most memorable lyrics from singer-songwriter Stephen Stills goes something like this, 'Something's happening here. Just what it is ain't exactly clear.' Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and it IS exactly clear.' What's also clear is that there's still time to do something about it and actually foster economic growth in the USA and beyond our borders. Climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists and from leading scientists around the world. ""Let me also remind my colleagues that the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction or whim of any one person or administration. It was Congress that passed a law mandating that the National Climate Assessment be presented every four years. That law was called the Global Change Research Act of 1990. It passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush - a Republican. ""Our nation's leading scientists warned us yet again - less than one month ago - that, if we fail to start seriously reducing carbon emissions now, by the end of the century, we may well be witnessing:  sea-levels rising another 6 feet, resulting in an estimated $3.6 trillion in cumulative damages to U.S. coastal properties and infrastructure;  annual economic losses of up to $500 billion that will impact nearly every major economic sector in our country; and,  reductions in our gross domestic product by up to 10 percent - twice that of the Great Recession that brought America to its knees a decade ago. ""Yet, as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate change, the Trump Administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies. The Administration is also attempting to discredit the recent science reports by pushing talking points from well-known climate deniers. ""But Americans aren't falling for these tricks anymore. Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every day. And they want action. So does our business community. While this Administration sits on its hands, American businesses are stepping up in a big way to combat the effects of climate change. Many businesses stand ready to do even more. ""To our international friends who are wondering where this nation is on climate change, I can tell you that the majority of Americans - including me - are with you. We support the Paris Climate Agreement. We want to reduce carbon emissions because we're convinced that doing so will enable us to save our planet. ""This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue. This isn't a blue-state or red-state issue. It affects all of us. And if you think climate change hasn't reached your state just yet, the science is clear that it will. Luckily for us, young people are leading the call for action. Climate change or environmental issues are often mistakenly forgotten when we discuss domestic issues. In today's news cycle, especially under this Administration, it doesn't always make headlines. It's oftentimes been said that climate change isn't an issue that drives American to the polls. Well, Mr. President, that is changing. ""Young people have led the way in changing our country before. In the 1950s, they led the decades-long Civil Rights Movement for equal rights for every American under the law. It was young activists who made clear their opposition to the Vietnam War. Back in the 1970s, young people pushed hard for strong environmental standards when the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio was burning and garbage littered our shores. Well, our country is back at another one of those make-or-break moments in our history. We need the energy of Americans of all ages - young and old - to make sure we don't blow it. And we need to listen to them all, especially our younger Americans. After all, it's their future that's at stake. ""When it comes to global challenges?--?such as terrorism and cyber- attacks?--?the U.S doesn't sit back and wait for someone else to lead the way. We step up, and we lead! We have many dogs in this fight. Too many to count! ""Fortunately, acting sooner rather later on climate change brings with it many positives. We can put our country on a course to reduce emissions, and grow our economy. The two are not mutually exclusive. In fact, quite the opposite. What we can and should be doing is using our energy and resources to foster new economic opportunities for communities that may be dependent on the old world order. In 2017, nearly 3.2 million Americans were working in wind, solar, energy efficiency and other clean energy jobs. More will follow, and it's incumbent on us to ensure that some of those new jobs go to people whose jobs are going away, as we seek to reduce carbon emissions in this country and on our planet. ""We don't have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up and get going. That's why, as the senior Democrat and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I'm anxious to help lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate future. If we're honest with our children and grandchildren, we don't have any other choice, Mr. President. ""It was my hope that, on the world stage this week, America's representatives at COP24 would make clear that our country is ready to lead by example. Unfortunately, they did not. But that's no reason to despair. We have the facts and the energy on our side. ""I will leave my colleagues with this message today: Climate action should not be an issue that divides us. It should unite us. It should unite the entire global community. And our world could definitely use more unification these days. Years from now, when my sons or my sons' children are dealing with the inevitable consequences of our failure to address climate change, there will be a day when they come to me and say, 'You were a U.S. Senator. What did you do when you had the chance to do something about this impending disaster when there was still time?' We should all want to be able to say - and work tirelessly to say - that we moved heaven and earth to make sure that future generations could inherit a safe, healthy planet, one where their dreams and aspirations can be realized and not destroyed. ""My colleagues and I are on the floor today to make clear that the overwhelming majority of Americans stand with almost every other nation in the world. We need to act, and we need to act now. Time is not on our side. Let's seize the day! Carpe Diem!""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA171","Rise for Climate: Powerful Global Mobilisation Concludes Demanding Real Climate Leadership","September 9, 2018 Sunday 9:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The 350.org issued the following news release: This weekend over 250,000 people took part in more than 900 actions in 95 countries. The Rise for Climate mobilizations demanded political action to keep fossil fuels in the ground and deliver a swift and just transition to 100 percent renewable energy for all. People have delivered clear demands to elected officials and decision-makers as they head into a series of important summits and negotiations to fix the climate crisis later this year. One month before the official release of the IPCC special report on 1.5 C and the upcoming United Nations climate change conference in Poland ( COP24 ), activists have made clear that concrete steps are needed to quit fossil fuel production and slash emissions by 2020 as the only way to avert the worst case scenarios of climate change. Hundreds of thousands of people found creative and powerful ways to voice their concern for the state of the planet and to call for an end to fossil fuels and a worldwide transition to renewable energy before 2020:  Communities throughout the Pacific region mobilized in support for renewable energy, calling on decision-makers to prevent global temperature increase beyond 1.5 C over pre-industrial levels.  In Manila, activists held one of the first virtual marches, representing vulnerable and frontline communities from the Philippines and as a commentary to the shrinking democratic space in the country.  In Bangkok women's rights groups, farmers and environmentalists marched just outside of the UN additional session of climate talks, where negotiators were unsuccessful in hashing out the last details of the Paris Agreement's rulebook.  Kutaisi, the second largest city in Georgia, commits to transit to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 after hundreds of citizens demanded a clean energy for all during Rise for Climate Day.  In Ituango, Colombia around 400 people from impacted communities stood firm on their right of freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration by taking to the streets of the city, occupying the public space, after being surprised by police who tried to prevent their planned demonstration against the Hidroituango hydroelectric plant and the expansion of fossil fuels.  In Sydney local groups sailed a ship along the harbour flying Rise for Climate banners and hosted a protest in front of the Prime Minister's office to protest the country's addiction to coal mining.  In Kampala 25,000 people joined a festival and a children's march. Thousands more joined events and gatherings throughout the African continent.  In Copenhagen, where the first attempt at a universal climate agreement failed in 2009, over 15,000 people joined the largest march ever to hold European leaders accountable on climate. In Brussels, activists brought the mobilization to the doorstep of the European Parliament, while in Germany activists targeted churches and local governments to divest from fossil fuels.  Astrobiologist Cyprien Verseux and colleagues showed support to the global mobilization from the ever shrinking ice shelves of Antarctica, marching through below zero temperatures.  Hundreds of events all over the United States saw tens of thousands of people hit the streets for climate jobs and climate justice, concluded by the largest march the US West Coast has ever seen in San Francisco, joined by over 30,000 people, as street artists painted a world record street mural.  3,000 people gathered in New York to call on Governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and all elected officials move the state off fossil fuels through a just transition to 100 percent renewable energy.  In Puerto Rico, 1,500 young people and their families joined together to urge the government to take bold and meaningful climate action, and motivate communities to initiate their own renewable energy projects.  In Canada, First Nations communities and activists held rallies along the proposed route of the TransMountain pipeline, protesting against the government's costly acquisition of the infrastructure from the US-based firm Kinder Morgan, after it had announced plans to cancel the project.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA172","Can a coalition of 'superheroes' save the COP24 climate talks?","December 13, 2018 Thursday 5:12 AM EST","CNN.com","Think of them as the Justice League for global warming diplomacy. They're the ""High Ambition Coalition"" and they arrived late this week at the beleaguered COP24 climate talks here in Polish coal country, wearing suits and hosting press conferences -- hoping to salvage a United Nations treaty that is meant to save the earth. Dozens of reporters from around the world shoved into a tiny, sweaty conference room Wednesday night hoping to hear what the coalition had to say about the negotiation taking place the talks, which were described by one scientist as a ""huge mess."" The UN's secretary general gave a speech earlier in the day saying it would be ""suicidal"" to fail. Meanwhile, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait are questioning the basic premise underling the talks -- that 1.5 degrees of warming would cause global calamity. To avoid that, global carbon pollution from fossil fuels and other sources would have to be cut in half in only about a decade, according to the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. It's a massive undertaking. The kind that tends to attract superheroes. At the front of the room, flanked by ministers from Europe and Latin America, was David Paul, the environment minister from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Never heard of it? A pin on Paul's coat lapel, shaped like the nation's flag, offered clues about the place. The flag is a field of blue slashed with thin lines of white and tan. The blue represents the ocean -- which is most of the Marshall Islands' territory. It's been called a ""big ocean country"" in the Pacific, and if warming is allowed to continue apace, scientists say the nation may not exist in coming decades. Its low-lying islands could sink beneath rising seas. Paul came to Wednesday's meeting with a clear demand: Finalize the rules that will govern the Paris Agreement, which is meant to avoid the level of warming that could sink the Marshall Islands and kill the world's coral, supercharge storms, intensify droughts and so on. Paul is fighting for the survival of his nation, while the coalition -- made up of more than 20 members, from countries rich and poor, big and small -- are fighting for the survival of the planet. The message: Warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius and there must be strong, clear rules on reporting and cutting pollution. The demands were a ""shot of energy"" at a critical moment in the negotiations, said Jake Schmidt, international program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""We finally have a growing group of countries signaling that they want to leave here with a strong agreement that delivers on the promise of Paris,"" Schmidt said. The members of the coalition express almost unyielding optimism about what is seen by many experts and environmentalists as a hopelessly slow and dysfunctional process. Leaving the press conference, I stopped Miguel Arias Ca\'c3\'b1ete, the European Union's climate commissioner and asked: Can you do this -- save the talks -- without the help of the United States, given that President Trump has denied the reality of climate science and pledged to pull out of this agreement? ""America is in,"" he said, not missing a beat. ""The federal government is on climate holidays. But in the United States, there is action. California. Governor Brown. The mayors of the important cities. The governors. There's action. Civil society is alive in the United States."" The optimism could be seen as justified by the coalition's origin story. The High Ambition Coalition emerged at the COP21 climate talks in Paris in 2015. That's where world leaders agreed to the treaty that's being put into practice now, with Paul's predecessor from the Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum, at the center. He rallied with the United States and other world powers to make a moral call for action that became the Paris Agreement. Before those talks, the idea of a 1.5-degree temperature limit for warming was not on the table. De Brum and the coalition made that level of ambition seem achievable. But much has changed in the three years since Paris. The science has gotten scarier. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report saying the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees of warming could be catastrophic. Currently the world is on track to warm more than 3 degrees. ""Two years ago, we and others were saying it looks like CO2 emissions are flattening off and polices are working -- but not going fast enough,"" said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and physicist who is director of Climate Analytics, a non-profit focusing on climate science and policy. ""Now we are seeing it's actually going in the opposite direction, which is just astonishing, really, given the scientific evidence is just accumulating."" The politics are almost unrecognizable. In 2015, the Obama Administration in the United States led the conversation on swift action with China. Under President Trump, the United States on Saturday joined Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait to decline on ""welcoming"" the latest science. That move, according to observers, has flared emotions among delegates from some of the world's poorer countries, who face dangerous consequences for a problem they haven't caused. There's been tragedy in the Marshall Islands as well. Minister de Brum, who helped form the High Ambition Coalition and emerged as the moral voice of the Paris Agreement, died in October 2017. Obituaries heralded him as one of the heroes of those negotiations. ""Tony de Brum is a great statesman, and his are huge shoes to fill,"" said Paul, the current minister. ""He really created something special that galvanized the entire world."" In an interview on Thursday, Paul said he feels the weight of that story on him as he walks these conference center halls this week. He also thinks about his children, ages 7, 8 and 15. ""We have 12 years to reverse these trends,"" he said, citing a date from the latest IPCC scientific report, which shows preventing 1.5 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels could soon become impossible. Paul flipped that statement to glass-half-full, though. ""We have that window of opportunity,"" he said."" We have to take advantage of it."" ""A half degree makes a huge difference in terms of the state of our islands,"" he said. ""This is really about the existence of our country -- and our culture and our people. ""The moment to act is now."" \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA173","Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform Announces New Investment of EUR 5 Million in the Green for Growth Fund at COP24","December 14, 2018 Friday 7:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Investment Bank issued the following news release:    - This inaugural investment enabled the Green for Growth Fund to harness private funding for greater energy savings and renewable energy in the Middle East and North Africa region - Measures financed through the investment should result in annual primary energy savings of 200,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of 40,000 metric tons During COP24 taking place in Katowice, Poland, Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCFP) officially signed an investment of EUR 5 million to the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to support the fund's lending for energy efficiency, resource efficiency and renewable energy measures in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Serving as a risk cushion, this investment helped the fund to attract further private investors, thus enhancing its outreach and impact. This operation was first committed at a ceremony held during COP 23, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. Since then, GGF's outstanding portfolio in the MENA region has grown stronger to over EUR 110 million spread across 14 partner institutions and has generated cumulative sub-loans of over EUR 60 million. This existing portfolio is yielding estimated annual primary energy savings of 460,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of around 90,000 metric tons. Part of the portfolio has been developed thanks to the planned Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform support, and it already exceeds the targets set at the time of the initial announcement in Bonn. Founded in late 2016, the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform aims to fund high-impact climate action projects with strong environmental and development benefits, thereby acting as a catalyst for additional financing. The platform contributes to Luxembourg's international commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and is in line with the EIB's Climate Strategy. GGF Chairman Olaf Zymelka stated: ""EIB being one of the initiators of GGF, has been a tremendous support throughout our journey and we are grateful to them and the Luxembourg government to choose GGF as the very first investment of this joint initiative. This new partnership will enhance our capacity to respond to the growing demand for energy and resource efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy in MENA, and we are eager to contribute further to a green future for the region."" Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action and environment said: ""The first pillar of EIB's Climate Strategy focuses on reinforcing the impact of EIB climate financing. That's why I am very pleased that following last year's announcement at COP 23, we have now finalised our investment in the Green for Growth Fund (GGF). The EIB has played a key role in the development of the GGF, and remains one of the fund's leading partners. We believe that this joint support under the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform is an important signal of confidence in the fund's potential going forward and we hope our commitment will attract additional finance from third parties, including from the private sector. Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg Minister of Finance, said: ""For Luxembourg, being an important financial centre, unlocking private finance is a key objective. Luxembourg is thus very pleased to partner with the EIB on the Green For Growth Fund."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6553929 MSTRUCK \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA174","Uncertainty, hope at the 11th hour of COP24 climate talks","December 14, 2018 Friday 12:11 PM EST","CNN.com","The UN climate talks in Poland -- an attempt to save the world from disastrous levels of global warming -- are sputtering toward a conclusion after two weeks of discord. ""They're going nowhere -- for Tuvalu, for small counties,"" Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga of Tuvalu, an island country in the Pacific, said Friday morning. ""What we have on the table is very disappointing, very frustrating. We are unhappy. We are going back on the Paris Agreement -- what we agreed to three years ago. It looks like people still do not trust each other. There is a lack of confidence [and] trust on the principles of working together."" Sopoaga said the United States alone is standing in the way of agreement. ""It's the White House alone that's dragging their feet,"" he said. ""Our country is already going underneath the water. I hope the White House reconsiders its position."" At issue for countries like Tuvalu, which are feeling the effects of climate change but doing little to cause it, is debate about whether to ""welcome"" a recent report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that says pollution from fossil fuels and other sources must be cut dramatically in just 12 years to avoid disastrous warming. Last weekend at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait declined to ""welcome"" that report, instead wanting only to ""note"" its existence, which is light-years away in diplomat speak. That disagreement, along with events at COP24 that promoted fossil fuel technologies, have cast a cloud over these negotiations, which are being held in Polish coal country. US President Donald Trump has pledged to pull out of the Paris Agreement. That can't technically happen until 2020, though, so the nation still has a presence in these talks. Not everyone here sees the US playing the spoiler role in Poland. ""When Trump announced that the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement, we thought it would be reflected strongly in having a US administration blocking negotiations,"" said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, president of a previous round of these negotiations, COP20, and global lead for climate and energy issues at World Wide Fund for Nature, a US-based environmental group. ""Fortunately, that hasn't happened,"" he said. ""The US negotiators and head of delegation have not been a strong supporter -- but haven't blocked negotiations."" The point of the negotiations is to come up with a ""rulebook"" that will make real the Paris Agreement on climate change, to which countries agreed at these talks in 2015. New, but not final, drafts of those rules were released on Thursday night and will continue to be revised. The talks were supposed to end Friday but now appear to be headed into the weekend, according to several observers and negotiators involved in the discussions. Among the issues ministers are debating are rules for reporting emissions; financing -- or even reparations of sorts -- for developing countries as they deal with the effects of climate change; and, importantly, the symbolic issue about ""welcoming"" the best international science. The Paris Agreement calls for countries to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or at most 2 degrees -- above pre-industrial levels. It's a global ""peer pressure"" agreement that relies on nations submitting their own plans for cutting pollution and reporting on those efforts. There are no financial penalties, for example, if nations fail to meet their pledges. Partly for those reasons, it's crucial that there are clear and strict rules that require countries to report how much progress they are or aren't making to reduce pollution, said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and director of Climate Analytics, a nonprofit research and policy group. Aspects of the current rules are ""weak,"" he said, but could change. ""This is still in play as far as I'm concerned,"" he said Friday afternoon. ""We have some real concerns about certain areas,"" said David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute, an environmental policy group. He identified the draft rules around emissions trading as one weakness. Another potential blocker in the ongoing negotiations ""loss and damage"": aid to poorer countries hurt by global warming. There remains a sense of uncertainty in the air in Poland. Until a final draft of the rulebook is available, it's hard to know how things will turn out, said Todd Stern, the United States climate envoy under the Obama administration. ""From what I've seen so far, it's edging its way toward a decent outcome -- I hope,"" Stern said, noting that most meetings are taking place behind closed doors. ""But we haven't seen a document yet. Big things can happen between documents."" Others are even more optimistic. Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for ecological transition, is ""sure"" that an agreement will be reached in Poland, she said Friday afternoon. ""There's nothing that could explain why there would not be an agreement here,"" she said. The main hall of the sterile conference center in Poland where the talks are being held was filled twice on Friday with protesters demanding swifter action from world leaders. A group of Polish children, inspired by a teenager from Sweden, walked out of school this morning. On Twitter, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen, called for a global walkout for climate action. ""It's about time those with power and the resources come down to see what life is like with the people,"" said Taneti Maamau, president of Kiribati, another island nation in the Pacific Ocean. He was overlooking protests in the conference center on Friday afternoon. Environmentalists were chanting ""keep it in the ground"" as they held signs saying, ""Which side are you on?"" and ""System change not climate change."" Countries like Tuvalu, which arguably have the most to lose if these talks derail, were on edge about the results of the rulemaking conference, which follows several alarming reports about the clear state of climate science and the fact that global pollution is still climbing. ""It's so unfortunate -- despite the warnings from the IPCC special report -- that we are stuck in our own self-interested agendas here in this process,"" Tuvalu's Sopoaga said of the UN report. ""We should rise beyond this,"" he said. ""We cannot allow this to happen."" \"

Assistant Secretary-General and Head of the New York Office of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Satya S Tripathi, said the government should not carry out the rebuilding work alone because no government can ever be able to deal with a problem of such a massive proportions. ""So working with civil society, working with the people, working with the private sector, I think we need to bring everybody together, working with a common goal--that is the only way to do it,"" Tripathi told PTI on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 24 ) at Katowice in Poland. Describing people of Kerala as ""extremely enterprising"", Tripathi said, ""hats off to the people of Kerala. I can already see that the government is working with a lot of stakeholders to build a partnership that will help"". While 483 people and thousands of livestock were killed, the disaster happened in the month of August this year incurred immense losses on the state's infrastructure, as many roads, bridges and thousands of houses were damaged/washed away. Tripathi said the biggest lesson he took away from the massive recovery coordination was the power of partnerships. He also said it was not helpful to do the same things again because that would not help in the long run and every disaster gives you an opportunity to build better. ""So one needs to look at what was missing. Why did the floods happened to start with and how that we have suffered all these deaths and devastation, could we do something differently and I think that is the message for all the tragedy and the immense havoc that was caused on people and property in Kerala,"" said Tripathi who had served as Senior Adviser on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at UNEP. ""It also is a God-sent opportunity to look at the problem from a different perspective and see how we can do better this time. There are opportunities and lessons for all in this crisis,"" said Tripathi, a development economist and lawyer with over 35 years of experience. Asked about the arguments by certain experts that dams have played a role in increasing the proportions of Kerala flood disaster during July-August 2018, Tripathi said he leaves that to experts but maintained that the ecological risks to the eco-system overall is far more when you come up with big dams. ""Because while we see the visible benefits of providing water for irrigation and other things, the invisible damages very huge both in terms of eco-system, species and the environment in general,"" said the top UN official. He said, ""While e are putting up dams and if we are really looking at the environmental impact in a holistic manner, sometimes the visible benefits are made to look very big and the invisible losses nobody looks at till you have a flood of the century."" ""I think one needs to have a really holistic look at this mega scale projects which may not necessarily serve the interest of the people and the planet in a longer term,"" Tripathi said.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA177","Europe steps up climate funding for developing countries, as COP24 talks divide","December 13, 2018 Thursday","SNL Power Daily with Market Report","Several of the biggest providers of climate finance for the developing world said they would devote additional funds to fighting the effects of a warming planet, as countries appeared divided over key issues during climate negotiations taking place in Poland. France, Germany, the U.K. and the European Commission all announced that they would step up financial support for developing countries, as government ministers were deep in negotiations to agree on a rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change at the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 , in Katowice, Poland. ""Europe is stepping up support to help developing countries build resilience and adapt to the impacts of climate change,"" EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete said in a Dec. 12 announcement that the EU would contribute 10 million in 2019 to a climate change adaptation fund for developing countries set up by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC. Several European countries had already made similar pledges totaling several hundred million euros during the talks in Katowice, where delegates from more than 190 nations are currently trying to hammer out an agreement on how to implement the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to at least 2 degrees C compared to preindustrial levels. Discussions at the conference, which runs until Dec. 14, are centered around individual countries' emissions reductions pledges to achieve the goals of the accord as well as how to finance mitigation and adaptation for vulnerable nations and the overall transition to a low-carbon global economy. France said it will contribute an additional 15 million to the climate change adaptation fund and 20 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund, another UNFCCC vehicle. The country will increase its public climate funding to 5 billion per year in 2020, compared with 3 billion in 2015, the French environment ministry said, with the share devoted to climate change adaptation rising from 1 billion to 1.5 billion per year. Germany's environment ministry said it will also pour an additional 70 million into the adaptation fund, which finances projects like early warning systems for floods and heavy rainfall and measures for securing water supply. With a contribution of 240 million so far, Germany is already the largest donor to the fund, the ministry said. The U.K. announced that it would provide an extra \£3100 million to support up to 40 new renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa over the next five years, supporting developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects. The government said the funds, part of the U.K.'s commitment to invest \£35.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020, could unlock an additional \£3156 million of private finance into renewable energy in Africa by 2023. Climate finance rules still lacking At the Paris climate negotiations in 2015, 18 developed countries pledged to leverage climate financing of $100 billion annually from 2020 to developing countries. According to climate news website Carbon Brief, a recent assessment by the U.N. found that the sum had reached $75 billion in 2016, up from $65 billion in 2015 either directly given by governments or raised from the private sector. A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, found that public climate finance alone reached $56.7 billion in 2017. But even after previous climate summits taking up the topic, rich donor countries and poorer nations on the receiving end of the funds still disagree over what counts as climate finance. ""In the absence of any common accounting methodology under the UNFCCC, contributor countries have been able to decide in a vacuum what they would count as part of their commitment to mobilize $100 billion by 2020,"" Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, and Romain Weikmans, a lecturer at Universit\'e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, wrote in a blog post for the Brookings Institution, a think tank. Since contributing countries have adopted different accounting and reporting practices, it is near impossible to compare data on climate finance, the authors said. While previous COP summits have called for the development of rules to account for climate finance, ""these modalities need to be decided, so the world can get on with this,"" Roberts and Weikmans said. ""The next few days in Katowice will be crucial in redressing the current dysfunction."" European countries and the U.S. are also fighting efforts by developing countries to introduce terms on loss and damage provisions, which would detail how to compensate the most vulnerable countries for already occurring climate change effects, into all negotiating items on the table, according to news website Euractiv. Japan was the largest climate finance provider in 2015 and 2016, giving $10.3 billion per year on average, followed by Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S., according to Carbon Brief's analysis of a climate finance database collated by the OECD. The biggest recipients of the funds in those years were India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, the EU, its member states and the European Investment Bank together provided 20.4 billion in public climate finance for developing countries, making up over 40% of the total provided by the developed world, according to the European Commission. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA178","As World Gathers for COP24, Chase Bank Found Undermining Paris Agreement by Financing Coal Power Expansion in Poland","December 5, 2018 Wednesday 1:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Rainforest Action Network issued the following news release:    - Climate advocates claim JPMorgan funding is starkly at odds with the goal of a 1.5 degree world Katowice - As global leaders head to Katowice to strengthen climate commitments at COP24 , a briefing paper released today by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and Fundacja Rozwoj Tak - Odkrywki Nie (Foundation Development Yes - Open-Pit Mines No, or RT-ON) underscores the counterproductive role of major financial institutions like JPMorgan (Chase) to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Chase is enabling the Polish coal industry to continue to grow even while other countries across Europe make commitments to phase out coal. The planned Ostroleka C coal-fired power plant has attracted particular controversy. Chase, already the target of a growing international climate accountability campaign due to its role as the #1 U.S. banker of extreme fossil fuels, is supporting Ostroleka C via financing for Energa, one of the two state-controlled companies behind the project. The Ostroleka C power plant is projected to burn two million tons of coal per year from 2023 to 2063, emitting six million tons of CO2 annually and causing serious public health impacts. Last year, Chase underwrote a Euros300 million bond issuance for Energa at a time when Ostroleka C was a key strategic project for the company, despite a Chase policy ruling out direct finance for new coal plants in OECD countries, including Poland. This bond issuance constituted the only private bank financing for either Energa or Enea since the adoption of the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""From a climate context, new coal power should not be happening, and Chase knows it. Yet, Chase is actively promoting the expansion of coal power in Poland by exploiting a glaring loophole in its coal policy that goes totally against its stated commitment not to fund the expansion of coal-fired power plants,"" said Jason Opena Disterhoft with Rainforest Action Network (RAN). ""Chase's financing of Ostroleka C is flatly incompatible with the Paris Agreement or supporting a 1.5 degree world."" ""JPMorgan Chase should know better,"" said Kuba Gogolewski, Senior Finance Campaigner at Foundation ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO"". ""They should look beyond the very short-term interest in providing finance to the Polish coal industry. The energy system in Poland must undergo a rapid transformation, and JPMorgan Chase is slowing down this change by financing coal utilities and coal power plants."" Chase has been the target of widespread, escalating protests calling on the bank to end its massive financing of the most destructive and polluting forms of fossil fuels and to align its policies and practices with the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Agreement. The October 2018 report from the IPCC has brought unprecedented attention to the urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To meet that goal, global carbon emissions would have to fall by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, reaching zero around 2050. New Coalswarm and Greenpeace analysis has shown that OECD countries -- including Poland -- must lead the way by ending coal power by 2030. By contrast, any new coal-fired power plants are flatly incompatible with limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees. These would drive expanded extraction, when potential emissions from currently operating coal, oil and gas reserves takes the world beyond 2 C, and emissions even from currently operating oil and gas alone takes the world past 1.5 C. Shareholders, investors, financial analysts, and lawmakers increasingly recognize how financially tenuous and environmentally disastrous the Ostroleka C project--and Poland's coal industry--is. Carbon Tracker projects that the power plant, if built, would be ""permanently unprofitable,"" with a net loss of Euros1.7 billion over its lifetime. Furthermore, Ostroleka C is facing challenges in the courts. ClientEarth, a shareholder in Enea, has sued the company for approving the project, and one of Enea's trade unions has filed a parallel lawsuit.b Ostroleka C is slated to be the last coal-fired power plant in Poland, and major international insurers have already stated that they will have nothing to do with the project. Chase has, to date, made no such commitment, and, on the contrary, appears to be committed to facilitating the construction of a climate-destructive coal plant in a tenuous financial situation.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA179","LOOKING BEYOND FOSSIL FUELS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS","December 6, 2018 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","In midst of the 24th United Nations climate change conference ( COP24 ), many are trying to double down in the search for practical, actionable solutions to the climate crisis: land itself. Ahead of the ongoing COP24 , the U.N. Environmental Programme (UNEP) launched a report warning that the international community's pledges under the Paris agreement, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, thus, ambition gap has already lead to the current impacts of climate change that can be seen around the world and will continue to see for decades to come, World Resources Institute's (WRI) global climate senior associate and one of the lead authors of UNEP's report Kelly Levin told IPS. ""The ambition of current country commitments is not in line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement. If we continue to do what we are doing right now, we are going to see over 3 degrees Celsius warming,"" she said. UNEP's annual 'Emissions Gap Report' found that governments must triple their efforts as emissions must be reduced by a quarter by 2030 to keep warming no more than 2 degrees Celsius and would have to be halved to read the 1.5 degree Celsius target. Not only is there a gap, but the report also found that there was a rise in emissions in 2017 unlike recent years. While much of the attention remains on the need to reduce fossil fuel use, land restoration and reforestation are often neglected as solutions to the crisis. ""I think that there is an underrecognition of how important the land sector in particular is right now...it is one of the most immediately available opportunities and relatively least cost,"" Lubowski said. According to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the land-use sector represents between 25 to 30 percent of total global emissions. Tropical deforestation alone accounts for 8 percent of the world's annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. If it were a country, it would be the world's third-biggest emitter. Though land-use change emissions have remained relatively flat, action targeting the sector is ""low-hanging fruit"" that can close the emissions gap by up to 30 percent, Lubowski noted. ""Reducing deforestation has already proven to be the most viable large-scale solution. What's needed I think is to go beyond these just sticks and try to introduce some carrots in terms of some positive incentives...And we haven't even come close to exhausting that opportunity,"" he added. Moving Around The Money Fiscal policy reform is among the most effective tools to create incentives for low-carbon investments and reduce GHG emissions. ""Both the traditional fiscal policies as well as creating these carbon markets and emissions trading programs have really a big part to play in land-use, particularly tropical deforestation,"" Lubowski told IPS. He pointed to ecological fiscal transfer as one such policy as it allows local governments to receive tax revenue and resources based on their performance on conservation. The inclusion of conservation indices as part of decisions around fiscal allocation provides incentives for local municipalities to protect land and forests as well as resources to expand such protections. Without resources, local governments may be forced to allocate land to agriculture, industry, and construction in order to generate revenue. Only a few countries have implemented the policy with Brazil being the first to take advantage of the opportunity with its ICMS-E programme. This has lead to a 165 percent increase in the extent of conservation area between 1992 and 2000-equivalent to an increase of more than one million hectares of protected areas. For instance, Parana, a southern Brazilian state, devoted five percent of the municipal tax share towards the protection of biodiversity conservation areas and watershed areas and has since expanded its protected areas. Brazil's efforts in curbing deforestation as a whole led to the decrease of almost 30 percent of GHG emissions. However, there are now concerns that the newly elected Jair Bolsonaro will reverse the country's trends after advocating for the reduction in conservation areas, increase in mining in the Amazon, and even the abolishment of the Ministry of Environment. Neighbouring Colombia has taken a slightly different approach to that of Brazil by implementing a tax for every ton of CO2 a company is responsible for emitting. Revenue from the tax are allocated towards land preservation and sustainable development in rural communities. The fiscal policy also provides an incentive for companies as they can be exempt from paying a carbon tax if they become carbon-neutral or engage in offsetting activities such as environmental projects. A similar carbon offsetting and reduction approach is also being designed by the aviation industry which is could be responsible for approximately five percent of global GHG emissions by 2050. The Future is Trees Since the land sector make up approximately 20-25 percent of NDCs, it is increasingly important to implement policies towards restoration and conservation, Lubowski noted. However, both Levin and Lubowski noted that this will not be enough to reduce the emissions gap and reverse trends. ""We need action in every sector. We need to step away from fossil fuel energy sources and move towards clean energy sources, we need to stop deforestation and restore our lands, we need to curb emissions from agriculture, we need to address transportation and have zero energy cities,"" Levin told IPS. According to the UNEP report, if all fossil fuel subsidies alone were phased out, it would lead to a 10 percent reduction of emissions by 2030. ""We know what the ingredients are for success, we know how to do this. It's not going to cost a lot and it will actually bring significant [benefits]... it's just a question of getting down to it,"" Levin added. ""I am definitely worried about where we are, especially if we are thinking about 1.5, the land sector becomes even more important in terms of not only reducing emissions which is essential but also going negative,"" Lubowski said. He urged for more international cooperation in reducing emissions and greater focus on forestry as a way to ramp up ambition in a cost-effective way. Levin highlighted the need for countries to scale up their commitments by 2020 and COP to step up. ""[COP] will be a really important moment to reaffirm the process for countries...it's the first test of the spirit of the Paris Agreement and it needs to send a really clear message of enhancing ambition,"" she said. \"

The meeting was convened by the new Nuclear Innovation: Clean Energy Future (NICE Future) initiative to address how innovative and advanced nuclear technologies could accelerate emissions reductions. The NICE Future initiative launched at last Mays Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) in Copenhagen, Denmark. The initiative envisions nuclear powers many uses in contributing to clean, reliable energy systems of the future. Nuclear energy is both a primary source of clean energy and an enabler of other clean energy sources. Globally, nuclear energy produces nearly one-third of the worlds emissions-free electricity. The U.S., Japan, and Canada spearheaded the NICE Future initiative. Since its start, six more countries have joined, and the initiative has engaged representatives from more than 80 organizations and individuals from more than 25 countries worldwide. As de-carbonization becomes a goal for so many, it is becoming clear that large scale power demands will require big, 24/7, clean and resilient energy sources to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply. Nuclear is that source, said Sarah Lennon, NE Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary, on behalf of the Canada, Japan, U.S. NICE Future Lead Team. Nuclear energy the clean energy workhorse, yet its often omitted from conversations about clean energy. We see a role for nuclear and renewables versus nuclear or renewables. Thats new thinking. I am pleased that during COP 24 there is also a place for discussion on nuclear energy and its role in the energy systems of the future, said Polands Minister of Energy, Krzysztof Tchrzewski, in keynote remarks. It is nuclear power that will be the main tool to reduce emissions. Poland has decided to follow this direction because nuclear power plants offer stable power generation with zero emission of air pollutants."" Speakers representing governments, research organizations, and NGOs worldwide discussed breakthrough innovative and integrated systems and applications. Of particular note are nuclear-renewable systems that enhance renewables integration into the grid and further enable both technologies. These technologies also enable combined uses of heat and power, hydrogen production, and industrial de-carbonization.

Hurricanes. Four straight record-setting years of increasing temperatures. Ocean acidification. Sea-level rise. Species loss. Drought. All are made worse by climate change, fueling humanitarian crises as people are forced to flee their homes because of natural disaster or changes in their environment. ""Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,"" warns the 1,656-page National Climate Assessment released Nov. 23 by the Trump administration. On Sunday, Dec. 2, representatives from United Nations member states, including government, nonprofit and faith-based organizations, will meet in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24 , to hammer out a framework for implementing the Paris Agreement, which was reached in 2015 at the 21st conference. ""Not only have all the nations of the world signed the Paris Agreement, I have seen the great religions of the world and the indigenous spiritual traditions also come together to seek the healing of the planet,"" said California Bishop Marc Andrus in an email to Episcopal News Service. ""During Lambeth 2008 I listened with astonishment as bishops from India, West Africa, Australia, the United States and Sudan talked for just short of two hours about the environmental degradation and climate change effects that were already plaguing the dioceses they served,"" he said. ""Only in the last 10 minutes of the two hours allotted for conversation on two of the major issues that have been facing our church for decades did this group of bishops turn their attention to the second issue, so consumed were they by the present danger of climate change."" Andrus will lead an eight-member delegation representing Presiding Bishop Michael Curry at the Dec. 2-14 conference in Poland. This is the fourth Episcopal delegation to attend the annual conference on climate change. The Episcopal Church began attending the conference in 2015 in France, where the Paris Agreement was reached. In Paris, the Episcopal delegation made a spiritual case for climate action. At that conference, member countries, including the United States, reached a landmark agreement to set voluntary goals aimed at keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists predicted would be necessary to prevent a spiraling catastrophe of melting glaciers, rising sea levels and related weather extremes. Greenpeace stages a protest outside the UN Climate Change Conference 2016 (COP22) in Marrakech, Morocco, Nov. 18, 2016. Photo: Reuters In Morocco in 2017, nations reaffirmed their commitment to cut carbon emissions. In Germany, in 2018, the process was thrown into doubt by President Donald Trump's pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement. The United States is the world's largest economy and its second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and make the planet warmer. It was in June 2017, as part of his ""American First"" strategy, that Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the international agreement, saying it undermines the economy and places the United States at a disadvantage. Since then, the We Are Still In movement has taken root, with more than 200 faith organizations signing on, including Episcopal churches. Still, the world is far from meeting the Paris Agreement's target, which would require reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels. In fact, emissions continue to rise. The conference in Poland is intended ""to finalize the rulebook for how the Paris Agreement will work. ... That's important because if you don't have rules, it falls apart at this level of bureaucracy,"" said Lynnaia Main, the Episcopal Church's representative to the United Nations. Scientists agree that climate change is a global threat. The World Meteorological Organization warns that, given current trends, warming could reach between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which informs U.N. policy, issued a similarly dire report. ""I have quoted many times in the past decade something that was said by the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams: 'It takes a global body to deal with global problems.' An example of how this is true is the increasing crisis of environmental refugees,"" Andrus said. ""Have you wondered what was the engine that drove the closely watched caravan out of Central America? According to an Oct. 30, 2018, Guardian article, in addition to violence, organized crime and systematic corruption, 'climate change in the region is exacerbating and sometimes causing a miasma of other problems, including crop failures and poverty.' The caravan comes mainly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, it crosses Mexico and seeks asylum in the United States. ... The struggle of the people in the caravan is transnational, and I would say cannot be 'solved' by any one country. We must work together for the good of all,"" Andrus said. Environmental justice is one of the church's three main priorities, along with racial reconciliation and evangelism. Over the years, General Convention has passed numerous resolutions on the issue, whether supporting federal climate action or pledging to mitigate the church's own impact on the environment. The church's 79th General Convention met in July in Austin, Texas, and passed 19 environmental resolutions, including support for a national carbon tax, carbon offsets for church-related travel, ocean health and Episcopalians' continued participation in the Paris Agreement. In 2016, the Episcopal Church was granted U.N. observer status, which allows members of the delegation to brief U.N. representatives on the Episcopal Church's General Convention climate resolutions and to attend meetings in the official zone. ""The continuity fostered by our COP delegations' attendance at the annual U.N. Climate Change Conferences has a multiplier effect for our broader Episcopal and Anglican influence at the United Nations,"" said Main in a press release. ""Our actions in Katowice will strengthen a broader base of U.N. ministry that includes eradicating poverty through the Sustainable Development Goals, supporting migrants and refugees, defending indigenous peoples, mainstreaming gender and protecting rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.""

Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow, said that developed and developing countries have nothing to fear from the transition to a climate friendly economy. ""The opportunities of the green economy are already being felt. In the USA there are more jobs in the solar industry alone than in generating electricity through coal, oil and gas combined. The solar industry is also creating jobs 17 times faster than the rest of the economy. Around the world there are now more than 10 million people employed in renewables with this figure rising. ""Research from the London School of Economics this year showed that the amount of retraining needed to make people ready for the transition to green jobs is much lower than many realise. Their analysis showed that in the USA, 44% of workers already have the transferable skills needed to contribute to the green economy."" There has also been recent progress made in countries like Spain that have recently announced a 250m euro package to help coal miners as part of plans to phase out Spanish coal mines. Mr Adow said the developing world also had much to gain from the transition away from a carbon-based economy. ""As well as tackling climate change the benefits for developing countries to leapfrog the fossil energy systems of the past to modern, clean alternatives, are clear. Trudging along the dirty development path trod by richer countries will see developing nations stuck in the past and pollute their environments while ruining efforts to limit global warming. ""In order to jump straight to renewables developing countries will need finance and support from richer countries but the benefits will be felt by everyone.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA184","UN Experts Urge Poland to Ensure Free and Full Participation at Climate Talks","May 7, 2018 Monday 7:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The United Nations Human Rights Committee issued the following news release: Poland should ensure free and full participation at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) at the end of the year, UN human rights experts said, citing concerns about a new safety and security law that could hamper civil society's involvement. Environmentalists have expressed concerns about the legislation, which was written specifically for the conference in Poland, saying it could affect their rights to privacy, peaceful assembly and participation. The UN experts raised the issue as the Polish Government briefed officials about preparations for COP24 at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn today. ""We acknowledge the commitment of the Government to host the climate conference, aiming to ensure that it will take place in a secure and safe manner,"" they said. ""As COP24 will take important decisions to implement the Paris Agreement and address challenges in mitigation action, it is critical that Poland strikes the right balance between safety concerns on the one hand, and fundamental freedoms of assembly, participation and privacy, on the other. ""For the COP24 The UN experts encouraged the Government to respond to their communication with detailed clarifications. ""As we move forward to combat climate change, Governments should encourage and ensure full and meaningful public participation in these critical multilateral discussions. All eyes are on the Polish Government to see how, as the host and the president of COP24 , it will honour its human rights obligations and uphold its responsibility to ensure free and unfettered access for broader participation,"" the experts said. ""We stand ready to work with the Government and advise on the ways to achieve that important objective."" Highlighted human rights concerns:  Article 17 appears to give sweeping surveillance powers to the police and secret services to collect and process personal data about all COP24 participants, on the basis of existing legislation that allows such surveillance of suspected criminals and individuals posing a threat to public safety. Applying such presumption on the COP24 participants appears to be unwarranted and unbalanced. Such broad surveillance is not subject to judicial review;  Article 22 appears to prevent spontaneous peaceful assemblies in Katowice, which owing to the expected evolving nature of the COP24 negotiations should be tolerated to allow for spontaneous protests to be freely and peacefully conducted. COP24 will take place in Katowice from 26 November to 16 December. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6279149 MSTRUCK \"

It will provide a market benchmark to operationalise the integration of energy efficient mortgages into the business lines of the forty-one pilot lending institutions. At the end of 2017, these lending institutions represented 55% of mortgages outstanding in the European Union, equal to 25% of EU GDP, constituting significant critical mass in the market. The EEM Initiative is a market-led initiative, funded via the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Programme, which aims to deliver a standardised European framework and data collection architecture for energy efficient mortgages, with favourable financing conditions for energy efficient buildings, energy saving renovations and anti-seismic measures. The EEM Pilot Scheme was launched in June 2018, further to the engagement of market actors in a consultation process by way of national and European roundtable events. The pilot scheme lending institutions are supported by the EEM Advisory Council, which includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, The World Bank, UNEP Finance Initiative, the Scottish Government and Climate Bond Initiative.

Gerassimos Thomas, European Commission, Deputy Director-General for Energy, stated: ""I believe the EEM Initiative will bring a positive change in the market, providing more accessible financing for energy efficiency in buildings. It will facilitate the implementation of energy efficiency investments where they are most needed, in the buildings sector. Having agreed on a definition is an important step, opening the way for a quick roll-out of energy efficiency mortgages. The definition agreed upon is operational and easy to use, and can be strengthened in time, to match the high level of ambition of the EEM Initiative, and to make better use of the tools provided by the European legislative framework."" Luca Bertalot, Energy Efficient Mortgages Initiative Coordinator, stated: ""Now is the time to take action, a market roadmap is the most effective way of delivering mortgage financing solutions to support European citizens in making their homes more energy efficient, comfortable, secure and therefore, ultimately, future-proof. The definition announced today provides a strong, operational market benchmark for lending institutions and a clear blueprint for the European Commission's Sustainable Finance agenda, by facilitating cross-sectoral and institutional coordination and delivering market innovation and synergies.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA186","COP24 KICKS OFF IN KATOWICE NEXT WEEK: HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW","November 29, 2018 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the World Bank: News on climate change has been grim over the past year. In 2017, carbon dioxide levels were the highest they have been in 3-5 million years. According to NASA, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880. And this is not a one-off: eighteen of the 19 warmest years on record have happened since 2000. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth in 2017 and sea levels are rising at the fastest recorded rate in 2,000 years. According to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the window to limit global warming to a below 2 pathway is fast closing. Moreover, not only are the consequences of a two-degree world far greater than that of a 1.5 world, but we are not on track for either. In 2017 alone disasters triggered by weather - and climate-related hazards cost the global economy US$320 billion in losses. In future these economic losses will increase and will have a bigger impact on the lives and livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable. By 2030, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030, unravelling development gains to date. By 2050, as many as 143 million people could become climate migrants in just three regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America), with individuals, families and even whole communities forced to seek more viable and less vulnerable places to live. Climate Action Could Unlock Major Economic Opportunities Despite the grim headlines, there is cause for optimism with clear evidence of the economic momentum driving finance and markets towards low-carbon opportunities, and the cost of renewables and batteries falling. The economic case for climate smart development is now clearer. The New Climate Economy report noted, for instance, that with the potential to unlock $26 trillion and 67 million jobs up to 2030 while also delivering reduced congestion, cleaner air, new jobs and market opportunities. Generating or integrating 18 gigawatts of additional renewable energy into electricity grids; and mobilizing over $10 billion in commercial finance for clean energy; Developing 22 investment plans for climate-smart agriculture in 20 countries; Providing 38 million people in 18 countries with access to reliable climate information and early warning systems to deal with more frequent and intense natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. There is also some movement in carbon markets. National and subnational carbon pricing efforts, which could offer the clearest signal of the low-carbon transition to market participants, have tripled in the last decade. As of September 2018, 46 national jurisdictions and 25 subnational jurisdictions are putting a price on carbon. In November 2018, the world's first official chapter of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition was launched in Singapore, reflecting growing momentum for carbon pricing in Asia. Globally, in 2018, the green bond issuance expected to reach $250 billion. In November 2018, the World Bank Group marked the ten year anniversary of green bonds with landmark issuance bringing the total $12.6 billion. Over those ten years, the World Bank Group has helped create this market including by defining criteria for eligible green bond projects and being the first to provide investors with assurances. The Bank has helped developing countries to issue green bonds, for example in Fiji in 2018, and IFC has helped corporations to develop this market in developing countries. In October 2018, the World Bank also launched the world's first blue bonds, aiming to help Seychelles transition to a sustainable use of marine resources. There's Good News and Bad News: So What Comes Next? COP24 ). The priority of the negotiations is agreement on the ""Paris Rulebook"" or the implementing guidelines of the Paris Agreement, effectively the framework of rules and operating procedures that will underpin the Agreement. The World Bank delegation will be participating in over 60 events, announcements and launches. The World Bank Group's engagement at COP will be centered around these core messages: first, we cannot fight poverty without fighting climate change, including scaling up attention to adaptation; second, ; third, that the World Bank Group is committed to extending its already significant leadership role on climate. As part of our endeavor to be more ambitious on climate, we will announce new 2025 targets through which, even as we continue a strong push on mitigation efforts, we will scale up our efforts on adaptation. Our announcements recognize the urgency of climate action and the significant role of the World Bank Group to help our clients avoid the mounting risks of a changing climate and unlock the economic opportunities of cleaner, climate smart growth. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA188","WHAT THE COP24 NEEDS: A NEW EMERGING MINDSET","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","An alternative framework of international development and new forms of consumption of good/services are implicit in achieving the goals of UN climate conference recently held in Poland. With 4.3 billion persons living on $5 or less per day, we cannot expect these persons or their countries to initially participate in the cost of climate change improvement without more favorable development. The reduction of hunger and poverty are inherent in the fight for a better climate because the poor are exactly the most exposed and least protected to adverse climate change. Rather than favor the developing world, the advanced nations have encumbered them with debt and exportation of profits; the net financial flows for the developing world are negative by 26.5 trillion dollars between 1980 and 2012 (Hickel, 2017). A more radical and effective development framework is emerging as proposed by the same author in his book the Divide. Certainly it will be an uphill battle as it involves elimination of debt burdens of developing countries, more global democracy in international financial institutions, more just wages, tax justice and land security. Obviously the current Western model of production and consumption is highly individualistic, targeting through advertising our desires, by following the trails of our digital lives through almost all of our Internet apps on cell phones and other digital devices. Even our political orientation can be influenced in this way. The consumption is short-term ""sugar-high"" satisfaction, to be repeated by purchase of another product shortly thereafter. This is extremely costly to the environment, overloading us with the production, consumption and transportation of products that serve secondary needs. The capitalization of companies selling consumer discretionary goods/services is 60 per cent of the capitalization of companies in the entire consumer sector of the S&P500 companies this year (Bespoke, 2018). And this is in sharp contrast to what really makes us happy: strong social relationships. The famous Harvard Study of Adult Development has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier. Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives. Importantly, international studies on happiness indicate that happy countries have high social capital and strong friendship networks. A cross-national study of 143 countries revealed that high levels of social trust and having someone to count on in case of need are associated with more positive feelings, better life evaluations, and the absence of negative feelings in most countries of the world. Also persons who participate in volunteering activities and with a high level of social trust are more likely than their peers to have better life evaluations and more positive feelings (Calvo et al. 2012). A new model of consumption is emerging based on social experience and sharing. The experience of culture in a social setting in the form of a concert or intelligent tourism staying with local natives and guides are examples. In the future, services that enhance our sociality will grow. We also have come to realize that we can share under-utilized capacity of our basic properties such as homes and automobiles; and the sharing economy has been born. In the past everyone enjoyed owning a car or a record, instead now use is more important that ownership. This greatly reduces the number of goods that must be produced. Sociality and sharing have a much lighter ecological footprint than the continuation of individualistic consumption of goods. The long-term gains of the sharing economy in terms of better utilization of capacity have been estimated at 570 billion euro for the EU28, according to the European Parliamentary Research Service (Goudin, 2016). Developing nations should be aware of these alternatives; otherwise they will develop slowly and fall into the trap of consumerism that business is so anxious to sell, which may lock them into energy infrastructures and greenhouse gas production that they could have, at least in part, avoided. We are reminded that according the latest data 670,000 MW of coal power plant capacity is currently in planning or already under construction in 59 countries (Urgewald, 2018). We are individuals and will always require some satisfaction of individual needs beyond the basic requirements of food, shelter, health and education; but at our best we are social, and should recognize that we have let individualism go too far in consumption and international relations.

""There is no more time to waste in short-term self-interestedness"", said Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit, WCC general secretary, while urging the UN to ramp up pledges from participating nations, in order to be able still to meet the agreed-upon goal of no more than 1.5 C increase in global temperatures. ""Urgent adaptation and mitigation measures, transformation of economic systems, deep behavioural change, and supportive national and global policies and institutional arrangements are needed now to avoid potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change"", he said. ""In facing this existential challenge, hope lies in realizing that sustainability and justice are two sides of the same coin"", Tveit added. Creation is not for sale For LWF general secretary Rev. Dr Martin Junge, a deep transformation is needed to limit the continued global warming. ""As people of faith we know well how God wants this world to be and what God wants for human beings and calls them to be in this world. Our message to the churches and to the world is that creation is not for sale. As churches we should focus on that vision and engage in action for climate justice"", he said. The Katowice Climate Change Conference, 2-15 December, is the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""The LWF engages with climate justice as a matter of intergenerational justice and our delegation at COP24 consists of young leaders actively involved in the topic of climate change and advocacy in their churches. They are issuing a clear call to the current generation, for future generations. Because climate change won't disappear by declaring that it doesn't exist"", added Junge. Support adaptation and resilience Rudelmar Bueno de Faria, general secretary of ACT Alliance, noted that the implementation of the Paris Agreement depends largely on the rules and guidelines that will be further developed at COP24 . ""Our call for climate justice and climate action is urgent. We are faced with unprecedented crises. Communities and countries are losing their territories in the Pacific to rising sea levels. Floods and droughts are causing humanitarian emergencies in Asia and Africa"", said de Faria, as he referred to the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5 degrees that provides scientific evidence of the need to act urgently to prevent catastrophic climate change. ""We are concerned that developed countries have not kept their promise to provide adequate climate change finance to support adaptation and resilience in developing countries. We are also disappointed that there isn't adequate climate change finance, and so far it has not met the criteria of predictability, additionality and transparency"", he added. The head of ACT Alliance also stressed the wish to see the issue of loss and damage ""receive support and to be included in the transparency framework of the Paris Agreement"". The World Council of Churches, ACT Alliance and the Lutheran World Federation represent more than half a billion Christians worldwide and have been engaged in climate justice advocacy work at local and global levels for the last decades.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA191","UN Climate Summit To Emit More CO2 Than 8,200 American Homes Do In A Year","December 3, 2018 Monday 4:07 PM EST","Conservative Daily News","Dec 03, 2018( Conservative Daily News: HYPERLINK http://conservativedailynews.com The U.N. estimates the summit, called COP24 , will emit[1] 55,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide  the very greenhouse gas U.N. officials are trying to keep from accumulating in the atmosphere. Based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) figures[2], that's the equivalent of more than 11,700 cars driving for one year or 728 tanker trucks worth of gasoline. That amount of CO2 emissions is also the same as 8,243 American homes for an entire year, according to EPA.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) However, that's a low-ball estimate because it only includes the emissions from the conference itself, and not emissions associated with the thousands of people who flew to the meeting in Katowice, Poland. More than a few summit-goers, including celebrities, likely flew private jets. When those emissions are factored in, COP24 's carbon footprint is likely much higher, according to environmental economist Richard Tol. '[It is] probably unusually high as Katowice would require multiple stops for anyone who's not from Europe,' Tol told The Daily Caller News Foundation. The high carbon footprint only contributes to the U.N.'s hypocritical image. Indeed, a former U.N. environment director was forced to resign in November over his extensive, costly travel[3] while warning the world of the need to cut emissions to stem global warming.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) U.N. officials spent the past few months hyping COP24 as one of the last chances humanity has to avoid catastrophic global warming. A U.N. report issued in October suggested a $27,000 per ton carbon tax[4] might be needed by the end of the century to stem warming. Tol also estimated COP24 's cost to top $130 million, but Tol considers that to be an underestimate because whole new facilities, basically a town, had to be built[5] to accommodate tens of thousands of people. 'There's 30,000 people in Katowice  1,300 person-years. I'd put that at $130 million,' Tol said via email. 'That's an underestimate, as they build a new town.' More than 30,000 people are expected to attend COP24 , which kicked off Monday, in Poland. For 60 days, U.N. officials, diplomats, environmentalists and journalists will eat up electricity and fuel traversing thousands of square meters of temporary structures set up to house the summit. The summit's goal is to further the implementation of the Paris climate accord, which went into effect in 2016. British natural historian and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough kicked off the summit with dire predictions of catastrophe[6] is nothing is done to stop global warming. However, Attenborough, like thousands of others, no doubt emitted lots of carbon dioxide getting to Katowice, which is in the heart of Poland's coal country. The U.N. has long been criticized for the high carbon footprints and costs of its meetings[7]. The U.N.'s 2015 climate summit likely resulted in 300,000 tons of CO2 emissions, mostly from associated air travel. To deal with this hypocritical image, the U.N. has taken to offset the emissions from its summits by sponsoring forestry projects. For COP24 , the U.N. will pay the Polish State Forests agency to plant 6 million trees. Carbon 'offsets,' however, are somewhat controversial because they allow people to pay for theoretical emissions reductions by funding green energy projects or reforestation. The U.N. is also offering free lanyards to COP24 participants[8] who buy offsets for non-conference-related emissions, which may include air travel based on how the U.N. calculates summit emissions. 'Many will put that on their expense account, so this is cheap virtue,' Tol said.

To book Dr. Huelskamp on your program - including a live TV remote from Heartland's studio, which can connect to any station or network in the world - please contact Media Specialist Billy Aouste at HYPERLINK mailto:media@heartland.org media@heartland.org Dear Secretary Pompeo, On behalf of The Heartland Institute, I would like to congratulate you for standing up for sound science at the COP24 United Nations climate summit in Katowice, Poland. I especially thank you for declining to ""welcome"" or endorse the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report 15 released this fall. The IPCC is, at its heart, a political rather than a scientific organization. Politicians and government figures select who will serve on the IPCC, and government political figures have final say on the conclusions of IPCC reports. Audits of the IPCC and its reports show the IPCC is stacked with environmental activists, utilizes sloppy and biased research, and has an embarrassing record of its projections being contradicted by real-world evidence. The overwhelming scientific evidence shows humans are not creating a climate crisis. IPCC Special Report 15 calls for the United States and other nations to impose massive carbon dioxide taxes on its people and spend tens of trillions of dollars to address a nonexistent climate crisis. Allowing Americans to exercise our own judgments to spend that money instead on better nutrition, education, healthcare, and other goods and services that make life more enjoyable, healthier, and longer lasting is a scientific, economic, and moral imperative. Like you, The Heartland Institute is standing up for climate realism at COP24 . On December 4 in Katowice, we hosted a science panel presenting the latest scientific evidence showing humans are not creating a global warming crisis. The panel included an unveiling of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels, a comprehensive scientific and economic volume documenting that fossil fuels provide substantial net benefits to society. Also, representatives of The Heartland Institute met in Katowice with the Solidarity labor union, with the two organizations drafting a joint statement expressing skepticism of the United Nations climate agenda and emphasizing the importance of affordable conventional energy. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for having the courage and energy to stand up for the American people and sound science in Poland. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to aid your invaluable work. Sincerely, Hon.

But we need bolder commitments and action on the ground. Even if all greenhouse emissions stopped today, the earth will still warm by a further 0.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. That locks us into an increasing number of extreme events--heat waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes--that will have a disproportionate effect on the world's most vulnerable people. ""When societies are unable to absorb the shocks of a changing climate, instability increases, making climate change a contributing factor to conflict. That's why Mercy Corps believes that in addition to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the world must also work to help vulnerable people and societies adapt to the coming crises. ""Climate change is making the poorest people poorer. To help them adapt and to avoid losses, we must invest in inclusive financial tools and other strategies to soften the blows of a changing climate. These can include lowering barriers to insurance, credit and savings, and increasing public and private finance. Otherwise, we risk undermining economic gains made in developing countries. ""The climate is changing. By taking action now, we can minimize risks and ensure that people, young and old alike, have the tools they need to prepare for and adapt to changes.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA194","From Minot State to the United Nationals and Back","July 13, 2018 Friday 6:51 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Minot State University issued the following news release: Minot State University staff member Kowan O'Keefe has already put together quite a list of experiences since he started at MSU as a freshman just eight years ago. Originally from Creston, British Columbia, O'Keefe began his time at Minot State mainly due to a chance to play collegiate golf. ""I came here in 2010 to play on the college golf team and started as a biology major, but ended up graduating with majors in chemistry and math,"" he said. O'Keefe was very successful on the golf team at Minot State. He was two-time academic All-American, the Player of the Year in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference, and won the NSIC's Dr. William Britain Award - the highest academic honor in the conference. He describes his time on the team as ""probably the best experience of the entire thing."" However, he didn't just spend time on the golf course while attending college. O'Keefe had the opportunity to present research he was working on in the lab to state, regional, and national conferences. One notable event he presented at was Posters on the Hill in Washington, D.C. Posters on the Hill gives students the opportunity to showcase their research to congressional members, meet with their representatives, and learn about advocacy for undergraduate research. Only 60 applicants are able to present while hundreds apply. ""I'm definitely a big fan of politics and that was really a cool opportunity to see how science plays a role in public policy and to communicate what type of research we're doing with policy makers who are quite intelligent, but they don't necessarily have a very strong background in chemistry or in math,"" O'Keefe said about the experience. Presenting research eventually took him beyond the United States. During his senior year of college, O'Keefe represented the American Chemical Society at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru in 2014. ""That was a really major conference because it was the last one right before the one in Paris where they ultimately signed the Paris agreement,"" he said. ""So a lot of the details for that were negotiated at the conference I was at in Peru."" O'Keefe attended a second United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2016 after having graduated with his masters at the University of Toronto. The second conference was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. After his time in Morocco, O'Keefe found himself back in Minot visiting his brother Karson O'Keefe. At that time, the opportunity to work with students at Minot State in the POWER Center - Providing Opportunities With Enhanced Resources - became available. O'Keefe describes the POWER Center as, ""an additional resource for students who are either first generation students, fall into a certain taxable income guideline, or have any type of documented disability. We provide additional tutoring, additional academic advising, priority course registration, assistance with financial aid applications. We serve almost 300 students across campus."" In addition to working in the POWER Center assisting students, O'Keefe was elected president of the Minot State Staff Senate May of 2018. MSU Staff Senate essentially gives staff a channel to make suggestions or recommendations. ""We have a staff satisfaction survey that goes out every year, and then based on the results of that, if there's an idea that a number of the staff thinks we can change, we'll try and find a way to accommodate or make those changes to make the experience better in whatever way that we can,"" he said. When O'Keefe is not working on making student and staff experiences better, he continues to pursue his passion for combating climate change. He is currently working on two chapters in a collaborative book titled ""The Paris Agreement and the Path Forward."" ""I've got the first chapter in that book which is basically explaining why the Paris Agreement is a good deal and why the U.S. should be a part of it,"" he said.

The event was led by the African Development Bank (AfDB), which earlier this year broke with the ever-green World Bank and announced that it will now fund coal-fired power projects. As AfDB put it, 'we have to use what we have' and this is true of oil and gas as well as coal. A number of African countries are rich in fossil fuel resources and they intend to develop these, in order to develop their economies and provide for their people. Mind you the Africans are also aggressively active in the Paris Agreement negotiations, which they also see as a potential source of funding for development. They are pushing hard on the finance front. But as with many developing countries, Paris lip service does not interfere with their use of coal, oil and gas. In fact since the World Bank pulled out, China has become the world leader in financing and building coal-fired electric power plants. Now the African Development Bank is also in the coal, oil and gas game. This is great news for a lot of poor people. Here is the official report of the event. Of course it is couched in terms of Paris Agreement nonsense, but the meaning is clear. We have oil and gas and we intend to use it. Managing Carbon Risks and Raising Climate Ambition New Policy Approaches for Countries with Fossil Fuels Presented by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Chatham House The side event aimed to draw attention to carbon risks across a range of policy areas, including energy, industrial, and long-term development planning. Presenters highlighted areas in policy and practice where development assistance can help countries overcome barriers to transitioning and building carbon resilience into long-term planning. Glada Lahn, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, moderated the event, and noted that the elephant in the room at COP 24 is the role of oil and gas in development in the context of the Paris Agreement. She highlighted global discussions around raising economies out of poverty via oil and gas extraction in order to spur growth and development, and stressed the risks posed by the fossil fuel market in transitioning to a low carbon economy. Sin Bradley, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, noted that there is a high expectation from countries on the role of oil and gas in their economies, highlighting a current reassessment of their value in the global economy. She underscored that the linkages between the oil and gas sector and the wider economy may deliver a shared value under Business-as-Usual, whereas they would deliver a shared risk towards the economy under a 1.5-degree goal scenario. She stressed the need to have a joint approach to carbon risks, adding that there is no point in pursuing climate solutions that undermine governance and socioeconomic stability. Chebet Maikut, Ministry of Water and Environment, Uganda, noted that Uganda has prioritized oil and gas as key sectors to spark socioeconomic development in the country. He stressed that his country needs to learn lessons from producer countries and highlighted his countrys commitment to reduce emissions from oil and gas by 22% by 2030. Rose Mwebaza, African Natural Resources Center of the AfDB, highlighted Nigeria as a good case study for including oil and gas emissions reduction measures in their Nationally Determined Contribution. She noted, however, that the NDC showed what to achieve but not how to achieve it, drawing attention to the lack of a carbon strategy to implement these reductions. She urged for the exchange of knowledge with producer countries on how to extract the resources in the least disruptive manner. In the ensuing discussion, panelists and participants discussed issues regarding: conflicts between biodiversity conservation and resource extraction, noting that Uganda's petroleum reserves overlapping with 80% of the country's protected areas; the implications of transitioning to low carbon development, considering the heavy dependence of transport systems on fossil fuels; whether subsidies for oil and gas compete with renewable energy; and the role of the insurance industry.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA196","Time To Wake Up: COP24","Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)","Newstex Blogs","Dec 11, 2018( Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse: HYPERLINK http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov Because the government of the United States of America has fallen under the political control of the industry most responsible for this mess. American leadership was essential to forging the global consensus on carbon emissions in the original Paris Agreement. I know because I was there in Paris in 2015 as Secretary Kerry and the U.S. negotiating team worked to seal the landmark pact. What a pathetic difference a few years make. In 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would become the only country in the world to turn its back on this agreement. The U.S. abdicates its leadership just as the scientific warnings of the dangers of climate change grow clearer, and grimmer. In October came a new report from the world's scientists working through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Last month, the federal government released its own sobering news about the worsening risks climate change poses to our nation and our economy. Our National Climate Assessment warned of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses due to climate change --if we don't act to curtail carbon emissions. Trump's responded first by describing his own 'very high levels of intelligence,' but then simply denied all the science because, he said, 'I don't see it.' Well, guess what? Pope Paul V didn't 'see it' when Galileo demonstrated that the earth revolved around the sun. That didn't change the astrophysics. The climate science, laid out in black and white by Trump's own government, is that our planet is heating up due to our use of fossil fuels. The science is even more incontrovertible than when Donald Trump said it was 'incontrovertible' in 2009. Saying he now doesn't see it, is the very definition of denial. 'Willful blindness' would be another term. The takeover of our government by fossil-fuel forces is having very real consequences in U.S. emissions numbers. After years of decline, U.S. carbon emissions rose in 2018, increasing by 2.5 percent. This of course coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to delay, repeal, and weaken rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants, oil and gas wells, industrial facilities, and vehicles. Of course all of these industries share the blame for not cleaning up their mess on their own, as well as for pushing the Trumpsters to weaken their safety regulations. Chinese carbon emissions increased in 2018, as did Indian emissions. Among major economies, only the European Union saw its emissions decline in 2018. This is why international summits like Poland are so important the world urgently needs to correct course, and we can only do so if countries together do their part to reduce emissions. According to the IPCC, to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we need to cut carbon emissions to 50 percent below 2010 levels by 2030, only 11 years from now, and we need to hit net zero emissions by 2050. The IPCC report calls pricing carbon the 'central' policy that will allow us to hold the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less. If you're sincere about market capitalism, where the costs of a product need to be in the price of the product for markets to work, this is pretty obvious. Where this gets difficult is if you're a fake free-marketeer who's really fronting for the fossil fuel industry. But if you're not faking it to cover for the industry who funds your party, it's pretty straightforward economics: you put the public harm externalities into the price of the product. The good news is that many governments from cities, states, and provinces to countries and regions are already pricing carbon. This chart shows the various governments that have set a price on carbon, either through emissions trading (in green) or a carbon fee (in purple). The prices vary. Sweden, for example, charges almost $140 per ton of carbon emitted, covering nearly 50 percent of the nation's emissions. The Canadian province of British Columbia enacted a carbon fee in 2008, rising over time to its current price of $35 per ton. In the four years following the British Columbia carbon fee, fossil fuel use decreased by 17 percent in the province, compared to a 1 percent increase in the rest of Canada. And British Columbia's economy grew faster than that of any other Canadian province. Why would it not? One hundred percent of the revenues raised from British Columbia's carbon fee are returned to taxpayers in the form of other tax cuts. And 70 percent of British Columbians support the policy. So what about the U.S.? California has put a price on carbon via an emissions trading system, as have the nine Northeastern states, including Rhode Island, that are members of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. For the moment, the prices in California and the RGGI states are still relatively low, around five bucks for RGGI. Senator Schatz and I have introduced an American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act to assess a carbon fee starting at $50 per metric ton of emissions in 2019 the mid-range of the Office of Management and Budget's 2016 estimates of the 'social cost of carbon,' the long-term damage done by carbon pollution. Our market-based proposal is an appeal to true conservative Republican colleagues. But the fossil fuel industry keeps a stranglehold on the Republican Party, preventing climate action, even using market principles. Things are unlikely to change as long as millions of industry dollars slosh around Washington, protecting this corrupting industry from having to account for the costs of its pollution. America is called the 'indispensable nation,' and American leadership is indispensable if we are to achieve a global response to a global challenge. But American leadership is lacking because the dark money and sleazy operatives of the fossil fuel industry today control the Trump administration and the Republican Party. There used to be a guy in this body who said, 'Country First.' We could use a little of that now, in this tragic Trump sleazefest. It is time to wake up. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA197","INDONESIA COMMITS TO LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT AND A GREEN ECONOMY AT COP24","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Although Indonesia has attained decent economic growth of over five percent in the last decade, in order to ensure sustainable growth in the future the switch to renewable energy (RE) will be critical, says the country's government. ""If we don't focus on low carbon development, we cannot continue this growth,"" Bambang Brodjonegoro, Indonesia's Minister of National Development Planning, said yesterday Dec. 10. He spoke about Indonesia's shift to a low carbon, climate-friendly development pathway at a high-level panel discussion at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which is currently being held in Katowice, Poland. The panel discussion was organised by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in partnership with the Ministry of National Development Planning of the Republic of Indonesia (BAPPENAS). The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns of catastrophic climatic impacts if global warming is not kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius. This will include severe impact on food production and increasing risks of climate-related disasters. But according to Brodjonegoro, the Indonesian government is taking this issue seriously. ""We are fully committed to steer our economy for low carbon development. We will mainstream a low carbon framework in our medium-term development plan,"" he said, adding that low carbon development in Indonesia would involve improving environmental quality, attaining energy efficiency, increasing agriculture productivity, improving reforestation and reducing deforestation simultaneously. There is a large scope for RE development in Indonesia, as most of its potential is unrealised as of now. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) report\'c2\~on Indonesia's RE prospects, the country has ""an estimated 716 GW of theoretical potential for renewable energy-based power generation"". But of its bioenergy potential of 32.7 GW, it has developed a mere 1.8 GW. ""In order to provide the electricity for remote areas, this is a good time to promote renewable energy as this will increase the percentage of renewable energy in our energy mix,"" Brodjonegoro said. According to the minister, a key issue for scaling up RE in Indonesia lies with developing the capacity of stakeholders to meet the needs of different types of investors to access finance. Dr. Frank Rijsberman, Director General of GGGI, echoed these thoughts, stating that the critical factor for proliferating renewables in Indonesia is whether it can attract private sector investment. ""Both governments and the private sector have not fully incorporated the idea that green growth is not only nice but it is also affordable,"" he said. ""Businesses should be investing in renewable energy because there is a business opportunity."" In this regard, he said that blended finance could be a critical path where every dollar investment from donors could catalyse other investments from private sources. State Secretary for Climate and Environment in Norway Sveinung Rotevatn, was a panelist at the event. He stated that Norway is encouraged by the low carbon development in Indonesia, and is committing substantial funds to reduce deforestation there. According to Global Forest Watch, Indonesia experienced a drop in tree cover loss in 2017, including a 60 percent decline in\'c2\~primary forest loss. The organisaiton said that this could be in part to the 2016 government moratorium on the conversion of peatland. ""As a developed country we see [Norway] as having a responsibility to contribute,"" he said. Norway has been working in partnership with Indonesia since 2010. The future of oil is not bright, and Rotevatn believes the shift in production to gas from coal could be a useful bridge towards a shift to renewables in the long run. He added that resistance in this transition from fossil fuels to renewables is expected. ""In 1991 Norway introduced a carbon tax. Today we consider it a natural thing but implementing it is always hard,"" he said. One estimate from the Norwegian environmental agency shows that since Norway reduced emissions in 1991 it continued healthy economic growth. However, Indonesia has a long way to go in the transition process as over 90 percent of its energy still comes from fossil fuels. But the government is optimistic of its potential to scale up RE. ""We are focusing on incentivising renewable energy production and increasing infrastructure of renewable energy capacity. We have a lot of isolated islands and remote areas which can be utilised,"" said Rida Mulyana, Director General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (NREEC) at Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. However, he noted that several challenges remain. One of these is public acceptance, as there is still a need for systematic and sustainable socialisation and education to minimise community resistance to RE projects. While Mulayana pointed out financing as a key issue, he also said the government will not provide any subsidy for renewables and it has to compete with other sources of energy. David Kerins, Senior Energy Economist at the European Investment Bank and another panelist at the event, said although RE projects are becoming more commercially viable, the private sector is yet to jump in on these investment opportunities. So there is a need to promote investment while providing safeguards to investors on the expected benefits. ""The RE energy sector has moved far beyond the situation it was before. Once people see how possible and straight forward it is, private sector can start targeting projects of its own,"" he said. Glenn Pearce-Oroz, Director for Policy and Programmes, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), one of the attendees of the event, said one of the important next steps will be how to bring along commercial financing for low carbon development. ""Part of what we are seeing is private sector being more and more interested to do business in the green economy. What they are looking for though is clarity of roles and consistency in terms of the markets they are getting into,"" he said. ""So the challenge for developing countries is how do you demonstrate that type of consistency and clarity and how do you establish clear rules of the game, good regulatory frameworks, that gives private sector the confidence to come into these markets?"" He said Indonesia has the size, dynamism of economy and a lot of favourable elements for attracting private sector investment. ""Green growth as a concept is beginning to take off in different countries,"" said Dr. Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) and a 24-time COP attendee. ""Green growth is more of a political process than a technical process. There are vested interests and issues that have to be worked out at the national level,"" he said. ""The good news is it [green growth] has started to happen.""

Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland: ""The message from Katowice is that governments are committed to making the Paris Agreement work. Between the usual conflicts and new geopolitical strains, these talks could have foundered over any number of issues. The rulebook didn't come easily, and it's not perfect, but it gets the Paris Agreement off the ground. ""Many hoped for stronger signals from countries about ramping up their ambition in 2020. Clearly, building the necessary political will remains our core challenge. But a functioning agreement will do more to raise ambition over the long haul than any momentary political signals. And Katowice was our best shot at getting the rules right. ""Most important, the new transparency rules will make it easier to hold all countries accountable for their promises. This takes us well beyond the bifurcated system we've had until now. If the transparency system shows that everyone is in fact making a sincere effort to do their part, we'll all be in a better position to do more. ""Unfortunately, parties couldn't agree on detailed rules for using market-based trading to meet country targets - which is critical for mobilizing private sector investment. It's urgent that this last remaining piece of the rulebook be completed next year. ""It was clear from the start that Paris alone couldn't possibly get the job done. The real work is at home, where we have to do a much better job demonstrating not just the risks, but also the opportunities presented by climate change. We need an inclusive approach - one that taps all available technologies and deals justly with those who stand to lose the most. The challenges and choices vary from country to country. But the only lasting solutions will be those built on common ground."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6564357 MSTRUCK \"

At the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice's closing plenary on Saturday night, four countriesKuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United Statesblocked efforts to ""welcome"" the IPCC report, instead insisting the body should only ""take note"" of it. Without a consensus on how to characterize the report, the full Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will have to resolve the matter later this week. Below is a statement by Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), who has been involved in the international climate negotiations since they began in 1991. ""The efforts of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait to diminish the value and importance of the IPCC Special Report, a comprehensive scientific report they themselves requested three years ago in Paris are deeply irresponsible and must not prevail. The IPCC's scientific reports are the gold standard of climate science analysis. ""The United States' opposition to acknowledging the urgency of the IPCC's findings and welcoming its recommendations is especially troubling. The U.S. is a global scientific superpower, and scientists in U.S. federal agencies, universities, corporations and nonprofit institutions have been deeply involved in the work of the IPCC since its founding. ""The problem comes right from the top, as President Trump doesn't even accept the findings of his own federal agencies' scientists in the recent National Climate Assessment. Mr. Trump has ignored near-unanimous scientific consensus, instead doubling down on his belief that all scientists have a political agenda and that human-induced climate change is uncertain, at best, or even a conspiratorial hoax. ""While the U.S. and the other three blocker countries may be content to simply 'note' the report's existence, communities on the frontlines of climate change around the world are more than noticing, they're suffering the devastating consequences of climate change daily, including flooding, wildfires, drought and heat waves. ""The IPCC Special Report is a wake-up call from the world's scientists that must be heeded. It is a declaration of planetary emergency that all governments must respond to with profound and rapid action, not merely 'take note' of. ""Ministers arriving in Katowice must emphatically reject the efforts of the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait to downplay the report's findings, and acknowledge the need to dramatically scale up mitigation and adaptation activities, as well as to provide increased support for developing country action, including strategies to cope with the ever-mounting impacts of climate change. It's also vital that the Polish COP Presidency work with ministers to craft a planetary emergency package for adoption at the closing plenary at the end of the week. The world is demandingand expectingnothing less."" \"

The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \- better known as COP24 \- was held Dec. 3-17 in Katowice, Poland, as the Cornell students and educators spoke at press conferences, organized side events, spoke to climate change professionals from hundreds of countries and absorbed volumes of scientific detail. COP24 students From right, Cornell students Emma Birch, Maeve Anderson and Charlotte Levy take notes at a COP24 event. Caroline Dodd \' 19 met Fekitamoeloa Katoa \' Utoikamanu from Tonga, the United Nations\' High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. Dodd and other Cornell students Skye Hart \' 18, MRP \' 19, Zeyu Hu \' 19, Carly Shonbrun-Siege \' 18 and Venus Dulani \' 19, worked remotely with \' Utoikamanu and other Tongan officials during the fall semester in Cornell\' s Global Climate Science and Policy class taught by Allison Chatrchyan, director of the Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions and a COP24 Cornell trip organizer, and Natalie Mahowald, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences. Tonga is a Pacific island nation facing sea-level rise; the students helped officials develop a report on loss and damages for the island\' s negotiations for international climate action.  Working with the Tonga delegates, we applied our research and knowledge to a critical problem, Dodd said. Emma Birch \' 20, Tyler Brewer \' 19, Keelin Kelly \' 20, Emily Boedo \' 19 and Laura Kee\' 19 similarly helped the government of Armenia prepare for the COP by developing a report on climate impacts to agriculture through the Koronivia work program, a landmark agreement from COP23 in 2017 to review the role of agriculture and food security under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Youth inclusion was a COP24 theme, Dodd said. An entire day was devoted to climate education, which included performances and speeches from youth representatives.  The message from youth was a call to break the barrier of inclusion as merely tokens in negotiations and decision-making, she said,  and instead aim to achieve direct youth representation, because the future is at stake. Emma Hoarty \' 19 attended a panel on harnessing carbon markets, which is a means of climate-change mitigation under the 2015 Paris Agreement. When the floor opened for questions. Hoarty raised her hand.  I introduced myself as a Cornell undergraduate, and I asked the panel if a national carbon market would be possible in the U.S., or if they thought our regional carbon markets would grow to eventually encompass most of the country, she said. To Hoarty\' s surprise, panelist Steve Rose, Ph.D. \' 00, a senior research economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, identified himself as a Cornellian, too. The two spoke after the panel.  He was impressed that Cornell sent students to COP24 , Hoarty said.  This experience reminded me where a Cornell degree can take you, and just how many Cornellians there are all around the world. Talanoa Dialogues Provided From left, Skye Hart, Khyati Rathore, Allison Chatrchyan, Laura Kee, Caroline Dodd, Julie Kapuvari, Martha Torres and Emma Hoarty, front, get into a tropical spirit by celebrating Talanoa Dialogues at COP24 . Zeyu Hu \' 19 spoke at a press conference organized by the TERRE Policy Center, an Indian think tank that launched a new toolkit for environmentally friendly universities. He explained Cornell's Climate Action Plan, which employs innovative technology to decrease campus carbon emissions and reduce electricity consumption.  It is important to note, Hu told to the delegates,  that this climate neutrality movement [on Cornell\' s campus] was primarily started and driven by students who lobbied the university\' s administration [decades ago] for Cornell to become a carbon-neutral campus. Four Cornell students including Maeve Anderson \' 19 and Martha Torres \' 19 provided strong support to help the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture in Rome to organize a workshop at COP24 . The students and faculty lodged in Krakow, about an hour by bus from the Katowice venue. Rhea Lopes, MRP \' 19, said she spent the bus trips engaging with delegates from Ghana, Australia, Denmark and Great Britain, among others.  This was a fantastic educational opportunity to meet and interact with several other delegates and negotiators from different countries, she said. Cornell students also organized a Talanoa Dialogue with the Ithaca community and submitted the report to the UN for consideration at COP24 . Originating from the government of Fiji, the Talanoa process is meant to share stories of current impacts of climate change all over the world, build empathy and push world leaders to take stronger action on climate change. Provided Zeyu Hu, right, with Xie Zhenghua, China\' s chief climate negotiator at COP24 . Chatrchyan, along with Hu and Lopes, met with Ben Simonds, of 2017\' s COP23 Presidency Secretariat. They discussed the impacts of the Talanoa Dialogue, which Simonds suggested that Cornell continue to help foster and analyze its effectiveness. Later, Chatrchyan and Lopes were joined by Gerald Torres, the Jane M.G. Foster Professor of Law, and Carly Shonbrun-Siege \' 18 in a panel discussion,  Conducting Talanoa Dialogues at the Local Level. Following the panel, several delegates requested advice from the Cornell delegation on how to shape these dialogues for their own communities and organizations. Simonds said that conducting a Talanoa Dialogue in a small community like Ithaca was novel, and it could be emulated by other institutions. With a pair of nongovernmental organizations \- the International Food Policy Research Institute, and the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security program \- Chatrchyan served as a panelist and helped to organize a side event,  Science and Policy Coming Together to Successfully Implement Countries\' Nationally Determined Contributions. She also spoke in two high-level events for the  We Are Still In initiative with executives from Coca-Cola, Mars Inc. and other leading groups. Commenting on the volume of service completed by Cornell students at this conference, Chatrchyan said:  There was no other university doing this level of work at this year\' s climate change negotiations. Other COP24 events featuring Cornellians included: Johannes Lehmann, professor of soil and crop sciences, spoke on land-grant universities and climate-smart agriculture research, at the GACSA workshop, attended by the World Bank, FAO and other leading NGOs. Gerald Torres on  Science and Policy Coming Together, at a press conference Charlotte Levy, Ph.D. \' 19 spoke on  What to Factor In: Real Climate Impacts Aren\' t Just About Carbon at a press conference Rebecca Brenner, lecturer in the Cornell Institute on Public Affairs, and Danielle Eiseman, postdoctoral fellow in earth and atmospheric sciences, talked on  Building Community Resiliency and Climate Action Through Trained Volunteers. The COP24 Delegation was organized with leadership from the Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions and the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, which provided faculty and event support.

What each country does now will determine w....","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The Christian Science Monitor","High hopes preceded a two-week gathering of some 14,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries that concluded Dec. 15 in Katowice, Poland. The conference, known as COP24 , was expected to reignite worldwide efforts to curb climate change. Whether to applaud the meeting's modest achievements or condemn the lack of major action on this urgent issue lay in the eye of the beholder. The conference chair, Poland's Michal Kurtyka, was so pleased at the conclusion he leapt off the podium to congratulate delegates. Yet earlier speaker Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who has raised international awareness of the dangers of climate change, scolded the gathering, saying, ""You're not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to your children."" Reaching any agreement, especially one that might call for national sacrifices, from such a large and diverse body was always going to be a daunting task. But in fact some essential, if somewhat wonky, progress was made that keeps the 2015 Paris global climate pact alive and keeps open the possibility of more progress. Most significant was an agreement on how countries will measure and monitor carbon emissions, essential to understanding exactly what each nation's emission levels are - and whether they are growing or shrinking.\~ Canada may prove to be the next testing ground. A carbon tax going into effect there soon will raise the prices of oil, gasoline, and natural gas. But the money collected will be returned to households; in most cases, families will receive a larger ""rebate"" than the cost they incur in higher energy prices.\~ In the United States, a so-called Green New Deal is gaining momentum. It would speed the transition from fossil fuels in the next 10 years, converting 100 percent of the nation's electricity supply to renewable sources. It would also update the nation's energy grid, increase energy efficiency of buildings, invest in research into more green technologies, and provide job training for workers in a new green economy. When described in these terms, without attachment to any politician or political party, 81 percent of American voters either ""strongly"" (40 percent) or ""somewhat"" (40 percent) approve of such a plan, according to a new survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. The plan was seen most favorably by Democrats (92 percent) and independents (88 percent). But nearly two-thirds of Republicans (64 percent) liked it, too. That may be in part because 82 percent of those surveyed had heard nothing previously about a Green New Deal, though the idea already has the support of some 40 members of Congress. The new Congress, with its Republican Senate and Democratic House, now has the opportunity to resist turning the Green New Deal into a battlefield for partisan warfare. It could move forward on a plan that already has clear voter support and that could make a significant contribution to stemming the ill effects of global warming. \"

Climate and Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen says deforestation is a multi-million business for criminals that cut down invaluable tropical forests, adding ""their activities have detrimental consequences for sustainable development in rainforest nations and the global climate."" He says ""halting and reversing land degradation and tropical deforestation could provide up to 30 percent of the climate change solution."" Elvestuen told the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum that the partnership includes Interpol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and a U.N.-supported center combatting illegal deforestation. The three institutions will work together to share expertise, networks and efforts to jointly support countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia. The Oslo forum focuses on the role forests play in achieving the Paris accord goals to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""Environmental crime has surged in recent years, generating billions in illicit profits for criminals, who are also involved in corruption, money laundering and other forms of trafficking,"" Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock said. ""Protecting the environment's precious resources is our collective responsibility toward future generations."" The conference said organized criminals make up to $152 billion a year on illegally cutting down tropical forests.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA205","CALL FOR A WIN-WIN FRAMEWORK AT COP24","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","An African delegation is in the Polish city of Katowice to join 30,000 delegates and thousands others from almost 200 countries attending the 4th edition of what has come to be known as annual climate change negotiation conferences organised under the auspices of the United Nations. This year's conference comes 24 years after the establishment of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, and it is the fourth since countries inked a deal in 2015 in France where after years of disagreements, adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change. The two-week conference takes place at the backdrop of the alarm sounded by scientists working under the auspices of U.N.-mandated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose special report released in October warned of dire consequences if the global community fails to put in place drastic measures to arrest the accumulation of climate-polluting emissions which cause global warming. In its ""state of the climate"" report released few days ago, the World Metrological Organisation (WMO) indicates that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years the global average temperature, and if the trend continues, the temperatures may rise by 3 to 5 degrees\'c2\~Celsius by 2100. This spells doom for communities at the frontline of climate change impacts, but which may not be aware that the shifting seasons which are making it impossible for them to plant crops as they used to, the erratic rainfall which appears late and ends even before they plant, and are characterised by floods that wreck havoc in villages and cities, recurrent droughts which wipes their livestock and crops, are all manifestation of the changing climate which they should learn to live with in the foreseeable future. The negotiations taking place in Katowice are aimed at discussing the best way possible to defeat challenges posed by climate change. Over years, discussions have centred on the efforts to reduce the green house gases believed to accelerate global warming, and how to live with the damage already caused while helping those who are unable to absorb the shocks emanating from climate change impacts. At stake is the so-called ""Paris Rulebook"", a framework of the Paris Agreement implementation which has already resulted into fissures between delegations from developed countries and poor countries. Developing countries, especially those from Africa, want the elements of the Paris rulebook to be as unambiguous as possible to avoid past deliberate oversights that have rendered impotent previous Pacts aimed at addressing climate change. On their part, industrialised countries are fighting to ensure the framework helps them escape their historical responsibility, which they successfully achieved under the Paris Agreement that seemingly has watered down the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Whether Katowice will deliver a balanced rulebook or an eschewed framework favouring the powerful countries due to their manipulative, intimidating and/or carrot-dangling strategies will be judged in the two weeks. Throughout 2018, the Fiji Presidency has facilitated over a series of trust-building conversations meant to agree on contentious issues, including emission reduction levels by countries, support for poor countries and sources of money for such efforts. The Fiji-facilitated interactions, known as Talanoa Dialogue, have been characterised by mistrust and normal rituals witnessed in all negotiations, and sceptics see no credible success in breaking the persistent North-South divide. Though Fiji has tried its level best to apply the spirit of ""Talanoa"", which means, trust-building, the good intentions of the Pacific Island State have not helped to move the process forward. Indeed, the president will be handing over the baton to his Polish counterpart with his only achievement being process-based "" where are we...where do we want to...how do we want to go there"" ritual, which avoided to tackle the hard questions threatening to endanger the gains so far made in international climate governance system. For African countries, any framework for the implementation of Paris Agreement that does not define the source of money and technology is hopelessly barren. Rich countries have turned the negotiations into market places to expand markets for their goods and services. In their effort to turn climate change into business opportunities, the industrialised countries and those in transition such as China, India and Brazil have encouraged their major transnational corporations to train their eyes on the emerging opportunities in the ""climate sector"", where sectors such as ""climate-smart agriculture"", ""forest as Carbon sinks, ""clean coal"", ""climate finance, ""low-carbon"", ""climate resilient growth"", are gradually overtaking normal development discourse. There is nothing wrong in turning the challenge of climate change into opportunities as the industrialised countries have vouched in the ensuing transformation where even international development assistance is conditioned. What is curious though is the fact that these conditionalities may disadvantage people already suffering the impacts of climate change. In addition, many donors are only interested in projects that are mitigation in nature, such as energy and major infrastructure projects which assure them on bigger profit margins. Adaptation, which does not have return for investment, is not attractive to many donor partners nor private sector investors. A win-win framework in Katowice which considers the interest of industrialised countries and their businesses, as well as developing countries and their vulnerable communities to enable them transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient development trajectories without jeopardising the livelihoods of the present and future generations is thus the most suitable outcome. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA206","University Communications","July 16, 2018 Monday","US Official News","Minot, ND: Minot University North Dakota has issued the following news release: Minot State University staff member Kowan O\' Keefe has already put together quite a list of experiences since he started at MSU as a freshman just eight years ago. Originally from Creston, British Columbia, O\' Keefe began his time at Minot State mainly due to a chance to play collegiate golf.  I came here in 2010 to play on the college golf team and started as a biology major, but ended up graduating with majors in chemistry and math, he said. O\' Keefe was very successful on the golf team at Minot State. He was two-time academic All-American, the Player of the Year in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference, and won the NSIC\' s Dr. William Britain Award \- the highest academic honor in the conference. He describes his time on the team as  probably the best experience of the entire thing. However, he didn\' t just spend time on the golf course while attending college. O\' Keefe had the opportunity to present research he was working on in the lab to state, regional, and national conferences. One notable event he presented at was Posters on the Hill in Washington, D.C. Posters on the Hill gives students the opportunity to showcase their research to congressional members, meet with their representatives, and learn about advocacy for undergraduate research. Only 60 applicants are able to present while hundreds apply.  I\' m definitely a big fan of politics and that was really a cool opportunity to see how science plays a role in public policy and to communicate what type of research we\' re doing with policy makers who are quite intelligent, but they don\' t necessarily have a very strong background in chemistry or in math, O\' Keefe said about the experience. Presenting research eventually took him beyond the United States. During his senior year of college, O\' Keefe represented the American Chemical Society at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru in 2014.  That was a really major conference because it was the last one right before the one in Paris where they ultimately signed the Paris agreement, he said.  So a lot of the details for that were negotiated at the conference I was at in Peru. O\' Keefe attended a second United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2016 after having graduated with his masters at the University of Toronto. The second conference was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. After his time in Morocco, O\' Keefe found himself back in Minot visiting his brother Karson O\' Keefe. At that time, the opportunity to work with students at Minot State in the POWER Center \- Providing Opportunities With Enhanced Resources \- became available. O\' Keefe describes the POWER Center as,  an additional resource for students who are either first generation students, fall into a certain taxable income guideline, or have any type of documented disability. We provide additional tutoring, additional academic advising, priority course registration, assistance with financial aid applications. We serve almost 300 students across campus. In addition to working in the POWER Center assisting students, O\' Keefe was elected president of the Minot State Staff Senate May of 2018. MSU Staff Senate essentially gives staff a channel to make suggestions or recommendations.  We have a staff satisfaction survey that goes out every year, and then based on the results of that, if there\' s an idea that a number of the staff thinks we can change, we\' ll try and find a way to accommodate or make those changes to make the experience better in whatever way that we can, he said. When O\' Keefe is not working on making student and staff experiences better, he continues to pursue his passion for combating climate change. He is currently working on two chapters in a collaborative book titled  The Paris Agreement and the Path Forward.  I\' ve got the first chapter in that book which is basically explaining why the Paris Agreement is a good deal and why the U.S. should be a part of it, he said. ABOUT MINOT STATE UNIVERSITY Minot State University is a public university dedicated to excellence in education, scholarship, and community engagement achieved through rigorous academic experiences, active learning environments, commitment to public service, and a vibrant campus life.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA207","COP24 BRINGS GREATEST TEST OF COUNTRIES' COMMITMENT TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT YET","December 1, 2018 Saturday","States News Service","The following information was released by World Wildlife Fund (WWF): KATOWICE, POLAND On the heels of several international reports outlining the mounting impacts and costs of climate change, negotiators at this weeks UN climate talks need to finalize the rules governing how the Paris Agreement will operate going forward and ensure countries deliver a strong commitment to increase their own climate targets before 2020. The troubling gap between current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and what is needed to prevent catastrophic climate change is laid bare in three recent reports: the 2018 Emissions Gap Report, the United States 4th National Climate Assessment, and the landmark special report on 1.5C of global warming. In many ways things are getting worse and worse, and better and better, faster and faster, said Lou Leonard, World Wildlife Funds senior vice president for climate change and energy. The worlds best scientists, and nature itself, are sounding the alarm. Changes are happening sooner and faster than we expected. At the same time, the private sector and regional governments are waking up to their responsibility to lead on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. They are creating momentum and unveiling a new formula for success in ramping up global ambition. As the recent Emissions Gap report states, countries must sharply raise the ambition of their national climate targets by 2020 or the 1.5C goal under the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach. Increasing ambition at this scale is only possible if the private sector, regional and national governments work collaboratively to develop a new set of national climate targets before 2020, said Leonard. Countries left ambition on the table when they set their first climate pledges in 2015. Current national climate targets largely ignored or understated the contributions of those driving regional economies, like companies and local governments, said Leonard. That can change for the revised targets because these players are now fully bought into the process. Moreover, a growing wave of businesses and cities have made new, science-based commitments since 2015, including at the Global Climate Action Summit in September of this year. WWF is bringing leaders from new climate coalitions in Japan, Mexico, Argentina and the United States to the talks to bridge new alliances, push for stronger pre-2020 action, and to meet with national governments to advocate for strong rules to operationalize the Paris agreement. Private sector representatives in the We Are Still In coalition cite a strong transparency regime, clear and consistent approaches for setting national climate targets, and clarity around market mechanisms as key elements up for debate at these talks which are critical to their business operations. US efforts to reduce emissions will be on display in the US Climate Action Center -- located in Pavilion E and livestreamed -- December 7-10. The Center will host mayors, businesses, Congressional staff, and other climate leaders from the We Are Still In coalition and convene discussion on topics including the implications of the US midterm elections, the benefits a strong Paris regime for the private sector, and the role of natural climate solutions. WWF believes a clear set of outcomes are needed in Poland to ensure the continued momentum for climate action, called the Katowice Package. These include: Urgently scaled up climate action both before and after 2020 accompanied by financial and other support for developing countries; Finalize and adopt a comprehensive set of rules (Paris Rulebook) to guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement. These must enhance the transparency of all countries actions to address climate change, lead to greater accountability and ambition of countries individual climate plans, and clarify the roles of market mechanisms; A renewed recognition of the gap between current action and the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, and a recognition of actions that can close the gap, including better integration of nature-based climate solutions; and finally, A commitment from Parties to update and resubmit improved national climate plans (or nationally determined contributions or NDCs) by 2020. Positive momentum heading into the talks was boosted by Germanys pledge of 1.5 billion towards replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, which should help reassure especially the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries that international financial support is available for their climate actions. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA208","Bringing Science to Global Climate Talks","January 24, 2019 Thursday","US Official News","La Jolla, CA: University of California, San Diego has issued the following news release: A saucer-shaped arena set in the heart of Poland\' s coal country seems like an unlikely place to host a global climate change conference. And yet, for two weeks in December, more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 nations converged in the Silesian capital of Katowice, Poland, to attend the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ). The conference, held from Dec. 3-14, 2018, was the latest in a series of meetings led by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to tackle the global issue of climate change. More than twenty students and researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego attended the climate talks, where they gained a nuanced understanding of the intricacies and challenges of climate policy. The team was part of UC Revelle, the observer organization representing the University of California.  It was so interesting to see how this kind of global policy is created, said Kat Montgomery, a Master of Advanced Studies student in the Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. A first-time attendee of the UN talks, Montgomery described her experience in Poland as  illuminating and said she gained a better understanding of the role of non-governmental and research organizations in the UNFCCC process.  I think the UC\' s biggest accomplishment at COP24 was being able to give so many current and future scientists a chance to attend a conference like this, where they could learn about and potentially influence global policy, said Montgomery. UC San Diego delegates at COP24 Climate Conference in Poland University of California delegates served as panelists for a discussion at the UN's Sustainable Development Goals Pavilion on the topic of investing in education for the future of sustainable energy. Scripps alumna Megan Bettilyon with Global Good (far left) moderated the discussion with participants (pictured left to right) including Scripps Ph.D. students Osinachi Ajoku and Tashiana Osborne, Yale student Holden Leslie-Bole, and Scripps postdoctoral scholar and alumnus Yassir Eddebbar. In Katowice, she and other UC delegates observed some of the complex negotiations in which nations hammered out the details of a common rulebook to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. The rulebook defines how nations will enact their climate pledges to keep global temperatures well below an increase of 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. It also provides a universal framework for measuring and reporting emissions with greater transparency and supports climate financing to poorer nations, among other things.  The negotiations were difficult, as many countries were trying to pull in different directions. However, the world came to a midpoint to implement the Paris Agreement, said Alfredo Giron, a Scripps Ph.D. student whose research focuses on fishery sustainability in the Gulf of California.  Being part of the Scripps delegation allowed me to follow up this process very closely and get involved with delegates from different countries and other observer organizations to dig into the details. In the UFO-shaped Spodek arena, the UC delegates hosted an exhibit that highlighted the ocean\' s reach on global climate. The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions. COP24 Climate Conference speakers in Poland Scripps Oceanography scientists discuss the crucial need for ocean observations in the deep sea during a COP24 press conference. Pictured left to right: Distinguished Professor Lisa Levin, Ph.D. student Garfield Kwan, and Samantha Murray, Executive Director of the MAS program in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation. One meaningful interaction occurred when Tibetan delegate Zamlha Tempa Gyaltsen stopped by the UC exhibit to drop off a hand-signed letter from His Holiness the Dalai Lama a well-known champion for climate science with deep connections to UC San Diego. In the letter, His Holiness thanked the COP24 delegates for striving to create a  better environment for the world so that future generations will be able to live a healthy, happy life. He also urged humanity to recognize that climate change affects everyone on Earth and that we must take serious action now. UC delegates also led six press conferences and participated in other side-events to communicate the latest scientific research on topics ranging from ocean deoxygenation to geoengineering to the value of deep ocean observation networks, and more.  The conference is an enlightening experience that comes with a sense of worldly connectedness and inspires nations to collectively work toward changes for the good of humankind, said Scripps Ph.D. student Tashiana Osborne, a two-time attendee of the UN climate talks. Osborne said she\' s still hopeful that nations can work together to address climate change but was concerned to witness  how slow-moving and challenging it can be for responsible political actions to be taken. At COP24 , she and fellow Scripps Ph.D. students Kara Voss and Meredith Fish held a press conference to discuss the science behind atmospheric rivers and extreme weather patterns linked to climate change.  It is very important for the world to see students, researchers, and top STEM programs like Scripps invested in global climate change issues, said Osborne.  It's imperative to demonstrate that there are those of us in the United States who remain dedicated to learning about and helping address parts of the climate crisis. UC delegates at COP24 Climate Conference in Poland The COP24 entrance sign provided a perfect place for Scripps Oceanography delegates to strike a pose. Pictured left to right: PhD student Matt Costa, postdoctoral scholar Kasia Kenitz, alumna Megan Bettilyon, Ph.D. student Osinachi Ajoku, staff member Brittany Hook, and postdoctoral scholar Yassir Eddebbar. COP24 marked the third UN-led climate talk attended by Osinachi Ajoku, a Scripps Ph.D. student studying climate science. His research focuses on how aerosol particles produced from biomass burning affect climate patterns in Africa. Ajoku said that attending three conference sessions has given him a holistic outlook on how countries address climate change by factors such as culture, location, and economic standing.  It has also allowed me a unique perspective of how countries in Africa are progressing in climate change relative to the rest of the world since that region is the focus of my research, said Ajoku, a Los Angeles native with roots in Nigeria which he says makes his African research feel more personal. While at COP24 , Ajoku served as a panelist for a discussion at the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Pavilion on the topic of investing in education for the future of sustainable energy. The panel was moderated by Scripps alumna Megan Bettilyon (MAS \' 10) of philanthropic investment fund Global Good and also included Scripps postdoctoral scholar Yassir Eddebbar, Osborne, and Yale student Holden Leslie-Bole as panelists. Each panelist underscored the importance of educating the youth about climate change and discussed the increasingly vital role of science communication to inform and inspire communities to tackle the massive problem of climate change on a local level. Delegates at COP24 Climate Conference in Poland UC delegates learn how global climate policy is shaped by attending daily meetings and negotiations. Left to right: Scripps postdoctoral scholar Bonnie Ludka and Ph.D. student Margot White, UC Merced student Julia Burmistrova, Scripps Ph.D. student Alfedo Giron and faculty member Samantha Murray.  When something's outside of your control, you have to focus on what you can control, said Ajoku, responding to an audience member\' s question about how to garner support in his home country of Mozambique.  I'm a big believer in ground works, so I think the best thing to do is work on a local level, to bring the community together and teach them about climate change. I think this would actually go a long way. The University of California has been sending delegations to COP for the past 17 years, and the continued effort has already made noticeable waves. Giron noted that this year, many members of the UC delegation had talks with other delegates who have read a scientific paper on ocean-related Nationally Determined Contributions that was written by Scripps\' Natalya Gallo and Lisa Levin, and GPS\' David Victor all former participants in the climate conference and members of the UC delegation.  Every year, Scripps gains more presence among delegations and brings the spotlight to the oceans, said Giron.  COP24 was an opportunity for me to dig deeper into learning how negotiations work, get to know more delegates, and confirm that I want to be part of such processes from a scientific perspective in the near future. Montgomery echoed Giron\' s sentiments on the importance of having UC delegates involved in the annual conference.  I got to know people on this trip whose research has some amazing real-world applications, she said.  The more chances they have to share it with policymakers, the better off we'll all be.

Heartland's event, featuring two scientists and two experts on climate and energy policy in the United States and Europe, will be held at the Vienna House East Katowice from 2 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time. This event will also feature the public debut of a new 1,000-page report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) titled Climate Change Reconsidered: Fossil Fuels. It is the latest in what is now a five-volume, 4,000-plus page series stretching back to 2009 critiquing the work of the UN's IPCC. The Heartland Institute is attending COP-24 in Katowice with NGO-Observer credentials during the first week, reporting from the conference site on Monday, Tuesday morning (before Heartland's science and policy event), and Wednesday. The following statement from James Taylor, senior fellow for environment and energy policy at The Heartland Institute, may be used for attribution. ""Each year the verdict becomes stronger and clearer that the scientific evidence debunks global warming alarmism. While the United Nations' Conference of the Parties frantically searches for reasons to justify its continued existence, The Heartland Institute is proud to present the science that debunks U.N. alarmism. ""We will also be presenting examples of real-world evidence contradicting important U.N. climate claims. We will be delivering the truth that the only thing 'settled' about the global warming debate is that U.N. climate reports have little credibility. Skeptics present a far better scientific case."" The December 4 event at the Vienna House Katowice - just one kilometer away from the COP-24 site - will include the first public presentation of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels. That will be followed by 30-minute presentations by Dr. Idso, Dr. Ludecke, Mr. Avery, and Mr. Taylor, as well as a group discussion about the latest climate data and the goings-on at COP-24 . This event will be live-streamed starting at 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET). In October, NIPCC posted a draft version of the Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels, which can be reviewed here. The Heartland Institute serves as the publisher of the NIPCC volumes.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA211","OPENING REMARKS BY CLIMATE ACTION AND ENERGY COMMISSIONER MIGUEL ARIAS CAETE AT THE SECOND MINISTERIAL ON CLIMATE ACTION (MOCA) BY THE EU, CHINA AND CANADA","June 20, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Union: Excellencies, colleagues, let me start by welcoming you all to Brussels and thanking Minister McKenna and Special Representative Xie for co-organising this meeting today. And sincere thanks to all of you, ministers and high-level representatives, for having accepted our invitation. The EU, Canada and China have joined forces to encourage global leadership and ambition in the fight against climate change by building momentum for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Following the successful first MOCA in Montreal last year, we have convened this opportunity for ministerial guidance on the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme and on the other key political events at COP 24 . The MOCA brings together Ministers and high-level representatives from the world's largest economies and other countries from the different regional groups. In this more intimate and informal setting we hope to support but not to replace or prejudge-- the formal negotiations. As we have just heard in Berlin, achieving results at COP 24 will require us all to pick up the pace of negotiations, and to be well-prepared to send strong messages of political leadership. The agenda we have prepared reflects a subset of the key challenges that still need to be resolved. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue hosted by Germany and Poland earlier this week provided for excellent high level exchanges. We see the next two days as an opportunity for deeper and more detailed peer-to-peer conversations on the political differences that we will need to resolve if we are to ensure a successful conclusion to COP 24 . COP 24 and its main deliverables, and tomorrow we will address key matters of the Paris Agreement Work Programme as it relates to action and as it relates to support. With six months between now and the closing plenary in Katowice, we must seize the opportunity of this MOCA to discuss -- openly and sincerely -- our individual asks and limitations. At COP24 COP 24 should be robust enough to deliver confidence that we are on track to implementing Paris, flexible enough to reflect relevant differences in Parties' capacities, and dynamic enough to ensure that all Parties are improving their performance over time. In addition, through the Talanoa Dialogue, the High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, and the stocktake on pre-2020 action, Parties should be prepared to share our achievements and the lessons we have learned so far, and on how we can advance action and raise ambition from now into the future. These processes will set the scene for the next round of NDCs and Long term strategies. I look forward, in the plenary discussion to come, to sharing with you the details of how the EU is preparing for Katowice. This will include an update on the agreement of EU climate policies necessary for us to achieve our NDC, preparations for a new long term strategy to put us on track towards the Paris goals, and an EU Talanoa Dialogue, launched last week with the involvement of 600 stakeholders from across the EU and around the world. Last Thursday, EU negotiators agreed to increase the 2030 renewable energy target to 32% up from the original 27% target on the basis of which our at least 40% emissions reduction target in our NDC was modelled. And yesterday evening, EU negotiators agreed on a new 32,5% energy efficiency target by 2030 up from the 30% original target. EU negotiators also agreed the governance rules to meet our climate and energy targets. Both new targets would de facto mean that the European Union would be in a position to raise the level of ambition of the NDC and increase its emissions reduction target from the current 40% to slightly over 45% by 2030. Each of these recent developments in the EU shows that in addition to raising headline targets, ambition can emerge from the bottom-up: if we strengthen our policies, renewables and energy efficiency in this case, we should be able to achieve deeper cuts in our overall emissions. One thing is clear: our collective Paris goal to pursue efforts to limit global average temperature rise to 2C and to limit this rise to well below 1.5C, requires each of us to look for deeper cuts than are reflected in our current Paris targets. You can count on the EU to defend and implement the Paris Goals. But we clearly cannot do it alone: the EU accounts for less than 10% of global emissions today. To succeed, we need all countries, regions and actors around the world on board. The MOCA is one way to contribute to getting everyone on board, so we look forward to our discussions. I now turn to my good friends and colleagues Minister McKenna and Special Representative Xie to share their expectations for this MOCA. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA213","UNRISD at Science-Policy Dialogue on Just Transitions to a Low-Carbon World at UN Climate Conference","December 6, 2018 Thursday 11:47 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","United Nations Research Institute for social Development issued the following news release: ""The transition must accelerate. (...) Only a transition that challenges systems of exclusion and discrimination, and seeks to improve prosperity and well-being for all, can be considered a truly Just Transition."" This was one of the main messages presented by UNRISD on behalf of the Just Transition Research Collaborative to participants at the UN Climate Conference, COP24 , currently under way in Katowice, Poland. This message is contained in Mapping Just Transition(s) to a Low-Carbon World, the state-of-the-art report on ways to achieve a socially equitable transition away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon development. The report was written by the Just Transition Research Collaborative, which brings together experts from academia and civil society to collectively map and analyse the different understandings and narratives of ""Just Transition"" underpinning the concept's growing popularity and uptake. Challenging the narrow interpretation of Just Transition that seeks to protect a relatively small number of affected workers, the report calls for profound change and an intersectional approach to climate justice. The Collaborative is run jointly by UNRISD and the University of London Institute in Paris, and supported by the Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung. The UNRISD lead of the Just Transition Research Collaborative, Dunja Krause, travelled (by train and bus) to Poland to launch the report at three different events during COP24 , in order to maximize potential uptake. Launching the report at COP24 --in the presence of governments, United Nations organizations, civil society and the private sector--is an important way of contributing to the science-policy dialogue on Just Transition and supporting policy makers to make better decisions on how to combine the environmental goal of shifting to low-carbon development with social considerations of equity and justice. The research shows that although challenging and complex, Just Transitions are possible through direct engagement with workers, and through government investment in infrastructure and social welfare programmes, among many other initiatives discussed. The findings struck a chord with many present at COP24 , and resonate with the growing recognition of the need not only to respond to climate change but to respond equitably. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told world leaders at the conference, ""Climate action is not just the right thing to do--it makes social and economic sense.""

The MoCA brings together Ministers and high-level representatives from the world's largest economies and other countries from the different regional groups. 'In this more intimate and informal setting we hope to support - but not to replace or prejudge- the formal negotiations.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA217","Heartland Science Panel Brings Realism to UN Climate Conference","December 27, 2018 Thursday 7:50 AM EST","The Heartlander","Dec 27, 2018( The Heartlander: HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news Delivered by Newstex) ;; The Heartland Institute hosted an event in Katowice, Poland to advance the latest research on climate science and the high costs of government efforts to fight purported anthropogenic climate change. Heartland's event was held on December 4, 2018 during the two-week 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which ran from December 2 through December 14. No Science at UN Meeting COP 24 hosted no discussions of climate science. The UN delegates focused on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below the levels countries committed to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, in response to a September 2018 report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) saying carbon dioxide emissions must be net zero by 2050 to avoid global average temperatures rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius. Negotiators also discussed how to provide funding to help developing countries adapt to future climate changes. Heartland Provides Science, Economics The Heartland Institute's three-hour event, which was livestreamed and has been viewed by more than 7,000 people, presented scientific evidence indicating humans are not creating a climate crisis. Panelists also discussed the harm caused in Europe by energy policies and subsidies intended to fight purported climate change. Craig Idso, Ph.D., chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, began the session by unveiling the newest report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels (see story on page 11), of which he is a lead coauthor. The new volume, which is approximately 700 pages long, features contributions of more than 100 scientists and includes more than 2,000 citations of data from peer-reviewed scientific literature. The report says fossil fuels have brought tremendous net benefits to the United States and the world and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. IPCC 'A Political Body' The IPCC is a political body, not a scientific one, and promotes climate alarmism, says Idso. 'Climate alarmism is championed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a political body of the United Nations,' Idso said during his presentation in Poland. 'Given what is compiled in [the NIPCC] reports and the thousands of peer-reviewed articles cited therein, I can tell you with complete confidence there is absolutely no observational evidence that provides any compelling support for the contention there is something unusual, unnatural, or unprecedented about earth's current warmth.' Dennis Avery, who formerly served in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of State and is a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment ...imate News, gave a presentation documenting how warmer climate periods have historically nurtured greater global crop production and benefits for human health and welfare. Climate change has only been a negative factor regarding human health and welfare in periods of cooling, Avery said. The current modest warming, like every warming period since the dawn of human civilization, will almost certainly add to the crop gains and other benefits people have enjoyed during the past century's modest warming, Avery said. Sun, Wind, Money Horst Ludecke, Ph.D., an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Applied Sciences of the Saarland, documented how solar variability has driven temperature and climate change throughout history. Ludecke cited research strongly indicating solar activity remains the primary driver of climate change today as in the past, with human emissions of carbon dioxide playing at best only a minor role in the ongoing natural recovery from the Little Ice Age. Wolfgang Mueller, general secretary of the European Institute for Climate and Energy, discussed the impact Germany's substantial monetary and legislative support for wind power has had on electricity prices. As a result of the German government's energy policies, Germans currently pay more than triple the price of electricity in the United States, Mueller said. James Taylor, a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, wrapped up with a presentation arguing the UN's climate agenda is more about taking money and power away from individuals and sovereign nations than reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 'The UN climate agenda would strip Americans of tens of billions of dollars each year and much of our individual freedom,' Taylor said. Solidarity Joins Climate Fight After the symposium, leaders of the Polish Solidarity labor union's Silesian Region invited representatives of The Heartland Institute and the European Institute for Climate and Energy to meet with union executives in Katowice and present the scientific case for climate realism. The meeting took place at Solidarity's Katowice offices on December 5, 2018. After the scientific presentation, Solidarity invited The Heartland Institute to collaborate with the history-making Polish labor union in developing and signing a joint statement expressing skepticism toward the UN's climate narrative and its energy policy goals. 'We, speaking as one, believe in the restoration of the Scientific Method and the dismissal of ideological dogma at the United Nations. That means a healthy skepticism of data interpretation and policy conclusions and an end to the war on science and scientists by powerful state-backed forces,' the joint statement reads. '[We also] believe that global leaders should focus their efforts on energy affordability and availability that raise living standards around the world. Affordable energy is absolutely necessary to lift people out of poverty and secure a brighter future for the people of the world.'

Attenborough, famous for his decades of documenting the world and its wildlife, was addressing delegates of almost 200 countries attending the COP24 UN climate change summit in Poland, designed to negotiate how to turn the 2015 Paris climate deal into reality. 'Right now we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,' Attenborough said.

'Leaders of the world you must lead,' he continued. 'The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world on which we depend is in your hands.' Attenborough also used the opportunity to plead with the United States to remain committed to fighting climate change, despite Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate deal. 'Please join the rest of the world,' he said. 'The entire rest of the world is united in trying to take action on this. The United States is a very, very powerful voice. Please, please, join us.'

TONY DOKOUPIL: The seventh grader plays hooky in hopes of pushing adults into action against global warming. What did your mom say when you propose the idea of not going to school on Fridays? TONY DOKOUPIL: No double take at all? ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: Well, they did start laugh-crying, but I took that as a good sign. TONY DOKOUPIL: She`s been doing it for more than three months, but it won`t be a one-girl show come tomorrow. ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: All fifty states are going to be striking that day. He supported all the strikers, so. TONY DOKOUPIL: Villasenor is co-founder of Youth Climate Strike U.S., along with twelve-year-old Haven Coleman and sixteen-year-old Isra Hirsi. They`re calling for, among other things, one hundred percent renewable energy by 2030. And the three young women were inspired by a fourth. GRETA THUNBERG (Stockholm, Sweden, August, 2018; Student Activist): We`re not doing anything to fight the climate crisis. TONY DOKOUPIL: Greta Thunberg (sic) started her own Fridays for the Future strike last August outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. GRETA THUNBERG (Katowice, Poland, December 2018): Change is coming whether you like it or not. TONY DOKOUPIL: Since then she`s taken her message directly to the United Nations Climate Change Conference known as COP24 . GRETA THUNBERG: You are not mature enough to tell it like it is, even that burden you leave to us children. ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: I was amazed because she put the world leaders in their place. She really pointed out that they are acting like children. HAVEN COLEMAN (Youth Climate Strike US Co-Founder): I`ll link you into the all e-mails, okay? TONY DOKOUPIL: Haven Coleman is organizing students from her home in Colorado. HAVEN COLEMAN: It doesn`t matter if we get thousands. It doesn`t matter if we get hundreds. We are still influencing, we`re still powerful because a voice is a voice and every voice has power. TONY DOKOUPIL: A lesson you don`t always learn in a book in a fight that certainly won`t be over tomorrow. If you could teach everybody one thing about what you`ve learned about climate change, what would it be? ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: That a lot of world leaders and politicians have to start making decisions based on facts. They need to start listening to scientists, and they need to stop being bought off. TONY DOKOUPIL: And if they don`t? ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: If they don`t, then you can say goodbye to your life and your future. We will continue striking until the necessary actions are taken. We will not be stopping. (End VT) TONY DOKOUPIL: And while you can argue with the tactics, scientists have provided a pretty good sick note for the planet in the form of the latest international report on climate change. Yeah, no more studying history. They`re going to try to make it. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. GAYLE KING: Do we point out that most of those leaders in that package were young girls. TONY DOKOUPIL: In fact, not only here in the U.S. but around the globe most of the leaders in this movement are women. Young women. GAYLE KING: Yeah. I like that. I like her thing about laugh-crying. BIANNA GOLODRYGA: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. GAYLE KING: And-- and on a note that has nothing to do with the story, you know Tony Dokoupil is a good guy.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA220","Renac's Green Banking Programme Rolls Out in MENA Region","December 26, 2018 Wednesday","Wireless News","The Renewables Academy AG (Renac) reported the start of the scholarship application phase for one of the trainings under its 18-month programme ""Green Banking MENA - Capacity Building on Green Energy and Climate Finance"". According to a media release, the programme comprises a total of three training courses, a Train-the-Trainer seminar, an Applying Green Energy Finance Programme and an Online Training. The main objective of the programme is to sustainably improve capacity for renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) financing options in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. The agreement signed in Paris during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) is proof of the key role renewable energy and energy efficiency play in international climate change mitigation efforts. While green markets keep gaining momentum, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia enjoy the necessary natural resources for widespread implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Local professionals with the appropriate know-how will be able to profit from new business opportunities in a growing industry, which additionally presents manifold benefits (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy security and job creation, among many others). Currently, RE and EE projects face substantial blocks to external financing from banks, which is usually characterized by high interest rates. The trainings are intended to tackle these circumstances. Through the ""Green Banking MENA"" programme, professionals from private and public financial institutions involved or interested in financing green energy projects will gain specific knowledge in technologies, financial schemes, risk evaluation, mitigation measures and international climate finance options. Interested professionals from Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia can apply here until 15 January 2019 for the first part of the scholarship programme, the Train-the-Trainer seminar at Renac's Training Centre in Berlin, Germany. ""Green Banking MENA"" is a scholarship programme as part of the project DIAPOL-CE - Policy dialogue and knowledge management on low emissions development strategies in the MENA region. DIAPOL-CE is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) within the German International Climate Initiative (IKI) and implemented by GIZ.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA221","AFRICA REMAINS RESOLUTE HEADING TO COP 24","October 18, 2018 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","In December 2015, nations of the world took a giant step to combat climate change through the landmark Paris Agreement. But African experts who met in Nairobi, Kenya at last week's Seventh Conference on Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA VII) say the rise of far-right wing and nationalist movements in the West are threatening the collapse of the agreement. The landmark Paris Agreement focuses on accelerating and intensifying actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, through greenhouse-gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology transfer among others. And as Parties struggle to complete the implementing measures needed to get the Paris regime up and running, African experts have identified the need to speak with one unified voice, saying a shift in the geopolitical landscape threatens climate negotiations. ""The rise of 'the inward-looking nationalist right-wing movement and climate deniers' in the West is a signal of hardening positions in potential inaction by those largely responsible for the world's climate problems,"" Mithika Mwenda, secretary general of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance, told the gathering. Mwenda said civil society organisations were seeking collaboration with governments on the continent and stood ready to offer support as Africa seeks homegrown solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. The 24th Conference of the Parties\'c2\~( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\'c2\~(UNFCCC) to be held in Katowice, Poland in December, is earmarked as the deadline for the finalisation of the Paris Agreement operational guidelines. Since 2015 when the Paris Agreement was reached, the world has seen a shift in the geopolitical landscape, ushering in a climate-sceptic Donald Trump as president of the United States, and several far-right wing nationalist movements gaining power in Europe. ""Two strong groups have joined forces on this issue - the extractive industry, and right-wing nationalists. The combination has taken the current debate to a much more dramatic level than previously, at the same time as our window of opportunity is disappearing,"" said Martin Hultman, associate professor in Science, Technology and Environmental studies at Chalmers University of Technology and research leader for the comprehensive project titled 'Why don't we take climate change seriously? A study of climate change denial'. For his part, Trump made good on his campaign promise when he wrote to the UNFCCC secretariat, notifying them of his administration's intention to withdraw the United States from the treaty, thereby undermining the universality of the Paris Agreement and impairing states' confidence in climate cooperation. With this scenario in mind, the discussions at the recently-concluded climate conference in Africa were largely dominated by how the continent could harness homegrown solutions and standing united in the face of shifting climate political dynamics. In his opening remarks, which he delivered on behalf of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya's environment and forestry minister, Keriako Tobiko said climate change was a matter of life and death for Africa. ""We have all experienced the devastating and unprecedented impacts of climate change on our peoples' lives and livelihoods as well as our national economies. Africa is the most vulnerable continent despite contributing only about four percent to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but when we go to argue our case we speak in tongues and come back with no deal,"" he said. He said given Africa's shared ecosystems, it was essential to speak in one voice to safeguard the basis of the continent's development and seek transformative solutions. This climate conference was held just days after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius which warned of a catastrophe if immediate action is not taken to halt GHG emissions. And commenting on the IPCC report, Tobiko reiterated the resolutions of the first Africa Environment Partnership Platform held from Sept. 20 to, under the auspices of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the technical body of the African Union, which emphasised the need to turn environmental challenges into economic solutions through innovation and green investments. Tobiko said that Kenya would be hosting the first Sustainable Blue Economy Conference from Nov. 26 to 28 to promote sustainable investments in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. Just like the Africa Environment Partnership Platform - which recognised ""indigenous knowledge and customary governance systems as part of Africa's rich heritage in addressing environmental issues"" - indigenisation was also a trending topic at the CCDA VII. Under the theme: 'Policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa', the conference attracted over 700 participants from member states, climate researchers, academia, civil society organisations and local government leaders, among others. Experts said that local communities, women and the youth should be engaged in Africa's efforts to combat the vagaries of climate change. James Murombedzi, officer-in-charge of the Africa Climate Policy Centre of the U.N. Commission for Africa, said African communities have long practiced many adaptation strategies and viable responses to the changing climate. However, he said, ""there are limits to how well communities can continue to practice adaptive livelihoods in the context of a changing climate"", adding that it was time they were supported by an enabling environment created by government-planned adaptation. ""That is why at CCDA-VII we believe that countries have to start planning for a warmer climate than previously expected so this means we need to review all the different climate actions and proposals to ensure that we can in fact not only survive in a 3 degrees Celsius\'c2\~warmer environment but still be able to meet our sustainable development objectives and our Agenda 2063,"" added Murombedzi. Murombedzi said it was sad that most African governments had continued spending huge sums of money on unplanned adaptations for climate-related disasters. And these, according Yacob Mulugetta, professor of Energy and Development Policy, University London College, ""are the implications of global warming for Africa which is already experiencing massive climate impacts, such as crop production, tourism industries and hydropower generation."" Mulugetta, one of the lead authors of the IPCC special report, however, noted that ""international cooperation is a critical part of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,"" but warned African climate experts to take cognisance of the shifting global geopolitical landscape, which he said is having a significant bearing on climate negotiations. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank (AfDB), pledged continued support to a climate-resilient development transition in Africa through responsive policies, plans and programmes focusing on building transformed economies and healthy ecosystems. James Kinyangi of the AfDB said the Bank's Climate Action Plan for the period 2016 to 2020 was ambitious, as it ""explores modalities for achieving adaptation, the adequacy and effectiveness of climate finance, capacity building and technology transfer - all aimed at building skills so that African economies can realise their full potential for adaptation in high technology sectors."" Under this plan, the bank will nearly triple its annual climate financing to reach USD5 billion a year by 2020. \"

Deputy Environment Minister Jochen Flasbarth told reporters on the sidelines of this year's meeting in Poland that Berlin has signaled to the United Nations it's ""not available for an event on the scale of last year."" He cited the increased costs of organizing the meeting at short notice. Germany hosted the 2017 talks at the U.N. climate office's headquarters in Bonn for Fiji, which has struggled to organize a meeting for tens of thousands of participants. The venue for talks rotates among regions, and next year it's the Latin American and Caribbean Group's turn. Several of those countries are still mulling a bid, including Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Jamaica and Barbados. Meanwhile, Brazil says it has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by almost 1.3 billion tons this year, largely by reducing deforestation and improving land management. Latin America's biggest country announced the cuts yesterday on the climate talks' sidelines. The figures would mean Brazil has met its national commitments to cut greenhouse gases by up to 38 percent before 2020. Some rich countries, including Germany, have indicated they will miss their emissions goals. Brazil's environment minister, Edson Duarte, said the cuts showed ""even developing countries facing economic and social challenges can still deliver on their pre-2020 commitments."" The country's incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, has suggested he will not protect Brazil's vast Amazon rainforest from deforestation after he takes office next month. -- Associated Press \"

The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report.  If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating, wrote Senator Carper.  This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. The Honorable Andrew Wheeler Acting Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20460 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying,  [m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis. [1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world\' s leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts \- some of which are EPA employees \- as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated  I don\' t believe it when asked about the report, adding that  we\' re at the cleanest we\' ve ever been. [2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that  We think that this is the most extreme version and it\' s not based on facts. She also said that  [I]t\' s not data-driven and that it  contradicts long established trends. [3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that  The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration  and  [G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment and  I don\' t know this for a fact  I wouldn\' t be surprised if the Obama administration told the report\' s authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report. [4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the \' worst-case\' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that,  analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity and  analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years. [8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. So that I can understand the basis for EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019: Copies of all briefing materials prepared for you or other Trump Administration EPA political officials related to the preparation and release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including but not limited to the May 2, 2018 briefing for the Office of Air and Radiation whose invited participants included Bill Wehrum and David Harlow, the May 14, 2018 briefing for the Office of Water whose invited participants included Lee Forsgren and Owen McDonough, and the May 29, 2018 briefing for the Office of Research and Development whose invited participants included Richard Yamada.

Hecklers protested the U.S. event on fossil fuels but nobody bothered the Africans when they promoted the role of oil and gas in national development. The event was led by the African Development Bank (AfDB), which earlier this year broke with the ever-green World Bank and announced that it will now fund coal-fired power projects. As AfDB put it, ""we have to use what we have"" and this is true of oil and gas as well as coal. A number of African countries are rich in fossil fuel resources and they intend to develop these, in order to develop their economies and provide for their people. Mind you the Africans are also aggressively active in the Paris Agreement negotiations, which they also see as a potential source of funding for development. They are pushing hard on the finance front. But as with many developing countries, Paris lip service does not interfere with their use of coal, oil and gas. In fact since the World Bank pulled out, China has become the world leader in financing and building coal-fired electric power plants. Now the African Development Bank is also in the coal, oil and gas game. This is great news for a lot of poor people. Here is the official report of the event. Of course it is couched in terms of Paris Agreement nonsense, but the meaning is clear. We have oil and gas and we intend to use it. Managing Carbon Risks and Raising Climate Ambition New Policy Approaches for Countries with Fossil Fuels Presented by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Chatham House The side event aimed to draw attention to carbon risks across a range of policy areas, including energy, industrial, and long-term development planning. Presenters highlighted areas in policy and practice where development assistance can help countries overcome barriers to transitioning and building carbon resilience into long-term planning. Glada Lahn, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, moderated the event, and noted that the elephant in the room at COP 24 is the role of oil and gas in development in the context of the Paris Agreement. She highlighted global discussions around raising economies out of poverty via oil and gas extraction in order to spur growth and development, and stressed the risks posed by the fossil fuel market in transitioning to a low carbon economy. Si-n Bradley, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, noted that there is a high expectation from countries on the role of oil and gas in their economies, highlighting a current reassessment of their value in the global economy. She underscored that the linkages between the oil and gas sector and the wider economy may deliver a shared value under Business-as-Usual, whereas they would deliver a shared risk towards the economy under a 1.5-degree goal scenario. She stressed the need to have a joint approach to carbon risks, adding that there is no point in pursuing climate solutions that undermine governance and socioeconomic stability. Chebet Maikut, Ministry of Water and Environment, Uganda, noted that Uganda has prioritized oil and gas as key sectors to spark socioeconomic development in the country. He stressed that his country needs to learn lessons from producer countries and highlighted his countrys commitment to reduce emissions from oil and gas by 22% by 2030. Rose Mwebaza, African Natural Resources Center of the AfDB, highlighted Nigeria as a good case study for including oil and gas emissions reduction measures in their Nationally Determined Contribution. She noted, however, that the NDC showed what to achieve but not how to achieve it, drawing attention to the lack of a carbon strategy to implement these reductions. She urged for the exchange of knowledge with producer countries on how to extract the resources in the least disruptive manner. In the ensuing discussion, panelists and participants discussed issues regarding: conflicts between biodiversity conservation and resource extraction, noting that Uganda's petroleum reserves overlapping with 80% of the country's protected areas; the implications of transitioning to low carbon development, considering the heavy dependence of transport systems on fossil fuels; whether subsidies for oil and gas compete with renewable energy; and the role of the insurance industry. \"

Each year since 2011, Washington University has sent a group of both graduate and undergraduate students to attend the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Student delegates closely follow a topic at the conference by attending events, sitting in on negotiations and speaking to diplomats and other students from around the world. Ten students are participating in this year's talks, dubbed COP24 . ""There are universities in the constituency from all over the world,"" Waltman wrote. ""It really is incredible to be among ambitious youth like ourselves as we all scramble to navigate our way through the complex world of international climate negotiations.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA228","Poland Should Welcome Activists to U.N. Climate Talks","May 9, 2018 Wednesday","US Official News","New York: Human Rights Watch Organization has issued the following news release: As this month\' s climate talks in Germany come to an end, some participants are feeling a little queasy. Environmental activists and indigenous peoples worry about their ability to actively participate in the annual UN climate talks, in Katowice, Poland in December. UN human rights experts share their concerns. Earlier this week five experts - including the special rapporteurs on environment and human rights, on freedom of assembly, and human rights defenders - raised the alarm about a new Polish law that could hamper civil society\' s involvement at the climate summit, known as the COP24 . It will bring together state parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC), and thousands of experts, journalists, businesses and nongovernmental groups. The UN experts cite concerns about the ban on spontaneous assemblies in Katowice during the talks, which will make it difficult for groups to respond to developments at the negotiations. In a letter sent to the Polish government last month they said that by  curtail[ing] the possibility of spontaneously expressing views about the unfolding of the climate talks and organizing peaceful assemblies to this effect , the new law appears to go beyond the rights restrictions necessary to ensure security and safety at the conference. The UN experts also noted that the law  appears to give sweeping surveillance powers to the police and secret services to collect and process personal data about all COP24 participants . This is a serious issue for the safety of climate activists at the summit. Last month, Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the UNFCCC, acknowledged the concerns about the law in a letter to observer organizations, and committed to  engage with the COP24 Polish presidency in an effort to ensure that non-party stakeholders are able to participate in COP24 as they have in past COPs . However, her letter doesn\' t address the specific risks the law could pose to public participation. The Polish government has yet to respond to the UN rights experts. But a reply from the Polish environment minister to similar concerns raised by the Bureau of the Aarhus Convention, a regional human rights and environmental body, has done little to dispel them. The government contends that the dates of the conference are known, so that activists could  book demonstrations in advance. But at climate negotiations, events unfold quickly and progress is often not clear until the last moment. Unless nongovernmental groups can respond spontaneously and organize peaceful protests when necessary, their rights are seriously undermined. The Polish government also compares the ban to the situation in 2015 in Paris, where the terrorist attacks immediately preceding the climate conference led to a ban on demonstrations in the city. But unlike in Paris, the Polish ban is not a reaction to a concrete security threat. Similarly, the Polish government claims that the surveillance powers for the police are necessary  due to the temporary increase in terrorist, extremist and common crime threats. In addition to collecting information about anyone posing a threat to public safety and order, the new law authorizes the police to collect data about anyone registered as participants in COP24 without their consent until January 31, 2019. But, the UN experts said, providing this authority without judicial review  appears to be unwarranted and unbalanced . This is particularly true in light of the existing counterterrorism provisions in Poland that grant extraordinary surveillance powers to the Internal Security Agency for anyone suspected of terrorist activity, especially foreigners. During meetings in Bonn this week, the Polish government emphasized its commitment to work closely with civil society to confront the global climate crisis and achieve the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement. To make this a reality, Poland should urgently amend or repeal the law to ensure that non-party stakeholders can fully exercise their rights during COP24 . The UNFCCC Secretariat and other governments involved in the negotiations should work with the Polish government to provide the space for a vibrant civil society at the climate talks. As the statement of the UN experts notes:  All eyes are on the Polish Government to see how, as the host and the president of COP24 , it will honour its human rights obligations and uphold its responsibility to ensure free and unfettered access for broader participation. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA229","Monitoring climate change from space","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Space Daily","Rising global temperatures and the effects of climate change are huge and environmental challenges. Satellites provide unequivocal evidence of the changes taking place and provide decision-makers with the information they need to address these complicated issues - as demonstrated in efforts underway at the COP24 summit in Poland. Representatives from almost 200 countries have gathered in Katowice, Poland for the 24th conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said, ""We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change. Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later, before it is too late."" One of most important tasks at the summit is to agree the course of action to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement - and, with the 2C target now deemed not enough, to coordinate an international effort to halt warming at 1.5C. COP24 is expected to agree and finalise the 'Katowice Rule Book' for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The meeting focuses on a triangle of nature, man and technology, and will investigate how they can be used to reduce climate change and mitigate its effects. Understanding the complexities of how Earth functions as a system and hard evidence of change is vital for putting forward implementation plans, especially as taking action can have financial implications for nations. So while space agencies such as ESA and environmental monitoring programmes such as Copernicus do not have a direct role in the decision-making, the information their satellites provide are key. Satellite measurements of Earth's changing temperature, sea levels, atmospheric gases, declining ice and forest cover for example, are one of the main ways of providing the scientific community with the data they need to improve our understanding of the Earth system and predict its future. In her opening speech, Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the United Nations General Assembly, stressed, ""If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."" Data form the basis for policy-makers to build the most effective strategies for halting climate change. Earth's climate has always varied naturally, so the difficult task of separating natural variability from changes caused by human activity is important for confronting today's challenges. Needless to say, it is also important that satellite measurements continue over long periods of time so that changes can be monitored accurately. Through ESA's Climate Change Initiative, long-term datasets on key indicators of climate change are being systematically generated and preserved. These 'essential climate variables' - of which there are more than 50 - are core to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations dedicated programme on Global Climate Observation System. Another European contribution to the global challenge of climate comes from the Copernicus environmental monitoring programme and its dedicated family of Sentinel satellite missions built by ESA. These satellite missions offer continuity of measurements for climate research as well as for a host of operational services to improve everyday life. Copernicus with the Sentinels and their systematic observations, ESA's Climate Change Initiative, along with the contribution that ESA makes to the REDD+ deforestation and forest degradation programme are the topics showcased at ESA's stand at COP24 . \"

We Answer Three Key Questions.","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 23:54 EST","The New York Times ","WASHINGTON  \~With the world still struggling to get global warming under control, diplomats from nearly 200 countries HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/katowice are scheduled to meet in Poland The focus of the meeting? To hammer out a key set of rules for the HYPERLINK Paris climate agreement Under the Paris deal, signed by world leaders in 2015, virtually every country on Earth agreed to submit a plan for curbing emissions and vowed to ratchet up efforts over time. But key questions about how that process would unfold were left unanswered: How thoroughly should countries report their progress on emissions? How detailed should their plans for making further cuts be? Delegates at the conference  being held in Katowice, at the heart of Poland\' s coal-mining region, and which is known as COP24 , shorthand for its HYPERLINK formal name  will haggle over a \~ HYPERLINK  rule book  This is going to be one of the most difficult negotiations we\' ve seen yet, said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under President Barack Obama.  There are so many moving parts. The stakes are high: While countries agreed in Paris to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, the plans that various countries have written so far HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/climate/world-emissions-goals-far-off-course.html are wildly insufficient to that task What\' s more, some countries are now backsliding. The Trump administration has disavowed the Paris deal and HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/climate/trump-paris-climate-timeline.html plans to pull the United States out by 2020, though the country will nonetheless send officials to Poland to participate in talks. Australia and Brazil also have newly elected leaders opposed to more forceful climate action, and some analysts \~ HYPERLINK https://www.iiea.com/energy/the-paris-climate-agreement-versus-the-trump-effect-countervailing-forces-for-decarbonisation/ are now finding signs of a  Trump effect that could undermine global efforts on climate change. What\' s the point of these climate talks? To understand the Katowice meeting, it\' s useful to recall that the Paris climate agreement was largely intended to work through peer pressure among nations. Under the Paris agreement, countries aren\' t required to submit legally binding plans for reducing emissions. Instead, each country submits a voluntary plan tailored to its own domestic situation. This structure, the architects of the Paris deal said, was the most realistic way to get every world leader to agree to participate. But those architects also realized that countries aren\' t doing nearly enough to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. So, under Paris, countries are required to meet periodically, assess their collective progress and see where stronger action can be taken. World leaders could then push each other to ratchet up their ambitions over time. At least, that\' s the theory. But for this peer-pressure dynamic to have any chance of working, analysts say, countries will need to track and report their progress on curbing emissions in a transparent, standardized way. And they\' ll need to offer much more detail on how they intend to cut fossil-fuel emissions in the future, so that outside experts can scrutinize their plans and point out exactly where current climate policies are falling short. Right now, this is often difficult to do. For instance, many countries, like Indonesia, have pledged to reduce their emissions below a  business as usual trajectory. But without a clearer sense of what counts as business as usual, it can be hard to track how much these countries are really doing. So, in Katowice, negotiators will hash out these HYPERLINK https://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2018/11/essential-elements-paris-rulebook.pdf thorny details , like how rigorously countries should track their progress or what level of outside scrutiny future pledges should face. One current draft of the negotiating text is 236 pages long, and, \~ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1068519945548398596 according to an analysis What are the big disagreements? The rule book is expected to provoke fierce debate. Some developing countries have argued that they should be given much more leeway in how they report and track their progress, especially if they have limited technical capacity to measure their emissions. China, in particular, has long been wary of outside scrutiny. Other countries, like the United States and Europe, are leery of holding countries like China, India and others to a lower standard because developing nations account for 60 percent of global emissions today. Looming over all these debates is the uncertain role of the United States, which played a critical part in bringing countries together to finalize the initial Paris agreement in 2015. While the State Department is still sending a team to negotiate the rule book, the Trump administration has largely repudiated the Paris deal and has refused to send an additional $2 billion in climate aid that had been pledged by the Obama administration at Paris. It is still unclear how much influence the United States will have at this newest round of talks, or whether any other countries might step in to take a leadership role.  The global political environment is really challenging right now, with nationalism taking hold in many countries, said Samantha Gross, a fellow in the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate, in a recent telephone call with reporters. How will this affect climate change? The most important work on climate change policy will continue to be done by national and local governments around the world; by private businesses, investors and individuals; and by scientists and engineers developing clean-energy technologies.  While this multilateral process is important, it is not the solution to climate change, said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.  At best, it can help facilitate climate action over time. In that regard, few countries are expected to come to Poland with sweeping new climate policy announcements. For instance, Germany, which has been discussing HYPERLINK when to set a date for phasing out its coal consumption , has postponed any major decision until after the meeting. One big question is whether the negotiators will wrap up the talks with a strong rule book in hand. Under the Paris deal, countries have informally agreed to consider revising their near-term emissions pledges by 2020 to make them stronger. Analysts will be watching to see if countries emerge from Katowice with a clear intent to increase their ambitions,\~or if the Trump administration\' s refusal to tackle climate change might persuade other leaders to slacken their own efforts. If negotiators at Katowice struggle to agree on a robust rule book, or the talks deadlock entirely, that could further sap global momentum for climate action.  The worst case is a complete collapse of talks, which would be seen as an unraveling of the Paris agreement, said Mr. Diringer.  But for that reason, I think that\' s an outcome most governments would like to avoid.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA231","Farting cows directly linked to global warming","December 25, 2018 Tuesday 10:08 AM EST","Green Prophet","Dec 25, 2018( Green Prophet: HYPERLINK http://www.greenprophet.com http://www.greenprophet.com COP24 Climate Change Conference[2],being held in Katowice Poland,is bringing countries together again to try to find solutions to rising temperatures and severe weather patterns being caused by continuous dependence on fossil fuels and other human-caused factors. One under-looked cause, now being considered as no less critical than fossil fuels, is beef and dairy cow farming; especially in affluent countries like Australia, the UK and the USA. Increasing fondness for beef in the USA, for example, is raising levels of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) in the atmosphere as high as the use of fossil fuels. Thisincrease is being caused largely by a very important natural phenomena: cows fart. The unique food digestion process of a cow's 4 chambered ruminantstomach[3]actually ferments the cellular plant material it eats creating methane and other gas, including nitrogen and carbon dioxide. These gases are released from both the animal's mouth during digestion when it chews its'cud'; and afterwards expelled in even larger amounts from the large intestine and anus, causing the flatulence or farts. In a way, you might consider this process as similar to a biogas manufacturing process. So much of this natural biogas is created during the digestion process thatscientists now say that the amount involved to create just 225 grams of beef releases as much biogas into the air as the exhaust from 55 cars! The released biogas is now considered to be adefinite contributor to the 'greenhouse effect'[4] that causes global warming. A recent program produced on CNN points this out more dramatically by illustrating the cattle farming industry in the American state of Texas[5], which has the distinction of being the USA's top beef producing state. The program showed how cattle are raised there in giant feed lots and idolized by a college football team with its Big Bevo mascot: a giant longhorn steer. This particular species of cattle was once the State of Texas' prime beef producing animal; and idolizedas a colorful part of the Old West when massive herds of cattle were driven hundreds of miles overland to livestock markets in Kansas. There, they would then be shipped by rail to meat processingcenters in Chicago and other locations.According to the CNN featured program, cattle emit 10 times more greenhouse gases than other food mammals like pigs and chickens. American fondness for beef remains high, however. Reducing the greenhouse gases emitted by cattle is now considered to be a primary objective to keeping the level of global warming within the 1.5 degrees C goal of the COP 24 conference. If the global temperature levelsexceed this threshold, catastrophic consequences to the earth's environment will occur. Alternatives to naturally grown beef are currently being developed by scientists like Dr. Mark Post[6], one of the first innovators of laboratory produced 'macro meat'. Dr. Postsays that producing synthetic meat from stem cells may one day be commercially feasible and will be able to help satisfy people's desire for beef, while dramatically reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses now being emitted by cattle. It's not just beef producing cattle that are causing the greenhouse gas problem, however. large dairy cattle herds also emit the same greenhouse gases as beef cattle. With this in mind,the only plausible solution will be less production of dairy products from cow's milk, which will be much harder for most people to accept, myself included.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA232","After Katowice: Three Civil Society Strategies for Ratcheting Up Climate Ambition","January 18, 2019 Friday 4:00 PM EST","Carnegie Council Transcripts and Articles","Jan 18, 2019( Carnegie Council Transcripts and Articles: HYPERLINK http://carnegiecouncil.org http://carnegiecouncil.org COP 24 and Leaders Summit in Katowice, Poland, December 2, 2018. CREDIT: UNclimatechange[1] (CC)[2] This article also appears on the Ethics ...ternational Affairs website.[3] While most media reports about COP24 in Katowice did recognize the ""thousand little steps forward together[4]"" that would ""keep the Paris agreement alive[5],"" the overall picture was one of barely contained conflict. Reporters stressed that the talks ""limped[6]"" into an extra day (which was unsurprising, as even relatively inconsequential COPs run late). The New York Times called the public disagreement over whether the COP should ""welcome"" or ""note"" the recent IPCC report a ""huge fight over climate science."" One op-ed[7] even claimed that the welcome/note debate ""derailed this year's climate talks"" completely. The Guardian extrapolated from that incident, among others, to conclude that whoever hosts COP26 in 2020 ""will have a diplomatic mountain to climb[8]."" Sources that specialize in the UNFCCC process, where the most important negotiations are informal and closed to observers, told a more optimistic story. While the talks were tense, difficult and tiring, as international negotiations are, the final texts that emerged were stronger and more comprehensive than most had predicted. Former French diplomat and Paris Agreement architect Laurence Tubiana referred to the outcome of Katowice as ""really striking[9],"" while key NGO player Center for Climate and Energy Solutions called it ""a major milestone[10]"" and the neutral observer Earth Negotiations Bulletin stated that it ""delivered on its mandate[11]."" And despite the United States' role in the ""absurd spat[12]"" over the IPCC report, the country played a neutral or even supportive role in the negotiations. While the White House's Wells Griffith was involved in a shameless plug for fossil fuels[13] on the sidelines, the U.S. negotiating team was primarily composed of (and led by) experienced career officials[14], not political appointees. Together with China, who was a surprising ally[15] for the EU, the U.S. helped[16] forge crucial transparency rules on how the UNFCCC system will require countries to report progress toward their mitigation pledges and how these reports can be verified. Crucially, countries reached agreement on universal rules rather than relying on the old bifurcated system that had separate sets of rules for developed and developing countries. It's not surprising that the media failed to really grasp the successes of Katowice: much more than in Paris, the highlights were in the wonky details[17]. Apart from the universal transparency framework, one such detail was progress on the specific information required in countries' five-yearly mitigation pledges (""Nationally Determined Contributions"" or ""NDCs"") (FCCC/CP/2018/L.22[18]). Another was the new ability of the Implementation and Compliance Committee to effectively draw attention to a country if they have failed to provide any of a number of reports required by the Paris Agreement (FCCC/CP/2018/L.5[19] Annex III, para 22). Only one item on the agenda (the role of tradable carbon credits) was left undecided.1[20] Global agreements on ""frameworks"" and ""modalities"" are great, but will they keep global temperature increase ""well below 2 degrees"" or under 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming?2[21] As Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists put it[22], ""The real test is what happens when countries go home. All the decision text in the world doesn't cut a molecule of carbon. You need action on the ground."" A Financial Times editorial[23] struck an even more cautious note on this subject, rightly pointing out[24] that the current mitigation pledges are ""inadequate"" to meet even the lesser of the Paris Agreement's collective goals, and that COP24 negotiations ""have not changed this in any way."" Timing of Pledge It is true that the Paris mitigation pledges are vastly inadequate, putting us on track to a dangerous world of 3 degrees[25] warming or more by 2100. Does this mean that the Paris Agreement is just hot air? Developing countries can (and often do) rightly object to the lack of progress in the lame-duck pre-2020 regime. But the Paris system itself, which begins in earnest in 2020, is proceeding according to design. Countries were intended to digest the 2018 IPCC report on the 1.5 degree target, and the conclusion of the inclusive two-year Talanoa dialogue at Katowice, before formulating new mitigation pledges by early 2020. The ""ratchet mechanism"" in the Paris Agreement[26] (Article 4.3) means that each one of these pledges must ""represent a progression beyond"" the initial pledge that countries made in 2015 or soon after. This early-2020 deadline should be on the mind of every climate-focused NGO, since countries should already be in the process of formulating their updates. The NDC update process represents a valuable opportunity for NGOs to influence global climate policy. There are of course many different ways that civil society can raise ambition, but I want to draw attention to three strategies in particular. Pressing Domestically for an Ambitious Pledge One strategy for raising ambition is to aim to generate the political will for much stronger mitigation pledges from every player domestically, which in turn will generate the mutual trust needed to solve the collective action problems of climate change. The directness with which NGOs and activists are able to foster political will in their home countries for powerful pledges will vary. When dealing with governments that are committed to public deliberation, civil society can certainly demand to know how their country's mitigation pledge will represent its ""highest possible ambition"" and ""a progression"" beyond its previous pledge while reflecting UNFCCC equity principles (Paris Agreement[27], 4.3). In countries with a weaker public deliberation tradition, that role may have to be more nuanced. But civil society pressure need not be limited to adversarial or public-facing actions. NGOs can help build bridges between political actors. For instance, they can assist fledgling research and industry actors in clean tech and other mitigation areas to signal to policymakers what domestic climate targets might be feasible with the right support. They can also act as intermediaries between decision-makers and key constituencies who would be affected by concrete climate policies, to avoid triggering popular backlash such as that which occurred in France recently. All of these roles have the potential of raising the ceiling of what ""highest possible ambition"" might mean for a given country. What would this strategy mean for civil society in the United States, a country whose head of state has signaled intent to withdraw from Paris and is unlikely to submit a new mitigation pledge by 2020? First of all, the global community would likely consider a U.S. mitigation pledge in 2021 as better late than never. Thus civil society can pressure 2020 presidential candidates to develop a ""shadow pledge"" to prepare for a post-Trump federal policy and send positive signals to domestic industry and a range of external actors. Furthermore, the #wearestillin[28] movement can work to present a ""virtual pledge"" made up of a credible aggregate of mitigation goals made by subnational actors like cities and states in light of the federal neglect of climate policy. Comparing mitigation pledges A second strategy for civil society is to harness reputational effects at the international level through mitigation pledge comparisons. Here we need to shift our analysis from the lower level game of domestic politics to the higher-level game of countries' global interactions. As Jennifer Jacquet and Dale Jamieson put it[29] in a Nature Climate Change paper: ""For pledge and review to succeed, the basic challenge remains: the cost of failing to make and fulfil ambitious pledges must exceed the benefits of business as usual. The soft power of reputation is an important factor in this calculation."" Before Katowice, many NGOs held out hope that the UNFCCC's new five-yearly ""Global Stocktake"" might be a major forum for climate leaders to bring this soft power to bear against climate laggards. However, Katowice has made it very clear that the Stocktake cannot single out any players for special attention, stating that it ""should have no individual Party focus"" (FCCC/CP/2018/L.16[30] Section I.14). Consequently, civil society must continue to make its own decisions about how to best generate and channel the reputational effects that the Paris Agreement relies upon. Evidently, comparisons of the mitigation pledges of various countries are needed for civil society to play the role of ""informal monitor[31]"" (as Robert Falkner describes it) to the Paris Agreement. But such comparisons will be less effective if done in an ad hoc or obviously partisan way. As I have argued before[32], in order to effectively ""name and shame"" climate laggards and ""raise and praise"" climate leaders, civil society information must demonstrate credibility, be simple to grasp, and be adequately granular. Climate pledge comparisons have been on the scene for several years now, and some progress has been made. Climate Action Tracker's[33] work remains idiosyncratic and academia-focused in its methodology, but has increased its granularity, now separating countries into five, rather than four, categories of ambition. Civil Society Review repackaged its assessment[34] for the 2018 Talanoa dialogue, and then again in a report called ""After Paris[35]."" It continues to use quite progressive assumptions about the distinction between subsistence and luxury emissions, which lead to the conclusion that it is developed countries, including the EU, and not the rapidly growing economies, that continue to let the global team down A relatively new player on the scene, The Paris Equity Check[36] is admirable in scope, as it includes every country in the Paris Agreement, whereas Climate Action Tracker and Civil Society Review are more selective. In its more useful and granular ""pledged warming map"" the Check aims for credibility by leaving the decision about which of three fairness metrics (historical responsibility, capacity, or equal per-capita emissions) to whichever most favors each country. Then, through some complicated modelling[37], it projects what level of warming would occur if every country put forward the same level of ambition (according to their preferred metric of the three). Despite the relative humility about being able to explicitly define fairness, Paris Equity Check has nevertheless garnered major controversy.3[38] Buried in the details[39] of how capacity and equal per-capita emissions are measured is an admission that, under two of the three fairness metrics, Paris Equity Check allows a thirty-year period of grandfathering. Thus, a more polluting country is (perversely) given more lenient targets in the near term, and less polluting countries have to take up the slack. Further, the idea of historical responsibility for emissions before 1990 is ruled out as an input into any fairness metric. These choices have left the Equity Check open to strong criticism[40], not only from the architects of the Civil Society Review, but from some of the foremost names in academic climate ethics. For an effective and fair review by civil society, I still recommend[41] building equity into an economic comparability of effort[42] approach, and hold that organizing countries into many development clusters and then ranking countries within groups would be a welcome addition. However, given the time constraints, for this round of pledge updates, reputational effects must proceed via existing reviews: the Civil Society Review, the Climate Action Tracker, and the Paris Equity Check.4[43] It is up to the architects of such reviews to revise them to increase their credibility, clarity, and granularity (as well as the amount of countries assessed), and up to the rest of civil society to publicize and support them. For instance, civil society can push countries to include specific reference to each of the three reviews' verdict about their previous pledge, to put their new pledge into appropriate context. Further, a civil society group could create a review aggregator that can show the public at a glance how well each country is in terms of all current reviews (as well as explaining briefly the methodology of each review). In these ways, the review process by civil society can become a credible litmus test of global climate ambition, in the same way other indexes[44] such as the Corruption Perception Index[45] play on other issues. The incentives created by doing better on such a test can entice many countries to submit much more ambitious mitigation pledges in 2020 and beyond. Facilitating the ""Means of Implementation"" Besides domestic and international action to try to increase mitigation pledges directly, there is yet another strategy civil society can use to increase mitigation ambition. This is facilitating international cooperation on what is known in the UNFCCC as the ""means of implementation"": financial support, technology transfer (including intellectual property), and capacity building. Aside from a few hopeful announcements, Katowice was quite disappointing regarding climate finance. For instance, fewer pledges of climate grants from developed countries emerged than usual. Aside from the robust ethical argument[46] that developed countries owe developing countries support for climate action, such support can also be found in the enlightened self-interest of developed countries. This is because increased finance flows and other means of implementation will often trigger more ambitious developing country mitigation pledges that are ""conditional"" on receiving appropriate support. Again, civil society, specifically in wealthy countries, has a role to play internally in creating political will from within for mobilizing the various means of implementation. And as with mitigation pledges, there is also a role for civil society to provide credible, balanced international assessments of who is doing more in the field of means of implementation, a topic that is almost as controversial and difficult to measure as emissions pledges. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated[47] at the closing of the COP that he has five priorities looking ahead: ""ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition, and ambition."" He went on to explain that he was referring to five types of ambition: ambition in mitigation, adaptation, finance, technical cooperation and capacity-building, and technological innovation. To these ends, Guterres will convene a high-level summit in September 2019. But the work to raise ambition within our own countries, and to improve the measurement of ambition from all countries, is required from us, now. Let's be smart about it. NOTES 1[48] For further accessible yet detailed analysis of the text that Katowice delivered, see the excellent work by C2ES[49] or IISD's Earth Negotiations Bulletin[50]. 2[51] These are the twin collective mitigation goals from the Paris Agreement[52] (Article 2.1) 3[53] Of course, as a matter of practicality, countries with higher emissions will need longer to reduce their emissions to their fair share, but that (arguably) should play no role in assessing the fairness of their ambition. As the Civil Society Review points out, countries can make up for shortfalls between their fair share and any feasible reduction by providing means of implementation for other countries (see below). 4[54] Countries' pledges will also feed into more general indexes of climate change ambition, being 10 percent of the score in Climate Action Network's Climate Performance Index[55].

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA233","SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: TIME TO WAKE UP: COP24","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse: As-prepared for delivery The U.S. is technically present in the form of a small delegation, but American leadership on climate change is decidedly absent. Why? Because the government of the United States of America has fallen under the political control of the industry most responsible for this mess. American leadership was essential to forging the global consensus on carbon emissions in the original Paris Agreement. I know because I was there in Paris in 2015 as Secretary Kerry and the U.S. negotiating team worked to seal the landmark pact. What a pathetic difference a few years make. In 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would become the only country in the world to turn its back on this agreement. The U.S. abdicates its leadership just as the scientific warnings of the dangers of climate change grow clearer, and grimmer. In October came a new report from the world's scientists working through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Last month, the federal government released its own sobering news about the worsening risks climate change poses to our nation and our economy. Our National Climate Assessment warned of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses due to climate change if we don't act to curtail carbon emissions. Trump's responded first by describing his own ""very high levels of intelligence,"" but then simply denied all the science because, he said, ""I don't see it."" Well, guess what? Pope Paul V didn't ""see it"" when Galileo demonstrated that the earth revolved around the sun. That didn't change the astrophysics. The climate science, laid out in black and white by Trump's own government, is that our planet is heating up due to our use of fossil fuels. The science is even more incontrovertible than when Donald Trump said it was ""incontrovertible"" in 2009. Saying he now doesn't see it, is the very definition of denial. ""Willful blindness"" would be another term. The takeover of our government by fossil-fuel forces is having very real consequences in U.S. emissions numbers. After years of decline, U.S. carbon emissions rose in 2018, increasing by 2.5 percent. This of course coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to delay, repeal, and weaken rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants, oil and gas wells, industrial facilities, and vehicles. Of course all of these industries share the blame for not cleaning up their mess on their own, as well as for pushing the Trumpsters to weaken their safety regulations. Chinese carbon emissions increased in 2018, as did Indian emissions. Among major economies, only the European Union saw its emissions decline in 2018. This is why international summits like Poland are so importantthe world urgently needs to correct course, and we can only do so if countries together do their part to reduce emissions. According to the IPCC, to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we need to cut carbon emissions to 50 percent below 2010 levels by 2030, only 11 years from now, and we need to hit net zero emissions by 2050. The IPCC report calls pricing carbon the ""central"" policy that will allow us to hold the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less. If you're sincere about market capitalism, where the costs of a product need to be in the price of the product for markets to work, this is pretty obvious. Where this gets difficult is if you're a fake free-marketeer who's really fronting for the fossil fuel industry. But if you're not faking it to cover for the industry who funds your party, it's pretty straightforward economics: you put the public harm externalities into the price of the product. The good news is that many governmentsfrom cities, states, and provinces to countries and regionsare already pricing carbon. This chart shows the various governments that have set a price on carbon, either through emissions trading (in green) or a carbon fee (in purple). The prices vary. Sweden, for example, charges almost $140 per ton of carbon emitted, covering nearly 50 percent of the nation's emissions. The Canadian province of British Columbia enacted a carbon fee in 2008, rising over time to its current price of $35 per ton. In the four years following the British Columbia carbon fee, fossil fuel use decreased by 17 percent in the province, compared to a 1 percent increase in the rest of Canada. And British Columbia's economy grew faster than that of any other Canadian province. Why would it not? One hundred percent of the revenues raised from British Columbia's carbon fee are returned to taxpayers in the form of other tax cuts. And 70 percent of British Columbians support the policy. So what about the U.S.? California has put a price on carbon via an emissions trading system, as have the nine Northeastern states, including Rhode Island, that are members of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. For the moment, the prices in California and the RGGI states are still relatively low, around five bucks for RGGI. Senator Schatz and I have introduced an American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act to assess a carbon fee starting at $50 per metric ton of emissions in 2019the mid-range of the Office of Management and Budget's 2016 estimates of the ""social cost of carbon,"" the long-term damage done by carbon pollution. Our market-based proposal is an appeal to true conservative Republican colleagues. But the fossil fuel industry keeps a stranglehold on the Republican Party, preventing climate action, even using market principles. America is called the ""indispensable nation,"" and American leadership is indispensable if we are to achieve a global response to a global challenge. But American leadership is lacking because the dark money and sleazy operatives of the fossil fuel industry today control the Trump administration and the Republican Party. There used to be a guy in this body who said, ""Country First."" We could use a little of that now, in this tragic Trump sleazefest. It is time to wake up. \"

The goal is to lower CO2 emissions at Fraport's fully-consolidated Group companies by nearly half to about 125,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2030. The corresponding emissions in 2017 amounted to 209,668 metric tons of CO2. Fraport's new target is based on the national reduction rates agreed to at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. Fraport AG's executive board chairman, Dr. Stefan Schulte, said: ""Growth and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, but belong together. In the spirit of corporate responsibility, we have firmly embedded climate protection in our Group companies to make a positive contribution to this worldwide effort. To achieve our CO2 goals, we will continue to improve the energy efficiency ratings of our buildings, facilities and processes."" In the report, Group CO2 emissions were included with the non-financial performance indicators - along with figures on the sickness rate and the ratio for women in management positions (in Germany). Other indicators include global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity at Frankfurt Airport, as well as Group-wide employee satisfaction. Advancements in these key topics and further initiatives with regard to sustainability are presented in the latest Fraport Group report for the 2017 fiscal year. Titled ""2017 Compact - Gute Reise!

The highlight of AER's involvement was when AER President Magnus Berntsson spoke at the high-level segment 12 December on behalf of all the regions and municipalities of the world. Setting the scene AER has been building a strong voice on how regional climate action can advance global climate goals, convening the engagement of its member regions with the international development policy processes, notably the climate change agenda and its Conferences held in the frame of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Stretching from the 3 of December to 12 of December, this year's Conference of Parties (COP) is expected to have gathered around 30 000 participants, among them environment and climate ministers from around 196 countries. COP24 Katowice is viewed as one of the most important COPs since COP21 in Paris, 2015, when the Paris agreement was adopted. On the agenda for this meeting was an attempt to adopt a rulebook for the Paris agreement. A week of many meetings During these weeks there are many meetings taking place, both in connection to the negotiations but also as side-events. As one of the largest independent regional networks in Europe AER was invited to speak at many venues. The highlight of AER's involvement at COP being AER President, Magnus Berntsson's, speech at the high-level segment of COP24 . In his speech emphasised that regions play an important role in implementing the climate goals, arguing that it is on the local and regional level that the practical work on climate action is taking place. By cooperating with other regions, through networks such as AER, the voice of subnational actors become stronger and national and international levels must listen. Besides speaking at the high-level segment Magnus Berntsson had week full of meetings and conferences. On 10 December he participated at the ICLEI Local and Regional Leaders meeting, named ""Accelerating transitions to delivery of the Paris Agreement through multilevel Climate Action."" On 11 December Magnus Berntsson held the key note speech at the Union for Mediterranean on ""The involvement of sub-national Euro-Mediterranean governments"". During his key note speech Magnus talked about the importance of creating partnerships with actors from both the public and the private sector as well as the civil society. He exemplified with Region Vstra Gotaland climate strategy developed in broad cooperation with stakeholders from all over the region. Followed by participating in a panel on the World Climate Summit- The investment COP 'Creating the Right Policy Environment for Deployment of Innovations and Business-Driven Solutions'. During this session Magnus Berntsson highlighted that the public sector plays an important role in providing the right policy framework that will enable society's transition to a low carbon economy. He also paid a visit to the Austrian pavilion on the 13 of December, where he spoke on mitigation and adaption of climate change as well as the work of R20 Regions of Climate Action. The President of AER was not the only representative from AER present at COP24 , Eva Hallstrom from Vrmland, Sweden, chairing the AER working group on energy and climate change was also in Katowice, Poland sharing good practices and attending negotiations.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA238","COP24 Brings Greatest Test of Countries' Commitment to the Paris Agreement Yet","December 1, 2018 Saturday 1:21 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","World Wildlife Fund issued the following news release: On the heels of several international reports outlining the mounting impacts and costs of climate change, negotiators at this week's UN climate talks need to finalize the rules governing how the Paris Agreement will operate going forward and ensure countries deliver a strong commitment to increase their own climate targets before 2020. The troubling gap between current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and what is needed to prevent catastrophic climate change is laid bare in three recent reports: the 2018 Emissions Gap Report, the United States' 4th National Climate Assessment, and the landmark special report on 1.5 C of global warming. ""In many ways things are getting worse and worse, and better and better, faster and faster,"" said Lou Leonard, World Wildlife Fund's senior vice president for climate change and energy. ""The world's best scientists, and nature itself, are sounding the alarm. Changes are happening sooner and faster than we expected. At the same time, the private sector and regional governments are waking up to their responsibility to lead on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. They are creating momentum and unveiling a new formula for success in ramping up global ambition."" As the recent Emissions Gap report states, countries must sharply raise the ambition of their national climate targets by 2020 or the 1.5 C goal under the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach. ""Increasing ambition at this scale is only possible if the private sector, regional and national governments work collaboratively to develop a new set of national climate targets before 2020,"" said Leonard. ""Countries left ambition on the table when they set their first climate pledges in 2015. Current national climate targets largely ignored or understated the contributions of those driving regional economies, like companies and local governments,"" said Leonard. ""That can change for the revised targets because these players are now fully bought into the process. Moreover, a growing wave of businesses and cities have made new, science-based commitments since 2015, including at the Global Climate Action Summit in September of this year."" WWF is bringing leaders from new climate coalitions in Japan, Mexico, Argentina and the United States to the talks to bridge new alliances, push for stronger pre-2020 action, and to meet with national governments to advocate for strong rules to operationalize the Paris agreement. Private sector representatives in the We Are Still In coalition cite a strong transparency regime, clear and consistent approaches for setting national climate targets, and clarity around market mechanisms as key elements up for debate at these talks which are critical to their business operations. US efforts to reduce emissions will be on display in the US Climate Action Center -- located in Pavilion E and livestreamed -- December 7-10. The Center will host mayors, businesses, Congressional staff, and other climate leaders from the We Are Still In coalition and convene discussion on topics including the implications of the US midterm elections, the benefits a strong Paris regime for the private sector, and the role of natural climate solutions. WWF believes a clear set of outcomes are needed in Poland to ensure the continued momentum for climate action, called the ""Katowice Package"". These include:  Urgently scaled up climate action both before and after 2020 accompanied by financial and other support for developing countries;  Finalize and adopt a comprehensive set of rules (""Paris Rulebook"") to guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement. These must enhance the transparency of all countries' actions to address climate change, lead to greater accountability and ambition of countries' individual climate plans, and clarify the roles of market mechanisms;  A renewed recognition of the gap between current action and the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, and a recognition of actions that can close the gap, including better integration of nature-based climate solutions; and finally,  A commitment from Parties to update and resubmit improved national climate plans (or nationally determined contributions or NDCs) by 2020. Positive momentum heading into the talks was boosted by Germany's pledge of EUR 1.5 billion towards replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, which should help reassure especially the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries that international financial support is available for their climate actions.

""This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself."" The text of the letter can be found below and HERE. December 3, 2018 The Honorable Andrew Wheeler Acting Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20460 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying, ""[m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis.""[1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world's leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts some of which are EPA employees as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated ""I don't believe it"" when asked about the report, adding that ""we're at the cleanest we've ever been.""[2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that ""We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts."" She also said that ""[I]t's not data-driven"" and that it ""contradicts long established trends.""[3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that ""The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration""...and ""[G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment"" and ""I don't know this for a fact I wouldn't be surprised if the Obama administration told the report's authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report.""[4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the 'worst-case' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that, ""analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity"" and ""analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.""[8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA241","Fate of Humanity Weighing Heavy on Ministerial Shoulders at UN Climate Change Conference","December 10, 2018 Monday 8:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","CARE International issued the following news release: Ministers arriving in Katowice will need extreme courage and conviction to make life-saving decisions if humanity is to be saved from the worst impacts of climate change, Oxfam and CARE International said today. Despite it forming the key scientific input to this year's UN Climate Change Conference, COP24 , a handful of countries blocked inclusion of the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), leaving it to ministers to ensure the report is put back into the heart of conference outcomes. Sven Harmeling, CARE's Global Policy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience, said: ""The landmark science report on 1.5 C has shown that we need immediate action to reduce emissions now, not in the future. This week, we expect ministers to no longer hide behind the inaction of the United States and Saudi Arabia, to no longer stay silent, but to speak up for both agreed rules on implementing the Paris Agreement and enhanced national action plans. This is essential to lead us towards roughly halving emissions by 2030 compared to today."" Kristen Hite, Oxfam Climate Change Policy Lead, said: ""It's unacceptable that despite the clear findings of the IPCC governments are still refusing to see the writing on the wall: preventing a world warmer than 1.5 degrees must be the benchmark for all decision making this week. There is real energy and leadership amongst from states, but how many more people need to die from drought-induced hunger or thirst before everyone agrees to limit global warming? How many more communities should burn, or drown?"" Climate change is already forcing people from their land and homes. During the first week of COP24 governments adopted landmark recommendations on displacement, complementing the broader Compact on Migration which was adopted in Marrakech today. In a recent report, Oxfam found the vulnerability to extreme weather of small-scale farmers and pastoralists in the Sahel region made 24 million people reliant on humanitarian assistance this year alone. Harmeling comments: ""We welcome that governments and UN agencies now have a clear framework on how to protect the rights of people at risk of displacement from the climate crisis and ensure communities have full ownership over decisions on relocation. However, this week it is essential that developed countries also agree to commit to financing loss and damage in the Paris Rulebook, to help vulnerable people cope with the unavoidable impacts of climate change."" Oxfam and CARE are also calling on governments to agree on strict accounting rules which ensure that only dedicated funding for real climate action gets counted towards the $100 bn per year which developing countries have been promised. ""There's been some really important discussions to agree a set of crucial rules that everyone should stick to when tackling climate change, but emission cuts are the high-stakes poker chips that governments are betting our lives on. This week the world will be watching to see if Ministers can bring true ambition to the table to win a more prosperous future for everyone,"" Hite said.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA242","AFRICA NEEDS TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE ON CLIMATE ISSUES, SAYS KENYA'S ENVIRONMENT MINISTER","October 10, 2018 Wednesday 8:14 PM  EST","US Fed News","NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 10 -- The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Economic Commission for Africa issued the following news release: Africa needs to prepare and speak with one voice when it goes to COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, in December, Kenya's Environment and Forestry Minister, Keriako Tobiko said Wednesday at the opening of the Seventh Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA - VII) conference in Nairobi. ""We have all experienced the devastating and unprecedented impacts of climate change on our peoples' lives and livelihoods as well as our national economies. Africa is the most vulnerable continent despite contributing only about 4% to global greenhouse gas emissions but when we go to argue our case we speak in tongues and come back with no deal,"" he said. ""We need to make sure that we have a unified voice as we proceed to COP24 . We should showcase our own solutions to climate change; solutions that are developed and customized to fit our own situation."" He said given Africa's shared ecosystems and that natural resources know no boundaries, it was essential that 'we continue to speak in one voice to safeguard the basis of our development and seek transformative solutions'. Mr. Tobiko said the theme of this year's forum, ""Policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa"", reflects Africa's collective engagement and commitment to strengthen climate change actions in the context of its development priorities. Climate change threats, he said, however present opportunities for innovative and green investments for Africa. ""This is why implementation of the Paris Agreement remains a priority for the continent in order to adapt to the inevitability of climate variability and change. It is however important to emphasize that achieving the goals of the Agreement require committed leadership from state and non-state actors,"" the Minister said. Commenting on theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 'Global Warming of 1.50C special report and its impacts in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty', Mr. Tobiko said limiting global warming to 1.50C would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. ""Operationalisation implies that adequate and predictable resources be mobilised and made available to support adaptation and mitigation action in Africa and other developing world,"" he said, adding it was important that discussions and outcome of CCDA-VII contribute to build momentum towards the upcoming COP 24 and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Local communities, women and the youth, he said, should be engaged in Africa's efforts to combat the vagaries of climate change. Mr. Tobiko shared with participants Kenya's priority climate actions and how its devolved governments were helping fight climate change. ""There are numerous practical and innovative solutions at community, sub-national, national and international level that we should never ignore in Africa. Climate change affects all of us but it affects doubly the most vulnerable members of our communities so we should always engage them because they also have the knowledge and solutions,"" he said. The Minister said as part of efforts to tap into opportunities in biodiversity, Kenya will be hosting its first Sustainable Blue Economy Conference between the 26th and 28th November 2018 to promote sustainable investments in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. The meeting has attracted over 700 participants from member States, climate researchers, academia, civil society organizations, private sector, youth, women and local government leaders, among others.

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?The United Nations conference on climate change is supposed to be civil society's last best hope for developing a global plan to cope with the global crisis. But this year's conference in Katowice, Poland has disintegrated into part-diplomatic soiree, part-energy industry trade show. And it remains hostile terrain for the environmentalists and community advocates agitating on the sidelines. Ad Policy[3] While the summit is designed to take stock of global progress on core provisions of the Paris Agreement the policy blueprint hammered out by about 200 member states in 2015 this year's gathering is marked by two major differences: first, there's been a monumental worsening of the climate crisis, with emission rates accelerating far more rapidly[4] than anticipated; second, right-wing and nationalist movements have swept across the United States and other ecologically critical regions, from the Brazilian Amazon[5] to Central Europe. So while more extreme mitigation measures are needed to stay on pace with the 1.5C target for global warming, political momentum is rapidly evaporating. In response to the flagging political motivation for international cooperation, grassroots groups are advancing a list of 'People's Demands[6]' to counter the corporate capture of the UN process and call for a transparent, democratic, and community-focused vision for a decarbonized future. The six-point program[7] for climate justice developed by a coalition that includes Friends of the Earth, Indigenous Environmental Network, and the watchdog group Corporate Accountability calls for a comprehensive, 'people first' transition to renewable energy sources by 2030, led by front-line communities, starting with an immediate halt to fracking projects and coal extraction and a moratorium on new fossil-fuel developments. The goals align with the UN climate-science panel's recommendations for a 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030[8] and run counter to the agenda of Trump and other anti-science, hard-right nationalists. More broadly, the coalition demands a long-term program of environmental restoration, mitigation, and reparations, underwritten by a democratic policy-making process free of corporate corruption. That means barring industry lobbying through comprehensive conflict of interest regulation. Although not every instance of conflict of interest is preventable in climate policy which often involves some cooperation with industry advocates say the UN process has rolled out a red carpet for corporate green-washing. Unlike other international conferences such as World Health Organization meetings, the climate negotiations use a definition of 'non-state' actors[9] that might include civil-society groups or might include private-sector lobbyists for Exxon or pro-business think tanks like the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Climate Change The groups behind the People's Demands submitted a formal request[10] in January to the UNFCC to restrict corporate influence peddling[11], demanding a new conflict of interest framework aimed at blocking 'entities that either have, or represent those that have, financial interests requiring them to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases in order to continue to maximize profit' from '[using] its access to a public institution to slow, derail or direct the outcomes of negotiations toward the interests of its members.' There is also rising internal pressure to get moneyed interests out of the climate talks, according to AFP[12]. In recent months a coalition of conference participants known as African Group of Negotiators as well as the European Parliament have also requested conflict of interest rules be established for the climate conference. (So far, the conference has only adopted vague language that recognizes 'the importance of enhancing the engagement of non-party stakeholders.') When AFP sought out about a dozen business groups registered as 'non-party stakeholders,' all refused to comment. Then again, corporate influence in the COP process[13] has long been something of an open secret. The site of this year's talks, Katowice, is the heart of Poland's coal country[14]. The conference is sponsored[15] by three of Poland's biggest state-owned coal producers, and Central European oil giant Orlen.Current Issue \~ HYPERLINK https://www.thenation.com/issue/december-31-2018-issue/ https://www.thenation.com/issue/december-31-2018-issue/ The fate of the Green Climate Fund[16] a financing pool established through the Paris accord that offers, in theory, $100 billion in donations for various mitigation and adaptation projects. But it has lately fallen into disarray amid bureaucratic infighting another stark illustration of the disconnect between the investment priorities of wealthier member nations and the unmet social needs of environmentally vulnerable communities. The progressive climate-justice groups have also criticized the role of the US Chamber of Commerce[17] as an active political presence at the Katowice conference. The group lobbies ministers on behalf of fossil-fuel companies while promoting climate-denialist claims, even as the Trump administration itself has pointedly distanced itself from the summit. Another corporate player involved with the UNFCCC is the International Emissions Trading Association[18], which represents objective non-state observers like BP, Chevron, Shell, and Bank of America. According to Corporate Accountability's analysis of its lobbying activities around the Paris Agreement, it is a major promoter of controversial carbon-trading schemes, which seek to marketize token environmental-remediation programs in lieu of encouraging comprehensive emissions reductions. Similarly, business groups have championed the controversial REDD+ program[19], a voluntary forest-conservation scheme that allows polluters to 'offset' environmental harms with various projects that count as 'credits' toward deforestation limits. Meena Raman, legal advisor for Third World Network[20], says via e-mail from Katowice, 'Instead of heeding the unequivocal science and urgent needs of people now, developed countries are spending their time here trying to escape their historical responsibility to this crisis. Developed countries are trying to default on the debt that they have to developing countries for driving this crisis.'Read Next The corporate capture of the UNFCCC process has compromised the integrity of the negotiations, according to Corporate Accountability advocate Jesse Bragg. And though getting rid of business lobbyists at the conference space itself is £ first step,' he says, comprehensive conflict-of-interest guidelines are also needed on the domestic level, within the governments of member states, in order to establish 'common-sense firewall policies that limit industry interference in policy-making. For example, requiring publicly accessible minutes after meetings with industry representatives or limits on revolving door cases.' At a side event in Katowice featuring the People's Demands[21], Suparna Lahiri of Global Forest Coalition[22] argued[23] that grassroots voices were being crowded out of the corporatized conference:The ongoing negotiationsare shifting the focus away from the pathways to real solutions: the lands, territories, and forests where indigenous peoples, communities, and women are on the frontline, vulnerable to climate shocks, but resilient enough to respond with their own actions, using their customary practices, traditional wisdom and knowledge.However, our rights, governments, conservation, and restoration practices are not recognized and supported, since they neither bring credits nor profits.The conference corridors may be awash in oil-slicked cash, but on the sidelines a new internationalism is being forged. While they have no corporate sponsorships, they're hell bent on making polluters pay.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA244","Stalemate in Poland revealed central tension of Paris Agreement","February 12, 2019 Tuesday 6:00 PM EST","Climate Home News","Feb 12, 2019( Climate Home News: HYPERLINK http://www.climatechangenews.com http://www.climatechangenews.com This becomes complicated. Markets are a primary facilitator of such transfers, and 'mitigation outcomes' is a euphemism for carbon credits.As it happened: Final scramble for deal at climate talks in Poland[2]In a carbon market, regulators set caps for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across a segment of the economy, and distribute credits to covered entities that are based on their individual GHG reduction obligations. These entities then have the option of lowering their own emissions and selling these credits, or purchasing credits on the market to cover their excesses. As regulators progressively lower the GHG caps, overall emissions decline while individual flexibility continues. Such markets have demonstrated[3] the ability to reduce emissions at lower costs and faster speeds than other approaches, but they remain divisive as a core tool for addressing climate change. Some question[4] their distributional impacts, and fear that they will lead to emitting activities and environmental stress moving to places where they will continue to impact marginalized communities. Others point out[5] that policymakers often struggle to set emissions caps low enough to make a meaningful difference. Still others say[6] carbon prices are fine in theory but not as impactful as other policy tools - from financial incentives like feed-in-tariffs and subsidies on the one hand to direct regulations like vehicle and factory emissions standards on the other. And that is just in domestic contexts.Global issues need global coverage CHN is dedicated to bringing you the best climate reporting from around the world. It's a huge job and we need your help. Throughour Patreon account[7]you can give as little or as much as you like to support our work. It's safe and easy to sign up.Even those who champion carbon markets can challenge[8] the value of exchanging carbon credits across international borders. Such exchanges require context-specific respect for varied national circumstances, how the markets integrate[9] with one another, and - vitally - how accounting systems should be designed to ensure a ton of GHG reduction in one place equals a ton in another. And so carbon markets became a primary sticking point at Cop24 . Like the national climate plans steering them, carbon markets are highly differentiated across different countries. Crafting cohesive policies for emissions trading comes into conflict with the desires of countries to operate as they see fit, and report back to the international community in the manner they choose. At Cop24 , this came to a head in the form a spoiler. Article 6 calls[10] on countries to make 'corresponding adjustments' to their domestic emissions inventories to reflect international trades. Plainly, this means not crediting oneself with an emissions reduction that one also sells to another. Such double-counting would erode[11] confidence in the mitigation value of international credits, and send dubious signals to private sector market practitioners. Brazil sought to soften accountability standards for exporting carbon credits, and yield a system where double-counting risks were significantly higher. The international community recoiled, leading to a pervasive impasse on Article 6 as other contentious issues made progress (see table). It was ultimately tabled for further negotiation in the coming year. Undecided 'Bracketed' Clauses by Issue and Date at Cop24 The table above shows progress on articles of the Paris Agreement over the course of Cop24 . Article 6 is conspicuous in the continuation of bracketed text throughout the negotiations (Source: Carbon Brief)Brazil was the main obstructionist in this instance, but Article 6 will continue suffer the fundamental tension intrinsic to creating a centralized system based on varied commitments and disparate approaches to meeting them. It mirrors wider climate negotiations in being less about finding grand bargains, and more about aggregating activities around the world and providing coherent guidelines for how actions should be measured, reported and verified. The negotiations have become - at their core - an accounting and accountability exercise. The hope for Cop25 is that flexible yet robust rules are agreed upon to work across the range of next generation carbon markets. This was of course the hope for Cop24 as well. In the meantime trading continues. Countries and businesses can build cooperative markets and let the rule writers 'catch up later[12]'. Nothing that happened at Cop24 and no text in the PA prevents[13] markets from operating in the absence of clear international oversight. What Cop24 did reveal is that - for better and worse - the centralized systems of the past are gone, and future efforts will have to reconcile a wider bottom-up/top-down dichotomy to meaningfully contribute to climate mitigation. Jackson Ewing is a senior fellow at the Duke University Nicholas Institute of Environmental Policy Solutions. A more technical elaboration of this argument can be found here[14].

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA245","SHAHEEN STATEMENT ON TRUMP ROLL BACK OF CLEAN POWER PLAN","August 21, 2018 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen: U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement in response to the Trump administrations roll back of crucial power plant carbon emission standards that were implemented by the Obama administration. The Trump administration released new pollution rules that replace the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan with a new agenda that caters to the fossil fuel industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Trump administrations proposed regulations would increase carbon emissions, leading up to an estimated 1,400 premature deaths each year. The Presidents continued efforts to undo the progress weve made to combat the effects of climate change are threatening the health and safety of the American people, said Shaheen . Rising temperatures interrupt New Hampshires fall foliage season and maple syrup production, directly impeding our business and tourism sectors, and elevated sea levels put the homes and livelihoods of our Seacoast families at risk. It is unconscionable that the administration is knowingly pursuing a policy that puts the wellbeing of the fossil fuel industry over American lives. The Presidents actions also undermine years of work by small businesses in New Hampshire and across the nation that were incentivized under the Obama administration to prioritize technology in renewable energy and to curb carbon emissions. Im deeply concerned by the Presidents destructive efforts to unravel necessary protections that safeguard our air, water and land, and that preserve our environment and wildlife. Ill continue to oppose the administrations dangerous policies that put Americans health at risk and jeopardize the sustainability of our planet. Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris climate accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy as part of the omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2018. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the Presidents anti-environment agenda, and cosponsored legislation that would rescind President Trumps anti-climate executive order and restore our nations leadership role in the fight against global climate change. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA246","BRINGING SCIENCE TO GLOBAL CLIMATE TALKS","January 24, 2019 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of California - San Diego: By Brittany Hook Large delegation of students and researchers from Scripps Oceanography and University of California participate in COP24 climate conference in Poland A saucer-shaped arena set in the heart of Polands coal country seems like an unlikely place to host a global climate change conference. And yet, for two weeks in December, more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 nations converged in the Silesian capital of Katowice, Poland, to attend the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ). More than twenty students and researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego attended the climate talks, where they gained a nuanced understanding of the intricacies and challenges of climate policy. The team was part of UC Revelle, the observer organization representing the University of California. It was so interesting to see how this kind of global policy is created, said Kat Montgomery, a Master of Advanced Studies student in the Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. A first-time attendee of the UN talks, Montgomery described her experience in Poland as illuminating and said she gained a better understanding of the role of non-governmental and research organizations in the UNFCCC process. I think the UCs biggest accomplishment at COP24 was being able to give so many current and future scientists a chance to attend a conference like this, where they could learn about and potentially influence global policy, said Montgomery. In Katowice, she and other UC delegates observed some of the complex negotiations in which nations hammered out the details of a common rulebook to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. The rulebook defines how nations will enact their climate pledges to keep global temperatures well below an increase of 2C above pre-industrial levels. It also provides a universal framework for measuring and reporting emissions with greater transparency and supports climate financing to poorer nations, among other things. The negotiations were difficult, as many countries were trying to pull in different directions. However, the world came to a midpoint to implement the Paris Agreement, said Alfredo Giron, a Scripps Ph.D. student whose research focuses on fishery sustainability in the Gulf of California. Being part of the Scripps delegation allowed me to follow up this process very closely and get involved with delegates from different countries and other observer organizations to dig into the details. In the UFO-shaped Spodek arena, the UC delegates hosted an exhibit that highlighted the oceans reach on global climate. The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions. One meaningful interaction occurred when Tibetan delegate Zamlha Tempa Gyaltsen stopped by the UC exhibit to drop off a hand-signed letter from His Holiness the Dalai Lamaa well-known champion for climate science with deep connections to UC San Diego. In the letter, His Holiness thanked the COP24 delegates for striving to create a better environment for the world so that future generations will be able to live a healthy, happy life. He also urged humanity to recognize that climate change affects everyone on Earth and that we must take serious action now. UC delegates also led six press conferences and participated in other side-events to communicate the latest scientific research on topics ranging from ocean deoxygenation to geoengineering to the value of deep ocean observation networks, and more. The conference is an enlightening experience that comes with a sense of worldly connectedness and inspires nations to collectively work toward changes for the good of humankind, said Scripps Ph.D. student Tashiana Osborne, a two-time attendee of the UN climate talks. Osborne said shes still hopeful that nations can work together to address climate change but was concerned to witness how slow-moving and challenging it can be for responsible political actions to be taken. At COP24 , she and fellow Scripps Ph.D. students Kara Voss and Meredith Fish held a press conference to discuss the science behind atmospheric rivers and extreme weather patterns linked to climate change. It is very important for the world to see students, researchers, and top STEM programs like Scripps invested in global climate change issues, said Osborne. It's imperative to demonstrate that there are those of us in the United States who remain dedicated to learning about and helping address parts of the climate crisis. COP24 marked the third UN-led climate talk attended by Osinachi Ajoku, a Scripps Ph.D. student studying climate science. His research focuses on how aerosol particles produced from biomass burning affect climate patterns in Africa. Ajoku said that attending three conference sessions has given him a holistic outlook on how countries address climate change by factors such as culture, location, and economic standing. It has also allowed me a unique perspective of how countries in Africa are progressing in climate change relative to the rest of the world since that region is the focus of my research, said Ajoku, a Los Angeles native with roots in Nigeriawhich he says makes his African research feel more personal. While at COP24 Each panelist underscored the importance of educating the youth about climate change and discussed the increasingly vital role of science communication to inform and inspire communities to tackle the massive problem of climate change on a local level. When something's outside of your control, you have to focus on what you can control, said Ajoku, responding to an audience members question about how to garner support in his home country of Mozambique. I'm a big believer in ground works, so I think the best thing to do is work on a local level, to bring the community together and teach them about climate change. I think this would actually go a long way. The University of California has been sending delegations to COP for the past 17 years, and the continued effort has already made noticeable waves. Giron noted that this year, many members of the UC delegation had talks with other delegates who have read a scientific paper on ocean-related Nationally Determined Contributions that was written by Scripps Natalya Gallo and Lisa Levin, and GPS David Victorall former participants in the climate conference and members of the UC delegation. Every year, Scripps gains more presence among delegations and brings the spotlight to the oceans, said Giron. COP24 was an opportunity for me to dig deeper into learning how negotiations work, get to know more delegates, and confirm that I want to be part of such processes from a scientific perspective in the near future. Montgomery echoed Girons sentiments on the importance of having UC delegates involved in the annual conference. I got to know people on this trip whose research has some amazing real-world applications, she said. The more chances they have to share it with policymakers, the better off we'll all be. \"

Greenpeace's head of delegation at COP24 Jens Mattias Clausen said: ""The window of opportunity is open - but only just. Climate science still provides hope, but the time for political talk has long gone. People are clamouring for action. Children are walking out of schools, the vulnerable are calling for justice or launching lawsuits and communities are standing up to defend their forests. Which leader will stand with them and deliver them reasons for hope?"" Greenpeace Canada Climate &#38; Energy Senior Strategist, Keith Stewart, said: ""The politicians gathered in Poland must confront the harsh reality that people are already dying from climate change and that they are the last generation of world leaders who still have the time to act. Governments must work in cooperation to achieve a carbon-neutral society. We need fast, bold action to alter the course of history. Bold climate action can deliver a better world where a 100 percent renewably-powered economy provides clean air and water, jobs and prosperity, and justice for climate impacted communities. We expect nothing less of governments at COP24 . There is no time to waste. Within Canada, that takes real climate leadership, not a multi-billion investment in a new tar sands pipeline that will be a stranded asset in the low-carbon world we need to stop climate change."" Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) falls short of our fair-share contribution to the global effort to confront climate change and Canada's current climate plan will not achieve its 2030 reduction target.  The G20 outcome saw the G19 strongly reaffirm their resolve to act on climate, isolating the US administration as the lone government to have abandoned Paris.  The EU has sought to take leadership by proposing to go net zero by 2050. To stay within 1.5 C, the EU will need to reach this goal by 2040.  The Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) nations have committed to enhancing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and are calling on rich nations to do the same ahead of COP24 .  Leaders from 18 European countries have called for all countries to revisit their national climate action plans in light of the latest scientific findings.  Regional governments, cities and businesses provided a strong example to world leaders of what climate ambition looks like at the Global Climate Action Summit. This week, on December 7th, Prime Minister Trudeau meets the provincial ministers in Montreal to discuss NAFTA and other topics. He has another chance to make climate change a priority. The question remains whether he realizes that the world is living through a climate emergency, and that more urgent action is required to address the crisis.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA249","Carper to Wheeler as COP24 Begins: Distorting Climate Science Report Runs Afoul of Commitment You Made to Me","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington: Office of the Senator Tom Carper has issued the following news release: As the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) begins, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), wrote to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to express grave concerns regarding his recent public comments with respect to the Trump Administration\' s release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report.  If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating, wrote Senator Carper.  This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. The Honorable Andrew Wheeler Acting Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20460 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying,  [m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis. [1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world\' s leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts \- some of which are EPA employees \- as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated  I don\' t believe it when asked about the report, adding that  we\' re at the cleanest we\' ve ever been. [2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that  We think that this is the most extreme version and it\' s not based on facts. She also said that  [I]t\' s not data-driven and that it  contradicts long established trends. [3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that  The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration  and  [G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment and  I don\' t know this for a fact  I wouldn\' t be surprised if the Obama administration told the report\' s authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report. [4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the \' worst-case\' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that,  analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity and  analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years. [8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. So that I can understand the basis for EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019: Copies of all briefing materials prepared for you or other Trump Administration EPA political officials related to the preparation and release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including but not limited to the May 2, 2018 briefing for the Office of Air and Radiation whose invited participants included Bill Wehrum and David Harlow, the May 14, 2018 briefing for the Office of Water whose invited participants included Lee Forsgren and Owen McDonough, and the May 29, 2018 briefing for the Office of Research and Development whose invited participants included Richard Yamada. Copies of all briefing or materials prepared by EPA that were sent to any other entity within the Trump Administration related to the preparation or release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including documents related to the decision to release the report the day after Thanksgiving. Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to your appearance at the November 28, 2018 Washington Post event or the EPA press release the following day.

Piccard is an internationally recognized aviation innovator who piloted Solar Impulse 2, the first airplane to fly around the world without a drop of fuel. He also recently launched the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, whose goal is selecting 1,000 solutions that would protect the environment in a profitable way. These solutions are to be offered to world decision makers at COP24 ; the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ), which is scheduled for Dec. 3-14 in Katowice, Slaskie, Poland. The World Alliance also hopes to encourage these leaders to adopt more ambitious environmental targets and energy policies. ""Bertrand Piccard pushes the boundaries of the possible with his pioneering spirit,"" said Chris Strong, NBAA senior vice president of conventions and membership. ""That pioneering spirit is among the hallmarks of the business aviation industry, and we know convention attendees will be inspired by his personal story and perspectives about what is possible in aviation and beyond."" The Solar Impulse project was created to demonstrate the abilities of renewable energies and promote energy savings. The Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and economy, bringing together protection of the environment and financial viability to show that these solutions are not expensive fixes to problems, but rather opportunities for clean economic growth. The Solar Impulse 2 solar-powered aircraft departed from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, traversed Asia, then completed its longest leg from Japan to Hawaii. On that leg, the aircraft's batteries sustained substantial damage that required repair, but the flight eventually continued from Hawaii to California, across the U.S., over the Atlantic Ocean to Spain and back to its starting point in Abu Dhabi. Solar Impulse 2 completed its 26,000-mile round-the-world mission without using a drop of fuel in July 2016. Piccard was a speaker at the opening session for the 2017 edition of the European Business Aviation Convention &#38; Exhibition (EBACE). NBAA-BACE is business aviation's most important annual event, where participants have an unequaled opportunity to view the latest business aircraft, products, technology, and services the industry offers. Held this year at the Orange County Convention Center and Orlando Executive Airport, the event also offers a premier networking venue and dozens of educational sessions.

President Buhari renewed his commitment Monday in Katowice, Poland, at a bilateral meeting with Swiss President Alain Berset, on the margins of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP24 . The President had spent the whole day at the International Conference Centre, Katowice where he delivered his national address at the opening of the 12-day meeting of COP24 , met with several world leaders and visited the impressive Nigerian pavilion at the climate summit. During his meeting with the Swiss President, the Nigerian leader thanked the Swiss Confederation for its efforts and important role as intermediaries to secure the release of some Chibok girls and assured him that the issue of the remaining kidnapped girls and other abducted persons will remain a ""key priority"" for the Nigerian government. President Buhari and his Swiss counterpart discussed joint strategies to ensure the safe return of the girls, building on the past successes of securing the release of some of the Chibok girls and other abducted persons in the North Eastern part of Nigeria. The President also welcomed the Swiss President's commitment to continue providing humanitarian assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria and to ensure the safe release of the abducted school girls. ""We will continue to make the safe release of the remaining Chibok girls a priority and will welcome any kind of support from any quarters to make this happen, "" the President said. In separate bilateral meetings with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, President Buhari commended the country for a successful outing at the opening of the COP24 meeting in Katowice. The President told his Polish counterpart that Nigeria was facing serious climate change challenges, particularly the receding Lake Chad, which is a source of livelihood to some 40 million people living in the region. ""Nigeria is totally committed to global efforts to mitigate and adapt to effects of climate change,"" President Buhari told the Polish leader, whose country is the president of COP24 . In his meeting with Prime Minister Morawiecki, the President lauded the plan by the Polish Government to open a Trade Office in Lagos soon, promising that investors who look to Nigeria can be ""guaranteed"" of safe returns on their investments. ""We have a vibrant and active young population and our government is doing so much on the Nigerian economy, including diversifying to non-oil sectors. ""We welcome increased cooperation with Poland and will encourage investments in other sectors of the economy like solid minerals and information technology, "" the President said. Morawiecki told President Buhari that traditionally 96 per cent of oil imports to Poland come from Saudi Arabia and Russia, adding ""but now we are looking at importing oil from Nigeria. "" The Prime Minister noted as the fastest growing economy in the European Union, Poland has identified Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa, as three top investment destinations in Africa. ""We want the hub of our investment destination to be in Nigeria,"" the Polish Prime Minister told President Buhari, welcoming the pledge by the Nigerian leader to immediately put in place a framework to encourage more Polish investments in Nigeria. Meanwhile, the President's bilateral meeting with his Austrian counterpart, Alexander Van der Bellen, focused on the challenges of Lake Chad and what was required to recharge it. Noting that the Lake faced the two challenges of technology and financing, President Buhari told the Austrian leader that enormous financial resources and technology were required to transfer water to Lake Chad from the Congo Basin. Van der Bellen, who indicated his country's interest to cooperate with Nigeria on recharging the Lake Chad, talked about climate change challenges in Austria including drought, glaciers melting, among others. President Buhari also met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and both leaders followed up on their past discussions, during their last meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, in July, which centred on trade, investments and partnerships in agriculture. The President welcomed the proposal by the Dutch Prime Minister to visit Abuja soon and promised that the Nigerian government will continue to provide a conducive business environment for existing and prospective Dutch investors. On the sidelines of COP24 , President Buhari also met with the Prime Minister of Estonia, Juumlri Ratas. The Prime Minister of the Northern European country sought Nigeria's support on its bid for a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council for 2020-2021. The two leaders also discussed bilateral cooperation and climate change mitigation. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA254","Law Professor Wirth Reflects on Environmental Negotiations","January 27, 2019 Sunday","The Heights: Boston College","In early December, the 24th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) was convened in Poland. Boston College law professor David Wirth was an official academic adviser at the meeting, which was designed to halt the impending effects of climate change. ""Growing up, my father was interested in stamps and coins, and I was interested in butterflies, shells, and fish,"" Wirth said. ""I was interested in nature, and I grew up with a certain awe and respect for nature."" COP24 . The conference was looking to elaborate on the Paris Rulebook, which, according to Wirth, was ""pretty detailed,"" but required further expansion. The Paris Rulebook came out of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015 by 195 countries who agreed to mitigate their greenhouse gas emission and work toward a more environmentally friendly world. Environmental issues have received greater attention in light of a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that warned of irreversible damage if corrections did not occur before 2020. The U.S. government released a report that came to the same conclusion. As of now, emissions are still increasing. Wirth warns that they must be reduced by 45 percent by 2030 to avoid the catastrophic effects that accompany dramatic climate change. COP24 made significant strides toward instituting policies that would curb emissions, but the absence of the United States, and its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, has taken the pressure off China to take significant measures to curb their emissions. Additionally, Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a climate change skeptic who has pulled out of hosting COP25. Wirth called COP24 Wirth was invited to the conference because of his impressive resume and his extensive background in the field of international environmental law. He was educated at Princeton University and Harvard University, where he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry. Wirth attended Yale Law School and graduated in 1981. He then went to work as a law clerk to Judge William H. Timbers of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, before going into the field of international environmental law, which put all of his degrees to use, even though environmental law was still in its infancy stages. He has worked on the diplomatic side of climate change since 1988 and has held positions at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the State Department, among other governmental institutions. When Wirth was at the State Department, he was the only person working on international environmental law. ""I got in on international environmental law when the elevator wasn't even at the ground floor-it was at the basement,"" Wirth said. Wirth then joined the BC community in 1998 and was made a permanent member of the faculty in 1999. He has taught classes on international environmental law and public international law, as well as climate change and policy. ""The social justice ethos of this school is very attractive to somebody that works in my field,"" Wirth said. ""I got into this line of work, not to be too disingenuous about it, to make the world a better place. International law can do that."" Featured Image Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Related \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA255","Coalition of countries pledge to increase climate ambitions by 2020","December 14, 2018 Friday","SNL Power Daily with Market Report","A coalition of nearly two dozen countries pledged to increase their climate ambitions by 2020 and called for other nations to promise to do the same to help halt global warming. The High Ambition Coalition, primarily comprised of European, Latin American and small island nations, issued a statement Dec. 12 during climate talks in Poland. It said the countries are ""determined to step up our ambition by 2020,"" including by boosting their goals under the Paris Agreement on climate change, taking more short-term actions and engaging in long-term strategies for developing low emission technologies. Ministers and other officials that signed the deal were from Argentina, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, the European Union, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Grenada, Italy, Jamaica, the Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Principality of Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Saint Lucia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Notably missing from the pledge is Poland, which is hosting and leading the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24 . However, COP24 President Micha Kurtyka of Poland and a Fiji minister on the closing day of related informal national ambition discussions known as the Talanoa Dialogue issued a Talanoa Call for Action for governments and the private sector to step up action in 2020. The year-long ambition talks concluded at COP24 on Dec. 12, three days ahead of when negotiators are hoping to hash out an implementation rulebook for the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to limit global warming ideally to 1.5 degrees C and to 2 degrees at the most. The parties to the Paris Agreement launched the Talanoa Dialogue in 2017 to begin assessing how close they are to meeting their initial pledges and thinking about increasing their goals in 2020, which is the first year in which nations will have the option to announce new targets. Under the Paris accord, countries agreed to increase their climate ambitions over time with the understanding that their initial pledges, the ones in place today, would not be enough. ""Climate action is on the rise but not on the scale and speed we need,"" Kurtyka said at the closing session of the Talanoa Dialogue. Adding pressure to those discussions is a recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, that found the world effectively has until 2030, much earlier than previously thought, to significantly reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. But global emissions climbed in 2017 and are expected to have climbed again in 2018 and the U.S.'s refusal along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to endorse the IPCC report at the COP24 meetings indicates big challenges remain in getting all of the countries that signed the Paris accord to agree to ratchet up their goals in 2020. At the closing session of the Talanoa Dialogue, U.N. Secretary Ant\'f3nio Guterres challenged countries and the private sector ""to accelerate and finish the job and to raise ambition on all fronts. To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change."" Guterres has invited heads of state to attend a U.N. climate summit in New York City in September 2019 that will largely focus on stepping up ambitions in 2020 and increasing private sector participation. The Talanoa Dialogue was also the first time under the Paris Agreement in which the private sector and smaller governments were invited to participate in the discussions. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA256","COP24: Nationalism and the challenge of climate change; At a world gathering on climate change this weekend, nations will face a key political test: whether the....","November 27, 2018 Tuesday","The Christian Science Monitor","Two major international meetings are about to take place, and the first - the G20 summit of the world's leading economic powers - is likely to grab the lion's share of the headlines. But it's the second, opening this Sunday in the southern Polish city of Katowice, where the stakes are greater.\~ At issue is climate change. The task at COP24 is to draw up a rulebook to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement's aim of dramatically slowing it down, and averting what scientists increasingly agree is the alternative: hugely damaging natural, economic, and human costs across the globe. That's likely to prove daunting enough. But the real test will be whether the international cooperation and political will necessary for any effective response to climate change, a process that does not recognize state borders, is possible in a world increasingly driven by narrower nationalism. That's especially true of two key players: the United States and China. A series of scientific reports ahead of Katowice has underscored how far governments still have to go if they're to reach the stated goal of Paris - limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees C or 2.7 degrees F.\~more than pre-industrial levels - and how dire are the potential consequences of failure. The most comprehensive of the studies, by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concluded that even keeping the increase to 2 degrees wouldn't avert the risk of punishing increases in extreme weather conditions, more droughts and flooding, and related threats of hunger, poverty, mass migration, and resource-driven wars. The authors also warned of possible tipping points, such as an end to the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, which could make the effects of climate change irreversible if concerted action weren't taken over the next decade. Although President Trump has played down the issue of climate change, a US government report last week also delivered a bleak assessment. With the continental US already 1.8 degrees F.\~hotter than a century ago, it noted that mountains in Western states were already seeing less snow and that wildfires like the blaze that recently destroyed thousands of homes and claimed dozens of lives in California were becoming more frequent. Katowice's challenge won't primarily involve the science, however. It's political. Despite the declared aim of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperatures, in large part by phasing out emissions from coal, there was a pragmatic recognition that targets agreed to by individual nations would not be mandatory. That was one tradeoff for getting less developed economies, and crucially China, to participate in an international climate-change agreement for the first time. The meeting in Katowice is meant to achieve the next best thing: agreement on a robust system of reporting to ensure transparency over whether countries are meeting their commitments as part of the global response to climate change. While US leadership was a key in the Paris agreement, Mr. Trump has formally declared he intends to pull out. Since that can't take effect for another year, he is still sending a delegation to Katowice, and in the run-up to the meeting, these experts and officials are understood to have been active participants in the search for an agreement. But news reports have indicated Washington will also send a team to make a presentation about the long-term potential for ""clean coal,"" rather than essentially eliminating coal power over the coming few decades as agreed in Paris. \~ China has been more active in pre-Katowice discussions than in past climate talks, in part perhaps as a pointed effort to demonstrate it is filling a leadership vacuum left by the US. Its own long-term economic plans also include a major focus on clean-energy technology. But despite having the world's second-largest economy, the Chinese still appear to be positioning themselves as one of the developing countries, which have tended not just to seek looser national targets. They've argued that countries like the US and European states, the main source of carbon emissions in the last century, need to bear the principal financial responsibility for their transition to cleaner energy - one of Trump's principal objections to the whole Paris Agreement process. \"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA258","THE SECRETARY-GENERAL'S REMARK AT THE E-MOBILITY EVENT AT COP24","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 2:49 PM  EST","US Fed News","UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 4 -- The United Nations Office of the Secretary General issued the text of the following statement: Minister Kurtyka, Minister Morawiecki, Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, ladies and gentlemen It is a pleasure to address you at this exciting event. I want to thank the Government of Poland and in-coming COP president Mr. Kurtyka and the United Kingdom for launching this initiative. This event is exciting because it is a key step towards the sustainability transition that we all know is needed. And this step is critically important for reaching the aims of the Paris Agreement - to keep global temperature rise this century to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C. Globally, transport accounted for one quarter of total emissions in 2016, a level 71% higher than what was seen in 1990. It is estimated that over 1 billion passenger cars travel the streets and roads of the world today. By 2040, the number of cars on the road across the globe is set to double to 2 billion at least. This illustrates the urgency for accelerated action to reduce emissions from transport. But the need is equally obvious when looking at air pollution. Air pollution is now the fourth-highest cause of death worldwide. Long-term exposure to air pollution contributed to the deaths of 6.1 million people in 2016. Clearly, we need to prevent this. Clearly, we need to act. Interestingly, the first electric vehicles were produced and sold at the beginning of the 1900s and sales peaked in the early 1910s. But technological developments and the discovery of large oil reserves displaced the electric vehicle in favour of the combustion engine. Now, almost 100 years later, electric vehicles are coming back and need to increasingly displace the combustion engine in favour of reducing emissions and air pollution. We need sustainable and clean transport systems. The growing awareness for clean air and climate change means that many governments around the world have begun embracing e-mobility. Many are putting in place the policy frameworks and infrastructure needed for sustainable transport. A growing number of countries and regions have announced plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles and to shift to e-mobility. Others are putting in place targets for the absolute number or overall share of electric vehicles by 2020 or 2030. And the International Energy Agency estimates that in 2017, there were already 3.5 million charging outlets for electric vehicles around the world. These policy initiatives have spurred market growth for electric vehicles. There is increasing demand and many businesses are embracing e-mobility and its new economic opportunities. By some estimates, this will displace 7.3 million barrels per day of transport fuel. This clearly shows the potential of e-mobility in contributing to climate change mitigation. Many sustainable transport strategies also have large, immediate health benefits for the majority of the world's population, and large equity benefits for vulnerable groups. But the growth in electric vehicles will have a significant impact on electricity demand - and this needs to be kept in mind. If not managed carefully, the additional demand will create challenges across all sections of the energy system, particularly at peak times. E-mobility that depends on a fossil fuel-based energy system would potentially significantly drive climate change and air pollution and not lead to the solution we want. According to IRENA, assuming all these new electric vehicles were to consume 100% renewable electricity, around 450 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year of additional renewable electricity would be required by 2030. We have the solutions at our finger tips. We have much of the technology in place. We have policies to drive and support sustainable transport. And market conditions and demand are responding positively. The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity. But the transition needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full. If we get this right, then a decarbonized transport system will be part of the solution. The ""Driving Change Together"" declaration is an essential step towards a decarbonized transport system. I applaud the Katowice Partnership for e-mobility and I urge all actors to support it. It provides all actors, including the private sector, with ever more clarity and confidence on the direction of travel. By supporting it, you will contribute to reaching the aims of the Paris Agreement. By supporting it, you will contribute to a sustainable future for the benefit of all.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA259","Bringing Science to Global Climate Talks","January 24, 2019 Thursday 8:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The University of California San Diego campus issued the following news:    - Large delegation of students and researchers from Scripps Oceanography and University of California participate in COP24 climate conference in Poland    By Brittany Hook A saucer-shaped arena set in the heart of Poland's coal country seems like an unlikely place to host a global climate change conference. And yet, for two weeks in December, more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 nations converged in the Silesian capital of Katowice, Poland, to attend the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ). More than twenty students and researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego attended the climate talks, where they gained a nuanced understanding of the intricacies and challenges of climate policy. The team was part of UC Revelle, the observer organization representing the University of California. ""It was so interesting to see how this kind of global policy is created,"" said Kat Montgomery, a Master of Advanced Studies student in the Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. A first-time attendee of the UN talks, Montgomery described her experience in Poland as ""illuminating"" and said she gained a better understanding of the role of non-governmental and research organizations in the UNFCCC process. ""I think the UC's biggest accomplishment at COP24 was being able to give so many current and future scientists a chance to attend a conference like this, where they could learn about and potentially influence global policy,"" said Montgomery. In Katowice, she and other UC delegates observed some of the complex negotiations in which nations hammered out the details of a common rulebook to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. The rulebook defines how nations will enact their climate pledges to keep global temperatures well below an increase of 2 C above pre-industrial levels. It also provides a universal framework for measuring and reporting emissions with greater transparency and supports climate financing to poorer nations, among other things. ""The negotiations were difficult, as many countries were trying to pull in different directions. However, the world came to a midpoint to implement the Paris Agreement,"" said Alfredo Giron, a Scripps Ph.D. student whose research focuses on fishery sustainability in the Gulf of California. ""Being part of the Scripps delegation allowed me to follow up this process very closely and get involved with delegates from different countries and other observer organizations to dig into the details."" In the UFO-shaped Spodek arena, the UC delegates hosted an exhibit that highlighted the ocean's reach on global climate. The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions. One meaningful interaction occurred when Tibetan delegate Zamlha Tempa Gyaltsen stopped by the UC exhibit to drop off a hand-signed letter from His Holiness the Dalai Lama--a well-known champion for climate science with deep connections to UC San Diego. In the letter, His Holiness thanked the COP24 delegates for striving to create a ""better environment for the world so that future generations will be able to live a healthy, happy life."" He also urged humanity to recognize that climate change affects everyone on Earth and that we must take serious action now. UC delegates also led six press conferences and participated in other side-events to communicate the latest scientific research on topics ranging from ocean deoxygenation to geoengineering to the value of deep ocean observation networks, and more. ""The conference is an enlightening experience that comes with a sense of worldly connectedness and inspires nations to collectively work toward changes for the good of humankind,"" said Scripps Ph.D. student Tashiana Osborne, a two-time attendee of the UN climate talks. Osborne said she's still hopeful that nations can work together to address climate change but was concerned to witness ""how slow-moving and challenging it can be for responsible political actions to be taken."" COP24 , she and fellow Scripps Ph.D. students Kara Voss and Meredith Fish held a press conference to discuss the science behind atmospheric rivers and extreme weather patterns linked to climate change. ""It is very important for the world to see students, researchers, and top STEM programs like Scripps invested in global climate change issues,"" said Osborne. ""It's imperative to demonstrate that there are those of us in the United States who remain dedicated to learning about and helping address parts of the climate crisis."" COP24 marked the third UN-led climate talk attended by Osinachi Ajoku, a Scripps Ph.D. student studying climate science. His research focuses on how aerosol particles produced from biomass burning affect climate patterns in Africa. Ajoku said that attending three conference sessions has given him a holistic outlook on how countries address climate change by factors such as culture, location, and economic standing. ""It has also allowed me a unique perspective of how countries in Africa are progressing in climate change relative to the rest of the world since that region is the focus of my research,"" said Ajoku, a Los Angeles native with roots in Nigeria--which he says makes his African research feel more personal. While at COP24 Each panelist underscored the importance of educating the youth about climate change and discussed the increasingly vital role of science communication to inform and inspire communities to tackle the massive problem of climate change on a local level. ""When something's outside of your control, you have to focus on what you can control,"" said Ajoku, responding to an audience member's question about how to garner support in his home country of Mozambique. ""I'm a big believer in ground works, so I think the best thing to do is work on a local level, to bring the community together and teach them about climate change. I think this would actually go a long way."" The University of California has been sending delegations to COP for the past 17 years, and the continued effort has already made noticeable waves. Giron noted that this year, many members of the UC delegation had talks with other delegates who have read a scientific paper on ocean-related Nationally Determined Contributions that was written by Scripps' Natalya Gallo and Lisa Levin, and GPS' David Victor--all former participants in the climate conference and members of the UC delegation. ""Every year, Scripps gains more presence among delegations and brings the spotlight to the oceans,"" said Giron. "" COP24 was an opportunity for me to dig deeper into learning how negotiations work, get to know more delegates, and confirm that I want to be part of such processes from a scientific perspective in the near future."" Montgomery echoed Giron's sentiments on the importance of having UC delegates involved in the annual conference. ""I got to know people on this trip whose research has some amazing real-world applications,"" she said. ""The more chances they have to share it with policymakers, the better off we'll all be.""

(...) Only a transition that challenges systems of exclusion and discrimination, and seeks to improve prosperity and well-being for all, can be considered a truly Just Transition."" This was one of the main messages presented by UNRISD on behalf of the Just Transition Research Collaborative to participants at the UN Climate Conference, COP24 , currently under way in Katowice, Poland. This message is contained in Mapping Just Transition(s) to a Low-Carbon World, the state-of-the-art report on ways to achieve a socially equitable transition away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon development. The report was written by the Just Transition Research Collaborative, which brings together experts from academia and civil society to collectively map and analyse the different understandings and narratives of ""Just Transition"" underpinning the concept's growing popularity and uptake. Challenging the narrow interpretation of Just Transition that seeks to protect a relatively small number of affected workers, the report calls for profound change and an intersectional approach to climate justice. The Collaborative is run jointly by UNRISD and the University of London Institute in Paris, and supported by the Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung. The UNRISD lead of the Just Transition Research Collaborative, Dunja Krause, travelled (by train and bus) to Poland to launch the report at three different events during COP24 , in order to maximize potential uptake. Launching the report at COP24in the presence of governments, United Nations organizations, civil society and the private sectoris an important way of contributing to the science-policy dialogue on Just Transition and supporting policy makers to make better decisions on how to combine the environmental goal of shifting to low-carbon development with social considerations of equity and justice. The research shows that although challenging and complex, Just Transitions are possible through direct engagement with workers, and through government investment in infrastructure and social welfare programmes, among many other initiatives discussed. The findings struck a chord with many present at COP24 , and resonate with the growing recognition of the need not only to respond to climate change but to respond equitably. As UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres told world leaders at the conference, ""Climate action is not just the right thing to doit makes social and economic sense.""

Carper to Wheeler as COP24 Begins: Distorting Climate Science Report Runs Afoul of Commitment You Made to Me","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 8:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The office of Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, issued the following news release: As the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) begins, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), wrote to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to express grave concerns regarding his recent public comments with respect to the Trump Administration's release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA's views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration's response to its own report. ""If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating,"" wrote Senator Carper. ""This isn't an alarmist prediction.

These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying, ""[m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis.""[1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world's leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts - some of which are EPA employees - as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated ""I don't believe it"" when asked about the report, adding that ""we're at the cleanest we've ever been.""[2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that ""We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts."" She also said that ""[I]t's not data-driven"" and that it ""contradicts long established trends.""[3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that ""The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration""...and ""[G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment"" and ""I don't know this for a fact -- I wouldn't be surprised if the Obama administration told the report's authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report.""[4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the 'worst-case' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that, ""analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity"" and ""analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.""[8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. So that I can understand the basis for EPA's views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration's response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019: 1. Copies of all briefing materials prepared for you or other Trump Administration EPA political officials related to the preparation and release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including but not limited to the May 2, 2018 briefing for the Office of Air and Radiation whose invited participants included Bill Wehrum and David Harlow, the May 14, 2018 briefing for the Office of Water whose invited participants included Lee Forsgren and Owen McDonough, and the May 29, 2018 briefing for the Office of Research and Development whose invited participants included Richard Yamada. 2. Copies of all briefing or materials prepared by EPA that were sent to any other entity within the Trump Administration related to the preparation or release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. 3. Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including documents related to the decision to release the report the day after Thanksgiving. 4.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA262","At COP24, climate consensus reigns. But what does that really mean?; For some people, acceptance of climate change comes down to belief. But for the majority of....","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","The Christian Science Monitor","As leaders from around the world gathered in Poland for start of the United Nations' annual climate change conference, the scientific consensus underpinning our understanding of global warming and its\~likely effects through the coming years and decades is a key backdrop. The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 , comes just a couple months after the most recent report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, focusing on the consequences of exceeding 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F.) of warming. And just over a week ago, the US government released Volume 2 of its Fourth National Climate Assessment - a major body of work that involved input from 13 agencies and some 300 scientists, and that outlines impacts, risks, and adaptation in the United States. Both documents represent the most authoritative and comprehensive summary of current climate science. And both paint a picture of an increasingly urgent problem. But just what does consensus mean in a scientific sense? Some scientists worry that the public's misunderstanding of scientific terms like ""consensus,"" ""theory,"" and ""uncertainty"" contributes to many misperceptions, amplifying disagreements and casting unmerited doubt. ""The word 'consensus' is a misleading word, because it is implying there is a negotiation about scientific outcome, and that is absolutely not true,"" says Pavel Kabat, chief scientist and research director for the World Meteorological Association, as he prepares for a discussion at the UN conference hall at the ""Spodek"" (saucer) arena, an iconic landmark of Katowice and one of the most recognized architectural objects in Poland. Science doesn't negotiate, Dr. Kabat notes. Instead, the process that goes into creating something like the IPCC report he thinks can be better understood as a ""synthesis of the state of the knowledge."" When the US government released the latest National Climate Assessment on Nov. 23, a day after Thanksgiving, skeptics jumped on it, claiming it overplayed scientific certainty, relied on imperfect models, or was ""based on the most extreme model scenario,"" as White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders put it. President Trump's response to the report - which is mandated by law - was even more succinct: ""I don't believe it,"" he told reporters a few days after it was released. And this week, even as the world's largest climate forum kicked off, Trump formalized his withdrawal from the international political consensus, making the US the only country at the Group of 20 summit of the world's industrialized economies in Argentina not to sign a joint statement on climate change until a special clause was added reaffirming the US plan to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. But that sort of rhetoric, say scientists, contributes to widespread misunderstanding about just how certain scientists are. ""I think part of people's discomfort with this is that they think it's the same as, you know, 'scientists say coffee is good for you; scientists say coffee is bad for you; scientists say this, scientists say that,' "" says Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University and the lead author of Chapter 2 in the assessment. While there's always something new to learn about complex atmospheric and climate processes, says Dr. Hayhoe, the fundamental principles behind global warming are both basic and well understood. ""That science is so old and so basic that to deny that science, we would have to be denying basic thermodynamics that explains how our refrigerators and our stoves work and basic nonlinear fluid dynamics that explains how airplanes fly,"" she says. ""And there's not a lot of politicians and pundits claiming that airplanes don't fly or that stoves don't heat and refrigerators don't cool."" Getting to consensus Hayhoe and other scientists involved in state-of-the-science reports describe a process that involves hundreds of scientists, multiple reviews, public comments, and total transparency. For the most recent volume of the National Climate Assessment, each of the 29 chapters had lead writers and contributing writers - all experts in their field - who made sure they felt comfortable with everything in the chapter. In addition to comments from all authors and multiple federal agencies, the draft went through extensive public review and review by the National Academy of Sciences. Anyone from the public was invited to download and comment on the draft, and authors had to respond to every single comment on the record. ""How much more transparent can you get?"" asks Hayhoe. Indeed, rather than feeling like they're stretching the boundaries of what scientists feel confident about, or looking at ""most extreme model"" scenarios, many scientists worry that these reports often downplay the risks or are too conservative. Donald Wuebbles, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois who was the lead author of Volume 1 of the latest US climate report, released last year, notes that in some instances authors of that report scaled back proposed statements to accommodate\~the views of more temperate scientists. ""One of the things that happens here is that, because you really want to reach a consensus, these reports tend to be very conservative,"" says Dr. Wuebbles. ""So when we make a strong statement - when we say it's 'very likely,' greater than 95 percent certainty, that something is happening - my God, that pretty much says it's happening."" And, as with ""consensus,"" Wuebbles and others note that the public doesn't necessarily understand what\~""uncertainty"" means in scientific terms.\~In science, it's a quantifiable measurement of data variability, and is always present to some extent. ""We use models all the time for developing cars and airplanes and all kinds of other things on our planet, and those models aren't exact either. They have uncertainties in them,"" says Wuebbles. A 'lively process' Some critics of big reports like those from the IPCC or the national assessments have charged that they end up being a sort of ""groupthink"" process where dissenting voices get filtered out. It's a claim that the scientists most intimately involved push back against strongly. ""It's a very lively process. It's really hard for scientists to agree,"" says Valerie Masson-Delmotte, research director at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, speaking near the IPCC pavilion in Katowice. Dr. Masson-Delmotte has contributed to several IPCC reports, and says she often encounters misperceptions about the process: that scientists vote on the findings, for instance, or that they ""count papers that agree or disagree."" Scientists tend to approach the process with critical minds, she says, and with a lot of discussion about potential knowledge gaps or limits to knowledge. And diversity - of scientific background, and country of origin, and age - can make the process even more robust. ""It makes it better when you don't work in silos,"" says Masson-Delmotte. ""The outcome is much more rigorous when you have more diversity in the chapter teams."" Of course, none of this means that climate science - or any science - is ""settled."" While big reports emphasize what is known, and where scientists agree, most scientists spend the bulk of their time working on what is unknown, and where they don't agree. There are plenty of uncertainties with climate change, particularly when it comes to economic costs, localized effects, or the connection to weather events.\~The big synthesis reports try to make those uncertainties as clear as possible. And each new iteration of these reports adds to and revises previous analyses, as modeling gets stronger and data and observations are added. Looking at the changes in sea level predictions from the first IPCC report to the fifth is one example, says Masson-Delmotte. ""You can see how satellite measurements have changed the way we look at ice sheets."" Satellite observations, she says, showed fast-flowing ice streams that altered scientists' previous ideas. ""Because you have new observations, you understand better the formation of ice,"" she explains. ""It's not yet fully completely understood and modeled, but it changed the way people see ice sheets completely."" Acknowledging mistakes Sometimes, scientists do get things wrong. A\~major paper published in Nature this fall that indicated oceans were warming faster than scientists had believed made news both when it was published, and then when an independent researcher discovered errors in the study that made the conclusions seem more certain than they were. The report's authors acknowledged the errors, apologized, and are working to correct them;\~though they emphasize that they ""do not invalidate the study's methodology."" It was a mistake jumped on by many skeptics, but ""it's very much part of the scientific process,"" notes Wuebbles, adding that outlier results are never enough to change what the state of the science is. Hayhoe also notes that she sees some irony in the fact that, several years ago, she was a co-author on a study that closely examined 38 contrarian papers that disputed anthropogenic warming. ""We found every single one of those studies had an error in them ... that if it was corrected brought their results in line with the scientific consensus,"" says Hayhoe. And yet, she says it was hard to get any interest in study, because people said ""it's not new science."" In some ways, the process of assembling big, state-of-the-science consensus reports is the opposite of what most scientists do in their regular work, trying to generate new knowledge. But scientists say that process of laying out consensus is still critically important, especially for policymakers. The international assessments on stratospheric ozone were a key piece of getting the Montreal Protocol passed in 1987, says Wuebbles, citing an agreement that is widely credited with shifting the tide of ozone depletion. And with something that has become deeply politicized, like climate change, Hayhoe emphasizes that most skeptics don't try to refute accepted facts so much as sow disinformation about the level of uncertainty. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA263","UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE MAKES LITTLE PROGRESS","February 14, 2019 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Heartland Institute: By Bonner R. Cohen COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended after two weeks of negotiations with very little to show for the efforts of the thousands of participants. The 24th meeting of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended after two weeks of negotiations with very little to show for the efforts of the thousands of participants. Unprecedented Rejection COP24 got off to a rough beginning, with delegates failing to adopt the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) October 2018 special report describing the purported pending dangers from human-caused climate change. The 2015 Paris climate agreement was predicated on the IPCC's previous report's claims global greenhouse gas emissions would have to be reduced 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050, to keep global temperatures from approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, in order to prevent a variety of disastrous consequences. IPCC's most recent report, however, claimed those cuts would be too little, too late, instead arguing the world must reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2030 and emissions of greenhouse gases must be net-zero by 2050 in order to hit the temperature targets. Historically, each new IPCC report has been ""welcomed"" at the COP meeting following its release, indicating the countries participating in the climate negotiations accepted the report as establishing the scientific background for negotiations. At COP24 , however, Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States objected to the word ""welcoming,"" offering instead to ""take note"" of the report. Other countries objected to this proposal because it would not specifically endorse IPCC's findings. Because COP meetings operate on consensus, the lack of agreement meant all references to the report in the UNFCCC's rules and negotiations document had to be dropped, a first for a COP meeting. Big Failures After marathon negotiations, representatives from nearly 200 countries who had gathered in Katowice, Poland from December 2 through December 14 failed to provide any additional commitments of funding for developing countries to adapt to climate change and could not tighten the required greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond what was agreed to in Paris in 2015, despite IPCC's special report saying greater cuts are necessary to avoid environmental disasters. Putting another damper on the proceedings, reports released shortly before the meetings showed greenhouse gas emissions had grown substantially over the past three years, proving governments were failing to reach the emission reduction commitments they made in the 2015 agreement. In addition, Brazil's newly elected President, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew his country's invitation to host COP25 and said he would follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead and withdraw Brazil from the 2015 Paris climate treaty. The only concrete accomplishment delegates to COP24 could claim was adoption of a 156-page ""rule book"" outlining agreed-upon methods for tracking and counting carbon dioxide emissions. Like the emission reduction commitments in the 2015 agreement, the rule book's accounting mechanisms are nonbinding. COP25 is scheduled to take place in Chile in late 2019. 'Entirely About Redistributing Wealth' The UN's climate agenda is about controlling the economy and directing resources to favored people, not about saving the Earth from runaway warming, says Jay Lehr, Ph.D., science director at The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment and Climate News. ""The world is beginning to wake up to the fact these COP meetings have almost nothing to do with protecting the environment or preventing climate change,"" said Lehr. ""The meetings are entirely about redistributing wealth from developed countries to elites in less-developed nations and ensuring socialism is the order of the day. ""If the UN successfully eliminates fossil fuels, the predictable consequence will be the poor around the world will remain poor, because they will be denied access to affordable and reliable energy,"" Lehr said. Weeks of fuel riots in France and the removal of various political leaders over their climate stances show a widening gap between governing elites and ordinary citizens, says Craig Rucker, president of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), who attended the UN conference in Poland. ""From France's 'yellow vests' to Poland's coal miners, to leaders being replaced in Australia, Ontario, and Brazil, a growing number of people are no longer willing to meekly accept what is handed down to them from on high,"" Rucker said. ""The resistance is visceral, and it's not going away,"" Rucker said. Bonner R. Cohen, Ph.D. ( mailto:bcohen@nationalcenter.org ) is a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research and a senior policy analyst with CFACT. \"

Greenpeace activists projected a message onto the roof of the ""Spodek"" arena where the COP24 is being held, saying ""No Hope Without Climate Action: and ""Politicians Talk, Leaders Act."" Disappointing many of the scientists and delegates at the conference, the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait refused to endorse a landmark study on global warming which was to be the benchmark for future action in curbing the global warming. The four nations wanted only to ""note"" but not ""welcome"" the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that was released in October, in keeping with the views of the Trump administration. With no consensus on including the report, the idea was dropped. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has announced he is pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, tweeted Saturday that ""people do not want to pay large sums of money ... in order to maybe protect the environment.'' The IPCC' report said that drastic actions would be needed to achieve the Paris accord's most ambitious target of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report warned that the world was far from that target and heading more towards an increase of 3 degrees Celsius. On Monday, the environmental ministers arrive at COP24 and many delegates hope that they will make every effort to include the IPCC report in the conference agenda. VOA News \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA265","An Efficient Global Carbon Market Essential","December 27, 2018 Thursday 8:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association issued the following news release: As nations consider the agreement around the 'rule book' for global emissions reductions reached at COP24 earlier this month and the latest Emissions Projection 2018 report finds a reduced domestic emissions reduction task compared to previous reports, the need for emission reduction policies that reduce emissions at least cost remains vital. APPEA Chief Executive Dr Malcolm Roberts said: ""Among these important policy design issues are the rules for international trade in emissions permits/credits. The finalisation of these rules was deferred at COP24 for further work in 2019 ahead of final agreement at COP25. ""Access to deep, liquid and efficient international markets will be important to achieve least cost emissions abatement for many nations, including Australia. The oil and gas industry looks forward to negotiators arriving at effective outcomes during the year and that rules to underpin international trade are finalised by the end of 2019,"" Dr Roberts said. ""In addition, carry-over of emission reductions from the first and second Kyoto commitment periods to Australia's 2030 emission reduction commitments has reduced Australia's abatement challenge. Such an approach has been used by all Australian Governments since 2008 and was reaffirmed at COP24 . ""Australia's LNG projects will deliver decades of economic growth, jobs and exports, as well as strong regional and global environmental benefits. ""While the projections show the production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for export also results in greenhouse gas emissions, a conservative estimate released by the government earlier in December found Australia's LNG exports have the potential to save importing countries 130 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year. ""When used instead of other traditional fuels, LNG cuts emissions by half in many cases. LNG also helps developing countries to reduce air pollution, a major cause of millions of premature deaths."" This is a key reason Australia's second largest LNG market, China, has a range of policies to increase its use of gas. Natural gas consumption in China, including from Australian LNG imports, has risen sharply as a result of strengthened action against air pollution. Together, the various policies could see natural gas consumption increase by 112 billion cubic metres (bcm) over 2016-2020[1]. 112 bcm represents more than Australia's expected LNG to exports to China in 2020 and highlights the way in which Australia's LNG is reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and helping developing countries to reduce air pollution.

The Trump administration released new pollution rules that replace the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan with a new agenda that caters to the fossil fuel industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Trump administration's proposed regulations would increase carbon emissions, leading up to an estimated 1,400 premature deaths each year.

""Our new partnership with UN Climate Change will help build awareness and strengthen climate change leadership by engaging governments, civil society and business leaders to boost climate action at both regional and national levels,"" he added. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said: ""I am pleased that our institutions are strengthening the collaboration to address the challenges of climate change. This partnership offers a valuable platform to support efforts by Parties to raising awareness, policy coherence as well as increasing capacities on climate action. The impacts of climate change are not bound by national borders, they have far-reaching effects across countries and regions. A cooperative regional response to the climate challenge is consistent with the transformation required to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals."" ESCAP's partnership with UN Climate Change will build on existing initiatives, and identify joint projects that strengthen leadership, enhance capacity, and promote collaboration of public and private sectors to implement country-driven mitigation and adaptation activities.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA272","Utilities Embracing Emerging Technologies Can Reduce Customer Costs and Support a Cleaner, More Flexible Grid, New Report Says","December 12, 2018 Wednesday 6:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Rocky Mountain Institute issued the following news release: Electric utilities increasingly can reduce their system infrastructure investments and save customers money by employing non-wires solutions (NWS) --portfolios of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar photovoltaics, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response--to cost-effectively meet growing grid needs, according to a report released today by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). In addition to providing customer savings while safeguarding reliable service, NWS can support the integration of smart, customer-centered technologies that promote a cleaner, more flexible and resilient grid, the report, The Non-Wires Solutions Implementation Playbook: A Practical Guide for Regulators, Utilities, and Developers, explains. The Playbook identifies the key barriers that have inhibited more widespread NWS deployment and provides recommendations to overcome them. These recommendations focus on three themes: establishing more supportive regulatory environments, integrating NWS within a utility's standard operating procedures and adapting current utility procurement practices to effectively support NWS sourcing. For the past decade, regulated utilities have spent an average of $55 billion annually upgrading their distribution, transmission and generation infrastructure to meet customer needs. The largest share of this investment has been in distribution infrastructure to maintain and modernize the last-mile networks that deliver energy to homes and businesses. Using the Playbook, grid planners can improve on this approach to infrastructure investment by more systematically evaluating opportunities to deploy modular--and often lower-cost--NWS portfolios. Doing so reduces the risk that infrastructure investments based on uncertain forecasts may burden ratepayers with higher electricity bills for years to come if demand growth doesn't materialize, and provides a time-value-of-money benefit since investments can be delayed until needs are realized. ""Utilities are facing new challenges to support the health of a grid that is aging, alongside new customer demands for energy choice and cleaner energy,"" Jeff Waller, a principal at RMI and one of the report's authors, said. ""The proliferation of DERs and the growing ability and confidence of grid planners to integrate them into grid operations promises to lower customer costs, cut emissions and diversify the service offerings utilities can offer their customers. We hope our Playbook can be a valuable resource to speed the delivery of these benefits through the deployment of NWS."" The Playbook also includes practical NWS implementation guidelines to help utilities operationalize NWS programs. These implementation guidelines cover four central elements that are at the heart of a successful utility NWS program: criteria to identify potential non-wires solution projects, competitive RFP processes that lead to meaningful responses, evaluation frameworks to help utilities determine if NWS projects are viable and competitive and a discussion of key contract terms that are specific to non-wires solution projects. ""We have found that with a supportive regulator and our willingness to innovate and rely on the private sector, we can deploy non-wire solutions to benefit our customers and the environment,"" Damian Sciano, a director in Distribution Planning for Con Edison, the energy company that serves New York City, said. ""RMI's research shows that if our industry, policy makers and other stakeholders work together, we can unlock the potential of clean energy solutions like solar, battery storage, energy efficiency and combined heat and power."" The report was released today at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), in Katowice, Poland. RMI consulted with members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 17 governors, in drafting this report, which will inform the Alliance's efforts to advance interstate policy solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and grow the economy. The report's release at COP24 comes alongside the participation of governor's policy advisers from California, Washington, Hawaii and Maryland at COP24 in a series of climate meetings with international counterparts to discuss collaboration on climate solutions. The U.S. Climate Alliance unveiled plans for the Impact Partnership at COP24 , which provides technical, analytical and other support to the alliance from civil society.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA274","UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE IN KATOWICE - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS","December 3, 2018 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Union: 1. What will happen at COP24 ? This year's annual conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be a crucial moment for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, as Parties are aiming to finalise a detailed set of rules and guidelines - the so-called Paris 'work programme' or 'rule book' - which will enable the landmark accord to be put into practice all around the world. The conference, will take place from 2-14 December in Katowice, Poland, and will be presided over by the Government of Poland. It is officially the UNFCCC's 24th Conference of the Parties which is where it gets its name ' COP24 ' from; the Kyoto Protocol's 14th Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 14) and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1.3). The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. 195 UNFCCC Parties have signed the Agreement and 184 have now ratified it. 2. What are the EU's expectations for COP24 ? In December 2015, Parties to the Paris Agreement agreed to finalise a detailed set of rules and guidelines - a 'work programme' or 'rulebook' - for implementing the accord by the end of 2018. Adopting a clear and comprehensive work programme consistent with what was agreed in Paris is necessary for putting the Agreement into practice. It will enable and encourage climate action at all levels worldwide and will demonstrate the global commitment to ambition. Adopting a strong Paris work programme, with clear provisions on all key issues including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation, is the EU's top priority for COP24 . The outcome must preserve the spirit of the Paris Agreement, be applicable to all Parties, take into account different national circumstances and reflect the highest possible ambition over time. Clear rules and guidelines will also serve Parties' own policy-making, by providing a robust underpinning for policies and reflection on enhancing ambition over time. In the build-up to the conference, EU Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete has conducted extensive outreach with global counterparts in order to ensure a successful outcome in Katowice. This includes the second Ministerial on Climate Action in Brussels co-hosted with counterparts from China and Canada, the Global Climate Action Summit in California, and a recent visit to Beijing where climate priorities were discussed with Chinese authorities. Additionally, the EU has also undertaken wide outreach at officials level with a view to moving towards landing zones on the key political issues related to the Paris rulebook. Party groupings reached out to include progressive developed and developing countries, the G77 and major economies including South Africa. The political phase of the Talanoa dialogue should send a strong message to the world, in support of the implementation of the Paris Agreement to spur momentum for action. The EU expects all Parties to share evidence of their action and progress on their nationally determined contribution (NDC), as part of a collective global conversation on how to enhance ambition. Ahead of COP24 Alongside the formal negotiations, COP24 will have a strong focus on keeping up the political momentum for continued climate action by a wide range of stakeholders before 2020. It will provide a space for all relevant stakeholders to showcase their action, share information, foster new cooperation and raise awareness on climate change and the solutions available. The EU has a rich programme of side events at COP24 it will host more than 100 events over the two weeks, at the EU Pavilion in the conference centre. 3. What is the EU doing to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions? The EU's NDC for Paris is to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. This target is part of a wider EU climate and energy framework for 2030 and builds on the 2020 target to cut emissions by 20%, which the EU is well on course to exceed. The EU has worked intensely to establish an economy-wide framework of legislation and initiatives that will allow the bloc to meet its 2030 target and drive the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society. All key legislation for 2030 has already been adopted, including a modernisation of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and new energy efficiency and renewable energy targets to ensure the power sector and energy-intensive industries deliver the necessary emissions cuts, and new 2030 targets for all Member States to reduce emissions in non-ETS sectors including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. New legislation will also ensure that emissions from land use and forestry will be balanced out by removals. Ambitious proposals to reduce EU road transport emissions are also on the table and still being negotiated by member states and the European Parliament. Fully implemented these measures could lead to an EU GHG emissions reduction of around 45% in 2030. However, EU ambition and vision goes far beyond 2030. In March this year, following a similar request from the European Parliament, EU leaders called on the Commission to present a proposal for a strategy for long-term EU GHG emissions reduction, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Following broad stakeholder consultation and taking into account the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5C, the Commission this week presented a strategic vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral EU economy in 2050. It is an ambitious vision in line with the Paris Agreement goals providing sustainable growth and jobs and improving the quality of life of all EU citizens. The strategic vision will be followed by a broad debate among EU decision-makers and all stakeholders, which should allow the EU to adopt a long-term strategy and submit it to the UNFCCC by 2020, as requested under the Paris Agreement. The Commission will present its strategic vision to all global partners at COP24 , hoping it can inspire others to prepare their own long-term strategies. 4. How does the Paris Agreement ensure countries deliver on their commitments? In 2015, countries agreed to set up an enhanced transparency framework for action and support to build mutual trust and confidence and to promote effective implementation of the Paris commitments. The key task is to make this framework a reality by adopting a strong set of detailed rules. The enhanced transparency framework will help not only the understanding of progress made individually by Parties in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions, but is also critical for providing robust data to support the global stocktakes and assess the progress towards the long-term goals. Solid multilateral transparency and accountability guidelines would help countries to design good policies at home. They should provide an incentive to build and maintain domestic institutions, data collection and tracking systems that policymakers need to make the right decisions. The transparency, accountability and compliance system under the Paris Agreement is not punitive, but it is meant to identify when Parties are off track and help them to get back on track if they are not delivering. Underpinning this system are new and comprehensive requirements and procedures applicable to all Parties to track and facilitate their performance. These include technical expert reviews, a multilateral peer review process, and a standing committee on implementation and compliance. Together, these will maintain a focus on both technical and political aspects of performance. 5. What does the Paris Agreement mean for the EU's contribution to climate finance for developing countries before 2020? At the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries collectively committed to contribute USD 100 billion of climate finance per year by 2020, from both public and private sources, for meaningful mitigation action and transparency of implementation. In Paris in 2015, the EU and other developed countries committed to continue to provide financial resources to help developing countries tackle climate change. Together, the EU, its Member States and the European Investment Bank are the biggest donor of climate finance to developing countries. We have progressively raised our contribution in recent years, providing EUR 20.4 billion in 2017 alone. The EU is delivering its fair share of the overall USD 100 billion commitment. The Paris Agreement called for a ""concrete roadmap"" to achieve the USD 100 billion goal, with a Climate Finance Roadmap prepared by the donor community in 2016 indicating that they are on track to meet the ambitious goal. 6. How does the Paris Agreement address adaptation and loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change? The Paris Agreement put adaptation on an equal footing with mitigation and established the first global goal on adaptation, namely to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. The global stocktake will review the overall progress towards this goal. Adaptation is a key element of EU policy and planning. National, regional and local adaptation strategies are gaining ground since the adoption of the EU Adaptation Strategy in 2013. Today, 25 Member States have a strategy or plan and over 1,500 cities and municipalities have committed to developing one, in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. The Commission published an evaluation of the Adaptation Strategy earlier this month - highlighting successes achieved and actions needed to further reduce Europe's vulnerability to climate impacts. The evaluation also concluded that adapting EU regions and economic sectors to the impacts of climate change is now more urgent than forecast when the strategy was adopted in 2013. In addition, the EU is highly committed to supporting partner countries to take climate action, including adaptation efforts. The percentage of EU climate finance targeted at adaptation is increasing, with particular focus on action in the most vulnerable countries. In 2017, roughly 50% of climate finance from the EU budget (excludes Member State funds) was dedicated to adaptation projects. The Paris Agreement recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with climate change, including extreme weather events, such as floods, landslides, storms and forest fires, and slow onset events such as the loss of fresh water aquifers and glaciers. These concerns were addressed when the Paris Agreement was adopted by giving the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage the role of promoting cooperation on these issues. This includes further work on emergency response and insurance issues and a task force to develop recommendations on approaches to address displacement due to climate change, which delivered comprehensive recommendations on the subject. 7. What is the role for business and other non-state actors and how can the Global Climate Action Agenda be strengthened? The Paris Agreement recognises the key role of businesses, local governments, cities and other organisations in the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient world. The private sector will ultimately need to bring about the economic transformation, turning challenges into business opportunities. The sharing of experience from the private sector side, on the conditions to achieve sustainability in practice, is therefore extremely valuable. Actions showcased through the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA) - also known as the Marrakesh Partnership on Global Climate Action - are helping to build on the growing momentum. The GCAA has the potential to deliver transformative impacts on the ground, enhance ambition pre-2020 and contribute to implementing national climate plans and the long-term Paris goals. While measuring the impact and identifying what is additional to national climate pledges remains difficult, data indicates that the aggregated impact of the initiatives is in the order of a few gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2030 beyond the current NDCs - a potentially significant contribution to closing the gap (UNEP Gap Report 2016). The EU and its Member States have been proactive in promoting and sponsoring specific GCAA initiatives. Flagship initiatives include the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and Mission Innovation. COP24 will be excellent opportunities to reflect on progress made under existing initiatives, as well as for announcements on new transformative initiatives.

The guide highlights the crucial role of scaling up climate action by integrating human settlements into national adaptation planning and processes. As over two-thirds of the global population becomes urban by 2050, it will be faced with risks from a range of potential impacts of climate change including rise in sea levels, extreme variations in climate, and other related disasters. Urgent action is required to address the inter-connected issues of poverty, governance, and climate vulnerability both in cities and at the national level. Robust and comprehensive National Adaptation Plans (NAP) are important tools in delivering the adaptation needs and priorities of nations as detailed in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Cities are a critical location to achieve these NDC targets as 113 countries have urban priorities in their NDCs, much of it focusing on adaptation. The NDC Partnership, UNDP and UN-Habitat convened participants from local and national governments and the climate finance community to discuss opportunities for connecting local climate adaptation action with national policy and planning [ HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/2BhhznJ https://bit.ly/2BhhznJ Climate Change Adaptation takes top-priority both at national level and local levels. The Mayor of Quelimane, Mozambique Manuel Araujo explains that ""city leaders are dealing with climate change daily and we need to engage with partners at national and regional levels, as well as other cities dealing with the same issues like us."" The City of Quelimane has developed a local adaptation plan which is being integrated into the National Adaptation Plan. It has thus contributed positively to national efforts along with other cities, the National Association of Municipalities of Mozambique (ANAMM) and international partners. Integrating human settlements and key stakeholders of the national urban development community into national adaptation planning will strengthen National Adaptation Plans and processes, enhance climate action and promote the process of building resilient nations. This integration requires close cooperation and coordination between national, sub-regional and local governments as well as key private sector and civic society actors.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA278","SOLAR IMPULSE CHAIR BERTRAND PICCARD TO ADDRESS NBAA-BACE","July 17, 2018 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA): The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is pleased to announce that Solar Impulse Project Chair Bertrand Piccard will be among the speakers at the Day 1 Keynote at this years NBAA Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), which takes place Oct. 16-18 in Orlando, FL. Piccard is an internationally recognized aviation innovator who piloted Solar Impulse 2, the first airplane to fly around the world without a drop of fuel. He also recently launched the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, whose goal is selecting 1,000 solutions that would protect the environment in a profitable way. These solutions are to be offered to world decision makers at COP24 ; the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ), which is scheduled for Dec. 3-14 in Katowice, Slaskie, Poland. The World Alliance also hopes to encourage these leaders to adopt more ambitious environmental targets and energy policies. Bertrand Piccard pushes the boundaries of the possible with his pioneering spirit, said Chris Strong, NBAA senior vice president of conventions and membership. That pioneering spirit is among the hallmarks of the business aviation industry, and we know convention attendees will be inspired by his personal story and perspectives about what is possible in aviation and beyond. The Solar Impulse project was created to demonstrate the abilities of renewable energies and promote energy savings. The Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and economy, bringing together protection of the environment and financial viability to show that these solutions are not expensive fixes to problems, but rather opportunities for clean economic growth. The Solar Impulse 2 solar-powered aircraft departed from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, traversed Asia, then completed its longest leg from Japan to Hawaii. On that leg, the aircrafts batteries sustained substantial damage that required repair, but the flight eventually continued from Hawaii to California, across the U.S., over the Atlantic Ocean to Spain and back to its starting point in Abu Dhabi. Solar Impulse 2 completed its 26,000-mile round-the-world mission without using a drop of fuel in July 2016. Piccard was a speaker at the opening session for the 2017 edition of the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (EBACE). NBAA-BACE is business aviations most important annual event, where participants have an unequaled opportunity to view the latest business aircraft, products, technology, and services the industry offers. Held this year at the Orange County Convention Center and Orlando Executive Airport, the event also offers a premier networking venue and dozens of educational sessions. Learn more about NBAA-BACE. # # # Founded in 1947 and based in Washington, DC, the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is the leading organization for companies that rely on general aviation aircraft to help make their businesses more efficient, productive and successful. The association represents more than 11,000 companies and provides more than 100 products and services to the business aviation community, including the NBAA Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition, the world's largest civil aviation trade show. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA279","COLLEGE MEETING","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Commission: Commission discusses Italy's fiscal measures, Brexit, Poland and reports on EU Visa policy and EU-U.S. privacy shield Italy's draft budget plan The European Commission has today sent a letter to the Italian government regarding the fiscal measures set out by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Finance Minister Giovanni Tria in their letter of 18 December. On 21 November, the Commission adopted an Opinion on the revised draft budgetary plan of Italy, confirming a ""particularly serious non-compliance"" with the recommendation made by the Council of the European Union to Italy on 13 July. This was followed by a report under Article 126(3) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, concluding that an Excessive Deficit Procedure for non-compliance with the debt criterion was warranted. This conclusion was shared by the Eurogroup of 3 December, which also supported the ongoing dialogue between the Commission and the Italian authorities. Today's letter takes note of the new fiscal measures presented by the Italian government and indicates that if they are voted by the Italian parliament before the end of the year, this would allow the European Commission not to recommend the opening of an Excessive Deficit Procedure at this stage Visa liberalisation The Commission reported on its assessment of the fulfilment of the visa liberalisation benchmarks by the Western Balkan countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia as well as the Eastern Partnership countries: Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. This annual report shows that the visa liberalisation requirements for the concerned countries continue to be met but that action in some cases immediate is required for a number of countries in specific areas to ensure this continues to be the case. Visa non-reciprocity The Commission reported on progress made in the past 12 months towards achieving visa-reciprocity with the United States, as the only remaining case of non-reciprocity. Visa reciprocity is a fundamental principle of the European Union's common visa policy, and the Commission remains fully committed to achieving visa free travel to the United States for all EU Member States as a matter of priority. To this end, the Commission will continue to engage with the United States, in coordination with the five Member States whose citizens still need a visa to travel to the United States, in a result-oriented process. EU-U.S. Privacy Shield The Commission published its report on the second annual review of the functioning of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. This year's report shows that the U.S. continues to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred under the Privacy Shield from the EU to participating companies in the U.S. The steps taken by the U.S. authorities to implement the recommendations made by the Commission in last year's report have improved the functioning of the framework. However, the Commission does expect the US authorities to nominate a permanent Ombudsperson by 28 February 2019 to replace the one that is currently acting. The Ombudsperson is an important mechanism that ensures complaints concerning access to personal data by U.S. authorities are addressed. Poland First Vice-President Frans Timmermans debriefed the College on the infringement cases launched by the Commission against Poland, in particular following the Court order issued by the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice two days ago. Poland has until 17 January to report to the European Commission what measures it has taken in order to comply with the order. In the meantime the Commission will analyse the new law adopted by Poland to comply with the order and monitor its implementation. The First Vice-President also addressed the disciplinary measures taken against some judges who had referred preliminary rulings to the European Court of justice. He has also informed his colleagues of the outcome of the third hearing of Poland in the framework of Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union, which took place at the General Affairs Council on 11 December. United Nations Climate Change conference Vice-President Maros ef\'c4ovi\'c4 and Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete debriefed the College on the outcome of the United Nations Climate Change conference , in Katowice and Michel Barnier, the European Commission Chief Negotiator for Article 50 negotiations, presented to Commissioners the current situation in the United Kingdom. Brexit Given the continued uncertainty in the UK surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, as agreed between the EU and the UK on 25 November 2018 and as announced by President Juncker following last week's call by the European Council (Article 50) to intensify preparedness work at all levels and for all outcomes the European Commission has today started implementing its ""no-deal"" Contingency Action Plan. This delivers on the Commission's commitment to adopt all necessary ""no-deal"" proposals by the end of the year, as outlined in its second preparedness Communication of 13 November 2018. Today's package includes 14 measures in a limited number of areas where a ""no-deal"" scenario would create major disruption for citizens and businesses in the EU27. These areas include financial services, air transport, customs, and climate policy, amongst others. The Commission considers it is essential and urgent to adopt these measures today to ensure that the necessary contingency measures can enter into application on 30 March 2019 in order to limit the most significant damage caused by a ""no-deal"" scenario in these areas. Senior Management appointments The European Commission has today decided to appoint Mr Klaus-Dieter Borchardt to the position of Deputy Director-General in its department for Energy (DG ENER) and Mr Klaus Wiedner to the position of Director ""Financial system surveillance and crisis management"" in its department for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (DG FISMA). Mr Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, a German national, has extensive management experience in the Commission, notably in the areas of energy and agriculture. He joined the Commission in 1987. Between 1990 and 1995 he worked in the Court of Justice of the European Union before coming back to the Commission's Legal Service. He has been on management jobs since 2001, when he became a Head of Unit in the Commission's department for agriculture (DG AGRI) to deal with agricultural law. Between 2004 and 2010, Mr Borchardt worked in the private office of Commissioner Fischer Boel responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development. He has been working as a Director since 2010, first in DG AGRI and, as of 2013, in DG ENER. Mr Wiedner, an Austrian national, joined the Commission from the Austrian civil service in 1996 to consecutively work in the areas of competition and internal market. He took up his first Head of Unit job in 2009 and has held middle management positions since then. Mr Wiedner is currently a Head of Unit of DG FISMA's Bank Regulation and Supervision team. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA280","In New Era of Global Climate Action, Kortni Wroten Takes Charge","March 19, 2019 Tuesday 7:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Clark University issued the following news:    - Graduate student makes waves at UN climate summit    Kortni Wroten isn't one to sit back and just watch things happen. She's on a crusade to stop climate change. Wroten knows the solution lies in leveraging the collective power of grassroots, local initiatives. ""If you have something that bothers you, spark a conversation,"" she says. ""Don't be afraid to use your voice -- it's one of your most powerful tools to effect change."" The dual MBA and M.S. in environmental science and policy student made her voice heard at the COP24 As Clark University's first-ever student delegate, Wroten immersed herself in international climate policy alongside the world's leading activists, researchers, and experts. The two-week long event held in Katowice, Poland, focused on the creation of guidelines to combat the impacts of climate change, including negotiations on the rules to govern the 2015 Paris Agreement. Although President Trump announced his intentions to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement in 2020, Wroten and other American delegates moved forward on non-federal climate action. Wroten is taking a stand, with or without the administration, to promote climate change mitigation efforts. ""The environment is our future, and does not have a voice to represent itself,"" she says. ""I strive to be that voice for the planet and stand up for what is right."" Even when Wroten experienced frustrations with the slow pace of negotiations, she found inspiration in the climate protests occurring outside of the COP24 venue. ""After experiencing the protests and the moving words of my fellow advocates, I learned that if we want this to be a movement, we need it to be inclusive, honest, and transparent."" The passion and political inertia demonstrated at COP24 imbued Wroten with renewed hope for the future of climate action. She was encouraged to learn from other individuals, businesses, and cities that are moving forward with their solutions to combat climate change. ""It's so emboldening to see environmental advocates pushing for more progress instead of settling for the status quo,"" Wroten says. ""Young people everywhere are not taking it sitting down -- we are fighting for a better world and a better system."" The opportunity to participate in COP24 arose out of a directed study course, International Climate Negotiation, which focused on international policy and progress. The multi-institution course was co-taught by Elisabeth Gilmore, associate professor in Clark's International Development, Community and Environment (IDCE) Department, and Gillian Bowser, a natural resources professor at Colorado State University. During her presentation at a U.N. official side event, ""Students and Youth Researching and Advocating for Climate Action, Equity, and Global Justice,"" Wroten explored youth perspectives on agriculture and food justice. She discussed Worcester's local youth-led food initiatives, including Clark's student-run Local Root program and the city's Regional Environmental Council YouthGrow program. Both initiatives address local food justice issues and empower youth through community and climate action. In addition, Wroten presented at a U.N. Pavilion event, ""Food for our Future,"" where she tied in Worcester's initiatives to the efforts of the recent IPCC 1.5 Special Report. ""I focused on elevating the efforts of my peers and the neighborhood to raise awareness and recognition -- but also to inspire others that local, small-scale change is actually quite impactful,"" she says. Wroten's call-to-action rang loud and clear. After the event, she was approached by two students from the Netherlands who asked for insight and advice for launching their own urban agriculture initiatives. ""It was so rewarding to see that our initiatives here in Worcester were able to inspire change internationally,"" Wroten says. She credits the experiential structure of her graduate program to her success at COP24 . ""This degree program highlights a focus on pragmatic solutions while incorporating important sociological elements of the climate change phenomenon,"" she says. ""I am garnering the real-world experience necessary to expand my skill set and strengthen my resume, so that I will be comfortable with this type of work when I graduate."" Wroten returned to Worcester more inspired and determined to focus her efforts on environmental planning and sustainable development. ""Attending the COP showed me the promise of technology being developed to mitigate and adapt to climate change,"" she says. Wroten plans to work further on issues of advocacy and community organizing. ""I would like to focus my efforts on adaptation in the wake of oncoming climate disasters, particularly for vulnerable communities,"" she says. ""If you see something that you wish was better, you have the power to make that change yourself. That change may seem insignificant, but it has more power than you know,"" she says. ""If you wish something were being done in your city or on campus, start an initiative. If you are unsatisfied with politicians, run for office."" If there's one thing Wroten wants known, it's that an individual voice can change the world, and it's time for yours to be heard. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6656667 MSTRUCK \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA281","UN Climate Conference Makes Little Progress","February 14, 2019 Thursday","Heartland Institute","The 24th meeting of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended after two weeks of negotiations with very little to show for the efforts of the thousands of participants. Unprecedented Rejection COP24 got off to a rough beginning, with delegates failing to adopt the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) October 2018 special report describing the purported pending dangers from human-caused climate change. The 2015 Paris climate agreement was predicated on the IPCC's previous report's claims global greenhouse gas emissions would have to be reduced 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050, to keep global temperatures from approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, in order to prevent a variety of disastrous consequences. IPCC's most recent report, however, claimed those cuts would be too little, too late, instead arguing the world must reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2030 and emissions of greenhouse gases must be net-zero by 2050 in order to hit the temperature targets. Historically, each new IPCC report has been ""welcomed"" at the COP meeting following its release, indicating the countries participating in the climate negotiations accepted the report as establishing the scientific background for negotiations. At COP24 , however, Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States objected to the word ""welcoming,"" offering instead to \~""take note"" of the report. Other countries objected to this proposal because it would not specifically endorse IPCC's findings. Because COP meetings operate on consensus, the lack of agreement meant all references to the report in the UNFCCC's rules and negotiations document had to be dropped, a first for a COP meeting. Big Failures After marathon negotiations, representatives from nearly 200 countries who had gathered in Katowice, Poland from December 2 through December 14 failed to provide any additional commitments of funding for developing countries to adapt to climate change and could not tighten the required greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond what was agreed to in Paris in 2015, despite IPCC's special report saying greater cuts are necessary to avoid environmental disasters. Putting another damper on the proceedings, reports released shortly before the meetings showed greenhouse gas emissions had grown substantially over the past three years, proving governments were failing to reach the emission reduction commitments they made in the 2015 agreement. In addition, Brazil's newly elected President, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew his country's invitation to host COP25 and said he would follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead and withdraw Brazil from the 2015 Paris climate treaty. The only concrete accomplishment delegates to COP24 could claim was adoption of a 156-page ""rule book"" outlining agreed-upon methods for tracking and counting carbon dioxide emissions. Like the emission reduction commitments in the 2015 agreement, the rule book's accounting mechanisms are nonbinding. COP25 is scheduled to take place in Chile in late 2019. 'Entirely About Redistributing Wealth' The UN's climate agenda is about controlling the economy and directing resources to favored people, not about saving the Earth from runaway warming, says Jay Lehr, Ph.D., science director at The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment & Climate News. ""The world is beginning to wake up to the fact these COP meetings have almost nothing to do with protecting the environment or preventing climate change,"" said Lehr. ""The meetings are entirely about redistributing wealth from developed countries to elites in less-developed nations and ensuring socialism is the order of the day. ""If the UN successfully eliminates fossil fuels, the predictable consequence will be the poor around the world will remain poor, because they will be denied access to affordable and reliable energy,"" Lehr said. Weeks of fuel riots in France and the removal of various political leaders over their climate stances show a widening gap between governing elites and ordinary citizens, says Craig Rucker, president of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), who attended the UN conference in Poland. ""From France's 'yellow vests' to Poland's coal miners, to leaders being replaced in Australia, Ontario, and Brazil, a growing number of people are no longer willing to meekly accept what is handed down to them from on high,"" Rucker said. ""The resistance is visceral, and it's not going away,"" Rucker said. Bonner R. Cohen, Ph.D. ( mailto:bcohen@nationalcenter.org ) is a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research and a senior policy analyst with CFACT. \"

The Season of Creation began as an initiative from the Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios in 1989. It has since been endorsed and recommended to the Anglican Communion by the Anglican Consultative Council; and by Pope Francis for the Roman Catholic Church. It runs from the World Day of Prayer for Creation on 1 September to the feast of St Francis of Assisi on 4 October. For the past few years, the Anglican Communion Environmental Network as teamed up with the Global Catholic Climate Movement and other agencies to provide a range of resources to help Christians around the world make the most of the season. This year\' s theme,  Walking Together has inspired the first Ecumenical Care for Creation event in the Italian town of Assisi. On the afternoon of Friday 31 August, Christians will gather in Assisi\' s Vescovado Plaza, where Saint Francis publicly renounced his father\' s wealth, for the start of two-days of prayer. Between 5 pm on 31 August and 11 am on Saturday 1 September, prayer will take place there, at the Room of Reunification, the Chapel of Saint Damian in the Basilica of Saint Clare, and at the Upper Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi. In a message inviting churches to participate in this year\' s Season of Creation, organisers said:  As the environmental crisis deepens, we Christians are urgently called to witness to our faith by taking bold action to preserve the gift we share.  During the Season of Creation, we ask ourselves: Do our actions honour the Lord as Creator? Are there ways to deepen our faith by protecting \' the least of these\' , who are most vulnerable to the consequences of environmental degradation?  During this season, we walk together towards greater stewardship of our place in creation. At the conclusion of the events in Assisi, a group of pilgrims will begin a pilgrimage to Katowice, the venue for this year\' s annual UN consultation on climate change, COP24 . They will set off from St Francis\' Basilica at 11 am on 1 September and walk to Gubbio on the first leg of  The Path of Francis pilgrimage. Organisers describe the COP24 meeting as  a crucial international event for the real implementation of the Paris Agreement. Amongst those taking part in the two-day event in Assisi are Archbishop Bernard Ntahoturi, Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome; and Elizabeth Bussmann, environmental officer for the Church of England\' s Diocese in Europe.

The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions. One meaningful interaction occurred when Tibetan delegate Zamlha Tempa Gyaltsen stopped by the UC exhibit to drop off a hand-signed letter from His Holiness the Dalai Lamaa well-known champion for climate science with deep connections to UC San Diego. In the letter, His Holiness thanked the COP24 delegates for striving to create a ""better environment for the world so that future generations will be able to live a healthy, happy life."" He also urged humanity to recognize that climate change affects everyone on Earth and that we must take serious action now. UC delegates also led six press conferences and participated in other side-events to communicate the latest scientific research on topics ranging from ocean deoxygenation to geoengineering to the value of deep ocean observation networks, and more. ""The conference is an enlightening experience that comes with a sense of worldly connectedness and inspires nations to collectively work toward changes for the good of humankind,"" said Scripps PhD student Tashiana Osborne, a two-time attendee of the UN climate talks. Osborne said she's still hopeful that nations can work together to address climate change but was concerned to witness ""how slow-moving and challenging it can be for responsible political actions to be taken."" COP24 , she and fellow Scripps PhD students Kara Voss and Meredith Fish held a press conference to discuss the science behind atmospheric rivers and extreme weather patterns linked to climate change. ""It is very important for the world to see students, researchers, and top STEM programs like Scripps invested in global climate change issues,"" said Osborne. ""It's imperative to demonstrate that there are those of us in the United States who remain dedicated to learning about and helping address parts of the climate crisis."" COP24 marked the third UN-led climate talk attended by Osinachi Ajoku, a Scripps PhD student studying climate science. His research focuses on how aerosol particles produced from biomass burning affect climate patterns in Africa. Ajoku said that attending three conference sessions has given him a holistic outlook on how countries address climate change by factors such as culture, location, and economic standing. ""It has also allowed me a unique perspective of how countries in Africa are progressing in climate change relative to the rest of the world since that region is the focus of my research,"" said Ajoku, a Los Angeles native with roots in Nigeriawhich he says makes his African research feel more personal. \"

Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) News Release","August 21, 2018","Congressional Documents and Publications","Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement in response to the Trump administration's roll back of crucial power plant carbon emission standards that were implemented by the Obama administration. The Trump administration released new pollution rules that replace the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan with a new agenda that caters to the fossil fuel industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Trump administration's proposed regulations would increase carbon emissions, leading up to an estimated 1,400 premature deaths each year. ""The President's continued efforts to undo the progress we've made to combat the effects of climate change are threatening the health and safety of the American people,"" said Shaheen. ""Rising temperatures interrupt New Hampshire's fall foliage season and maple syrup production, directly impeding our business and tourism sectors, and elevated sea levels put the homes and livelihoods of our Seacoast families at risk. It is unconscionable that the administration is knowingly pursuing a policy that puts the wellbeing of the fossil fuel industry over American lives. The President's actions also undermine years of work by small businesses in New Hampshire and across the nation that were incentivized under the Obama administration to prioritize technology in renewable energy and to curb carbon emissions. I'm deeply concerned by the President's destructive efforts to unravel necessary protections that safeguard our air, water and land, and that preserve our environment and wildlife. I'll continue to oppose the administration's dangerous policies that put Americans' health at risk and jeopardize the sustainability of our planet.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA289","NATIONAL STATEMENT BY ISABELLA LVIN, MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION AND CLIMATE AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, AT COP24","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Government of Sweden: Check against delivery. The effects of climate change are already here. People see them with their own eyes, live the effect of them around the world. In Sweden we experienced an extremely hot summer this year, with drought and violent forest fires in the Arctic region like never before. We watch the news and we see wildfires in California, hurricanes hitting the Caribbean and the Pacific, violent torrential rains in Japan and droughts in Africa, and we can no longer ignore the disastrous consequences for this planet and all future generations if we do not take action now. Some people say we should not talk about the enormous threat of climate change because then people might lose hope. But to quote Greta Thunberg, a remarkable 15-year old climate activist from Sweden, the world does not need hope. It needs action. But when we take action hope is everywhere. The action that is needed here in Katowice is deciding on a robust, detailed, clear and stable rulebook for the Paris Agreement. A transparent rulebook that creates comparability and predictability, and also enables the necessary flexibility and crucially increased ambition over time. Every school child today knows about science. Scientific knowledge is more precise than ever. The IPCC 1.5 degree report provides abundant clarity as to the need for action. And it does not leave room for hesitation. Our leadership is called for by our children. We need to show a predictable pathway towards low-carbon economies. Our constituencies need and demand it, and luckily business increasingly echoes those sentiments. With the Fossil-free Sweden initiative, we enable dialogue between government at all levels, industry, and stakeholders. It has resulted in the industries themselves developing concrete roadmaps for fossil-free competitiveness in many sectors. From the steel, cement and aviation industries, to the forest and retail sectors, as well as many more. This shows action is possible. Low-carbon transition offers new opportunities for investments, jobs and better lives. The Swedish economy has grown substantially, by more than 60 per cent, while our emissions are down more than 25 per cent since the early 1990s. We want to, and look forward to, continue sharing our experience on policies, financing and technology with partners. We believe developed countries must lead the first step of a global transition, encouraging and supporting others to move forward. We also know climate change hits some countries and regions harder than others. The least developed countries and small island states face very real and pressing danger. Developed countries must lead the first steps of a global transition, encouraging and supporting others to move forward. Therefore, Sweden is proud to be one of the largest per capita providers of climate finance globally. I am also happy that here in Katowice we have been able to announce an additional contribution for 2018 of SEK 50 million each to the Adaptation Fund and the Least Developed Countries Fund. This is in addition to the contributions announced at COP23. Ladies and gentlemen, We warmly welcome the initiative from the United Nations Secretary-General to organise the Climate Summit in 2019. The summit will serve as an important complement to the UNFCCC process to mobilise political willingness to act and to demonstrate transformative action. We need action. The cost of inaction is monumental; impossible to quantify. Nations are disappearing, ecological systems are being damaged beyond repair. The difference between 2 degrees and 1.5 is vast: we must pursue the most ambitious outcome. And our duty as leaders is to ensure that the transition benefits all. An inclusive approach is part of the spirit of Paris and the 2030 Agenda. It requires full engagement from all stakeholders. It requires rules. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA290","Studies show scientists can increasingly link extreme weather to climate change","December 13, 2018 Thursday","SNL Daily Coal Report","The rate and pace at which scientists are linking extreme weather events to climate change appear to be accelerating, a London-based think tank and a scientific journal indicated in recent separate findings. The reports come as investors are putting pressure on publicly traded companies in their portfolios to assess and disclose their potential physical and political transitional risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Since 2004 the year scientists began examining the link between specific events and climate change scientists have published at least 200 papers in the field on those topics, about half of which were published in the last three years, think tank Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit announced in an analysis released Dec. 11. From December 2017 to November 2018 alone, scientists were able to link climate change to extreme weather events about three-quarters of the time. Scientists found that climate change could be linked to all of the 11 heatwaves they examined and to four droughts, seven rainfall and flooding events, six storms, one wildfire and three cold weather-related events. A number of those studies examined events in the U.S. Although hurricanes and droughts are naturally occurring phenomena, scientists determined that climate change made certain events more likely to occur, increased the chance of those events happening more often, increased the intensity of those events or caused specific event-related impacts tied to climate change. ""The old argument that you can't link climate change to any particular weather event is now dead, I mean that's just now wrong,"" the think tank's director, Richard Black, said in announcing the study at a side event of the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24 , in Katowice, Poland. Meanwhile, the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society published a special report Dec. 10 consisting of multiple scientific papers on climate change, including some that linked global warming to extreme weather events in 2017 such as droughts in the U.S. northern Great Plains and east Africa, heatwaves in the European-Mediterranean region, and extreme flooding and rainfall in China, Peru and Bangladesh. The report also included a study on how water managers may want to revise their plans in light of the flooding that led to infrastructure damage around the Oroville Dam in California and flooding in Texas following Hurricane Harvey. Delegates from more than 190 countries at COP24 are in their second and final week of negotiations to create a rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. Although President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. from the Paris accord, which aims to reduce emissions enough to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees C from pre-industrial levels, Trump did send delegates to the climate talks. At the same time, the White House held a pro-coal event on the sidelines of COP24 and joined with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in refusing to endorse a recent United Nation's report that found fossil fuels need to be phased out by 2050 under the Paris agreement. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA291","AFRICAN COUNTRIES DESERVE AN ENHANCED CLIMATE AMBITION","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","African countries have been at the climate-change negotiating table for more than 20 years. The continent faces some of the most severe impacts of climate change, but questions remain over its adaptive capacity despite this engagement. African civil society organizations, trade unions and governments have advocated for three main means of implementation: climate finance for adaptation and mitigation; technology transfer; and capacity building. COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (UNFCCC) currently taking place in Katowice, Poland from 2 to 14 December. Through the Paris Work Programme (PAWP) expected to be adopted in Poland, African countries expect that COP 24 will deliver on the continent's expectations with regards to facilitating climate resilience. Climate finance for adaptation and mitigation Climate change is impacting all economies in Africa, a continent highly dependent on agriculture. The impact is increasing the already high inequality, as resources meant for investment in social amenities are being channelled into climate-change adaptation. In this case, due to climate change related disasters like droughts and flooding, there is an adverse impact on agricultural production-namely food insecurity. Therefore, resources meant to provide other services like universal and affordable health care, expansion of infrastructure and other social services for the poor are channelled to climate change response initiatives. During the COP 16, the world's developed countries agreed to mobilize 100 billion US dollars per year by the year 2020 for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. This is still a pipe dream as only 10 billion US dollars have been mobilized so far since the establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2006 to date. Additionally, African countries continue to face difficulties in accessing the funds as they are on a perpetual treadmill of paperwork to even qualify to receive any of the funds earmarked for them. Is imperative of global social justice that this funding be fast-tracked. As countries head to Poland, African nations approach the negotiations with the hope that issues dealing with transparency and accountability on climate financing will be made clearer and smoother. Otherwise, African countries will be obliged to divert more domestic resources to meeting their commitments under their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which could affect other development priorities. If promised international funding is not forthcoming and the shortfall needs to be made up from scarce domestic resources, this can mean these resources are no longer available at national level for example for social protection measures or food security. The decision in Poland should therefore be clear on provision, transparency and accountability of climate financing. Technology transfer and capacity building Many adaptation and mitigation solutions will require technology as well as financing, for the purposes of innovation and upscaling across various sectors. Technology transfer, therefore, is critical for African countries. One of the concerns for African countries is the sheer lack of capacity to implement new technologies for climate-change responses. But Africa has the potential to also transfer technology to the north if the existing low carbon technologies that incorporate the already existing indigenous knowledge of African countries are expanded. Therefore, a provision for reverse transfer from South to North with regard to technology should also be provided. At the moment the discussion is being handled as North-South transfer only. Africa is also cautious of becoming a testing ground for new technologies. Therefore, technologies from the north should be tried and tested before being transferred to Africa-for example short-lived solar panel technologies that end up being very expensive in the long run-a key issue that needs to be part of the discussions at COP 24 . Climate change needs to be tackled on a global level and in a just manner The climate-change crisis is now being felt in developed countries. As Europe and America battle wildfires amid massive heat waves over the past year, the impact in Africa is felt even stronger. The increasing frequency of droughts and flooding, and consequently increased risk of violent conflict in already volatile regions, present a major threat to livelihoods on the African continent. Looking ahead to Poland, it is the hope of African countries that these impacts will be reflected in the outcome document. Lastly, as parties move towards operationalization of the Paris Agreement, it is important to ensure that the commitments towards promoting decent work and a just transition are properly articulated in the Paris Work Programme. This is key because climate change is already having significant impacts on the world of work in Africa. Over 60 per cent of Africa's economically active population works in and lives off the agricultural sector, which is adversely affected by climate change. The transition to low-carbon economies offers great potential for green jobs creation, in areas such as the renewable-energy sector. This transition process however means that current existing jobs that do not offer sustainable production methods will be at a risk. It is important to ensure that this transition happens in a socially just and inclusive manner. Therefore, a socially and ecologically just outcome from COP 24 must take into consideration the African demands on the means of implementation (climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building) for adaptation and mitigation as well as the necessity of a just transition.

The data found that if all 30,000 visitors choose meat-based dishes at the conference's largest food court during the 12-day conference, they would contribute the equivalent of burning more than 500,000 gallons of gasoline or the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to 3,000 people flying from New York to Katowice. The groups that compiled the research called on the United Nations to create a framework for host countries to prioritize climate-friendly menus at future climate meetings. ""The meat-laden menu at COP24 is an insult to the work of the conference,"" said Stephanie Feldstein, director of the Population and Sustainability program at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""If the world leaders gathering in Poland hope to address the climate crisis, they need to tackle overconsumption of meat and dairy, starting with what's on their own plates. That means transitioning the food served at international climate conferences to more plant-based options with smaller carbon footprints."" The menu features twice as many meat-based options as plant-based ones. These meat dishes generate average greenhouse gas emissions four times higher than the plant-based meals. The two dairy-free, plant-based options generate one-tenth of the emissions. In addition to higher greenhouse gas emissions, the meat-based dishes on the menu require nine times more land and nearly twice as much water as the plant-based dishes. ""What people eat at a conference may seem like small potatoes when it comes to curbing global emissions,"" added Farm Forward's Claire Fitch. ""But if those at the forefront of global climate negotiations aren't going to 'walk the talk' at the highest-level climate conference, how can we expect the rest of the world to get on board?"" Studies have shown that it will not be possible to meet global climate targets without reducing meat and dairy consumption and production. Yet the need to tackle the overconsumption of animal-based foods has been largely absent from international climate negotiations and commitments. The majority of food-related efforts focus on improving production practices with few or no significant targets for shifting to less climate-intensive diets. ""We know that we cannot meet the Paris Agreement goals, or the 1.5C target, with business as usual,"" said Caroline Wimberly of Brighter Green, who will be in Katowice for COP24 . ""Food is not a matter only of personal choice, but an essential factor in solving the climate crisis.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA295","RAPID ACTION URGED AS KEY UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE OPENS","December 2, 2018 Sunday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Global Environment Facility (GEF): Following a year of devastating climate disasters around the globe, from California to Kerala, and Tonga to Japan, the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) opens today with the goal of finalising the implementation guidelines for the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The guidelines will provide clarity on how to implement the landmark agreement fairly and transparently for all. Specifically, they will strengthen international cooperation by ensuring that national contributions to the global effort are transparent, responsibility is shared fairly and progress on reducing emissions and building resilience can be accurately measured. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's Climate Chief, said: ""This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record. Greenhouses gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse. This reality is telling us that we need to do much more COP24 needs to make that happen"". A finalized set of implementation guidelines will unleash practical climate actions with respect to all the targets and goals of the Paris Agreement, including adapting to climate change impacts, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing financial and other support to developing countries. Six months after the 2015 Paris Summit, the negotiations on the implementation guidelines were launched and COP24 was set as the deadline. While governments are committed to finalizing the guidelines in order to unleash the full potential of the agreement, a great deal of work still remains to be completed in Katowice. ""The 2015 Paris Agreement entered into force faster than any other agreement of its kind. I now call on all countries to come together, to build upon this success and to make the agreement fully functional"", said in-coming COP President, Mr. Michal Kurtyka. ""We are ready to work with all nations to ensure that we leave Katowice with a full set of implementation guidelines and with the knowledge that we have served the world and its people"", he added. Ms. Espinosa noted that countries have strong backing for rapid climate action, given that public awareness and demand for solutions have increased due to clear evidence that our climate is changing. ""We simply cannot tell millions of people around the globe who are already suffering from the effects of climate change that we did not deliver"", she said. Talanoa Dialogue The conference is being held hot on the heels of the Global Warming of 1.5C report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as a cascade of UN and other reports on increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions and on health and other serious impacts. ""All of these findings confirm the need to maintain the strongest commitment to the Paris Agreement's aims of limiting global warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5C"", Ms. Espinosa stressed. COP24 During the high-level event that will conclude the Talanoa Dialogue, Ministers will consider the IPCC's 1.5C report and its relevance in the context of future actions. ""It is my hope that this will give Ministers the opportunity to provide a political signal for enhanced ambition"", Ms. Espinosa said. COP highlights Following a procedural opening on Sunday, 2 December, to enable work to begin quickly, Monday will be the grand opening ceremony graced by the presence of some 40 Heads of State and Heads of Government. In a world-first, and supported by the in-coming Polish COP presidency, the UN has launched the ""People's Seat"" initiative. During Monday's opening ceremony, the initiative will open a new window for people to express their views through social media and digital technology. It will also aim to engage people from all walks of life around the globe in the growing momentum to take climate action in their personal lives. Climate action before 2020 At the COP, Ministers will have the opportunity to engage in several high-level events, which all highlight the key elements of current climate change efforts. These high-level events will address some critical aspects of climate action before the year 2020, including: The Pre-2020 Stocktake will assess climate actions to be taken before 2020. The High-level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance will consider the state of global climate finance flows as captured by the third Biennial Assessment. The High-level Global Climate Action Event will offer a unique vision of how the world is affected by climate change and how different sectors are tackling the issue. Together, all events provide Ministers with a space to have frank and open discussions on progress made to date. Capacity-building for climate action, a critically important element for developing countries now and in the future, will receive a significant boost at COP24 . At a specially created capacity-building hub, some 35 events will cover topics such as implementing NDCs, integrating gender into climate action and utilizing the knowledge of indigenous peoples. The Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action This momentum already represents USD 36 trillion in economic activity and is growing steadily. Showcasing these events at the COP is leading to a new form of inclusive multilateralism that is vital to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Well over 100 events will highlight action in transport, water, land-use, energy, the fashion industry, to name a few, representing the spectrum of climate action. They will include CEOs, Mayors, Governors and other leaders from civil society at large. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA296","COP 24: Climate Summit Language Reveals Hidden Agenda","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Heartland Institute","People complain about UN jargon but the technical language of the Katowice climate summit is very revealing. It is all about changing the world order. Words exist because there is something important to talk about. Words also embody basic beliefs. In\~this context it is very useful that the ever-green Climate Change News has published a\~Glossary\~of the 32 technical terms they think are most important in Katowice. Analyzing this list tells us a great deal about what is really going one. To begin with, there is not one word on the list that is about climate or climate change. So calling this a climate summit is just a semantic smokescreen. These folks are designing a new world order. The primary focus is how the world will be changed and who is going to pay for it. In fact the largest group of terms is those that refer to the various political alliances at the new-order design table. There are 12 such groups, plus the term ""negotiating group"" itself. These are groups of countries that feel they share enough of a common interest to team up. Thus a full 41% of the technical terms refer to interest groups. The largest negotiating group by far is called the G77 + China. Despite the old name, this group has 134 member countries. I have no idea why China gets special mention, except it is by far the most powerful member. These are the countries that stand to benefit hugely from the new world order, because its central feature is huge, never ending payments from the so-called developed countries to the developing countries. (I say so-called because the U.S. is still developing.) Africa has its own group, since they stand to make more money per capita then any other region. The U.S. is part of something innocuously called the Umbrella Group, which includes many developed countries outside of the EU, which is a group of its own. Brexit appears not to have happened here, because the UK is not listed separately from the EU. The avowed Socialists from the western hemisphere even have their own group of 11, further demonstrating that this Katowice business is all about a new world order, not climate change. Mind you these socialists are not the only anti-capitalists at the table, far from it. The next largest language group is of 5 wealth transfer terms. The definition specifically says that this is ""a central element"" of the new world order (which it calls ""international cooperation""). One of these terms is ""climate finance"" but it is not about financing climate, whatever that might mean. It is about the developed countries paying for everything the developing countries do in the name of stopping, or at least adapting to, supposedly human caused climate change. Annual payments of $100 billion are supposed to begin in 2020, but may well rise thereafter, if developing countries decide to do more, which they no doubt would. The more they do the more money they get. But this $100 billion a year is by no means the big ticket when it comes to payments. That honor belongs to something called ""loss and damage."" This is basically all of the damage caused by climate change, which now looks to be all bad weather. Every hurricane, drought, wildfire, snowstorm and flood is now attributed to human caused climate change, not to mention sea level rise. The Paris Accord acknowledges loss and damage but stops short of requiring the developed countries to pay for it. That they do pay is certainly part of the new order agenda. The tentative figure put out by the UN is $400 billion a year, but it could easily get much bigger. There is a lot of bad weather in the world. One of the sneakier wealth transfer terms is ""technology transfer."" In the US this term is widely used to mean the licensing of new technologies to companies, who then move them from the laboratory to widespread use. At Katowice the term means something entirely different, including the unlicensing of technologies. The idea is that companies holding patents will waive them, to allow developing countries to manufacture the patented stuff free of charge. It can even mean that these companies build manufacturing facilities and train the workers, also for free. I am not making this up. Then there are various important words referring to other aspects of the new world order, as well as to specific actions to be taken along the way. Chief among these are the ""Nationally determined contributions"" (NDCs), which are what each country promises to do. The NDCs are defined as ""climate targets"" but of course they are not target climates. They are milestones on the way to the new world order. As with most of this UN summit language, ""climate"" is a code word. The NDCs are to be renewed every five years, including in 2020, so this is another hidden agenda item in Katowice. In short, what is on the table at Katowice is moving toward a new world order, in the name of dealing with supposedly human caused climate change. One of the central elements is a vast wealth transfer from the developed countries like the U.S. to the developing countries. This is something the UN has always wanted to do and the climate change scare is their grand chance, or so they think anyway. Tens of thousands of national negotiators from around the world are hard at it in Poland. \"

Markey: At COP24 , international community forges a path towards transparency, implementation Boston (December 15, 2018) Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement after international negotiators at the United Nations Conference of Parties 24 reached a deal to adopt rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement. As part of the deal, every country will need to follow uniform standards for measuring carbon emissions. Ahead of 2020, countries will be required to raise ambition for reducing the emissions at the heart of causing climate change. ""Recent scientific reports showed a disturbing path toward global destruction due to climate change, but negotiations in Poland gave us a hopeful alternative roadmap for action,"" said Senator Markey. ""The rulebook agreed to at COP24 is a ray of hope despite President Trump's abysmal record on climate change. It will serve as a solid foundation for all nations to continue working toward the goals negotiated in Paris. Support from people around the world for the Paris climate agreement has never been stronger. Despite The Trump administration's giveaways to fossil fuel interests, the United States is still in, and we can make progress. From cities and states setting bold climate goals, to business and entrepreneurs developing clean energy solutions, the United States has the technological might to lead the world in emissions reductions. And now, with a new Congress set to begin, we must exert the political will to do it."" In November of 2018, Senator Markey introduced a Senate Resolution expressing U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA298","Meat-heavy Menu at UN Climate Conference Could Contribute 4,000 Metric Tons of Greenhouse Gases","December 3, 2018 Monday","US Official News","WASHINGTON,DC:Center for Biological Diversity, the state of Arizona has issued the following news release: analysis from the Center for Biological Diversity, Farm Forward and Brighter Green today finds that the meat-heavy menu at the United Nations\' Framework Convention on Climate Change conference COP24 could contribute more than 4,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases to the climate crisis. The data found that if all 30,000 visitors choose meat-based dishes at the conference\' s largest food court during the 12-day conference, they would contribute the equivalent of burning more than 500,000 gallons of gasoline or the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to 3,000 people flying from New York to Katowice. The groups that compiled the research called on the United Nations to create a framework for host countries to prioritize climate-friendly menus at future climate meetings.  The meat-laden menu at COP24 is an insult to the work of the conference, said Stephanie Feldstein, director of the Population and Sustainability program at the Center for Biological Diversity.  If the world leaders gathering in Poland hope to address the climate crisis, they need to tackle overconsumption of meat and dairy, starting with what\' s on their own plates. That means transitioning the food served at international climate conferences to more plant-based options with smaller carbon footprints. The menu features twice as many meat-based options as plant-based ones. These meat dishes generate average greenhouse gas emissions four times higher than the plant-based meals. The two dairy-free, plant-based options generate one-tenth of the emissions. In addition to higher greenhouse gas emissions, the meat-based dishes on the menu require nine times more land and nearly twice as much water as the plant-based dishes.  What people eat at a conference may seem like small potatoes when it comes to curbing global emissions, added Farm Forward\' s Claire Fitch.  But if those at the forefront of global climate negotiations aren\' t going to \' walk the talk\' at the highest-level climate conference, how can we expect the rest of the world to get on board? Studies have shown that it will not be possible to meet global climate targets without reducing meat and dairy consumption and production. Yet the need to tackle the overconsumption of animal-based foods has been largely absent from international climate negotiations and commitments. The majority of food-related efforts focus on improving production practices with few or no significant targets for shifting to less climate-intensive diets.  We know that we cannot meet the Paris Agreement goals, or the 1.5C target, with business as usual, said Caroline Wimberly of Brighter Green, who will be in Katowice for COP24 .  Food is not a matter only of personal choice, but an essential factor in solving the climate crisis. Demand-side policies and efforts, including food waste reductions and shifting diets  prioritizing populations with the highest consumption of animal-based foods  are critical in achieving a climate compatible food system and curtailing emissions.

Participating countries have already submitted written pledges to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, by transitioning to cleaner energy sources and by promoting energy efficiency. But rules were needed to ensure that countries could monitor each other's actions, and properly measure their impacts. ""Today's agreement is a solid step in the right direction,"" said EESI Executive Director Carol Werner. ""The details still need to be ironed out, but the agreed-upon rules set the stage for the effective implementation of the commitment made in Paris to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The international community also agreed to increase its greenhouse gas reduction commitments by 2020, and to provide more financing for vulnerable nations. But does this get us to where we need to be? No. The global community has failed to seize an opportunity to take the truly decisive, urgent action we need to see. The latest U.N. climate report, Global Warming of 1.5 -C, warns that we really should be aiming to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius--not 2--and that we only have 12 years left to act if we want to avoid drastic consequences."" Shockingly, the United States joined three other major oil-producing countries--Kuwait, Russia, and Saudi Arabia--to block language that would have embraced the 1.5 C Report and called for more urgent, ambitious climate action. The Trump Administration has already indicated that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement at the earliest opportunity, in 2020. In addition, Brazil, under a new administration, blocked rules that would have helped set a carbon trading system. ""The failure of the United States to lead on climate action, as it has in the past--it played a key role in getting the Paris Climate Agreement past the finish line--is mortifying and saddening,"" said Carol Werner. ""Fortunately, U.S. states, cities, and businesses are stepping up to the plate and pledging to decisively curb their carbon emissions. They are being joined by activists, nonprofits, tribes, and educational and religious institutions, which is much more reflective of American public opinion. And, we are looking to the new Congress to provide robust discussion of climate and resilience actions. Many in the large incoming freshman class and new House Committee chairs are deeply concerned about climate change and want to take action on behalf of the country.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA300","Q&A: MAKING GREEN GROWTH A SUCCESS ACROSS THE GLOBE","December 13, 2018 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","When the Global Green Growth Institute's (GGGI) Director General Frank Rijsberman's son was looking for a job following graduation, he saw that oil companies were paying the highest salaries. But Rijsberman, who has been working in the sustainable development sector for decades, knew better. He told his son that those very same oil companies would soon go broke. And instead advised him to seek employment with renewable energy companies as they would soon be the ones making money. As head of GGGI, it is undoubtable that\'c2\~Rijsberman has expert insight into the future of the renewable energy sector. GGGI supports governments around the world transition to environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth by helping them mobilise finance for climate action and implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) i.e. country commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. With a career spanning over 30 years, Rijsberman is one of the strongest advocates of green growth attending the 24th Conference of the Parties to the\'c2\~United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland.\'c2\~His organisation is organising over 15 events at the conference that are focused on, among other things, how low carbon development, green finance, transparency and capacity development of countries can address climate change. Amidst his packed COP24 schedule, Rijsberman sat down with IPS for a brief interview on the state of global climate action, COP24 and the work of GGGI in attaining green growth. Excerpts from the interview follow: Inter Press Service (IPS): Climate finance has been one of the sticking points at COP24 so far. Developing countries are concerned that the developed world is shifting the role of financial contributions to the private sector. What are your thoughts on this? Dr. Frank Rijsberman (FR): Firstly, there needs to be a clean definition of the 100 billion dollars climate finance pledged to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This 100 billion shouldn't be diluted. We need this 100 billion to be clean and green. But at the same time, this is only a small part of what we need to fight climate change. We need trillions, and for that public finance is not enough. This will only come about if we get the institutional investors off the sideline and get the pension funds, the private sector to engage. IPS: What are some of the challenges that now exist with regards to engaging the private sector in funding green growth and how can they be engaged more effectively? FR: It starts with many of the governments not even realising that renewable energy has become commercially viable. They still think green growth is nice but it is expensive and [they] can't afford it. It is already commercially viable to use solar-based batteries for instance, so there is a business case there. So convincing people that these are commercially attractive investments is the first thing that needs to be done. If structured well enough, [as in the case of] Bangladesh offering 20-year power purchase agreement at a reasonable price, then we can attract private investors. Governments also must create an enabling environment for the private sector to engage and have a level playing field for renewables to attract those investments. If there are barriers, such as fossil fuel subsidies, it becomes very hard for private businesses to make a living out of renewables. In Fiji, for instance, the government subsidises dirty electricity for poor households. Stopping that subsidy and turning it into a subsidy for solar power on the roofs of low income houses is one of our projects. IPS: Two months ago, the IPCC released a report that confirmed that accepting increased global warming of 2 degrees Celsius will impact severely\'c2\~lives, livelihoods and natural ecosystems.\'c2\~This means drastic changes are needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Is it achievable here? FR: It has to be finance first. Then we need to agree on transparency. We also need to ramp up ambition and rather than to waver from their NDCs countries need to step up their commitments, but that is for next year. We need to agree on the rulebook and get over the hurdle of finance at this COP then everybody's attention will focus on more ambition, which is what we need. If we get stuck on the Paris rulebook or finance then we also don't get to the 1.5 degrees, so it is like a house of cards. IPS: Transparency is one of the key issues being debated at COP24 . What are your thoughts on it? FR: Transparency is the code word for Article 6. Part of it means developed countries reporting in a credible way. And for developing countries it also means to save their rainforests, to restore their mangrove areas\'c2\~- can they get money to pay for that? There are countries like Korea or Australia that can't reduce their emissions fast enough, but they are willing to buy carbon credits. But then we need to agree on a rulebook for transparency - how are we going to report, what kind of Monitoring Reporting and Verification Systems (MRVS) are necessary, and those MRVS shouldn't overly burden countries like Myanmar. We can't have the same kind of rulebook for Myanmar and Germany [and] shouldn't make the barriers to access very high. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) felt they were excluded because [these processes] were too complicated. So, this time around transparency needs to allow the Least Developed Countries and SIDS to really access that. That is the critical sticking point. IPS: Your organisation assists member states, which\'c2\~include developing nations, access funding from\'c2\~the GCF. It has also assisted member countries in developing green growth models to great success. Are you seeing an increased\'c2\~commitment from\'c2\~governments, in both\'c2\~developing and developed nations, to embrace green growth?\'c2\~What is your vision for GGGI going ahead from COP24 ? We only started six years ago with 12 countries and now 30 countries have ratified our treaty and another 30 are in the queue to become members. When our President Ban Ki-moon meets ministers he encourages them to take green growth more seriously, then those ministers contact us about how they can do so. We also see a lot of good opportunities from the SIDS. In South East Asia - Vietnam, Indonesia - there is a large portfolio of planned new coal fired power plants. So, these are the hotspots and we need to convince those governments that green growth is commercially attractive and feasible. We are very happy with Indonesia's commitment for green growth and we are strongly supporting Vietnam's government to convert their intent to climate action. I have worked on sustainable development forever, and for the longest time Ministries of Finance had no time for us, saying 'Sorry we are poor, we need to grow and we will worry about the environment later'. Even INDCs were owned by the Ministries of Environment and the Ministries of Finance didn't know about them. Now the Finance Ministers who want growth are interested in green growth, integrating these ideas into mainstream national development planning. For instance, we helped Uganda develop the green growth development strategy which the ministry of finance is leading. That is what I am most excited about. We have finally convinced ministries of finance to take green growth seriously. \"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA301","US presence at climate talks mirrors political rifts at home; US withdrawal from its role as multilateral leader in global affairs is apparent at the COP24 clim....","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","The Christian Science Monitor","At the annual United Nations climate conference in Poland, the United States is, to say the least, a country divided. The US may have formally announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, but it's still a significant presence - and absence - at the 2018 summit of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 . It remains to be seen just which part of its influence will hold the most sway as world leaders again convene to try to move forward on climate action. The fractured nature of US presence here in Katowice reflects the sharply divided political climate back home, with Trump administration officials touting fossil fuel innovations and more local representatives from individual states and cities offering a patchwork of grassroots dedication to climate action. A gulf of politically charged mistrust separates these opposing camps. A third element of career officials is attempting to sidestep US politics entirely and forge ahead as active participants in these collective negotiations. On the political side, Trump administration officials on Monday held a highly visible and controversial panel that was an unapologetic promotion of coal, oil, gas, and nuclear energy, and which was interrupted part-way through by protesters offering a heated response to that message. Acting as a counterbalance to that official US stance, stands the ""We are still in"" coalition of subnational entities - states, cities, businesses, and other organizations - who are still committed to America's Paris Agreement targets. These groups aren't able to officially represent the US or negotiate on its behalf, but they're a visible presence here, reminding the world that the Trump administration represents only one segment of America, and that much of the country is continuing to work on climate mitigation. But more quietly a small US delegation is still actively participating in negotiations, helping to hammer out agreements on issues like transparency and finance as countries work to agree on a ""rulebook"" that lays out how the Paris Agreement will actively be implemented. Generally career civil servants, they're working on technical issues where the US position remains relatively unchanged and they can serve a constructive role. On the sidelines To be sure, the US role here is significantly diminished compared with the negotiations leading up to the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""The part of the talks that is about ambition is a part that the United States is just disengaged from,"" says Reed Schuler, a negotiator for the US during the 2015 Paris negotiations, referring to the critical issue of encouraging countries to make their emissions goals more rigorous. ""That's the void the subnational delegation is filling. It's filling the conversation of, 'here is the climate action moving forward in the US, and we hope our partners internationally are being more ambitious back home,' "" says Mr. Schuler, a senior policy advisor on climate and sustainability for Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee. The pro-fossil fuels panel was the only event the US government hosted at this conference, and it drew significant attention from both the media and protesters, who filled the room to capacity and then interrupted it part-way through, chanting ""keep it in the ground"" and ""shame on you,"" in between brief speeches from youth and indigenous leaders, before filing out. ""In the US, the policy is not to keep it in the ground, it's to use it in a way that is clean and efficient,"" responded P. Wells Griffith, a senior energy adviser to President Trump who presided over the panel. ""It is important to the overall climate discussion that we consider what's realistic and pragmatic,"" Mr. Griffith told the crowd according to Time. ""Energy innovation and fossil fuels will continue to play a leading role."" The panel drew broad condemnation from an array of climate experts, many of whom noted the irony of the US government touting ""cleaner"" fossil fuels even as they take steps to dismantle standards to prevent methane leaks and pollution from coal-fired power plants, but most observers here see it as a bit of political theater that plays to Trump's base but is largely ignored by the rest of the world. ""They had a side show last year, and a side show this year,"" says Todd Stern, the US special envoy for climate change under former-President Barack Obama, and the chief negotiator for the US at the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""The United States played a really big role in the negotiating process during the Obama years,"" says Stern. And now, ""that whole political level is not there. The US as a country does not have credibility or leverage here."" Stern credits other countries with not following the US exit from the Paris agreement just a year and a half after it was signed - a scenario that was possible - but says there's no way for anyone to really fill the void that the US departure leaves. ""It's hard not to have a strong US role in international affairs, period,"" he says. ""Things happen when the US engages, and it's hard to make consequential things happen with the US on the sidelines. Not to mention the US on the sidelines throwing spitballs."" Dueling messages Still, in terms of the actual technical negotiations going on this week, as country delegations work to develop the rulebook, most observers say the team sent by the US is generally respected and consists of career officials who have been involved in these negotiations for many years. The US, along with China, co-chairs the committee on transparency - an issue where it continues to be a strong voice pushing for more rigorous transparency. ""That stuff is not very partisan,"" says Schuler. The one exception to that relatively steady policy at the technical level occurred over the weekend, when the United States allied with Russia, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to block endorsement of the most recent report \~from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, focusing on the consequences of exceeding 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F.) of warming. Disagreement over a single word resulted in the omission of the passage entirely.\~Instead of signing onto a statement that would ""welcome"" the report, the four outlier countries only agreed to saying the conference ""notes"" the report - a subtle but important distinction that sent a message about the US rejection of the international scientific consensus on climate change, and placed the US with some odd bedfellows. ""This is not an attractive coalition,"" says Andrew Steer, president and chief executive of the World Resources Institute think tank. ""In some ways, the US is playing a constructive role [in the rulebook negotiations], but overall, this is negative. This is science. This is the best scientists in the world, coming out with a really thoughtful report, and how appalling it is that the country that's won more Nobel prizes in science than any other country ... should say, 'we don't believe it.' "" But if the US is a less visible presence at a federal level, there are still plenty of US leaders here working to assure the world that America is not stopping the fight on climate change. In the area of the COP24 center, where countries have their own ""pavilions,"" the United States is a notable absence. But the ""US Climate Action Center,"" representing the ""We Are Still In""\~coalition,"" has a large and active space, with numerous events. ""It's sort of the pocket US alternative center, also known as the old negotiators' home,"" Stern joked during a panel on Monday. The members of that coalition, and their presence here, ""gives hope on two levels,"" says Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""One is that they're doing things on the ground in terms of emissions reductions,"" helping to keep the US on a path where, if it rejoins the Paris agreement, it can get back on track to meeting its goals. ""And two, they're offering political hope, because they're showing that a majority of Americans, and an increasing majority of subnational officials are committed to climate action, and Trump really doesn't represent America and the American public. That's very helpful."" This story was produced with support from an\~Energy Foundation grant to cover the environment. \~ \"

""Business can and must provide the thought-leadership to create and drive the innovative technologies and solutions required to disrupt an industry that today sees 1.4 billion plastic bottles produced every day, many of which end up in landfill and our oceans,"" Anders Jacobson said. He added one consequence is that 83 percent of all tap water on average around the world has been shown to contain micro plastic particles, according to research. Mr. Jacobson was speaking at the Sustainability Innovation Forum, the largest business-focused event taking place during the United Nations climate change conference underway in the Polish city of Katowice. Following his keynote presentation, Mr. Jacobson was joined by environment ministers from the UK, Finland and Iceland for a panel discussion on how to tackle single use plastic and its impact on the planet's oceans. Noting that pervasive micro plastics are now found literally everywhere on the planet from the water we drink to the food we eat and the air we breathe, Mr. Jacobson said Bluewater daily demonstrates how human ingenuity can deliver tech solutions dramatically cutting the need for throwaway plastic bottles. Bluewater is a Swedish water technology company, founded in 2013, on a belief that clean water is a basic human right, made sustainably at the source and free from toxic single-use plastics. Designed for use in homes, businesses and public spaces, Bluewater's purifiers are today deployed in diverse environments to provide alternatives to plastic bottles at marathons, football matches, music and large-scale yoga events across Asia, the USA, Europe and Africa. Bluewater does not stop at innovating, making and selling its unique reverse osmosis water purifiers, the company is also spearheading a global movement to enhance human and planetary health by eliminating single-use plastics. ""This action model has already forged high impact partnerships with a range of nonprofits in affected communities like Flint, MI and with global sporting actors like Volvo Ocean Race that produce meaningful and tangible benefits to communities and demonstrate there are technologies and solutions already available today to avoid single-use plastics,"" Anders Jacobson said. Background Joining Anders Jacobson on the Sustainable Innovation Forum panel discussing how to tackle single use plastic and its impact on the oceans were Dr. Therese Coffey, UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Environment, Gudmundur Ing Gudbrandsson, Iceland's Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, and Hanna Pokka, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Finland.

Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, ranking Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following floor remarks on the negotiations at COP24 , the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference , where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris agreement:    The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue. ""For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable. ""Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone. ""That includes reports from the world's top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts. ""What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American. ""There's a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly--the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract. ""Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises. ""Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy. ""While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable. ""It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8 Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. ""It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks. ""It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average--the highest annual average in the satellite record. ""None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, 'We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.' ""This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week. ""Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement's entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures. The Paris Agreement also clearly outlined robust and transparent reporting, so that parties can hold each other accountable via diplomatic engagement as opposed to binding legal punishment. ""Of course, success comes down to execution. That is what makes the development of the implementation rulebook so consequential, and President Trump's decision to abandon the Paris Agreement so antithetical to our own interests. ""The current administration's wholesale rejection of meaningful engagement with the global community is disturbingly naive and is bound to result in repeating past mistakes and detrimental outcomes. China is emboldened by President Trump's plan to abandon the Paris Agreement. China effectively slowed progress at COP23 and will continue its efforts. ""In the leadership vacuum President Trump has created, China is stepping in to write the rules. It is completely absurd to assume that the U.S., by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, is somehow immune to the global economic implications of climate change. ""The President couched his decision to abdicate American leadership regarding the Paris Agreement as putting 'America First' in a June 2017 announcement riddled with inaccurate characterizations of the Paris Agreement and £lternative facts' on climate change. ""There is no truthful, factual, or reality-based argument to justify how allowing every country in the world, except the United States, to build the clean energy economy of the future and confront our most pressing global challenge puts America First. ""Continued U.S. leadership and climate diplomacy can only yield economic benefits for United States workers. More than 900 U.S. businesses support keeping the United States in the Paris Agreement, including more than 20 Fortune 500 companies. Acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for New Jersey and our Nation. ""I am proud to say that New Jersey is a national leader in deploying clean energy technologies, creating clean energy jobs, and planning and investing in climate change resilience. New Jersey is home to 417 solar energy manufacturing and installation companies employing more than 7,000 workers. ""New Jersey is also competing hard to become the first mid-Atlantic state to produce offshore wind energy, supported by the recent enactment of legislation establishing a 3,500 megawatt production goal for offshore wind energy. ""New Jersey has also recently increased its renewable energy standard to 50% by 2030 and set a new state carbon emissions reduction goal of 80% by 2050. ""New Jersey's leadership among the states working to combat climate change is rooted in our vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The fact is, if we continue on our current emissions trajectory the world could see global average temperature increase by 3 degrees Celsius. This would devastate New Jersey, risking $800 billion in coastal property value, along with the health, security, and livelihoods of millions of our residents. ""The potential losses from sea level rise, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather associated with climate change would cost my state's economy billions in economic losses. ""Just yesterday, the Star Ledger - a statewide paper -published a column by Robert Kopp, the director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, highlighting many of these consequences, as outlined by the recent National Climate Assessment. ""Our winters have been warming faster than our summers. Pests like the pine beetle and ash borer are no longer kept in check by winter freezes. Perhaps even more alarmingly we've seen our crops begin to bud earlier and earlier, only to see them decimated by cold snaps later in the season. In the Garden State, famous for our tomatoes, cranberry bogs, blueberries, and other specialty crops, that's a big deal. ""As temperatures rise, we also expect to see a surge in heat-related deaths and illnesses due to allergies and asthma, while disease carrying bugs like mosquitos and ticks thrive in increased seasonal moisture. ""And of course, perhaps the clearest threat to New Jersey from climate change comes in the form of coastal flooding from sea level rise and extreme weather events. We saw it with Superstorm Sandy, and we understand the devastating consequences it can have for our families, our communities, and our infrastructure. ""There is no convincing me that ignoring climate change and walking away from the world's only mechanism for holding countries like India, China, and Russia accountable for their emissions puts New Jersey First. ""Proof of the Administration's political favoritism for fossil fuels is exemplified by the only U.S. government sponsored event at COP24 in Poland titled: 'The Future of Coal'. ""Never mind how insulting and tone deaf it is to sponsor an event to promote dirty, coal-powered energy at a climate change conference, while countries like the Marshall Islands, Maldives, Mongolia, and Mozambique--that face existential crises from climate change-- look on. Even more than that, this public forum flaunts the administration's wholesale sellout to the industries the government is tasked with regulating. ""It also shows this administration's contempt for the U.S.'s booming renewable energy sector, which according to Trump's own Department of Energy, employs more Americans than the U.S. fossil fuel industries, by a five-to-one ratio. All told, nearly 1 million Americans work in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors. That equals nearly 5 times the number of workers employed in the fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and oil workers. ""As Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I believe climate diplomacy must be a priority for U.S. foreign policy. Climate change poses an imminent and long-term threat--not just to U.S. national security, but also to the long-term prosperity of this country and of our world. Addressing the crisis requires collective action and cooperation by local and national representatives, small and large businesses, and every one of us. ""If the U.S. is to maintain our status as the world's super power, it is in our best interest to lead the global cooperative effort to address the serious challenges posed by climate change, and to promote stability and resilience by helping developing countries reduce their vulnerability to the effects of climate change. ""If we stand alone on the sidelines as these changes in international economics take shape we will ultimately be the loser. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on the administration to continue advancing U.S. climate diplomacy and reconsider the decision to withdraw. It is essential to U.S. national security interests--as defined by our own Department of Defense--and growing U.S. economic opportunity.""

Following attendance at a United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) workshop in Paris in October titled: ""Leveraging Sustainable Procurement Practices to Transform Tourism Value Chains"", ABPCO and its members gathered to consider the areas where the industry can have the most significant impact on the creation of a sustainable future. Using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, ABPCO identified a desire for the industry to do more in areas of:  Responsible production and consumption  Quality education and partnerships  Reducing inequalities The UNEP workshop in Paris also highlighted an opportunity for the event industry to collaborate closely with the wider hospitality sector in the following key areas:  Phasing out single-use plastics  Sustainable food procurement  Circularity in the supply chain ABPCO's report and Sustainability Roadmap were launched at IBTM last week alongside attendees from UNEP, Positive Impact and other industry leaders focused on sustainability. "" COP24 Positive Impacts Fiona Pelham comments: ""ABPCO has shown significant leadership by attending, contributing to and communicating about a UN environment event on behalf of the global event industry. ABPCO members should be extremely proud that their association is taking leading action to protect our future and the future of the Events industry.""

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA306","US utility sector has met Paris goals, but transportation emissions rising","December 7, 2018","SNL Renewable Energy Weekly","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Nov. 28 that the nation is meeting its commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. That assertion, delivered just days before a crucial round of international climate talks, was true for the U.S. electric utility sector but not for the nation's economy as a whole. ""We're actually meeting our Paris reduction obligations, but we are going to withdraw from the treaty,"" Wheeler said at an event hosted by The Washington Post. While the U.S. electric utility sector reduced CO2 emissions by 28% in 2017 compared to 2005 levels, the country is still not on track to meet its pledge under the Paris Agreement to cut CO2 emissions economywide between 26% and 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. Wheeler made his comments ahead of the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24 , which runs Dec. 2 through 14. Held in the coal mining city of Katowice, Poland, the conference will host delegates from more than 190 nations who will attempt to hash out a set of implementation guidelines at COP24 that serve as a collective rulebook for the Paris Agreement. The conference also comes days after attendees at the G-20 Leaders' Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, signed a communique reaffirming that the Paris Agreement is ""irreversible"" while committing ""to its full implementation."" At the behest of the U.S., the communique also reiterated President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. Nevertheless, Trump is still sending a delegation to COP24 that includes officials from the EPA; U.S. State Department; White House; U.S. departments of Treasury, Energy and Agriculture; and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. is participating in the negotiations ""to ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests,"" the State Department said. When pressed on what he hopes to get out of the process, Wheeler said in his Nov. 28 interview: ""We want to remain part of the conversation in the event that the other countries are willing to renegotiate the treaty, and at this point, most of the industrialized countries that are signatories to Paris are not meeting their obligations."" That includes the U.S., according to multiple recent climate reports. Power sector vs. transportation sector Current federal and economy commitments, combined with market forces, will drive U.S. emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2025, or roughly two-thirds of the way to the original U.S. target, a report from America's Pledge on Climate found. The organization a climate action committee founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Gov. Jerry Brown released the report in September at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. The report noted that while power sector emissions have been trending lower, transportation sector emissions have increased every year since 2012, although they have not returned to their pre-recession peak in 2007. Emissions from the transportation sector eclipsed emissions from the power sector for the first time in 2016 and 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Transportation emissions ""have started to increase again as low gasoline prices, increasing vehicle sizes, and expanding economic activity outpace efficiency gains from federal fuel economy standards,"" the report said. Meanwhile, a Nov. 27 ""emissions gap"" report by from the United Nations Environment Programme found the United States is not on track to meet its Paris targets with current policies. The report specifically noted that the EPA has proposed to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which would have encouraged states to shift away from coal-fired electricity generation toward renewables and natural gas. The Trump administration's proposed replacement the Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule would increase CO2 emissions from between 47 million tons and 61 million tons by 2030 relative to the Clean Power Plan, according to the EPA's analysis. However, in public comments on the ACE rule, the Edison Electric Institute stated that the power sector will have complied with the final 2030 goals of the Clean Power Plan in terms of gross emissions reductions before the 2022 start date for the program. The U.N. report also noted the EPA plans to ease fuel economy and CO2 emissions standards on cars and light-duty trucks while revoking California's waiver to set its own tougher standards. In a preliminary regulatory impact analysis, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that the proposed standards for model years 2021 to 2026 would increase vehicle CO2 emissions by 713 million metric tons over the lifetime of the vehicles produced from model years 1979 through 2029. Nevertheless, the U.N. study also referenced a study by Yale University focused on the U.S. that found 17 states and 54 cities with greenhouse gas reduction commitments comprising 40% of U.S. emissions could meet almost half of the nation's Paris Agreement targets by 2025. Given the conflicting messages from the U.S. on climate policy, it's unclear how much influence the country will wield as negotiators strive to craft a common rulebook at COP24 . The EPA reportedly sent three representatives to Poland, including a senior policy adviser to Wheeler. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment Dec. 3. ""We're still participating in the process, but we are withdrawing from the Paris climate accord,"" Wheeler said Nov. 28. \"

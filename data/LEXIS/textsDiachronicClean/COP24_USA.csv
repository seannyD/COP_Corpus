"COP24","USA","COP24_USA1","PRESIDING BISHOP'S DELEGATION TO ATTEND 24TH UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","November 28, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Episcopal Church:Episcopal Church Office of Public AffairsAn eight-member delegation representing the Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop Michael Curry will attend the 24th Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, December 2-14. This is the fourth Episcopal delegation to attend this climate change meeting.Known as COP24, the United Nations Climate Change Conference is an annual intergovernmental meeting to focus on global dialogue and action around the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This conference produced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, which serves as the current basis for global standards on climate action and lowering carbon emissions.Called by Presiding Bishop Curry and led by Bishop Marc Andrus of the Diocese of California, the COP24What I have found in participating in the United Nations climate summits from Paris onwards is that the thousands of national representatives from virtually every country on Earth are also local climate activists. These remarkable COP representatives are updating the adage from the 1970s, think globally and act locally' to be 'think and act globally and locally',"" said Andrus. ""Thinking and acting, globally and locally is what we in The Episcopal Church are about. At General Convention 79 in Austin we passed 19 pieces of environmentally-related resolutions, and we also heard compelling stories of local action. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams once said, It takes a global body to confront global problems.' The Episcopal Church is a global body doing climate and environmental work at the world and the local levels.""The delegation will bring the voice and perspective from Episcopalians around the globe to the diplomatic community gathering in Katowice. It will also coordinate with Anglican Communion, interfaith and civil society partners in their presence at the conference.""Resolutions coming out of the 79th General Convention have given the Episcopal Church's Office of Government Relations additional tools to advocate for care of creation from allowing us to be engaged around advocacy for our earth's oceans to recognizing the need to address carbon emissions,"" said Rebecca Linder Blachly, Director, Office of Government Relations. ""We look forward to partnering with organizations and governments around the world to work for an earth that will sustain us for generations to come.""""Following the Presiding Bishop's call for life-giving, liberating, and loving care of creation, our witness at informs our ministry and helps us safeguard the integrity of creation and sustain and renew the life of the earth,"" added Melanie Mullen, the Episcopal Church's director of reconciliation, justice, and creation care.How to participateFollow the delegation on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook using #EpiscopalClimate:@EpiscoClimate on Twitter will provide the most up-to-date tracking at COP24.@EpiscopalUN on Facebook and Twitter will provide more UN-specific updates.The Episcopal Public Policy Network will highlight opportunities for action around policy.

The two main goals of COP24 were to finalize the 'Paris Rulebook' for implementing the Paris Agreement[3] from COP21 in 2015 and to 'raise ambition' for reaching a global response to the threat of climate change.Leading up to COP24, there were two major reports from the leading climate scientists the IPCC Special Report 15[4] and the 4th US National Climate Assessment[5]. These reports highlight how climate change is already negatively affecting human and natural systems, what could happen if we do not change our current behavior and economic systems, and what communities, companies, and governments can do to get back on track for a more prosperous future.Here are some of the biggest changes we need to make to mitigate climate change: Avoid additional carbon emissions by transitioning to renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro, and advance renewable energy storage. Stop deforestation. Cut global carbon emissions to net-zero by mid-century. Remove all the carbon emissions humans have released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution  more than 1.5 trillion tons. When you think of the best way to fight climate change[6], forests and trees are the cheapest, most powerful, and accessible solution to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Trees also enhance community resilience and help companies meet sustainability goals. Trees provide the necessities of life. They clean our air and water, improve biodiversity, soil, human health, food production, and the economy.Read The Carbon Footprint of Coffee[7] Takeaways from COP24A 'Rulebook' was agreed upon at COP24. Here are some of the positive highlights.Rulebook Sending Demand Signals to CompaniesMore ambitious national climate action plans are coming, likely by 2020 when the Paris Agreement officially goes into effect. Therefore, businesses must be ready for tougher climate goals and a growth of new sustainable development policies in the coming years. One thing is clear, companies that are proactive in using climate action to their competitive advantage will adapt well to the new clean and ecologically sustainable economy. One third of all human-caused carbon emissions came from land-use change and deforestation. Taking steps to measure and manage emissions from land-use will be important for many companies and the communities where they operate. Land-use change emissions are usually the most difficult set of emissions to address and the most overlooked by investors, companies, and countries.Read Planting Purpose with the Arbor Day Foundation[8] One Set of Rules for all CountriesDeveloped and developing countries will all have the same rules. In the past, global climate agreements had separate rules for rich and poor countries. This has been a major issue for political leaders in the U.S., European Union, and China. Standardized monitoring and reporting will make it easier to recognize the countries that are the leaders and identify countries that need help. Climate Finance In addition to climate financing from the public sector and multilateral development banks (MDB)  like the World Bank private climate finance continues to grow through initiatives like the U.S. Alliance for Sustainable Finance[9] and Climate Action 100+[10].These initiatives caused some complications for COP negotiators in how to count private sector climate finance funding in addition to other public monies from developed countries to assist developing countries in climate action investments. With the current rulebook, countries can report the complete loan value (public and private funds); not just the granted public and MDB money. Going forward, this will likely result in unlocking additional private sector capital for sustainable development projects. There is More Work that Needs to be Done in These Areas Welcoming the IPCC SR15 Report Since the release in October 2018, the latest IPCC Special Report has been an urgent call to climate action and a guide to use sustainable development as a tool to eliminate poverty and other systemic economic inequalities. Over 190 counties agreed to fully support this report as the primary guide to climate negotiations and actions.The science is clear, the impact of GHG emissions can be felt now and smart business leaders understand that ambitious action is critical and urgent. For example, oil and gas giant Shell is taking important steps to transition its business models to align with the scientific community[11]. Just TransitionThe clean economy and sustainable development goals should not be a model to reinforce existing economic inequalities (income inequality, lack of high-quality education, inadequate and costly healthcare) and only improve the environment. This economic transition needs to improve people's lives and be a better way of doing business. Recognizing that there needs to be fair labor transitions and major investments in worker's skill development is critically important. The transition of the workforce and creating high-quality jobs embedded with purpose is essential to a fair transition.

He also hosted a series of events at the UK Pavilion, showcasing British expertise and green innovation, including an event to celebrate the UK-Poland Partnership on electro mobility and zero emission vehicles. The Minister highlighted the need for all countries to demonstrate higher ambition in their international commitments, and pushed for a robust set of rules to underpin the Paris Agreement.The UK is committed to sharing its expertise and help developing countries in the global challenge of tackling climate change. The government has committed at least 5.8 billion of funding between 2016 and 2020 to help developing countries reduce emissions, and mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The UK will use our role leading on Climate Resilience at the 2019 UN Climate Summit to advance this work.FCO Minister Mark Field said:This year marks 10 years since Britain enacted the world's first comprehensive climate change law. It has been instrumental in our progress on climate change. Since then, we have decarbonised our economy faster than any other country in the G20, and we are leading the way in the shift from coal to renewable energy. But the reality is that we all need to do more.COP24 has brought us together across government, civil society and business boundaries, to build on the Paris Agreement 2015. It is vital parties make good on their commitment to finalise a set of rules that apply to all and will ensure continuous improvement in the fight against climate change.The conference will continue for another week, with Ministers from BEIS and DEFRA in attendance, as well as the Foreign Secretary's Special Representative on Climate Change.\l"

The COP24, also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Katowice, Poland, 2018, is the fourteenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. The conference is scheduled last two weeks, ending on December 14, 2018. The COP24 is the highly anticipated follow up to the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November of 2016, is an agreement between the parties to the UNFCCC to combat climate change. Specifically, the Paris Agreement includes a commitment to keep the global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius this century. The Paris Agreement also requires parties to the agreement to establish Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and to report regularly on their emissions and implementation efforts. Canada ratified the Agreement in October of 2016 and its NDC submission to the UNFCCC includes a commitment to achieve economy-wide GHG emission reductions of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030[1].

This year's COP24 is being held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 14.Rocky StartStraight out of the gate, however, theopening plenary was delayed on Sunday in part because of a request from Turkey to downgrade its status to that of 'developing country'  a move intended to soften Turkey's responsibilities. Developed countries  those listed in the Convention as Annex I countries  are expected to contribute more to climate financing and emission reductions than developing nations.The COP presidency agreed to schedule consultations on Turkey's proposal. Similarly distracting from the core purposes of the Conference is the position of host country Poland regarding its reliance upon coal for its electricity generation. Protestors picketed the site of a former coal mine in Poland over the weekend in an effort to shine a light on the country's coal industry. According to the World Energy Council[3],Poland consumes 77 million tonnes of coal per year, making it the tenth-largest coal consumer in the world and the second-largest in the EU, after Germany, securing 92% of its electricity and 89% of its heat from coal. Unfortunately, it would appear Poland has arrived at the Conference fully intent on ensuring everyone knows it is not ashamed of its coal use, considering that its own pavilion design ethos is prioritizing coal:So Polish exhibition stand is literally made of coal.

The planet is burning up. Carbon emissions are growing this year has been one of the highest growth rates in recent decades. This is not a matter to be taken anything but very, very seriously.The United States, I am sorry to say, does not represent the people of the United States. California, Washington, New York, Vermont and many, many other states, representing tens of millions of people, believe in the science of climate change believe, and demand that we reduce our carbon emissions.In California, we have set a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2045. We have taken other measures: We are introducing electric vehicles, building restrictions, cap-and-trade, renewable energy requirements upon our electric utilities there is so much we can do. I'm not saying we've gotten there our emissions per capita are entirely too high, but we are committed to do more.We recognize the science undergirding the knowledge we have today on climate change. If we're going to stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade from the industrial period, we have to take action now.The actions and the behavior of the leaders of the United States and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Russia and other countries are not acceptable. This is a suicide mission upon which you have embarked. Pull back, the people of the world are asking you men, women and children.From California, I can tell you, people are dying because of climate change in fires, in mudslides, in floods and other parts of the country, in New York and North Carolina and Louisiana and Texas. This is serious stuff.You represent humanity over 7 billion people are counting on you. Don't resort to what will be condemned in future years as nothing less than a criminal enterprise.Wake up, do the right thing. Leaders in Poland, this is your chance, this is your time.

At COP22 in Marrakech, back in 2016 we, as Poland, sought to be the host of COP24 this year, also in connection with the centenary of Poland's regaining independence. At the occasion afforded by this grand meeting we wanted to share with you our joy of the century of regaining independence.Today's concert - also in its contents - is a reference to the two aforementioned grand periods in the history of my country. We will hear music by Paderewski, but also by Wojciech Kilar. We will hear the music of an exquisite Polish pianist and composer, as well as an outstanding diplomat, to whom, among others, we are indebted for the restoration of independence in 1918, recognising his talent, his struggle for a free Poland; we consider him to be one of the six fathers of our independence. But we will also hear pieces by the contemporary composer: Wojciech Kilar, who died only five years ago. There will be historical music, but there will also be contemporary music.This is precisely the way we would look at those one hundred years of our history, at that Poland, which was reborn in 1918, and at today's Poland, which has been reborn, has gained full sovereignty and independence in the wake of developments of 1989. That Poland was arising from the ruins of World War I, the one today is still struggling to make up for the delays which communism inflicted on it. That Poland could only develop for 21 years, until 1939, i.e. until the beginning of World War II, the present-day Poland is almost 30 years old.See also: Statement by the President at the official opening of the Climate Summit and the COP24 Leaders' Summit Statement by the President of the Republic of Poland at the session devoted to the ""Just Transition"" declarationI would like to strongly emphasize that we, the Poles, welcoming you and rejoicing in your presence, are also very proud to be able to host the COP Conference on Climate Change in Poland for the third time, but also that this is happening at a time when we are a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.We are very proud that as a member of the world's largest organisation, the United Nations, we can take care of the world security in many aspects: the security of everyday life, and therefore also in the military aspect, but also in terms of secure future and security of future generations to come, which is the essence of works of COP conference.See also: President and UN Secretary General open COP24 climate summit in Katowice I firmly believe that this conference, which takes place in Katowice, a venue of symbolic nature for us, Poles, in terms of climate protection, in the city which develops at such a good pace, will produce excellent results expected by all of us. Above all, that it will contribute to global climate protection.And this is something I wish to all of you, this is something I wish for myself, for my compatriots and my Home Country, also in the context of the centenary of its regaining independence. I wish you a beautiful concert, great experiences and, above all, a successful COP24 summit in Katowice.Thank you.\l"

That global warming is already at around 10C warming, and Africa is already experiencing unprecedented disruptions of rainfall and temperature patterns and sea level riseiii.

This year's COP24 is being held in Katowice, Poland, from December 2 to 14.Rocky StartStraight out of the gate, however, theopening plenary was delayed on Sunday in part because of a request from Turkey to downgrade its status to that of 'developing country'  a move intended to soften Turkey's responsibilities. Developed countries  those listed in the Convention as Annex I countries  are expected to contribute more to climate financing and emission reductions than developing nations.The COP presidency agreed to schedule consultations on Turkey's proposal. Similarly distracting from the core purposes of the Conference is the position of host country Poland regarding its reliance upon coal for its electricity generation. Protestors picketed the site of a former coal mine in Poland over the weekend in an effort to shine a light on the country's coal industry. According tothe World Energy Council[3],Poland consumes 77 million tonnes of coal per year, making it the tenth-largest coal consumer in the world and the second-largest in the EU, after Germany, securing 92% of its electricity and 89% of its heat from coal.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA14","The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice Draws to a Close; Whilst Alarm Bells are sounding, Neutrino Energy offers answers","December 21, 2018 Friday 1:45 PM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire \~While the participants of this year's Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland tried in vain to replace the voluntary commitments agreed upon in 2015 at the Climate Change Conference in Paris with binding agreements, Germany's Neutrino Energy Group was busy working on a solution to the global climate problem with its team of international partners: ""Ignorance of the long-term consequences of global warming is nothing short of criminal negligence towards the coming generations, especially when one considers that science now has knowledge that can help us to find alternatives to our dependence on fossil fuel. This is a fact that cannot be denied!"" said Holger Thorsten Schubart, CEO of the Neutrino Energy Group, after one of many successful demonstrations of the Neutrino Power Cube in Berlin.Parallel to the occasion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, the Neutrino Energy Group presented a detailed demonstration of its Neutrino Energy Cell for a select audience. According to Neutrino Energy, this successful demonstration confirmed a notarized certification in which it had been documented that electricity can indeed be derived by using a small piece of neutrino foil coated with a layer of nanoparticles without the implementation of batteries or power cables. ""Energy converted from the invisible radiation spectrum is reality - measurable reality,"" summarized Holger Thorsten Schubart. The demonstration itself was conducted under the strictest of security conditions in the presence of journalists and experts in the field, and a video of the proceedings was made.\~It is already possible to cause light-emitting diodes to glow and to power small electrical devices through the use of neutrino energy - without cables, without batteries, without a generator. This method is similar to that used in the process of converting solar energy into electricity, but neutrino technology relies upon an invisible portion of the spectrum instead of light. The advantage of this method is obvious: Energy is available even in total darkness - 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.And comparable to the process of solar energy conversion, neutrino technology is scalable: The amount of energy produced stands in direct relation to the size of the power cells. ""In its early stages solar energy could only be used to power small electrical devices such as calculators,"" explained Schubart, ""but now we're seeing large-scale photovoltaic systems that produce enough energy for industrial applications. The same applies to neutrino energy. Of course, it takes time for people to accept technological innovations as reality, but scientific knowledge is in a process of constant development. The technological possibilities open to us today would have appeared utopic just a few short years ago.""Now that today's electrical devices are beginning to require less and less power, the time has finally come to move away from the large, centrally located power production facilities that date back to the early stages of western industrialization. Today it is much more sensible to think in terms of decentralization and low-voltage. None of the typical household electrical appliances in use today really needs 220 V of alternating current, but they still exist because manufacturers are forced to produce devices that are compatible with the present system. In the future, however, 12/24 or 48-volt direct current will be the norm for most daily applications, and the electricity required will not come from an environmentally unfriendly power plant, nor will it be transported long distances in a costly and wasteful process. There is no future for such outdated, ecologically unsound methods.The solution to today's energy problems is the neutrino. Neutrinos are high-energy subatomic particles from space that reach the earth by the billions in a constant flow. They also possess mass and are able to undergo weak interactions with other particles. This makes it possible for neutrinos to be used for the purpose of producing electricity by means of their kinetic energy, but it is important to note that neutrinos can be found everywhere, and they are influenced neither by the time of day nor by the prevailing weather conditions. The neutrino energy which reaches our planet on a daily basis is greater than that of all of the world's remaining fossil fuel reserves combined, and for this reason, neutrinos present humanity with a virtually unlimited source of energy.\~In the past, a disturbing amount of misinformation has been spread regarding the neutrino, but the actual method of implementing these particles to produce electrical energy is in fact characterized by\~simple wisdom - that strength and beauty\~are both elegant and at the same time highly logical. After the successful demonstration of a Neutrino Energy Cell, Schubart commented: ""Neutrinos are not captured when one converts their energy into electricity, just as a windmill doesn't capture the wind. They cause vibrations on an atomic level not unlike those of a miniature generator. And although the effect of this invisible radiation is extremely weak, this seeming weakness proves ultimately to be the strength of neutrino energy, because it is available everywhere in equal concentrations. This renders centrally located power plants and extended electrical grids spanning thousands of miles completely unnecessary.""In the end, it is the duty of mankind to seek out alternatives to the inefficient methods of energy production that are presently destroying our planet, and neutrino energy represents a way to finally end our dependence on fossil fuel and nuclear power.\~Press contact:\~Heiko SchulzeHaus der Bundespressekonferenz 0413D-10117\~BerlinTelephone: +49 30 20924013E-Mail:\~ HYPERLINK press@neutrino-energy.comWebsite:\~ HYPERLINK http://neutrino-energy.comNEUTRINO Deutschland GmbH is a German-American research and development company under the direction of the mathematician Holger Thorsten Schubart.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA16","WATERING THE PARIS AGREEMENT AT COP24","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Most people will experience climate change in the form of water - higher frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, an increase in waterborne diseases, and overloaded sewage systems that are unable to cope with new demands.At the same time, water offers some of the best solutions for reducing our climate impact and tackling effects of climate change. Yet, the role of water is poorly understood and often forgotten in the international climate debate.The Conference of the Parties (COP) 24At the meeting in Poland, the parties need to agree on the ""rulebook"" for the agreement, i.e. how it should be implemented. But water is largely absent from the agreement. However, many of the parties who ratified the Paris Agreement made water a central component of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).At the doorstep of finalizing the road map for implementing the Paris Agreement, the water community fears a missed opportunity to leverage water's full potential to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. With recent estimates saying that emissions must come down dramatically in the next few years, this is a risk the world cannot afford.Similarly, the most powerful manifestations of climate change are water-related and if that is not acknowledged, it will be difficult for countries to respond adequately. Climate change will also exacerbate water quality and variability, through changed precipitation patterns and changes to evapotranspiration and ultimately the water balance.Trees, landscapes and agriculture are, for example, key for reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Forests and wetlands act as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and play a central role in the hydrologic cycle, filtering, storing and regulating surface and groundwater flows.Forest and wetlands can also act as buffers and provide nature-based solutions to many infrastructure problems that increasingly need to be addressed by decision-makers, not least to make human settlements more resilient to floods and droughts.To ensure sustainable development, food security and economic stability in face of climate change, it is essential that water is acknowledged and integrated into efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its adverse effects.To take action is also a question of climate justice; the people most affected by effects of climate change are seldom themselves causing major emissions. Yet, at the same time they can be strong agents of change. Inclusion of marginalized groups and stakeholders is consequently key in resilient decision and policy making.The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and AGWA, a network hosted and co-chaired by SIWI, are honoured to be official co-coordinators of the MPGCA (Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Agenda) at COP24.Along with other partners, we have organised several climate resilient water related events.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA18","COP 24: Good News And Bad","December 16, 2018 Sunday 6:06 AM EST","PA Pundits","Dec 16, 2018( PA Pundits: HYPERLINK http://papundits.wordpress.comhttp://papundits.wordpress.comCOP24, two groups showed up with news - one group predicting a catastrophic disaster and the other with a message of hope and encouragement. Monday the U. S. held an event featuring U.S. government and industry officials showcasing the newest innovations in fossil fuels. These innovations will reduce emissions, create jobs and still provide reliable and affordable energy. The event was disrupted, with the sanction of the U.N., by youth standing and chanting 'keep it in the ground' and then exiting yelling 'shame on you, shame on you.' These young people had no desire to hear the good news about this cheap abundant energy. In contrast, Al Gore held an event on Wednesday walking out on stage like a rockstar. His presentation began with a slideshow of a satellite picture of planet Earth. He said we are using our £tmosphere like an open sewer' and in that sewer we are dumping 'man-made global warming pollutionequivalent to exploding 500,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year'. He spent the first hour of his 1 1/2 hour speech showing slides of the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters from all over the world. And of course, he blamed this on global warming. He claimed the civil war in Syria was caused by global warming not Hamas and the caravans headed toward the U.S. are migrants escaping a drought caused by global warming, not the crime and corrupt governments of their countries. When he made derogatory comments about fossil fuel companies and President Trump, the crowd laughed accordingly. When he concluded, the crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked off the stage. In the real world he might have been called on his lies, but the reality of COP24 is built on his lies. COP24 is working on a rulebook on how to implement the Paris Agreement. The rulebook will include a section called a 'Just Transition.' It refers to societies transitioning from fossil fuels to a carbon free society. This section is to soften the hard fact that there will be no 'just' transition, there will only be a 'forced' transition by governments. Most of the world is completely unaware that the United Nations is planning a complete 'transformational change' in their lives. To reach a carbon free atmosphere, which is impossible, but just trying to get there, will begin this transformational change with governments telling it's citizens what to eat, where to live, and what to drive. Al Gore said in a few years there will no longer be a combustible engine. A carbon free environment will require governments to take over farm and grazing land telling this sector what to grow and what animals to raise. One event on 'Food Systems and Climate Change' claimed that to keep the temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees, western countries will have to eat 50% less meat and more food will have to be grown on less land. Citizens of western countries will have to convert from a diet of meat and potatoes to a diet of vegetables, fruit, nuts and some grains. Government regulations will be required to change this behavior. Al Gore and the United Nations have been telling the world since the United Nations' Framework on Climate Change UNFCCC treaty was ratified by the U. S. Senate and signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, that we are experiencing global warming. And if the planet gets hotter than 1.5 degrees Celsius, oceans will rise, glaciers will melt and there will be no more planet Earth. But Earth's temperature has increased less than one degree Celsius. So to speed this process along, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC issued a new report right before COP24 predicting that mankind has 11 years to drastically change its behavior or the temperature is 'likely' to rise above 1.5 degrees C. This report is driving everything at COP24 and the words 'transformational change' are used in every conversation and event. The good news is COP24 was unable to include the IPCC report into its language because four countries refused to recognize it - the U. S, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia. The four largest oil producing countries. The good news is fossil fuels are not our enemy. This abundant, easily accessed energy lifts societies out of poverty. The bad news is societies will never be able to reach a carbon free atmosphere even with heavy government interventions and alternative energy is so expensive poverty will only increase. The bad news is the climate change train has left the station and it seems, it will not be stopped. The good news is the U.S. has president Trump.

The agreement established ways in which each of the world's developed nations could reach set climate goals, specifically the goal of preventing global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Between COP21 and COP24 a lot has happened: the United States pulled out of the Paris agreement, and despite the dire warnings of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, more and more policies are being geared toward environmental deregulation.As COP24Why is this meeting important?Continued attention at a global scale is critical for solving the crisis our civilization is currently facing. Meetings like COP24 and reports like those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the US Fourth National Climate Synthesis are ways of keeping the matter in the public view.Is it still possible to keep global temperatures from reaching the 2 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris agreement?It is indeed possible to achieve these goals, but only if immediate serious action is taken to reduce emissions and sequester carbon and other greenhouse gases. The longer we delay, the harder it will be to reverse or slow the pace of change.What role does the United States plays in reaching the goal? What about other countries?At the national level I do not expect changes will be adopted in the near term, unless some major event or grassroots activity leads to a groundswell by citizens for change. I am, however, optimistic that as people become increasingly aware of what is happening, they will engage in the political processes necessary to change minds and policies. As result, effective solutions will be found and adopted.This is a matter that everyone on the planet needs to be addressing. Fortunately more and more people are doing something.What changes can we expect to see after COP24?I think public concerns about the impacts of climate change are going to continue to grow as more and more people realize that serious things are happening now and that conditions will only get worse in the years to come if no action is taken.In the fight against climate change, doing nothing or giving up is not an option for anyone who cares about the well-being of our country, children, and the beauty and diversity of life on our planet.\l"

Instead, negotiations stalled, and Parties deferred this item for further work in 2019, missing an opportunity to inspire businesses to accelerate action.""If countries want to ramp up climate action, they must get more serious about international cooperation through market incentives,"" said Dirk Forrister, IETA President and CEO. ""But we should not let this slow us down - we don't have time to waste. While we wait for the rules to firm up, committed countries and businesses should team up to start building cooperative markets - and the rule writers can catch up later.""""Sound environmental accounting is the bedrock of market-based climate policies,"" said Stefano De Clara, IETA's Director for International Policy. ""Nearly every country recognises this essential element. Yet a slim minority blocked agreement in Katowice and insisted that the new crediting mechanism should not require a project host to properly reflect exports in their Nationally Determined Contributions.""""This would invite double-counting and erode confidence in both the public and private sector. So it is a good thing that the majority rejected this weakening measure.""At COP24, IETA and Environmental Defense Fund launched the Katowice Declaration on Sound Carbon Accounting to highlight the need for a robust system to avoid the double-counting of emission reductions.The likely impacts of the delayed decisions on emissions markets are unclear. The UNFCCC's new mechanism planned under Article 6.4 will remain closed until rules are agreed. This means project developers, who aim to apply to the UNFCCC for carbon credit approvals under the Paris Agreement, will remain on hold.However, they may pursue the growing markets being run by individual governments, or voluntary markets served by independent standards organisations. In addition, markets set up under the Kyoto Protocol will remain open, although their future, meant to be defined by the rule book, is uncertain.Importantly, Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement allows countries to link markets ""consistent with"" UN guidance. In the absence of such guidance, they are free to set up market systems that link together to meet targets and accelerate action at lower cost.A number of countries have already banded together to explore market harmonisation and future linkages under Article 6.2. Voluntary markets are also growing more vibrant as corporate leaders respond to investor and customer interest in climate responsibility. Domestic and international action through markets will continue to grow and deliver emission reductions, despite the anti-climatic end of COP24.MSTRUCK-6554399 MSTRUCK\l"

They will set the course for action on climate change by discussing the implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement[4] which aims to coordinate international effort to halt warming at 1.5C. The COPs receive significant media attention and, sometimes, even notable public interest[5]. They take place every year as an opportunity for countries to collectively assess progress on dealing with climate change. In 2018 the negotiations kick off barely two months after a report[6] by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the international community only has a 12-year window to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, 24 years after the first COP there is a deep disconnect[7] between how urgently the world needs effective climate policy and the pace of discussing global mechanisms on how to abate greenhouse gas emissions. A history of failure The first COP meetings held in the 1990s led to the creation of the Kyoto Protocol[8] in 1997, which set binding emissions targets for developed countries over two 'commitment periods' (2008-2012 and 2013-2020). However, the Kyoto agreement failed as the US did not ratify it and because several inconclusive conferences followed its implementation.

These new rules will help ""create a stronger foundation for countries to implement the historic accord,"" said Ceres CEO and President Mindy Lubber.Investors and businesses will benefit from the new rules as they will ""improve transparency and allow for consistent reporting and monitoring for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, enabling stepped-up climate ambition"" she added.Lubber said:The urgency to tackle the world's greatest sustainability and climate challenges has never been greater. That urgency was on full display at COP 24, especially on the heels of a sobering report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that called for dramatically increasing the pace and scale of greenhouse gas emission reductions.The investor and business community is acutely aware of the economic imperative of climate action. That's why a record number of investors -- 415 investors with $32 trillion in assets under management -- called on governments last week to not only scale up ambition to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to also put a price on carbon and phase out thermal coal power.And, at the U.S. Climate Action Center at COP24, We Are Still In leaders highlighted the 500 companies that have already committed to science-based targets to reduce emissions, and the hundreds of other companies that have already committed to power their operations with 100 percent renewable energy.It is clear that the transition to a low-carbon economy is well underway and momentum is building. But, we know there is much more work to be done, and government and private sector leaders will need to step up climate action by 2020 in order to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals of limiting warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5-degrees CelsiusCeres and its network members are more committed than ever before to ensuring that the U.S. is on track to meet and ratchet up the ambition of its goals under the Paris Agreement. The next year will be critical for leadership that accelerates climate action and strengthens policies both at home and abroad.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6555286 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA38","Six Takeaways From COP24 Business, Industry Day","December 10, 2018 Monday 5:47 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news:As new scientific research elucidates the need to take urgent and comprehensive climate action on the global level, business charted paths to a low-carbon economy at a major event in Katowice, Poland.At what has been billed as the most important global climate conference since the Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) three years ago, business discussed how to collectively raise climate ambition at the COP24 Business and Industry Day in Katowice.Business Day was hosted by ICC, which is the business and industry 'Focal Point' to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - making ICC the voice of business in the UN climate process. We would like to thank the partners who helped make this day possible.Here are six key takeaways from the day's discussions:1. The time to act is nowICC's Director of Green Growth Majda Dabaghi, who leads the ICC delegation to COP24, opened up the event, highlighting the ground-breaking report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 C of Global Warming. The report warns that urgent changes are needed to avoid the vast economic and social costs of climate change. Governments and business need to collectively ramp up plans to cut carbon emissions and the time to act is now, Ms Dabaghi said.2. We're all in this togetherMany of the day's speakers from both the public and private sectors expressed the fundamental need for collective action in raising climate ambition. At COP23 last year, the Fijian host government introduced the world to the concept of 'Talanoa', referring to the country's national tradition of inclusive and constructive dialogue.""We all need to work together to tackle climate change. Working in coalitions is key to succeed. That's the spirit of the Talanoa Dialogue we launched at COP23 under the Fijian presidency,"" said Inia Seruiratu, Fiji's Climate Champion.3. Climate action is a business opportunityIn one of the day's most engaging presentations, Bertrand Piccard, the Initiator and Chairman of Solar Impulse, delivered a powerful speech without even mentioning the phrase 'climate change, because ""building energy efficient and environmental friendly solutions is the biggest business opportunity of the century"".4. Delivering the Paris Rulebook will empower companies for good""If you could say one thing to governments here at COP24, what would be it be?"" Ms Dabaghi asked before one panel discussion closed. The responses from the business leaders speaking were remarkably clear. Enabling policy frameworks and delivering the 'Paris Rulebook' - an implementing framework that shows how governments plan on reaching Paris Agreement goals - are key to giving companies the certainty they need to take ambitious climate action.5. We need to talk about genderA powerful series of remarks also came from Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg, Director of African Women in Agriculture, in Kenya. Ms Kamau-Rutenberg explained that it is impossible to talk about climate adaptation in Africa without talking about agriculture - and the way African agriculture is produced is very gendered. In Africa, women play a central role in agricultural production. Climate discussions thus need to link both to agriculture and gender.6.

On Sunday, the United Nations will kick off critical negotiations on how to address the problem collectively and urgently, during a two-week climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, known as 'COP24'. IOM/Amanda Nero A boy watches the shore from a boat near Sirajganj, a community affected by severe erosion that has left many displaced. Sirajganj, Bangladesh. October 2016Thousands of world leaders, experts, activists, creative thinkers, and private sector and local community representatives will gather to work on a collective action plan to realize critical commitments made by all the countries of the world in Paris, three years ago. UN News put together this guide to COP 24 to answer some of the biggest questions you may have and make sure you're all caught up, with a ringside seat on the action.1. The basics: UNFCCC, UNEP, WMO, IPCC, COP 24, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement... can someone please make sense of all this? These acronyms and place names all represent international tools and terms that, under the leadership of the UN, were created to help advance climate action globally. They all play a specific and different role in focussing us all on achieving environmental sustainability. Here's how it fits together: In 1992, the UN organised a major event in Rio de Janeiro called the Earth Summit, in which theUN Framework Convention on Climate Change[2](UNFCCC[3]) was adopted. In this treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere' to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories. Every year since the treaty entered into force in 1994, a 'conference of the parties' - a COP - is held to discuss how to move forward and, since there have been 23 COPs so far, this year's will be the 24th, or 'COP 24'. Because the UNFCCC had non-binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and no enforcement mechanism, various 'extensions' to this treaty were negotiated during these COPs, including: the famousKyoto Protocol[4]in 1997, which defined emission limits for developed nations to be achieved by 2012; and theParis Agreement[5], adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing. Two agencies support the scientific work of the UN on climate change: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP[6]) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO[7]). Together, they set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC[8]) in 1988, which is made of hundreds of experts, dedicated to assessing data and providing reliable scientific evidence for the climate action negotiations, including the upcoming ones in Katowice. 2. The UN seems to be having a lot of conferences and summits on this subject Is any of it, well...fruitful? These meetings have been vital to find a global consensus on an issue that requires a global solution. Although progress has been much slower than needed, the process  which has been as challenging as it is ambitious - has worked to bring all countries with very different circumstances, together. Progress has been made every step of the way. Some of the concrete actions taken so far prove one thing: climate action has a real positive impact and can truly help us prevent the worst. Here are some notable achievements so far: -At least 57 countries[9]have managed to bring their greenhouse gas emissions down to the levels required to curb global warming. - There are at least51 'carbon pricing' initiatives[10]in the works; charging those who emit carbon dioxide per tonne emitted. - In 2015,18 high-income countries[11]committed to donating US$100 billion a year for climate action in developing countries. So far, over $70 billion have been mobilised. 3. Why is everyone talking about the Paris Agreement? The Paris document - which provides the world with the only viable option for addressing climate change - has beenratified by 184 parties[12], and entered into force in November 2016. The commitments contained in it are significant: - Limit global average temperature rise to well below 2C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. - Ramp up financing for climate action, including the annual $100 billion goal from donor nations for lower-income countries. - Develop national climate plans by 2020, including their self-determined goals and targets. - Protect beneficial ecosystems that absorb greenhouse gases, including forests. - Strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. - Finalize a work programme to implement the agreement in 2018. The United States, which joined the Agreement in 2016, announced its intention in July 2017, to withdraw from it. However, the nation remains a party to the Agreement at least until November 2020, which is the earliest that it can legally request to withdraw from it. 4. Why is +1.5C a critical l"

On top of that, thanks to our powerful washing machines, our clothes pollute the ocean with microfibers equating to approximately 50 million plastic bottles each year.Conversation and action around sustainability and climate change has been quiet and slow to come within the sector, but Monday marks another move toward collective change. A fashion industry charter for climate action was formally launched at this year's United Nations , COP24, in Katowice, Poland.Support for the new charter has come from high street retailers, luxury fashion houses and other suppliers within the sector. Stella McCartney, Burberry, Adidas and H&M Group are included in the list of 40 signatories.Stella McCartney, whose eponymous label is already a leading player in sustainable fashion, was one of the founding signatories. She announced her involvement in late November during Voices, a fashion industry conference staged in the English countryside, where she was also honored for her work in the sector.During an interview at the conference, she acknowledged the complexities of working sustainably and responsibly: ""There are millions of limitations from a design and creative point of view.

This aims to ensure that health systems become climate resilient, and that health prevention and promotion are fully integrated with climate services, as per recommendations from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).The declaration was signed at the XLIII Meeting of Health Ministers of MERCOSUR and Associated States, which took place on 23 November in Montevideo, Oriental Republic of Uruguay. It comes at a time when leaders from all over the world are gathering at the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. There, countries will discuss the implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to coordinate informational efforts to reduce global warming.""Climate change has increasingly become a huge threat to both health systems and public health in the Region of the Americas.""Climate change has been deemed ""the biggest global health threat of the 21st century."" Indeed, climate and weather impact health in a variety of ways, including via extreme weather and disasters, heatwaves, food and water contamination, and an increase in vector-borne diseases. Climate and weather changes also impact socioeconomic systems which can affect public health, including through food and water insecurity, resource scarcity and forced displacements.""Climate change has increasingly become a huge threat to both health systems and public health in the Region of the Americas,"" said Dr. Marcos Espinal, Director of Communicable Diseases and Environmental Determinants of Health at PAHO. ""It is vital that countries in the Region commit to fully integrating health into all their climate change adaptation plans. The Mercosur declaration is a great example of this commitment.""Impacts of climate change on health are already being felt throughout the Americas. Rising temperatures can provoke heat stroke, particularly in the elderly, and increase the duration of droughts and the risk of wildfires. Over the past two years alone, more than 200,000 people in the Americas were displaced as a result of forest fires, and millions of dollars incurred in structural damages.Rising temperatures also increase the number of intense tropical storms and floods hitting the Region, with 335 climate-related disasters occurring between 2005 and 2014, a 14% increase from the previous decade. In 2017, more than 625,000 people were affected by intense rains in Peru, and over 270 deaths were registered in Colombia due to mudslides. Climate change is also likely to expand the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases.PAHO is working to support regional initiatives and actions on climate change and health, including through the provision of capacity building and technical support for multi-hazard early warning systems, and on the preparation of Health National Adaptation Plans to Climate Change (N-NAPs). PAHO is also supporting the health sector to lead by example, through sustainable procurement and the implementation of ""Smart"" health care facilities, which aim to increase their resilience to disasters while reducing their environmental impact.The Mercosur declarationThe Mercosur declaration commits Ministries of Health of member countries to lead the development of health strategies as essential elements of National Climate Change Adaptation Plans (H-NAPs). These strategies focus on recognizing health vulnerabilities relating to climate change and propose ways to increase health system resilience and reduce inequalities.The declaration also commits countries to generate evidence on health and climate change in order to develop indicators, facilitate information exchange and inform decision-making.Health and climate change at COP24COP24 is taking place in Katowice, Poland, from 3-14 December 2018.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA46","#COP24 - Poland, Europe, and coal: trolling or misunderstanding?","December 18, 2018 Tuesday 12:55 PM EST","EU Reporter","Dec 18, 2018( EU Reporter: HYPERLINK http://www.eureporter.cohttp://www.eureporter.coCOP24, international media coverage has harshly criticized the event's Polish hosts for their 'provocative[1]' spotlighting of Poland's coal industry and broader 'coal addiction[2]'. The controversies in Katowice have re-ignited tensions between Poland and the European Union over emissions targets, energy transitions, and the country's enduring reliance on coal power. Beneath the surface, however, they may also help representatives from the industrialized countries at the event better appreciate just how much of a sacrifice they are asking their counterparts from the world's emerging markets to make, writes Louis Auge. Located in the coal mining region of Silesia, Katowice was always going to be a controversial choice for the COP24 climate talks. Michal Kurtyka, the COP24's president and a state secretary in Poland's Ministry of Energy, described[3] the decision to bring the conference to Katowice as a strategic attempt to put on display a city and region that is being asked to transition away from its lifeblood. While outside criticisms of Poland are severe, a closer look at the domestic context explains the country's enduring attachment to coal power. Coal accounts for 80%[4] of Poland's electricity generation and employs 85,000 people, serving as a key pillar of an economy that has only been considered 'developed[5]' as of the past three months. These factors are critical to understanding Warsaw's opposition to the European Union's carbon emissions reduction aims and decarbonization plans. While most of Europe expects[6] to be coal-free by 2025, Poland recently announced[7] it expects coal to meet 60% of its energy needs in 2030. As Kuryka put it[8]: 'How does one tell a region of 5 million people - in over 70 cities across the region - to just move on, your world is that of the past?' Of course, Poland is hardly the only COP24 participant that relies on coal to meet its energy needs. In fact, the Poles are merely saying loudly what a number of emerging economies have been telling the international community for years. Key players in the global climate debate, including India and China but also the ASEAN countries and major economies in sub-Saharan Africa, rely on coal and will continue to do so for decades to come. While coal has been dying out in other parts of the world, Southeast Asia's appetite for coal has been on the rise. With an aim to achieve universal access to electricity by the early 2030s, and a projected 60% increase[9] in energy use by 2040, coal power is expected to account for 40% of the growth in energy demand in the region. Not only does Asia currently account for three-quarters[10] of global coal consumption, but three-fourths of coals plants either in the planning stages or under construction are located in Asia. Even in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touted himself as a proponent of clean energy, the government continues to build coal mines and plants. As an affordable and easily accessible energy source, coal is the bedrock of the power grid in a country where up to 400 million people[11] still lack access to reliable electricity. Switching away from coal presents unique challenges for emerging countries, most of which are still working towards providing their citizens with reliable electricity. 'With the Germans, they can say 'We're moving from driving a Corolla to a BMW', while we are still trying to get the bicycle,' said[12] Themisile Majola, South Africa's deputy energy minister. 'They're talking about different technologies, we're talking about access.' Recent comments by World Bank president Jim Yong Kim helped highlight this dichotomy between industrialized and emerging economies, with the developing world facing energy shortages and resenting outside pressure not to exploit coal. As Kim encapsulated[13] the arguments put forth by developing countries: 'You've come to us in Africa who have put almost none of the carbon in the air and you can tell us we can't have baseload electricity. You're outraged by climate change, we have almost no responsibility for putting the carbon in the air and yet you're telling us we can't develop and have baseload energy because we can't use a single drop of fossil fuel for our own energy needs. And I can tell you, when I hear that from our leaders, from people in industry, in places like Africa, it's compelling to me.' What, then, are the ways forward for those COP24 participants who see greater urgency to reduce carbon emissions? One avenue is to dedicate greater focus to carbon capture and utilization[14] (CCU) or storage[15] (CCS) technologies. These can both reduce emissions from coal plants around the planet and reduce them from other industrial sources. Simply put, CCS is a process of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it, whereas in CCU, the CO2 is used to make other substances, like plastics, concrete or biofuel. Another path forward: working closer to home. Coal has become the global fossil fuel bogeyman, but oil and natural gas are also largely responsible[16] for failures to meet global emissions goals. The continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions, even as coal power generation decl"

Her protests didn't start at COP24. Thunberg began cutting class back home to sit outside the Swedish parliament to protest against what she saw as a lack of ambitious climate actions by her government.

'We have higher emissions, we need to reduce emissions,' she says. 'We need to do that to give a chance to developing countries to improve their standard of living. For example, buildings and infrastructures. How can we expect developing countries to care about climate change if we, who already have everything, don't care?'

Photo: Episcopal Church, via Facebook[Episcopal News Service] A delegation of Episcopalians who represented Presiding Bishop Michael Curry at this month's United Nations climate conference in Poland is heralding the conference members' agreement on next steps toward reining in global warming and the successful resolution of a key impasse over word choice.The Episcopal delegation ""bore witness to significant developments in international climate change policy,"" the delegation's leader, California Bishop Marc Andrus, said this week in a written statement about the conclusion of , known officially as the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Nearly 200 countries met Dec. 2-14 in Katowice, Poland, with the goal of developing a framework for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep global warming under the threshold of 2 degrees Celsius that scientists predict is necessary to prevent a spiraling catastrophe of melting glaciers, rising sea levels and related weather extremes.In 2016, the Episcopal Church was granted U.N. observer status, which allows members of the delegation to brief U.N. representatives on the Episcopal Church's General Convention climate resolutions and to attend related meetings. At COP24, the delegation promoted a more ambitious goal of keeping global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius.Andrus said most member nations ""acknowledged the need to ramp up ambitions for reducing carbon emissions, while also attending to a 'just transition' for the most heavily impacted countries who are also the most under-resourced for adaption.""COP24 President Micha\'c5, Kurtyka called the successful negotiations on implementing the Paris Agreement ""a great achievement.""""Our common efforts didn't consist solely of producing texts or defending national interests,"" Kurtyka said in an onl"

Rules necessary to ensure the most vulnerable communities are not left alone to deal with the adverse effects in a world in which global warming has risen above 1.5C. The effects of global warming are already affecting countries and regions around the world. This is especially the case for Small Developing Island Nations (SIDS) like the Seychelles. The Republic of the Seychelles is one of the island nations that could completely disappear fom the earth due to sea level rise. So what can a country with one of the smallest GDPs in the world do to prevent the global catastrophe lapping at its shores? ""Although we are challenged due to our small size and isolation from other nations, the Seychelles is incorporating the sustainable development goals into [its] businesses and communities, to make its economy more resilient and to help protect the people of our global community,"" explained Wallace Cosgrow, Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change of the Republic of the Seychelles, during a side event at COP24. ""With regards to The Seychelles' greenhouse gas emissions, 90% come from its energy sector, almost all of its energy is fossil fuel based. Now we have decided to lead by example and have turned to the path of renewable energy,"" said Theodore Marguerite an Analyst from the Seychelles Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. ""The SIDS have historically lagged behind with in the transition to sustainable energy sources; they have been highly dependent on coal. But we are driving the change by going 100% renewable,"" Minister Cosgrow added. Similar challenges and ambitions can be found in other Small Developing Island States. Mauritius, for example, ""has plenty of sunshine and wind it could use, but it relies on fossil fuel sources for its energy instead,"" lamented Jugeeswar Seewoobaduth from the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of the Republic of Mauritius. The Republic of Mauritius has traditionally shown a progressive stance on climate policy within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of the Climate Vulnerable Group (CVF), a group of countries vulnerable to climate impacts and known for pushing for higher climate ambition and leading by example within the UN climate talks. Despite their high ambitions, several SIDS have to deal with barriers to access concessional finance for their mitigation and adaptation plans; most are considered middle-income countries due to their small population size. Davinah Milenge Uwella from the African Development Bank highlighted the range of financial institutions and mechanisms that the Bank has deployed to support Regional Member Countries including Seychelles and Mauritius, to transition to green growth. These include financial facilities such as the Facility for Energy Inclusion (FEI); and the green mini-grid programme under the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa. To make this shift to 100% renewable energy generation and use, investments and integrated policy are crucial, adds Stefan Wehner from the Thinktank greenwerk: ""If we want these countries to succeed, we need to provide integrated energy roadmaps, investments infrastructure, technology and policy creation.""\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA57","COP24: A QUICK POST-MORTEM","December 20, 2018 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The Conference of the Parties 24 () of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has ended on December 15, with the usual extension of more than a day to complete the deliberations. Almost 25,000 delegates from the government, non-government, private sector and faith community attended the meeting, which was mandated to adopt the Rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement (PA). Analysis of the event is forthcoming yet, but based on my experience as a member of the Bangladesh delegation, I regard the ultimate outcome as not satisfactory, almost frustrating, but way better than the ""Brokenhagen"" of 2009.The most rancorous elements that appeared at the meeting are: recognition of the science of climate change as presented by the IPCC 1.5C Special Report; urgency of ramping up the mitigation ambition to match the call of science; fixing the share/levy of emissions trading transferable to a yet-to-be structured mechanism, replacing the Clean Development Mechanism under the soon-to-die Kyoto Protocol; the issues of climate finance (CF); and the agenda of Loss & Damage (L&D). Some elements have been agreed upon: that all countries will have to report their emissions and show progress in cutting every two years from 2024, after the global stock-taking at COP29 in 2023.The contestations cantered particularly on two issues: how to recognise the latest IPCC Report, which entails how clearly countries should signal the need for greater mitigation to stay below the temperature limit of 1.5 degrees, the aspirational goal set under the PA. The agreed text just hints, instead of using strong language, at the need for more ambitious emission reduction pledges before 2020, which frustrates the most vulnerable countries, UN organisations and NGO activists. With tensions mounting, the UN Secretary-General Guterres had to visit the meeting several times to plead for progress. Despite settling on some parts of the Paris Rulebook, countries failed to agree on substantive issues, such as defining the ex-ante and ex-post provision of information on CF.Actually, CF continues to be one of the most rancorous issues in all COPs, since 2015 when developed countries pledged to deliver USD 100 billion a year from 2020. Even before COP24, the rules governing CF reporting under Article 9 of the PA were expected to be direly contentious. The rules cover Article 9.5 of the PA (reporting on the projected availability of CF in future), and Article 9.7 (reporting on money already delivered). The agreed text now says developed countries ""shall"" and developing countries ""should"" report on any CF they provide, but the sought-after criteria-based common reporting format could not be agreed.But in absence of an agreed understanding of what CF is, countries have wiggle room for creative accounting. This was starkly evident again at COP24. The decision language under both parts of Article 9 is relatively permissive, which allows countries to report the full value of loans, rather than the ""grant equivalent"" share as CF. Another persistent issue is the ""double/triple"" counting of the same money, provided through all the Rio conventions or different delivery channels. The fixing of accounting methodologies subjectively by finance providers does not allow any comparability among them. An additional prick in CF is its extreme fragmentation in delivery, with channels both public and private ranging from 99 to over 500 including over 22 multilateral CF funds. There are too many overlaps involving huge transaction costs, generating frustrations both at delivery and receiving ends. This warrants a ""thinning out"" of weedy tendrils of CF bureaucracies, which often clog the money to reach the target communities. So, one good decision at COP24 was the organising of a workshop next year on ""effectiveness"" of CF to measure its impacts at the ground. The Bangladesh delegation strongly pushed for this.Just weeks before the meeting in Katowice, the OECD published a report on CF, which shows that in 2017 their members have provided USD 56.7 billion as CF to developing countries, but it did not specify the methodologies of reaching this number. We may recall the episode of 2015 in Paris when an OECD representative in a session on long-term finance mentioned that in 2014 they provided USD 62 billion as CF, the Indian delegate, based on their analysis, responded that only USD 2.2 billion could be regarded as credible CF. This Himalayan gulf in numbers of claimed CF delivery and actual receipt shows no sign of bridging yet.Another interesting facet is that though grants account for over a third of bilateral CF, it is a measly 10 percent of multilateral funding. But the most vulnerable countries' persistent demand has been to have grants as CF mainly to enhance their adaptive capacity. Also the adaptation finance remains at one-fifth of total CF, though the pledge has been to maintain a balance in support between mitigation and adaptation. What is more frustrating is that the long-agreed principles of CF under the UNFCCC, such as ""new and additional"" CF has been totally diluted, with no signs of resuscitation.However, amidst the clouds shrouding the canvas of CF, there is some money flowing in to the Adaptation Fund, to the tune of USD 129 million, and some new pledges of replenishment to the Green Climate Fund, where Germany pledged an amount of USD 1.5 billion, followed by countries like France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, UK and others. It is expected that the EU will lead to fill the gap left by the US-declared withdrawal from the PA.Finally, the Bangladesh delegation, I must say, fared well in the negotiations in the streams of Adaptation, Mitigation, CF, and Loss and Damage. In the future, it has the potential of doing a lot better, given that more rigorous homework is done before the meetings. This warrants analytical deliberations well before each meeting to generate novel ideas for consensus-building among like-minded alliances. As climate negotiations now stand as the number one global public diplomacy issue involving all countries and thousands of diverse stakeholders, our government is expected to put greater efforts in capacity building of the negotiators, particularly young ones, to carry our flag aloft in the most visible and most widely-publicised diplomatic forum.Mizan Khan is professor, Environmental Management, North South University, and currently, visiting professor, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland, College Park, USA.This story was originally published by The Daily Star, Bangladesh\l"

The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue. In calling for the President to reconsider his calamitous decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, Menendez described how New Jersey, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is already doing its part as a national leader for clean energy jobs and climate change resilience.  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice, Poland to finalize the rulebook on implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality. For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable. Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone. That includes reports from the world\' s top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts. What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth\' s climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American. There\' s a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract. Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises. Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy. While we shouldn\' t point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change\' s harsh reality are undeniable. It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8\'b0 Celsius (1.4\'b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975. It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks. It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average the highest annual average in the satellite record. None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, \' We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.\' This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week. Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement\' s entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures.

(TBM), a company that develops, manufactures and sells paper and plastic alternative products made from a limestone-based material known as 'LIMEX', is close to launching LIMEX and Plax bags on the market as alternatives to single-use plastic bags.Furthermore, TBM is honored to participate in COP24(Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) as a delegation of Japan.On 12th December 2018 (Local Time 13:15-14:30), TBM will host an event, 'LIMEX - Limestone paves the road to a de-carbonised circular economy', in Japan Pavilion. Here, TBM will introduce the concept model of alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEX and Plax.BackgroundCompanies today are expected to take actions against environmental issues to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to combat plastic pollutions. Regulations against plastics have been enforced in recent months internationally and there is a growing demand for plastic alternative materials.Anticipating the demand growth for biomass-based biodegradable resin, TBM has announced the 'Biodegradable LIMEX' at 'Brussels SDG Summit 2018,' which TBM has partnered with. The Biodegradable LIMEX is composed of limestone as the main raw material and biomass-based biodegradable resin.Furthermore, by working together with Bioworks, TBM's subsidiary that develops a highly functional modifier for bioplastics, we will promote the market application of Plax (Modified Polylactic Acid Compound), the biomass-based new material. We strive to contribute to a decarbonized society and a circular economy. Given the situation that only 9 % of plastic waste, which cumulatively accounts for 6.3 billion tons until 2015 globally,is recycled, TBM has partnered with local governments and companies to promote 'LIMEX Upcycle' to contribute to raising resource efficiency.Overview of the alternatives to single-use plastic bags made of LIMEXPlastic packaging including single-use plastic bags accounts for the largest market share in the plastic industry. Considering the plastic waste issue, progressive regulations against single-use plastics, and greenhouse gas emissions, there is significance in replacing the conventional single-use plastic bags with more environmentally friendly material. Within this context, TBM will introduce the products below at COP24. TBM aims for these products to be launched in the Spring of 2019.The event at Japan PavilionTitle: LIMEX - Limestone paves the road to a de-carbonised circular economyDate and Time: 12th December 2018 (Local Time 13:15-14:30)Organizer: TBMEvent Overview:Part 1 Talk - The Future with LIMEX [30 min]Resource efficiency driven by circular economy plays an important role to reduce GHG emissions.

GarberPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary , Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific AffairsKatowice, PolandDecember 12, 2018President of COP 24, Excellencies, and Distinguished Delegates; I am so pleased to be with you today. I am grateful to our gracious hosts here in Poland for their hospitality, excellent preparation, and leadership.The United States supports a balanced approach that promotes economic growth, improves energy security, and protects the environment.The U.S. record of accomplishment and leadership is clear: Our energy-related CO2 emissions have fallen by 14 percent since 2005, even as our economy has grown by over 19 percent.As President Trump announced last year, the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, absent the identification of terms that are more favorable to the American people. He also made clear that the United States will continue to be a leader in clean energy, innovation, and emissions reduction. Our National Security Strategy declares The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while expanding our economy. This achievement, which can serve as a model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains, not from onerous regulation.The global climate conversation needs to embrace not only aspiration but todays reality. The U.S. approach incorporates the realities of the global energy mix and uses all energy sources and technologies as cleanly and efficiently as possible, including fossils fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable energy.This diverse energy portfolio is possible thanks to early stage research and development and private sector finance and innovation.A quarter of our energy-sector CO2 reduction has come from utilizing natural gas. The U.S. natural gas boom is the result of years of U.S. innovation and RandD investment. General Electric, the U.S. National Laboratories, and American entrepreneurs all played a role in perfecting the extraction techniques that unleashed Americas natural gas revolution.RandD and operational experience are bringing down the cost of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage or CCUS. One hybrid coal and gas power plant in Texas captures more than 90 percent of the emissions from its flue gas stream. CCUS enhances our energy security and economic development and preserves the environment.The United States is home to the worlds largest nuclear power industry. Thanks to significant investment by the U.S. Department of Energy and the private sector, the first Small Modular Reactors will be operational by the mid-2020s. They will be flexible, scalable, easier to finance, and capable of powering remote areas and micro-grids.In 2017, the United States exported more advanced energy technology than any other country in the world. The United States is also the worlds largest oil and gas producer and the second largest producer of renewable energy.In 2018, the United States announced new RandD funding in nuclear, solar, marine, and fossil energy. We are making significant progress in Smart Grids, advanced storage technologies, wind, and hydropower.In sum, the United States will continue to engage our many partner countries and allies around the world to reduce emissions, to continue to adapt to climate change, and to respond to natural disasters. We will also work with other countries to develop and deploy a broad array of technologies, as we continue to promote economic growth, improve energy security, and protect the environment.Thank you.\l"

Therefore, RICS have been developing a comprehensive package including guidance, research, capacity building and strategic partnership to forge a two-pronged approach.Climate-change-carbon-emissionsThe built environment sector's carbon emissionsWhole Life Carbon Assessment for the Built Environment, 1st edition (3.10MB)20 Nov 2017Our approach is essentially about equipping professionals with the necessary tools to reflect sustainability aspects within their daily valuation practice and at the same time to work with other organisations to sensitise investors vis-a-vis the risks of not future-proofing their buildings against forthcoming legislation and changing market trends. We therefore actually require the inclusion and consideration of these aspects as part of valuation reports.Ursula Hartenberger, RICS Head of SustainabilityRICS have played a key role in developing the Energy Efficient Mortgages Action Plan (EeMAP) definition of what constitutes an energy efficiency mortgage and developing EeMAP's supporting tools, such as a valuation checklist and the accompanying guidance for mortgage lending valuers. Given the importance of the project for market transformation across Europe, it was presented by one of the project's pilot-scheme banks as part of a dedicated Human Settlements Action Event on financing multi-level action at COP 24 this week.It is estimated that across the EU, Euros100 billion will need to be invested annually in building renovation to achieve the region's climate targets. Historically, financing energy efficiency was regarded largely as a public finance exercise. This will change rapidly with the participation of private sector funds, especially banks or specialist lenders for whom lending against real estate represents up to one-third of their loan book.In view of the involvement of a significant and broad stakeholder base representing over 2000 banks; and value of outstanding mortgage loans in Europe over Euros6.8 trillion, the energy efficiency mortgage initiative has the potential to transform the European housing stock and help the EU meet its climate goals.The definition is intended as a concrete response to the efforts of the European Commission to construct a capital markets union, to facilitate the clean energy transition in l"

The latest estimates from leading experts also indicate that the value of health gains from climate action would be approximately double the cost of mitigation policies at global level, and the benefit-to-cost ratio is even higher in countries such as China and India.A WHO report launched today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24Exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. In the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP. Actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around 1% of global GDP.""The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. ""The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health - clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter - and will undermine decades of progress in global health. We can't afford to delay action any further.""The same human activities that are destabilizing the Earth's climate also contribute directly to poor health. The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution.""The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself,"" says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. ""When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost.""Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease.WHO's COP-24It describes how countries around the world are now taking action to protect lives from the impacts of climate change - but that the scale of support remains woefully inadequate, particularly for the small island developing states, and least developed countries. Only approximately 0.5% of multilateral climate funds dispersed for climate change adaptation have been allocated to health projects.Pacific Island countries contribute 0.03% of greenhouse gas emissions, but they are among the most profoundly affected by its impacts. For the Pacific Island countries, urgent action to address climate change - including the outcome of COP24 this week - is crucial to the health of their people and their very existence.""We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change - from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind,"" said Dr Joy St John, Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health.The report calls for countries to account for health in all cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation. It also recommends that countries use fiscal incentives such as carbon pricing and energy subsidies to incentivize sectors to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. It further encourages Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to remove existing barriers to supporting climate-resilient health systems.WHO IS WORKING WITH COUNTRIES TO: Assess the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from the more ambitious action required to meet the goals of limiting global warming to 2oC or 1.5oC. Ensure climate-resilient health systems, especially in the most vulnerable countries such as small island developing states (SIDS); and to promote climate change mitigation actions that maximize immediate and long-term health benefits, under a special initiative on climate change and health in SIDS, launched in partnership with the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Fijian Presidency of COP-23 and operationalized by the Pacific Islands Action Plan on Climate Change and Health. Track national progress in protecting health from climate change and gaining the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation measures, through the WHO/UNFCCC Climate and Health country profiles, currently covering 45 countries, with 90 due for completion by the end of 2019. WHO's COP24RECOMMENDATIONSParties to the UNFCCC could advance climate, health and development objectives by: Identifying and promoting actions that both cut carbon emissions and reduce air pollution, and by including specific commitments to cut emissions of Short Climate Pollutants in their National Determined Contributions. Ensuring that the commitments to assess and safeguard health in the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement are reflected in the operational mechanisms at national and global levels. Removing barriers to investment in health adaptation to climate change, with a focus on climate resilient health systems, and climate smart healthcare facilities. Engagement with the health community, civil society and health professionals, to help them to mobilize collectively to promote climate action and health co-benefits. Promoting the role of cities and sub-national governments in climate action benefiting health, within the UNFCCC framework.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA69","COP24: Climate conference in the heart of Poland's coal country","December 2, 2018 Sunday 9:32 AM GMT","CNN Wire","(CNN) -- There's a certain irony that when world leaders meet in early December at the COP24 global climate conference, they will be doing so in the heart of Poland's coal country.Coal is hugely important for Poland. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently referred to it as ""our black gold.""The country is the biggest producer of hard coal in the EU and coal power provides about 80% of Poland's electricity compared to an average of 30% among International Energy Agency member countries. But coal accounts for almost half of global energy-related CO2 emissions, and like other coal-dependent countries, Poland is trying to adapt to a world that needs to cut emissions to slow global warming.The EU has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and last week unveiled a plan to be net zero by 2050. Poland's CO2 emissions per capita are slightly above the EU average, but its emissions per GDP are third-highest in the EU.But there are signs that is changing.Marek Wasinski, an analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, a government-funded think tank, told CNN: ""Like other EU countries, Poland is also moving away from coal. It's not a revolution, it's a slow evolution of the energy sector.""Although it makes up less than 10% of its energy mix, Poland has around 6,000 megawatts of wind power capacity, putting it among the leading nations in the EU. Construction of the Baltic Pipe Project is set to start in 2020, which will supply natural gas from Norway to Poland. Natural gas produces much less CO2 than coal when it's burned for energy, but methane leakage can limit its climate benefits. The Ministry of Energy's draft energy policy, published last week, said that by 2030, 60% of power will come from coal. It expects to have up to 9,000 MW of nuclear power by 2043, and 30,000 MW of off-shore wind and solar power by 2040.Coal legacyMichal Kurtyka, COP 24 President and Secretary of State in the Ministry of Environment, told CNN that Poland inherited a legacy of coal from its decades in the Eastern Bloc -- which ended in 1989 -- but had since managed to successfully transition its economy.""In 1990 the Polish energy mix was 96% coal,"" he said. ""There was a very high share of employment in coal and very big industrial production, the result of this communist conviction that only through industrialization could the Soviet Bloc compete with Western economies. ""When we entered into the transformation phase, this idea of transition of employment and changing industrial structure in many industrial regions, but starting with Silesia, was a very big challenge, but it's working very well right now.""Katowice is an example of the transformation. It's a green city, 40% of the city is covered with parks, and quite a substantial part of production and employment is going to IT, business centers, value-added services, and new industries.""But the move away from coal isn't happening fast enough for some environmental groups.

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered a speech on the Senate Floor on the ongoing negotiations at COP 24 - the 2018 - where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue.In calling for the President to reconsider his calamitous decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, Menendez described how New Jersey, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is already doing its part as a national leader for clean energy jobs and climate change resilience.CLICK TO WATCH ( HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIz6YlhC9x4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIz6YlhC9x4)""Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice, Poland to finalize the rulebook on implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality.For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable.Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone.That includes reports from the world's top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts.What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American.There's a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly-the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract.Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises.Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy.While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable.It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8 degree Celsius (1.4 degree Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks.It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average-the highest annual average in the satellite record.None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, 'We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.'This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week.Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement's entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris.The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures.

This immense potential is complicated by the rising stress on forests as a result of climate change, including increased wildfire, which must also be addressed.""The science is clear. Forests and other natural lands are the swing vote on whether we can overcome climate change,"" said Daley. ""With the right policies and investment in the health and resilience of natural and working lands, the Climate Alliance states could dramatically increase the power of the land to absorb and store carbon. This will show the way for other states and eventual federal action.""American Forests' role in the Impact Partnership will build on past successes in working with the Alliance. In July of 2018, American Forests hosted an unprecedented Natural and Working Lands Learning Lab in Washington, D.C. that drew delegations of state officials and partners from 16 Alliance states. The Lab was staffed with more than 50 leading experts in the field of land-based carbon mitigation from federal and local government, academia, nonprofits, landowners and industry, and has already led to development of new policy proposals and establishment of financing mechanisms. As part of the new Impact Partnership, American Forests expects to host additional Learning Labs on land sector climate action working with fellow impact partners The Nature Conservancy, World Resources Institute, The Trust for Public Land, American Farmland Trust and The Coalition for Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.American Forests is well positioned to lead this effort. American Forests is the nation's first forest conservation organization, founded in 1875, and leads the 46-member Forest-Climate Working Group, the nation's only sector-wide coalition working on forest-based carbon mitigation. Jad Daley of American Forests was the co-founder of the Forest-Climate Working Group in 2007, and has served as co-chair since that time. American Forests has 25 years of experience advancing carbon sequestration through reforestation projects conducted in partnership with federal and state agencies and other partners, having planted more than 60 million trees in all 50 states.Contact: Lea Sloan, vice president of communications, 202/370-4509, 202/330-3253, HYPERLINK mailto:lsloan@americanforests.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6570325 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA78","COP24 GETS POLITICAL AFTER FIRST WEEK","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The first week of the two-week 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) being held in Katowice, Poland has just ended with a major political difference between the countries who wish to raise ambitions to take faster action to tackle climate change in light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5 degrees, and those who are associated with fossil fuel interests.The IPCC report was asked for by the COP in 2015 and was produced by the best scientists around the world. It was then adopted by all governments who are part of the IPCC in October this year. The report shows that there is a very significant difference between a world with a 1.5 degree and a 2 degrees higher global atmospheric temperature. It will affect all countries, not just the poorest. The report also said action was still possible if all countries agree to raise their ambitions for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. The need is for all countries to be reliant on 100 percent renewable energy no later than 2050.The IPCC presented their report to COP24 in Katowice last week. Normally it would be a very routine matter for the COP to acknowledge it and take its findings into the COP decision making process.However in this case it was not accepted and the argument took place over one word: ""welcome"". The vast majority of countries said they would like to ""welcome"" the IPCC report. However the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia would not accept that word and would only allow the COP to take ""note"" the IPCC report. This may sound like a trivial play of word but it signifies a major stand from the fossil fuel interests which are being represented here by Saudi Arabia, US and Russia.To give an example of how the US is doing that, there are two sets of events being hosted by the US, one by the Trump administration and the second by others including states like California, cities like New York, and companies and universities. This second pavilion has the slogan of ""we are still in"" the Paris Agreement. It is one of the most popular pavilions at the COP!On the other hand the official Trump delegation is holding a special event to promote coal as the future which has been paid for by the coal industry in the US. Many countries are asking why Trump has even bothered to send a delegation to the COP if he wants to leave the Paris Agreement? The answer is that he doesn't just want to leave it but rather to prevent other countries from making progress. In this goal he has gained the support of Saudi Arabia and Russia (which is really a trio who are becoming a major global partnership on more than climate change).So it is now clear that the division of interests is very clear between those who wish to take real action to tackle the global emergency of climate change and those who want to promote fossil fuels sales. It is no longer the case that those questioning the reality of human induced climate change is doing so because of ignorance, but rather that they are deliberately trying to subvert action.The answers may well lie in Saudi Arabia and Russia joining Trump to leave the Paris Agreement and let the rest of us carry on tackling this global emergency.Saleemul Huq is director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development, Independent University, Bangladesh.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA79","3 RANIMALS IN POLAND OUR TAKE ON THE COP24 CLIMATE TALKS","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by Rainforest Action Network (RAN):Three of us from RAN's climate and energy teamPaddy, Jason and myselfhave just arrived in Katowice, a small city in the heart of Polish coal mining country for COP24, the 2018 United Nations climate talks. The city is hosting nearly thirty thousand visitors, as heads of state, environmental ministers, lobbyists, researchers, and activists are making their way to southern Poland for the conference, the most important climate meeting since the Paris talks in 2015.You may remember all the buzz around COP21 three years ago. With the Kyoto Protocol expiring, almost every nation in the world came together around the Paris Agreementpledging to pursue a goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. The overall rulebook of the agreement was not hashed out in Paris, and that unfinished business is at the heart of the talks here this year: questions like how to standardize emissions reductions plans (or Nationally Determined Contributions in UN jargon speak), what the key metrics for reporting on emissions reductions should be, and who is responsible for financing new technologies in developing countries.The conference is taking place in the midst of a global groundswell of for climate action. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report detailing how hugely destructive 2C of warming would be, and what it will take to limit warming to 1.5C: global carbon emissions have to fall by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, reaching zero around 2050. Even the International Energy Agency (IEA), a notoriously pro-fossil fuel think tank, gets it. As we noted on our blog last week, the IEA's executive director is now on record saying that ""We have no room to build anything that emits CO 2 .""These numbers have caught the world's attention and galvanized unprecedented action. Tens of thousands of youth are striking from school in Australia over the Adani Carmichael coal mine, and across the U.S., young people are flooding the offices of their congressional representatives calling for a Green New Deal. In the U.K., thousands are blocking bridges and roads in an Extinction Rebellion. Despite this clear mandate to keep fossil fuels in the ground, governments, corporations, and financial institutionsnot just fossil fuel companies!are continuing to support the expansion of coal, oil, and natural gas.Take the case of this conference. As the New York Times has reported, co-sponsors of COP24 include Polish coal companies, and Polish exhibits here promote the wonders of coal. You'll be unsurprised to learn, then, that the Polish government is actively expanding coal mining and constructing new coal-fired power plants. And, as we reveal in a briefing paper published this week, they wouldn't be able to do so without the financial backing of JPMorgan Chaseand other international banks and insurers.RAN is here at COP24 to highlight the role of financial institutions in the unconscionable expansion of coal and fossil fuels in general. Governments and fossil fuel companies rely on banks for the financing of projects and insurance companies to offload the risks related to construction, operation, natural disasters, and anything else that may threaten this infrastructure. Banks and insurance companies are crucial elements of the fossil fuel supply chain, without which the physical infrastructure cannot be built and carbon cannot be extracted and combusted. Yet, as these companies fund and insure carbon-intensive projects that are not compatible with a 1.5C world, they proclaim their sustainability on panels next to government ministers and release reports on how they're working to address the Sustainable Development Goals.This week at COP24JPMorgan Chase and Polish Coal: With our Polish partners Fundacja RT-ON, we dove into the financial records and investigated JPMorgan Chase's role in funding Energa, a Polish state-owned utility company that plans to build a notorious new coal-fired power plant called Ostro\'c5,\'c4ka C.

UConn has sent students and faculty to the climate change summits since 2015. This year's summit, COP24, was held in Katowice, Poland, Dec. 2-14, with delegates from around the world convening to continue negotiations regarding climate change.Read more about UConn's representatives in action through the UConn Office of Environmental Policy's Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram account, or by foll0wing the #UConnTalksClimate hashtag.The following are excerpts from blog posts by some of the student participants:Brazil's New President Putting Climate &#38; Amazon Rain Forest at RiskBy Charlotte Rhodes, Junior, Environmental StudiesWalking into COP24, I was immediately struck by the Brazil Pavilion. Decorated with bright colors and large displays, the pavilion is a demonstration of the immense biodiversity and vital ecosystems housed in the region. But after my initial excitement set in, I was reminded that the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, has decided to take all of this away from the world.Bolsonaro has rebuffed climate change, and promised during his campaign to rollback protections on the Amazon rain forest for economic gain. This plan is toxic, and because of the significant influence the Amazon has over the environment, will have a rippling effect throughout the environmental community.The Amazon rain forest is a significant carbon sink and one of our most valuable resources against climate change. It can sequester millions of tons of carbon, successfully removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. This is such an important resource and if Bolsonaro goes through with his plans for clear-cutting the Amazon, more action will be required by everyone else to meet the 1.5 degree goal. ...Are we changing? Yes. Can we change? Can we listen?Heading to the COP24, I was hoping to find new ideas and insights within the field of environmental economics and policy, but I realize now I had subconsciously put my expectations for those new ideas within the familiar frameworks of thought and governance I was comfortable with. As a result, the most meaningful parts of my experience at the UN's Climate Summit in Poland have been interactions and conversations with people with rather different perspectives from my own.During a Climate Hub workshop entitled, ""Women for Climate Justice: Local Struggles, Global Actions,"" we were led through a meditative contemplation and drawing of the ""territory of our bodies."" To invoke contemplation, the facilitator asked us how and where we felt the impacts of climate change and its potential solutions, including poverty, water scarcity, renewable energy, collective action, and 'extractivism' (the first time I had encountered the term).As an example, the leader of our guided contemplation shared ""market solutions"" as something that greatly troubles her. Market solutions make up a significant portion of what I have been studying thus far (with a large exception perhaps being independent study of behavioral economics). Naturally, her statement prompted me to take a renewed look at the conflicting ideologies about the best ways to combat climate change. This is a conflict I have examined more closely this semester through the juxtapositions of my resource economics classes and an English class on the history and human experience of capitalism. ...I found that the ""territory of our bodies"" workshop proved the most productive in inspiring conversation and sharing by providing a common ground of others' often similar interpretations of the personal impacts of climate change. Just as behavioral economics works to better represent the often-flawed nature of humanity, sharing personal stories from a starting point of some common perspective appears to be a vital part of the shift towards actively reducing the effects of climate change.The Talanoa Dialogue is Making People Care!By Katarina Konon, Junior, Chemical EngineeringMost people, especially in light of the most recent IPCC report, know something about climate change. Some people focus on the science behind it, others focus on the consequences, and still others decide to ignore it altogether. It can be hard to process all the warnings, statistics, and charts that we learn about in school or see on the news. Because of this, Fiji introduced the Talanoa dialogue at COP23, which aims to give people a platform to ""share stories, build empathy, and to make wise decisions for the collective good."" This concept carried over into COP24.Another speaker from China talked about how 10 years ago, when she was a child, she could see the stars. Now, she looks up and they're not there because of pollution. If you can't imagine wildfires or floods destroying your home, try to imagine this. It just makes me feel so sad.There are a ton of reasons to care about climate change. So many, in fact, that it can be overwhelming. So start here. Start with the people who have to face it every day. Show some empathy, and do your part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You'd hate to be in their shoes someday.The Emotional, Psychological, and Mental Impacts of Climate ChangeBy Leann Mclaren, Senior, Political Science and HistoryDuring my time as a member of the UConn@COP24 cohort attending the United Nations' Conference on Climate Change in Poland, I had the opportunity to participate in an event titled ""Intergenerational Inquiry: Youth Stepping Up for Climate Action."" The event showcased multiple speakers, from the UN Secretary General for Youth to delegates from Ghana and students from many different countries.What I found especially provoking was the testimony from a youth activist from the island of Jamaica. He described his struggle of being exiled from his community as a kid due to his LGBTQ identity. From his story of homelessness, he described how the impacts of climate change took an emotional toll on him in addition to his family problems. In Jamaica, he described how as a developing island nation, many of the national disasters have the ability to wipe out entire nations of people. The harsh effects of climate change disproportionately affect people who were not primary contributors of greenhouse gas emissions.Similarly, with another student from India, he described how his motivation to become an activist for climate justice stemmed from his childhood. Memories of morning runs with his father in India became progressively dangerous, as temperatures increased to over 125 degrees Fahrenheit. The harsh effects of climate change affected not only his health but also his emotional connections with his father. He explains how these changes impacted his psychological development and contributed towards his activism.Overall, the students and speakers in this event resonated with me. The narrative of their personal stories allowed me to see how climate change produced much more than physical effects, but negative emotional and mental health side effects as well. This event made me more aware of the totality of impacts caused by climate change and more motivated to take action as a result of these realizations. I now aim to reduce my personal emissions and raise awareness to promote behavioral change among others, not only for the sake of preventing the catastrophic increase in global temperatures, but also for the mental, emotional, and psychological well-being of others all over the world.... While the Paris Climate Agreement was a historical step for humankind, it's not nearly enough to save us. The agreement was the beginning of this world transformation; true change will require continued, tenacious, collaborative effort.... Even if we do not reach our goal of 1.5 degrees C, or even that of 2 degrees C, any change we make now will still have an important effect on generations to come. So get out there and make some change happen. Reduce your carbon footprint. Vote ... Start improving your community. Collaborate with friends and neighbors. Have meaningful conversations with those around you. We are each just one person, but we still have an important, irreplaceable influence on the world around us.Read the blog posts in full at: HYPERLINK https://ecohusky.uconn.edu/bloghttps://ecohusky.uconn.edu/blogRead the IPCC's Report at: HYPERLINK http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6559192 MSTRUCK\l"

David Lauren, the youngest son of the company's founder and its chief innovation officer, told The Associated Press ahead of the announcement that the new shirt is part of a broader strategy of fresh environmental goals throughout the manufacturing process. ""Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference,"" Lauren said. The Polo isn't the first of its kind. Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average of 12 bottles. The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibers will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibers, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture. The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment. Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations , , in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action. As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibers that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is ""much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean."" The broader question of biodegradability of such fibers remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said. ""There's so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities,"" he said. ""Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem?

But what does it encompass?A just transition is defined by the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, as stated in the Paris Agreement, but in a way that the well-being of all people is protected. The recent IPCC report on 1.5 degrees spotlights the need for early action, once again reinforcing that a rapid transition across all sectors of the economy is necessary to mitigate the most catastrophic risks of climate change.There is great urgency involved-we only have 12 more years to turn things around! The lives and livelihoods of millions of people, especially in Global South countries, depend on fast action and ambitious climate policies to prevent the worst-possible impacts. For them, climate change is already a harsh reality, even though they have contributed almost nothing to its creation.A just transition can only be successful if it brings all affected groups to the table. It maximizes climate protection while minimizing the negative impacts of climate change and climate policy on societies, lives and livelihoods. Climate change will influence every sector of our lives.This includes the employment sector, which will be impacted by climate change as well as by climate change policies. Workers in the fossil industries and their families and communities are at the front l"

Nongovernmental groups and UN human rights experts have urged governments to explicitly reference human rights in these rules.But detracting from focused negotiations and effective climate action is the Polish government's crackdown on civil society activists and nongovernmental groups.Following the adoption of a Polish law passed earlier this year restricting protests and increasing police surveillance powers during COP24, many environmental groups championing a strong Paris Rulebook have struggled to make their voices heard at the Katowice meeting. Over the last week, several environmental defenders and activists have been barred from entering the country. Human Rights Watch also documented that Polish border guards went to the hotel rooms of some activists, including people accredited for COP24, and asked them for their passports and travel history. Two were detained and questioned for several hours, without being able to communicate their location or contact a lawyer, before they were released.Beyond the immediate impact on those prevented from speaking out in Katowice, these intimidation tactics are diverting resources and media attention. Instead of advocating for ambitious, rights-based climate action, many COP participants had to redirect most efforts towards defending their rights.The repression of environmental defenders at COP24 underscores the necessity of integrating a rights-based approach into the global climate framework. At a defining moment in international climate diplomacy, and with only four days left until the official end of the negotiations, states should find guidance in the human rights language in the preamble of the Paris Agreement and adopt climate policies that respect their human rights obligations.If governments fail to address human rights, they will fail to effectively address climate change.\l"

Campaigners have accused the rulebook of being a compromise favouring corporate interests and countries which have been the most obstructive in the negotiationprocess. Vitumbiko Chinoko, from CARE  an international humanitarian agency  in Southern Africa, accused £ few powerful countries' of holding multilateralism 'hostage' during theconference. 'Vulnerable countries cannot carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. It is unacceptable for governments to continue to cower behind the inaction of the US and other big polluters,' hesaid. Patti Lynn, executive director of NGO Corporate Accountability, said the climate talks had ended 'without delivering what the worldneeds'. 'Governments fell far short of crafting a just and equitable roadmap to Paris' implementation. The root cause of this failure  the fossil fuel industry's interference  was on full display at these negotiations,' shesaid. Compromise For those deeply involved in the process, the fact countries managed to agree on a single set of rules to implement the Paris Agreement  with flexibility in some areas  was a victory for multilateralism diplomacy in the face of growing populist movements rejecting climateaction. 'Despite all the headwinds, the Paris Agreement has stayed course at COP24, demonstrating the kind of resilience it has been designed for,' said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of NGO the European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the ParisAgreement. The climate negotiations are a unique and very technical diplomatic exercise in which every country around the world have to agree on how to save theplanet. As Spanish ecology minister Teresa Ribera told the BBC[5], this is a 'difficult'process. 'It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat. It is not so easy but we have got it,' shesaid.COP24 PresidentMicha Kurtyka when the Paris Agreement rulebook is adopted. Image Credit: IISD ENB[6] But there is also widespread acknowledgement that the package which was agreed late on Saturday night in Katowice is far from ambitious enough to deliver the level of climate action necessary to prevent climatebreakdown. Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of UN Climate Change (UNFCCC), said the rulebook was £n important step' but that 'no one is entirely happy withit'. Reflecting on the final hours of the negotiation, Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at the environmental think tank E3G, told Climate Home News[7]: 'We are not going to agree what is necessary for the climate but we are going to agree what is possible in these politics. And that has gone a step further than what we have seen before going into thesenegotiations.'

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA98","COP24 climate talks end in agreement -- barely","December 15, 2018 Saturday 9:45 PM GMT","CNN Wire","KATOWICE, Poland (CNN) -- After two weeks of discordant and emotional negotiations, the nations of the world agreed Saturday night on a set of rules meant to help curb global warming. But scientists and even the negotiators themselves know the so-called ""Paris Rulebook"" won't be enough on its own to stop carbon pollution from reaching critical levels. Countries would have to do far more to curb fossil fuel use and deforestation to avoid the droughts, superstorms, deadly heat waves and coastal floods associated with global warming. This rulebook is supposed to put into motion the Paris Agreement on climate change, a landmark 2015 accord that the US Trump administration has promised to abandon.After fraught and much-delayed talks at the COP24 climate change conference here in Polish coal country, more than 190 countries agreed to the rules. They punted, however, on a critical but complicated issue involving how countries trade and account for certain pollution. Brazil nearly blocked the process amid concerns that its proposals would lead to ""double counting"" and, essentially, cheating, according to observers and a senior negotiator involved in the discussions. That issue will have to be taken up at a later date in 2019.Ministers also did not agree to emphatically embrace the latest climate science, which stunned some attendees. Countries reached a ""compromise"" statement in which they welcomed the publication of an alarming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).They stopped short, however, of welcoming its actual findings. That ""administrative"" compromise fails to underscore the extreme urgency posed by the climate crisis, said Simon Stiell, Grenada's minister for climate resilience and environment. Vulnerable countries, including small island states that could see their entire territories disappear as seas rise, agreed to the text to ensure the rulebook moved forward, he told CNN.""We understand the need to consensus-build,"" he said. ""And for small island developing states we have achieved our minimum -- minimum -- asks with regard to key issues.""The IPCC report says the world has only about 12 years to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels, which is one of the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Together this makes up the majority of the 'rulebook' by which the Paris Agreement can be implemented by countries around the world.The key elements that were agreed upon include how countries will both define and provide information on national climate action under the Paris Agreement, how to measure cumulative global efforts by 2023, as well as a process to mobilize financing to support this action.Yet several issues remained contentious, such as rules for carbon markets and trading, referred to under 'Article 6' of the Paris Agreement, which have been deferred until next year. Some were also critical that the text was not forceful enough in demanding more urgent and ambitious action.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres returned in the final days of the conference, reinforcing the message that climate change is the number one priority for the United Nations. In his speech he said ""We must beat climate change before it beats us. It is a race we can win. It is a race we must win.""Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UN Assistant Secretary General and Director of UNDP's Policy and Programme Bureau, highlighted how UNDP's work is driving the climate action agenda through the support it provides across 140 countries: ""At UNDP we focus on the alignment between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that climate change not only threatens development outcomes but ambitious climate action can provide opportunities to unlock economic and social gains.""Throughout the two weeks of negotiations, UNDP shared its country-level programming experiences through numerous events, all aimed at advocating for three key ingredients needed to scale up countries' action to meet their national pledges, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This is necessary in order to ensure the urgency and ambition needed to implement the Paris Agreement. Some of the highlights were as follows:First, foster public-private partnership to scale up finance . With estimates suggesting 85 to 90 percent of Paris Agreement funding needs to come from the private sector, UNDP demonstrated ways to use limited public funds to unlock private investments. For example, together with the World Bank, UNDP developed and implemented the first ever Investment COP, convening investors and public sector actors to identify country-level business opportunities that advance climate action. In addition, initiatives such as Indonesia's green sukuk the first of its kind sovereign Islamic green bond provided a prime example of how to bring additional, private finance into the climate change sphere.Second, enhance adaptation . The recent IPCC report indicating the catastrophic impacts of our warming world put pressure on negotiators to not only take urgent mitigation action, but also to prioritize adaptation. UNDP engaged in over 15 adaptation related events throughout the two weeks of COP, often with other UN agencies such as FAO and UN Environment. Two flagship adaptation reports were launched, reflecting on years of country experiences in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Africa.Third, leverage nature-based solutions . UNDP celebrated the 10th anniversary of the UN-REDD initiative, and advocated the need to engage non-state actors, particularly indigenous peoples, to leverage the benefits of forest and land use management, more broadly known, along with other approaches, as nature-based solutions. In this regard, a key outcome of the conference was the 'Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform,' putting in place a formal channel for indigenous peoples' views and interests to be communicated to the UNFCCC process.The outcomes of COP24 are lauded as an impressive achievement, given the scale of work negotiators were tasked with over these two weeks; yet, the work has just begun. With this new 'rulebook' in place, it is now the responsibility of countries, with support from organizations like UNDP, to turn their pledges into concrete adaptation and mitigation action. This includes revisiting their national climate pledges by 2020 with the aim to increase ambition in order to meet the Paris goals. This will require mobilizing political will and leadership, becoming the focus of the SG's Summit in September 2019.UNDP welcomes the progress made thus far, and welcomes the challenge and opportunity to deliver on Paris and Katowice, now and well into the future.\l"

The UN Secretary-General Ant\'c3\'b3nio Guterres on Wednesday said it would be ""suicidal"" for these global warming negotiations to fail.Regenvanu stood at a lectern wearing a green tie and glasses, indicting the global community.""[P]arty negotiators rocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience,"" he told diplomats on Tuesday. ""There is no political argument to counter atmospheric measurements showing that CO2 emissions have risen since Paris and are on track for a 2.7% rise in 2018,"" he said, referencing the 2015 UN climate negotiations in Paris -- a moment when the world stood in unison demanding an end to fossil fuels. ""Whether you 'welcome' or 'note' or shamelessly ignore the science all together, the fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity.""In the guarded world of climate diplomacy, Regenvanu's statement is a massive burn to the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Over the weekend, those nations refused to ""welcome"" the latest scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which makes clear urgent action is needed to avoid catastrophe, including superstorms, deadlier heatwaves and floods. Those countries instead asked to simply ""note"" the report's existence. The United States issued a statement questioning the well-established science.

In his remarks, Senator Carper also highlighted the agreements reached at COP24, the Trump Administration's ignorance of this issue and the economic, environmental and public health consequences of inaction.Following the conclusion of COP24, Senator Carper on Saturday released a statement responding to the multilateral agreement reached to implement the Paris Climate Accord. Read that response HERE.""This agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade,"" said Senator Carper. ""Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every day...Yet, as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate change, the Trump Administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies.""Senator Carper continued, ""We don't have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up and get going. That's why, as the senior Democrat and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I'm anxious to help lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate future. If we're honest with our children and grandchildren, we don't have any other choice...""Today's speech can be viewed by clicking HERE. Below are Senator Carper's full remarks, as prepared for delivery:""Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley to reflect on the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that concluded this past weekend in Poland. This important conference, which is better known as COP24, met there for the past two weeks as leaders from nearly 200 countries worked to reach agreement on how the world will actually implement the Paris Climate Agreement.""The stakes could not be higher. The future of our planet and the futures of our children and grandchildren hang in the balance. It was a positive step forward that the international community could come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change on a global scale by finally beginning to implement the Paris Agreement into practice. Having said that, however, this agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade.""The entire world must be doing even more to address this problem. That includes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead. While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable.""But reaching bolder future agreements is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeavor - and that includes saving our planet. Unfortunately, our President - along with many of those within his Administration - continues to reject climate science and deny the reality of the problems we are facing.""Well, Mr. President, here's the reality. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced 16 extreme weather-related disasters that exceeded $1 billion in 2017. In the past year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges, flooding, wildfires, crop freezes and droughts - a new record!""Thirteen of our nation's leading scientific federal agencies recently reported to us in the National Climate Assessment that, if we do nothing to address our carbon emissions, today's extreme weather-related events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead.""In the future, we can continue to expect rainfalls where precipitation is measured by the foot, not in inches. We can continue to expect more wildfires out West burning areas larger than my home state of Delaware. And we can continue to expect extreme flooding to devastate small communities like Ellicott City Maryland, which has been hit by two 1,000-year-floods in the past two years alone. Think about that! Two in the past two years alone!""Mr. President, one of the most memorable lyrics from singer-songwriter Stephen Stills goes something like this, 'Something's happening here. Just what it is ain't exactly clear.' Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and it IS exactly clear.' What's also clear is that there's still time to do something about it and actually foster economic growth in the USA and beyond our borders. Climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists and from leading scientists around the world.Rest of the document can be viewed at HYPERLINK https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=E67863E9-8447-45BB-A262-6EFE5AA301FBhttps://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=E67863E9-8447-45BB-A262-6EFE5AA301FB For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at HYPERLINK contentservices@htlive.com\l"

Customers will continue to use gas as they do today, without any changes needed to gas appliances or pipework.The Keele campus was viewed as the perfect test site, with the University owning and operating its own private gas network, independent of the UK's wider gas network, as well as the University's sustainability ethos and expertise.Professor Mark Ormerod, Deputy Vice Chancellor and Provost of Keele University, said:""Energy and sustainability is a key overarching institutional priority for Keele University, and we are delighted to be a partner in this important, highly relevant and prestigious project. This collaborative project tackles one of the major societal challenges and has the potential to be highly impactful and lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions. It is fantastic to see HyDeploy showcased at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24).""Heat currently contributes to a third of the UK's carbon emissions. Reducing the carbon intensity of heating using green gases such as blended hydrogen has the potential to contribute to the UK's substantial carbon savings commitments, with minimal disruption to customers, as it uses their current gas supply and needs no changes to the existing pipework or appliances.If hydrogen were blended with natural gas across the UK at a similar level to HyDeploy, it could save around six million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year, the equivalent of taking 2.5 million cars off the road.The HyDeploy project will be the first UK practical deployment of hydrogen onto a live gas network since the transition from town gas. Successful demonstration of the project has the potential to unlock savings of pound sterling8 billion to customers and avoid 120 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.Keele University's Institute for Sustainable Futures is leading the way in SMART and low carbon energy research, using Keele's unique campus setting as a 'living laboratory' where innovative approaches to low carbon energy can be trialled. Key to this is the HyDeploy project, a pioneering hydrogen energy project which aims to reduce UK carbon dioxide CO2 emissions through blending Hydrogen with natural gas for cooking and heating buildings and homes across the private gas network on Keele University's campus.Professor Chris Fogwill, Director of Keele's Institute for Sustainable Futures, states:""HyDeploy will provide the first at-scale demonstration of blended Hydrogen in the UK, and is driven by the UK's commitment to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 80% by 2050 guided by the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Given that the implementation of the Paris Agreement is a key focus of discussions at the Katowice COP24 Meeting, it presents an ideal opportunity to highlight HyDeploy.""Zoe Robinson, Director of Education for Sustainability at Keele University, said:""The HyDeploy project on the Keele campus gives us the opportunity to understand the consumer experience surrounding sustainable energy transition developments in the gas supply. Understanding of the social aspects and how this influences customer acceptance is as important as our learning about the technical aspects, and HyDeploy at Keele gives us the chance to increase our understanding of both.""Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6545882 MSTRUCK\l"

EMPHASISES the EU's commitment to develop a robust and fully functioning set of rules as the outcome of the Paris Agreement Work Programme at COP24, which is essential for laying the groundwork for enhanced ambition, support and investment to enable the achievement of the Paris Agreement's objectives.REITERATES the importance of making swift and ambitious progress on making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. UNDERLINES that progress towards this objective is necessary to meet the long-term mitigation and adaptation objectives of the Paris Agreement and that it should be given due consideration within the UNFCCC architecture. STRESSES the need to encourage and effectively assess collective progress towards the objective of Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement, including, but not limited to, through the global stock-take, and to undertake further work to develop methods and modalities towards this end.EMPHASISES that public finance alone can never be sufficient to finance the transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. HIGHLIGHTS the need to ensure an enabling environment for sustainable investments and STRESSES the important role of public policy in this regard. WELCOMES recent developments in this area in the EU, including the ambitions of the European Commission's action plan on financing sustainable growth, and at national and international level.STRESSES that carbon pricing is a key component of an enabling environment for shifting financial flows towards green and sustainable investments, for supporting the transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient developments and for promoting innovative solutions to reduce emissions. In this context, WELCOMES and SUPPORTS: i) carbon pricing initiatives, including those that build capacity in developing countries; ii) the use of internal carbon prices by companies and financial institutions, including by multilateral and other development banks; and iii) initiatives promoting the phasing out of environmentally and economically harmful subsidies and rapid phasing down of financing for emission-intensive projects.REAFFIRMS that the EU and its Member States are committed to scale up the mobilization of international climate finance, as part of the collective developed countries' goal to jointly mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020 through to 2025 for mitigation and adaptation purposes, from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels. WELCOMES progress to date and HIGHLIGHTS that the EU and its Member States remain the largest provider of public climate finance, including to the multilateral climate funds, and have contributed EUR 20.4 billion[1] in climate finance for 2017.

In Katowice, Parties arrived with a clear mandate: translate the IPCC's findings into a commitment to raise ambition; deliver a climate action package commensurate with the level of ambition and committed resources required to reach this goal; and adopt a rulebook to guide how it happens.""We are deeply disappointed with the outcome of these negotiations,"" said Erika Lennon, CIEL Senior Attorney. ""Simply put, the outcome of COP24 is not compatible with the Paris Agreement, which promised to protect, respect, and consider human rights in climate action. In the final hours of negotiations, the only reference to human rights disappeared from the text when Parties punted a decision on carbon markets for another year.1 The rulebook gavelled in at the Spodek Center in Katowice offers too little people-centered, rights-based guidance for countries to jointly deliver on the Paris promises, conditions that the IPCC recognizes as necessary to keep global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius. As delegates return home and countries work toward increasing ambition and enhancing national climate commitments, they must also remember that they are already bound by international agreements to respect human rights, and that these must drive how they implement necessary climate action and ensure equity.""""The IPCC report made clear that respect for human rights and robust public participation are a prerequisite for effective climate action,"" said Sebastien Duyck, CIEL Senior Attorney. ""Not only have countries largely failed to adopt these recommendations in Katowice, but the COP itself casts a long shadow on the role and value of stakeholder engagement in UN climate processes. Poland's overt exclusion of and attacks against civil society participants at the COP sends a chilling message about the direction of human rights protections at the UNFCCC. We look to Chile, a country that championed the adoption of the Escazu Agreement, the regional agreement on environmental democracy, to facilitate this process in a truly participatory manner going forward.""""The failures here won't stop the climate crisis, but nor will they stop people worldwide from taking urgent action to confront climate change,"" said Carroll Muffett, President of CIEL.

When events like this take place, it does truly feel as if the whole world is focused on addressing climate change. However, I have to remind myself that nearly40 percent of Fortune 100 companies[2]haven't set even a single climate target. I don't want to sound like just another environmentalist waving my hands, jumping up and down that we need to act to reverse climate change NOW. The truth is simply this: I know it can be done, sustainability targets create business value and companies stand to lose big financially if they don't act. If your company falls in this bucket, listen up. I have helped Walmart, Starbucks and other household names get started with sustainability. I can help you too, using all the lessons I've learned from them.Don't take my word for it. Take it from the White House, which recentlyreleased a report[3]showing a side of climate change that many people haven't yet seen - the precise price tag of climate impacts to the U.S. economy. Projected climate impacts by the end of the century include $141 billion from heat-related deaths, $118 billion from sea level rise and $32 billion from infrastructure damage. Think back to the recession of a decade ago. Remember the devastating impact on our economy (and possibly your business)? This will be double that. What does this mean for the companies that haven't set a climate target - or more broadly, any U.S. company? Supply chains will be disrupted here in the United States and overseas. Disasters will impact factory production, transportation will be disrupted, costs will increase and agricultural productivity will suffer.Almost no industry here in the U.S. will be able to escape the negative effects of climate change on their business. Therefore, I have an offer for you: pick up the phone andcall me[4]. Let's get started on your company's sustainability journey. If you are feeling shy, but want some direction on the way forward with sustainability,here is some free advice: the three reasons for you to set a goal in 2019. Reason #1: Savings The first reason for you to set a goal in 2019 - money.A report from CDP[5]- which holds the world's largest collection of self-reported corporate environmental data, and other public sources - finds that nearly 80,000 emission-reducing projects by 190 Fortune 500 companies reporting data showednearly $3.7 billion in savings in 2016 alone. Reason #2: Your Family The recent wild fires in California, that killed people and destroyed homes and businesses, caused toxic air up and down much of the state. We took a surreal picture from our rooftop apartment in San Francisco when the air quality was so unhealthy that I couldn't let my kids play outside. I keep telling my children - ages 11 and 13 - that 'this is not normal!' However, unfortunately, as Governor Jerry Brown recently said, 'This is the new abnormal.' According toGallup[6], more than half of Americans think that climate change won't affect them personally. If you fall in this category, please take it from me - the effects to my family are as real as they can get. Youwillbe affected one way or another - maybe severe weather, maybe dramatically more expensive food, or maybe living through one of these traumatic events directly yourself. Reason #3: Science Which leads me to the third reason you should act on climate - science. The White House report comes just after another report from theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries. The report shook me to my core and as theNew York Timesreports[7], it 'describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 - a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.'

It is a year-long process that will culminate in political discussions at the 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2-15 December.Gathered at the historic St Stephen's Church, the participants reflected on the findings of the recently released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on 1.5 degree Celsius, that reveals that the planet is on-track to surpassing the relatively safer limit of 1.5 degree Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels in around two decades with potentially catastrophic effects, especially on the poorest.Just transitions was one of the key themes of the dialogue. Representatives from the city of Katowice shared that their city is in many ways built on coal. Many derive their livelihoods from it. Addressing climate change entails a shift away from these polluting industries.Initially coined by labour and environmental movements, the concept of ""just transitions""aims to ensure that the burden of adjustment does not fall on those who contributed least to climate change, are most vulnerable to it, and have the least resources to deal with it.For Athena Peralta, programme executive for Economic and Ecological Justice at the World Council of Churches (WCC), who facilitated the discussion, a just transition is first of all a rapid and drastic shift from a fossil-fuel driven and extractive economy to a carbon-neutral and regenerative economy.""This demands nothing less than systemic changes towards an alternative development paradigm that holds justice and sustainability together,"" she said.Ovais Sarmad, UNFCCC deputy executive secretary, expressed deep appreciation to the religious sector for their passionate engagement in the global issue of climate change. ""All religious traditions view creation as a sacred gift and have a critical role to play in calling for climate justice"", he said.Following the dialogue, an interfaith service was held, reflecting on just transitions in the context of Poland, and featuring prayers and songs from various religious, spiritual and indigenous traditions. A single flame was lit to celebrate the start of Hanukkah.The event was co-organized by the WCC, Brahma Kumaris, Franciscans International, Dominicans for Justice and Peace, Quakers United Nations Office, Islamic Relief, GreenFaith, Religions for Peace, ICE Network, CIDSE and the Global Catholic Climate Movement.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6540625 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA121","SIERRA CLUB STATEMENT ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE COP24 UN CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS","December 15, 2018 Saturday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Sierra Club:Today, the 24th annual UN Climate Negotiations (COP24) concluded. During the talks, countries met to hash out the details of the Paris Agreement rulebook, which will provide guidance for the implementation of the landmark climate deal. To date, Donald Trump is still the only world leader to announce his intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016, has been signed by every nation on earth. The earliest Trump will be able to complete his withdrawal from the deal is November 4, 2020, one day after the next U.S. Presidential election. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: ""There's simply no debate; fossil fuels have no place in a liveable future. While Donald Trump may seek to further isolate the U.S. on the world stage, leaders from across the globe continue to work together to tackle the climate crisis. At a time when science makes it clear that we have only 12 years to deeply cut carbon pollution to avoid climate chaos, the climate negotiations have continued to bring the world together to move towards a sustainable climate and healthy communities. ""Following yet another year of devastating and historic hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts, it has been the unstoppable power of people that has continued to drive climate progress, from retiring more than half of the U.S. coal fleet to moving cities to 100 percent clean energy. The American people are joined by the rest of the world in signaling that they will not tolerate any more of Trump's shameful blustering and inaction, and they have taken up the mantle of climate action while Trump abdicates any semblance of global leadership. The Sierra Club is proud to continue to join with allies in the movement driving that progress and ensure the transition to clean energy leaves no one behind."" ### Despite the Trump administration's inaction on climate, progress has continued to march on in the halls of the COP24 climate negotiations and beyond. Here's a short recap of some of the progress the world made over the past two weeks that you may have missed: Over 300 elected officials from 40 U.S. states released a letter calling for a Green New Deal and an end to fossil fuel use. Cincinnati, Ohio became the United States' 100th city to transition to 100 percent clean energy. The current total for cities committed to 100 percent clean energy is up to 102, meaning over 15 percent of the U.S. population now lives in an area that is Ready For 100. 1,000 groups announce that they're divesting $8 trillion in assets out of fossil fuels. Washington Governor Jay Inslee introduced a new bill to transition the state to 100 percent clean energy by 2035.

Amidst the various issues being debated, one of the most technical and complicated is Article 6 of the agreement, which focuses on the country plans for climate action.While the world has been having climate conferences since 1992, the tide turned with the Paris Agreement when all countries agreed to play their part to undertake climate action.""Developing countries now have a strong political will to contribute to the greenhouse gas reduction,"" said Hyoeun Jenny Kim, Deputy Director General at the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an international organisation that promotes balancing economic growth without harming the environment. This political will was manifested in Paris with countries voluntarily submitting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for reducing carbon emissions and building climate resilience, taking into account their respective circumstances. ""But at the same time, they need support to affectively implement their NDCs,"" Kim said, at a side event at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24), which was organised by GGGI and focused on transparency and NDC implementation. In order to get support from outside, Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of a country's carbon emissions reduction is almost a precondition as many donor agencies and even private sector organisations want to know how much greenhouse gases a developing country is emitting before they make a decision to support it. ""MRV is key for developing countries to get access to financial, technical and capacity building support, and that's why we are supporting developing countries to set up more proper and internationally acceptable MRV scheme,"" Kim said. GGGI's interventions in this area include preparing a low emissions development strategy for Fiji, Colombia's national green growth strategy and Mongolia's national energy efficiency plan. The organisation is also working on building capacity to implement MRVs in various countries around the globe, including, Mozambique, Senegal, Nepal and Laos. ""We will continue to support our members and partners in their efforts of effectively implementing NDCs with robust MRVs, so they can access more finance,"" Kim said. ""We are committed to reminding countries that green growth can happen."" One of the speakers at the panel was Ariyaratne Hewage, Special Envoy of the President on Climate Change, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, in Sri Lanka, which is on track to become a member of the GGGI. He said Sri Lanka anticipates extensive support from GGGI in the years to come for its preparation of various project proposals to fight climate change. ""The present situation in Sri Lanka is severe droughts in one part of the country and heavy floods in another,"" Hewage said. During a 2016 survey conducted by the Bonn-based NGO Germanwatch, Sri Lanka was awarded the fourth place in terms of climate vulnerability. ""We are severely affected by climate change, so we are very keen in developing climate change programs to ensure these problems are properly addressed,"" Hewage said. The proposed emission reduction i.e. mitigation targets of Sri Lanka's NDCs include 30 percent reduction in the energy sector and 10 percent reduction in transport, industry and waste by 2030. ""For energy and transport sector we already have developed MRV systems, but for the other sectors - industry, waste, agriculture, livestock, forestry - we need help,"" he added. The need for support was also stressed by Ziaul Haque who leads the Bangladesh delegation's COP24 negotiations on Article 6. ""Our main issue is lack of capacity to address this enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement at both the institutional level and the individual level,"" said Haque, highlighting the need for accurate data. ""We need to bring data on green house gas emissions from different institutions and whether they are collecting and archiving the data in the right manner is an issue that needs to be looked at. In this regard our institutional arrangement is not very strong at the national level,"" he said, stating that strengthening the capacity of institutions and individuals who will be dealing with the transparency issue is crucial. Rajani Ranjan Rashmi, a Distinguished Fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and former Special Secretary of India's Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, said at the side event that one of the fundamental issues to deciding a transparency framework is that of flexibility. ""Developing countries should be able to make gradual progression on the quality of data,"" he said. ""We have so far not been able to agree in the discussions on this level of flexibility.""

We demand that everybody who wants to come to the climate conference is allowed into the country to enact their right to participate in peaceful civil society actions for the climate.""Iryna Stavchuk, Executive Director of the Centre for Environmental Initiatives ""Ecoaction"" (Ukraine) said:""Participation of representatives of civil society organisations in climate negotiations is crucial, as they act as important leverage in decision-making. All this is to make sure that achievement of Paris Agreement goal to keep global warming at 1, 5 - 2 level becomes a reality. We find the actions of Polish authorities denying entry of peaceful activists unacceptable"".Wendel Trio, Director Climate Action Network Europe said:""It is appalling and a disgrace that one of our collaborators who successfully co-organised a March of 65.000 people in Brussels last week has been denied entry into Poland. People are demanding climate action from our governments and should be supported for doing so. The Polish government is afraid to see the reality that also they need to act.""Contact: Kim Bryan, global communications campaigner, 350.org, +447770881503, HYPERLINK mailto:kim.bryan@350.orgkim.bryan@350.org; Francois Rogers, head of communications, CAN International, +44 (0) 7 585 707 220, HYPERLINK mailto:frogers@climatenetwork.orgfrogers@climatenetwork.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesTeamManager-6544043 TeamManager\l"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA126","FINAL STATEMENT OF THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION TO THE 24TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE (COP24) IN KATOWICE,","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Vatican Information Service (VIS):Poland (2-15 December 2018)COP 24 struggled to find the will to set aside their short-term economic and political interests and work for the common good. After a long and complex debate, they have found a consensus on the rulebook for the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. We are grateful to the leaders from States and other stakeholders who contributed to this multilateral dialogue and the writing of the rulebook. The consensus on the final document, rather complex and technically detailed, represents a confirmation of the commitments made three years ago in Paris and of the significance of multilateralism. Unfortunately, we must also note that the rulebook does not adequately reflect the urgency necessary to tackle climate change, which ""represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day"" (LS, 25). Moreover, the rulebook seems to downplay human rights, critical in reflecting the human face of climate change, which affects the most vulnerable people on earth. Their cry and that of the earth demand more ambition and greater urgency. The Holy See Delegation, led by the Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, explained that advancing the dignity of the human person, alleviating poverty by the promotion of integral human development, and easing the impact of climate change through responsible mitigation and adaptation measures go hand in hand. We need a just transition period with all parties assuming their respective responsibilities according to the principle of equity. As the IPCC Special Report issued in October 2018 distressingly indicated, we are called to limit responsibly the average global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Therefore, we encourage much greater ambition in delivering Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and stronger mechanisms toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, managing the decarbonisation of the current fossil fuel-based economy, transparently sharing the way each nation implements its commitments, addressing the issue of loss and damage, ensuring solid financial commitments, and promoting education in sustainability, responsible awareness, and lifestyle changes. Faith and reason must come together enabling us to make positive choices in our lifestyles, in how our economies are run, and in building a true global solidarity necessary to avert this climate crisis.\l"

Equally important is the Silesia Declaration signed during the conference. It exhorted relevant stakeholders to ensure a just transition for segments of populations affected by climate agenda.By Margareth SembiringThe latest round of climate negotiations at the COP24 (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) in Katowice, Poland recently highlighted the perennial tension between environmental and economic concerns.This was evidenced in one key point of contention surrounding the position of oil-producing countries namely the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait that did not wish to ""welcome"" the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s special report on theimpacts of global warming of 1.5oC launched in October 2018. Instead, they were only willing to take ""note"" of it. Indeed, the tension betweencaring for the environment and ensuring income streams has to date failed to halt the Earth's temperature from increasing.Environmental vs Economic Concerns: The Silesia DeclarationConsidering these countries' reliance on fossil fuels for their national revenues, it is not too difficult to understand their reluctance to fully sign up to the report. The fossil fuels sector is believed to be the main culprit behind the changing climate. Climate mitigation efforts that are commonly referred to as, among others, low-carbon economy and sustainable development normally target this sector.They often suggest a transformation towards the use of cleaner energysuch as renewable energy sources. Although the solutions seem straightforward, the mechanisms behind them are less so. Not only such transition entails economic risks for countries that have thus far relied on fossil fuels for domestic growth, it may also mean a loss of livelihoods for a large number of people who have depended on the sectorfor a living.This concern was captured in the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration championed by the host Polish government. Poland currently uses coal to produce about 80% of its electricity and it aims to reduce coal use as part of its efforts to fight climate change. Whilegetting onboard of climate actions, it also recognises the need to address the issues surrounding potentially-affected workforce.Most notably, the Silesia Declaration emphasises the need for ""creation of decent work and quality jobs"" for segments of society that will have to transfer to other sectors or lose their sources of income because of the climate agenda. This will facilitate a successful transition to low carbon and climate resilient economy.In light of the tension between environmental and economic concerns, this is arguably one of the most critical aspects that states and relevant stakeholders must address to fully embrace sustainable development. The Silesia Declaration is not the first to highlight its importance. In 2015, the International Labour Organization (ILO) published ""Guidel"

The joint statement, created at Solidarity\' s prompting and written cooperatively between the two organizations on December 5, was submitted to the UN Conference of the Parties climate conference in Katowice today.  The Silesian Region of Solidarity, the Secretariat of Mining and Energy of Solidarity, and The Heartland Institute express skepticism of the assertions of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the world stands at the edge of a climate catastrophe, said the statement.  Solidarity and The Heartland Institute together stress that there is no scientific consensus on the main causes and consequences of climate change. Read the entire joint statement here. The joint statement was signed by Jaroslaw Grzesik, Chairman of Secretariat, Mining and Energy of Solidarity; Dominik Kolorz, president of the Silesian Region of Solidarity; and Heartland Institute Senior Fellow for Environment and Energy Policy James Taylor, who represented the organization. The communique also stated that The Heartland Institute \- a U.S.-based free-market think tank known globally for its work on scientifically opposing climate alarmism \- and Solidarity would begin  working together more closely to advance sound, science-based public policy. Solidarity took the initiative in 2014 to translate from English to Polish Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science \- part of a series of scientific reports by the Nongovernmental Interntional Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) \- and invited Heartland to its office in Katowice on December 5 to give presentations on the latest climate science and the failure of green energy plans in neighboring Germany. The latter presentation was delivered by Wolfgang M\'fcller, general secretary of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE). The communique states that Solidarity\' s Katowice representatives were  very satisfied by the new science and policy presentations from Heartland during their COP24 meeting, adding that  the presentations assured Solidarity that their doubts about current, alarmist climate policy are correct.  We, speaking as one, believe in the restoration of the Scientific Method and the dismissal of ideological dogma at the United Nations, the joint statement said.  That means a healthy skepticism of data interpretation and policy conclusions and an end to the war on science and scientists by powerful state-backed forces. The statement declared: Global leaders should focus their efforts on energy affordability and availability that raise living standards around the world. The negative impacts of expensive energy on human health and welfare are manifest and devastating. Affordable energy is absolutely necessary to lift people out of poverty and secure a brighter future for the people of the world. The most important joint task will be educating the public and policy makers on climate policy,  especially the world\' s youth \- who have been indoctrinated by climate alarmist dogma for generations. The statement also made clear that none of the signatories oppose  the goal of clean air nor supports the elimination of coal from the world\' s energy portfolio.  Solidarity has proven time and again that it will stand up the common man against the ruling elites, Taylor said.  Solidarity, like the Heartland Institute, does not shy away from pointing out flaws in the United Nations' asserted climate crisis. Sound science is on our side and we are honored to work closely, now and in the future, with Solidarity.

The Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its gloomy report at a meeting in Incheon, South Korea, with the warning that time is running out if the world wants to keep warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The pledges nations made in the Paris agreement in 2015 are 'clearly insufficient to limit warming to 1.5 in any way,' one of the study's lead authors, Joerj Roeglj of the Imperial College in London, said. The world has already seen one-degree Celsius rise in temperatures since the start of the industrial age. The Katowice Conference [10]will have 'quite significant consequences for humanity and for the way in which we take care of our planet,' Kurtyka told the Associated Press ahead of the talks. This is because the Paris agreement let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. And this is a problem. The conference also comes at a time when the World Meteorological Organization[11] released a statement last week saying globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide [12]reached 405.5 parts per million in 2017, up slightly from the previous year and from 400.1 in 2015. Concentrations of other heat-trapping gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, also rose. This year, the world can expect a 2-3 percent increase in carbon human-made emissions as the construction of coal-fired power plants in Asia and Africa continue while carbon-absorbing rainforests in the Amazon and Asia are felled faster than they can regrow. 'Everyone recognized that the national plans, when you add everything up, will take us way beyond 3, potentially 4 degrees Celsius warming,' said Johan Rockstrom, the incoming director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. 'We know that we're moving in the wrong direction,' Rockstrom told the AP. 'We need to bend the global carbon emissions no later than 2020  in two years' time  to stand a chance to stay under 2 degrees Celsius.' In the last few months people all over the world have lost their lives and homes to horrific wildfires fuelled by #climatechange[13]. Time to stop the fires. Time to stop burning fossil fuels. pic.twitter.com/lqIqADX7p6[14]  Climate News Hub (@ClimateNewsHub) November 29, 2018[15]The key challenge in KatowiceIt will be a challenge convincing countries to set tougher targets - and stick to them to get us past 2020. And it will require a transformation in all sectors of their economies, including energy, agriculture, and other industries. And we really have to do away with fossil fuels to make the transition work. Countries will also need to get past the argument that large industrial countries should be paying more than small or poorer nations for mediating the impacts of climate change. Rich countries say they're willing to lead the way, but only if poor nations play their part as well. 'Obviously not all countries are at the same stage of development,' said Lidia Wojtal, an associate with Berlin-based consultancy Climatekos and a former Polish climate negotiator. 'So we need to also take that into account and differentiate between the responsibilities. And that's a huge task.' All in all, in the three years since the climate agreement was drawn up, there have been critics from different parts of the political spectrum trying their best to diminish its importance on a global scale. But the agreement should be defended for many reasons, primarily because of what former U.S. President Barack Obama said in 2015. The Paris Agreement may prove to be 'the best chance we have to save the one planet we've got.' Don't expect to see President Donald Trump or Russian President Vladimir Putin at the conference that is expected to have nearly 40,000 guests from 200 countries. According to Russian News Agency, Tass,[16] Putin is not planning to attend the United Nations in Poland's Katowice on December 2-15, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. ""The president's schedule does not have this [event],"" Peskov said, noting that Russia may be represented at this conference by a government official. As for the U.S., Trump is using the conference to illustrate the importance of pushing ""clean coal.""[17] Proponents of coal and natural gas will dominate the panel, which will also likely feature a U.S. Energy Department representative. There are no plans to include a representative for the green energy industry.

Katowice is an important step to make the Paris Agreement a success by defining a robust transparency and accountability system to track progress towards the long-term goal, writes Bernard Respaut n euroactiv.com. Bernard Respaut is the chief executive of the European Copper Institute. The summit comes on the heels of a long-anticipatedreportby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C, we need rapid and far-reaching transitions in buildings and cities, energy, industry, land and transport. Global carbon emissions would have to fall by as much as 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050. We therefore need to decarbonise together, now. The European Parliament hascalled onworld leaders to strengthen their post-2020 climate commitments and mobilise adequate climate financing for developing countries. Beyond strengthening commitments, though, we must implement them, and COP24 will be crucial in providing a 'real time' overview of how far committed partners have come with actioning their goals. Europe should continue to lead the charge, but it is imperative the rest of the world follows. Copper: the metal of the energy transition The good news is we have solutions, and copper is central to many. It is the metal of the energy transition, facilitating production of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency in products and systems, and supporting the electrification of transport, heating and cooling. Based on the EU's 2050 scenario, we estimate the energy transition may increase demand for copper by up to 6-times (approx. 25 million tonnes in 2050). This makes recycling pivotal and, fortunately, a well-established recycling chain already exists, enabling the endless reuse of copper. The copper industry is energy intensive. Energy makes up 20-30 percent of production costs, meaning it is vulnerable to increasing energy and climate costs. To preserve the production of copper and other raw materials in Europe, and unleash their many benefits supporting climate solutions in addition to the jobs and growth associated with a sector in growing demand we need a legislative framework that supports their continued contribution. Key to that is a level playing field with other developed or transitioning nations, such as the USA or China, when it comes to energy and climate costs. Energy efficiency: widening the scope As economic growth and urbanisation demand ever more energy, using it efficiently is pivotal. A recentreportby the International Energy Agency shows that without energy efficiency policies, we would have consumed 12% more energy and produced 12% more greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. It also found there is substantial potential to save more. To achieve our full energy saving potential, however, global annual energy efficiency investments must double by 2025 and double again by 2040. Recently, the implementation of energy efficiency measures hasslowed, and European policies are not delivering the greatest possible energy savings. Yet significant opportunities remain, including in the EU energy system. The scope of EU energy efficiency policy should be widened to include measures in all energy-using sectors, and implement some more complex measures offering significant energy savings, such as building automation and electrification of heat and transport. These savings can be realised at costs well below the price of energy supply, and thus make great financial sense. They are also important in an increasingly renewable energy system. Connecting solutions through copper Products containing copper tend to operate more efficiently, with typical cost-effective reductions in energy use in the range of 20-30% t. Copper is thus a connector to energy efficiency solutions, and it also connects on a policy level. In 2017, the European Copper Institute launchedDecarbEurope: an initiative bringing together partners from across sectors and markets to facilitate a truly low-carbon economy by presenting an integrated vision for how to achieve a deep, cost-effective, circular-oriented and consumer-centric energy transition. As DecarbEurope, we believe decarbonisation will only happen through a symbiosis of policy and business, so we bring tangible solutions to the table showing how that transition could look. One example is sector coupling: the development of multiple integration vectors such as electricity, bioenergy, cogeneration, hydrogen and district heating, to name a few. European leadership The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement represents an opportunity for Europe to lead by example on global climate action. The new EU strategy for long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions can provide a robust framework that if effectively implemented could make a significant contribution to the Paris goals. With this year's COP24 summit being held in a major European mining and industrial region, it is more relevant than ever to discuss the key role of raw materials in mitigating climate change. For Europe to successfully lead global action on climate change, we need more dialogue, collaboration and joined up efforts across sectors. We need not one but many solutions, that together allow us to meet our Paris Agreement commitments and stay competitive in the long term. The copper industry has some of the solutions, and we are committed to finding and implementing more. \l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA138","MENENDEZ DELIVERS FLOOR SPEECH ON COP24 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE NEGOTIATIONS; ""IT IS COMPLETELY ABSURD TO ASSUME THAT THE U.S., BY WITHDRAWING FROM THE PARIS ....","December 11, 2018","Congressional Documents and Publications","WASHINGTON - Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered a speech on the Senate Floor on the ongoing negotiations at COP 24 - the 2018 Climate Change Conference - where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue.In calling for the President to reconsider his calamitous decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, Menendez described how New Jersey, a leader in the renewable energy sector, is already doing its part as a national leader for clean energy jobs and climate change resilience.Below are his remarks as delivered:""Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the negotiations taking place in Katowice, Poland to finalize the rulebook on implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. There is an immediate urgency for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution as emissions continue to increase. The longer it takes for us to fully accept and acknowledge the problem, the more aggressive the world will have to be to avoid the worst effects of climate change from becoming a reality.For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable.Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone.That includes reports from the world's top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts.What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American.There's a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly--the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract.Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises.Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy.While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable.It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8[degrees] Celsius (1.4[degrees] Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks.It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average--the highest annual average in the satellite record.None of these facts are new. None of these facts are deniable. The science predicted these climate change effects twenty, even thirty, years ago. To echo a common sentiment among climate change leaders on the urgency of the situation, who said, 'We are the first generations to experience the effects of climate change, and the last that can act to prevent the worst.'This urgency is fueling the negotiations in Poland this week.Deliberations on the various elements of these rules began shortly after the Paris Agreement's entry into force in November 2016, and the Agreement requires the rules be completed this year, making the COP in Katowice the most consequential Conference of Parties since COP21 in Paris.The Paris Agreement establishes firm, albeit non-binding, global emissions reduction goals; reductions sufficient to prevent a two-degree-Celsius increase in global average temperatures. The Paris Agreement also clearly outl"

While negotiations take place, a number of events focus on practical solutions to help humanity face the challenge.In this context, UNECE is raising awareness of the role that wood can play in cutting down emissions when replacing more carbon-intensive materials in the construction sector. This takes the form of a cartoon entitled ""The Three Little Pigs and Climate Change"", jointly developed with the Polish Ministry of the Environment and State Forests Poland, which revisits the classic fairy-tale.In this new version, it is no longer the wolf that threatens the life of the three little pigs, but climate change - a scarier and stronger adversary.The cartoon, made for a young audience, contains messages for all ages alike. It reminds us that carbon emissions of concrete and steel respectively are 40 and 30 percent higher than those of wood. It highlights that global CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to 31 percent if builders used wood instead of steel and concrete. This would reduce global fossil fuel consumption by 12 to 19 percent.""It was time to change the narrative on buildings and climate change, starting from the little tales we tell our children"" said Ms. Paola Deda, Officer in Charge of the Forests, Land and Housing Division of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, while launching the cartoon in Katowice. ""We cannot continue telling the same stories; climate change is changing needs, habits, solutions and indeed, also fairy tales that cannot longer afford promoting unsustainable ways of life"", she concluded.""We are proud of this cartoon, as it highlights the connection between our choices and their impact on their environment, in the context of climate change. The COP24 in Katowice is also about raising awareness of solutions, and sustainable paths to reduce the climate change thereat"" said Mr. Andrzej Konieczny, Director General of the State Forests Poland, at the launching event. ""And we are happy this video about buildings is presented in an event dedicated to forests: wood continues to be a sustainable material and it will be increasingly the choice of the future for smart and energy efficient buildings"", concluded Mr. Konieczny.Watch the video at: HYPERLINK https://youtu.be/66jVm1f5KJIhttps://youtu.be/66jVm1f5KJIContact: Theresa Loeffler, +41 22 917 4157, HYPERLINK mailto:theresa.loeffler@un.orgtheresa.loeffler@un.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6550599 MSTRUCK\l"

Among the commitments was to keep the increase in global temperatures under 2 degrees Celcius.Osafo's concerns were confirmed by Mohamed Nasr, Chair of the AGN. He said that during this past week there had been very little progress with regards to financial commitments from the developed world to address loss and damages related to past injustices, adaptation, gender equality, and the empowerment of women, among other issues. The seeking of a commitment from developed nations on this is being spearheaded by the African team.""The progress so far is not up to expectations, and if this is the way [negotiations will] go, it means we will not be able to implement what we agreed to in Paris,"" said Nasr.

The group reminded the political leaders that the current federal plan will not allow us to reach our Paris climate targets and that the conclusions of the latest IPCC report must be respected if we are to mitigate the climate crisis.The IPCC report highlights that we have 12 years left to act. Global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 C and avoid catastrophic climate change (). In Canada, we are far from reaching the GHG emissions reduction target that we set for 2030, and the current target falls short by 66 million tonnes of CO2.The welcoming committee called for Canada to adopt much more ambitious targets and a plan of action that respects climate science and Indigenous rights, and that will lead us towards a just transition for all workers, youth and future generations. The committee also demanded that Premiers recognize that decreasing oil and gas production is necessary if Canada is to comply with the Paris Agreement and avoid a massive increase in extreme weather patterns, a phenomenon that we are already seeing all over Canada.The First Ministers meeting took place during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24Quotes: Katie Ross, Youth Rising and Climate Justice Montreal organiser:""Youth are rising all around the world to demand real climate action from our leaders.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA158","""CLIMATE CHANGE WILL NOT WAIT FOR US""","December 13, 2018 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT):At UN Climate Change Conference, MIT researchers share knowledge and tools to help nations meet Paris Agreement targets.Emily Dahl | MIT Energy InitiativeEmily Dahl of the MIT Energy Initiative filed this report from the 2018 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, which runs Dec. 3 - 14.For the past two weeks, climate negotiations at the 2018 United Nations in Katowice, Poland a.k.a. COP24The process has left negotiators and observers alike frustrated as reaching consensus proves difficult on key issues, including how to ramp up climate finance for poorer countries and how to monitor and report emissions reductions. Some of the fiercest debates have arisen over whether to officially ""welcome"" the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the urgency of keeping emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius, which was opposed by just four nations: the U.S., Russia, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.Speaking to the parties on Dec. 11, U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa asked them to stay the course, saying, ""Many political divisions remain. Many issues still must be overcome. But I believe it's within our grasp to finish the job."" She challenged them, ""Let's complete the Paris Agreement Work Program and, by doing so, immediately unleash the power of the Paris Agreement itself.""MIT participants are here at the conference to support that aim to help unleash the power of the Paris Agreement by sharing analyses and insights that can aid nations in determining the right policy and technology solutions for meeting emissions reduction targets.Searching for optimism amid dire climate scenariosSruthi Davuluri, a master's student in the Technology and Policy Program (TPP) who attended the first week of the conference, came to Katowice looking to broaden and deepen her knowledge of different nations' policies and initiatives to address climate change. She says she felt discouraged for the first few days, especially given the dialogue around the IPCC's report.""In the negotiations, there were clear tensions between countries trying to push through and those trying to slow down the process,"" she says. ""In some sessions, people from the developing nations said they feel panicked. They know how difficult it is to convince other nations to see beyond their own borders, and how a global temperature rise of 'even' 1.5 degrees Celsius is actually a 2-degree rise for some nations, with dire climate-related impacts.""""The week was a roller coaster of thoughts,"" says Anthony Fratto Oyler, another TPP master's student, who is a research assistant with the MIT Energy Initiative. Since the seventh grade, he's dreamed of coming to the climate conference and seeing negotiations firsthand. ""During the week, I was struck by the severity of what we are facing, and as a young person, you can feel disheartened and small.""""It's difficult to imagine countries coming together to a solution when they can't even agree on a single sentence for a guidance document,"" he says. ""More so when you realize the inspirational, progressive, and pragmatic leaders that came together to sign the Paris Agreement three years ago are no longer there and in some countries' cases have been replaced by leaders who refuse to accept facts of climate change.""Erik Landry SM '18, has also found the conference eye-opening: ""In some sense, the tone of the talks has been disconcerting, but this is balanced by a powerful feeling of inspiration and empowerment that you can see from extremely innovative and creative individuals and organizations presenting their initiatives here at the conference."" Landry, a research associate in the Office of the Vice President for Research, is at the conference to advance his research on climate finance and to bring back insights that could help MIT as the Institute continues to advance its own climate action plan.Davuluri and Oyler have found reasons for optimism as well.""I loved hearing passionate people from developing countries and climate activists from small towns in the U.S., and getting the opportunity to have one-on-one interactions to hear their stories,"" says Davuluri, who enjoyed attending sessions with fellow researchers and having meetings with policymakers including the head of the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water, a global think tank based in India.""By the end of my time I ultimately felt hopeful,"" says Oyler. ""It's inspiring to know there are tens of thousands of individuals from all the world working through research, policy, leadership, and other avenues to address climate change.""Best practices for carbon markets and emissions trading systemsCarbon markets have been a major subject of discussion at the conference, and have figured prominently into MIT researchers' discussions here including at an official side event organized by the World Energy Council in collaboration with MIT, on innovative energy, environmental, and technological avenues for meeting Paris Agreement goals. The event featured government and industry leaders, including George Heyman, British Columbia's minister of environment and climate change strategy; Todd Muller, conservative opposition leader in New Zealand's parliament; Claude Nahon, senior vice president of sustainable development at Electricite de France; Matar Al Neyadi, United Arab Emirates undersecretary of energy; and moderator Sir Philip Lowe of the World Energy Council.At the event, Sergey Paltsev, a senior researcher at the MIT Energy Initiative and deputy director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, shared takeaways from new research on climate policy and technology pathways for nations to meet their Paris Agreement targets. The findings were drawn from analyses of selected Latin American nations and member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as best practices and lessons learned from these and other governments.Turning to Heyman, Paltsev said, ""Our best example in these reports is the carbon price in British Columbia and their approach to this issue, which scores very well in many dimensions. We need good examples. We need to show it is possible to do, it is possible to do it smart, and it is possible to do it with citizens approving the policy and continuing that support.""Michael Mehling, deputy director of MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, has been speaking at a number of events on carbon markets. ""Economists widely agree that putting a price on carbon is the most cost-effective way of dealing with the externalities that cause climate change,"" he says. At COP24, Mehling has been discussing collaborative emissions reduction options for governments through a provision of the Paris Agreement, Article 6.He explains, ""Article 6 of the Paris Agreement contains an option for countries to cooperate across borders, voluntarily, by transferring mitigation outcomes. That allows one jurisdiction to meet its climate pledges with mitigation efforts achieved in another jurisdiction."" Using this option, countries can collaborate by buying and selling emission reductions across national borders which can dramatically reduce the cost of achieving collective mitigation targets compared to countries acting on their own. That, in turn, should enable countries to increase the ambition of their climate efforts, but it also requires observing certain safeguards.Mehling's research, outl"

We will get it done together,"" said Governor Brown.""The moment is now. We are the last generation that can stop the consequences of climate change,"" said Prime Minister Sanchez.Today's meeting between Governor Brown and Prime Minister Sanchez included Spain's Ambassador to the United States Santiago Cabanas, Secretary General of International Affairs Jose Manuel Albares and Director General of Economic Affairs Manuel De La Rocha and builds on this week's events and meetings in New York with world leaders at Climate Week NYC and the World Economic Forum's Sustainable Development Impact Summit.California's Leadership on Climate ChangeReaffirming California's global climate leadership, Governor Brown convened the Global Climate Action Summit earlier this month in San Francisco, where grassroots activists, mayors, governors, heads of industry and nonprofits made hundreds of new commitments ahead of this year's United Nations (COP24). This month, the Governor also signed legislation setting a 100 percent clean electricity goal for the state, and issued an executive order establishing a new target to achieve carbon neutrality - both by 2045. Additionally, the Governor signed bills to block new federal offshore oil drilling along California's coast, announced the state's opposition to the federal government's plan to expand oil drilling on public lands in California and committed to developing and eventually launching a satellite that will track climate change-causing pollutants with unprecedented precision and help the world dramatically reduce these destructive emissions.Earlier this year Governor Brown issued executive orders to improve the health of the state's forests and help mitigate the threat and impacts of wildfire, and get 5 million zero-emission vehicles onto California's roads by 2030. Last year, the Governor signed landmark legislation to extend and strengthen the state's cap-and-trade program and create a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level.Under Governor Brown, California has established the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; set the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; and will reduce fossil fuel consumption up to 50 percent and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings by 2030. The state has met its 2020 target four years early, reducing emissions 13 percent while growing the economy 26 percent. From 2015 to 2016 alone, emissions reductions were roughly equal to taking 2.4 million cars off the road, saving 1.5 billion gallons of gasol"

On one hand you have rich countries unwilling to cut emissions despite already being wealthy like the United States. They are largely indifferent to worsening the plight of poor countries which must bear the brunt of climate change, like those in sub-Saharan Africa[1]. On the other hand, you also have developing countries that do not want to sacrifice anything to economic growth despite having among the world's most polluted cities[2] on the face of the Earth. I'm talking about you, China and India. But there are ""good guys[3]"" here: Out of the sheer necessity of survival, small island nations at risk of being submerged by higher sea levels worldwide are leading the charge at climate negotiations to save them from literally disappearing off the map. Let's say their work is cut out against the likes of the United States--promoting coal at a climate conference, what a joke[4]--and China and India who are quite callous to the plight of fellow developing countries. So much for third world solidarity... The ongoing negotiations on how to implement the Paris Agreement aren't going well. The world's largest economies and top greenhouse emitters remain mired in decades-old arguments about who is responsible for addressing climate change and its impacts.Now, a group of small island nations have stepped in to save themselves. Countries like Kiribati, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands aren't your typical geopolitical movers and shakers, but here at the United Nations [5] in Katowice, Poland these highly vulnerable countries have managed to reshape discussions with a simple but poignant reminder: if the world fails to halt global warming they may disappear for good.'We are not prepared to die, and the Maldives have no intention of dying,' Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives told reporters in Poland. 'We are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above the water.'They try, but the message sometimes falls on deaf ears: To do that, these countries have launched a last-minute blitz to rouse higher-emitting and slower-moving countries to action. They are pushing their counterparts to demand a more aggressive agreement in a series of closed-door bilateral discussions. And they've launched a messaging campaign to signal that they will not let other countries off the hook if they hold back.I am obviously sympathetic to small island states, but I do have to scratch my head about what kind of political leverage they can apply to get what they want achieved during these international talks. Literally, they are the smallest of fishes in a very big pond.

As part of the deal, every country will need to follow uniform standards for measuring carbon emissions. Ahead of 2020, countries will be required to raise ambition for reducing the emissions at the heart of causing climate change.""Recent scientific reports showed a disturbing path toward global destruction due to climate change, but negotiations in Poland gave us a hopeful alternative roadmap for action,"" said Senator Markey.

Clearly, we need to act.""Interestingly, the first electric vehicles were produced and sold at the beginning of the 1900s and sales peaked in the early 1910s.""But technological developments and the discovery of large oil reserves displaced the electric vehicle in favour of the combustion engine.""Now, almost 100 years later, electric vehicles are coming back and need to increasingly displace the combustion engine in favour of reducing emissions and air pollution.""We need sustainable and clean transport systems.""The growing awareness for clean air and climate change means that many governments around the world have begun embracing e-mobility.""Many are putting in place the policy frameworks and infrastructure needed for sustainable transport.""A growing number of countries and regions have announced plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles and to shift to e-mobility.""Others are putting in place targets for the absolute number or overall share of electric vehicles by 2020 or 2030.""And the International Energy Agency estimates that in 2017, there were already 3.5 million charging outlets for electric vehicles around the world.""These policy initiatives have spurred market growth for electric vehicles.There is increasing demand and many businesses are embracing e-mobility and its new economic opportunities.""By some estimates, this will displace 7.3 million barrels per day of transport fuel. ""This clearly shows the potential of e-mobility in contributing to climate change mitigation.Many sustainable transport strategies also have large, immediate health benefits for the majority of the world's population, and large equity benefits for vulnerable groups.""But the growth in electric vehicles will have a significant impact on electricity demand - and this needs to be kept in mind.""If not managed carefully, the additional demand will create challenges across all sections of the energy system, particularly at peak times.""E-mobility that depends on a fossil fuel-based energy system would potentially significantly drive climate change and air pollution and not lead to the solution we want.""According to IRENA, assuming all these new electric vehicles were to consume 100% renewable electricity, around 450 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year of additional renewable electricity would be required by 2030.""We have the solutions at our finger tips. We have much of the technology in place. We have policies to drive and support sustainable transport. And market conditions and demand are responding positively.""The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity.But the transition needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full.""If we get this right, then a decarbonized transport system will be part of the solution.""The ""Driving Change Together"" declaration is an essential step towards a decarbonized transport system.""I applaud the Katowice Partnership for e-mobility and I urge all actors to support it. It provides all actors, including the private sector, with ever more clarity and confidence on the direction of travel.""By supporting it, you will contribute to reaching the aims of the Paris Agreement.""By supporting it, you will contribute to a sustainable future for the benefit of all.

Brown Jr., The State of California has issued the following news release: Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today met with Prime Minister of Spain Pedro S225;nchez in Sacramento, where the two leaders discussed further bilateral trade and climate cooperation and action between California and Spain.  California and Spain share common history and a common commitment to climate action. We will get it done together, said Governor Brown.  The moment is now. We are the last generation that can stop the consequences of climate change, said Prime Minister S225;nchez. Today\' s meeting between Governor Brown and Prime Minister S225;nchez included Spain\' s Ambassador to the United States Santiago Cabanas, Secretary General of International Affairs Jos233; Manuel Albares and Director General of Economic Affairs Manuel De La Rocha and builds on this week\' s events and meetings in New York with world leaders at Climate Week NYC and the World Economic Forum\' s Sustainable Development Impact Summit. California\' s Leadership on Climate Change Reaffirming California\' s global climate leadership, Governor Brown convened the Global Climate Action Summit earlier this month in San Francisco, where grassroots activists, mayors, governors, heads of industry and nonprofits made hundreds of new commitments ahead of this year\' s United Nations (COP24). This month, the Governor also signed legislation setting a 100 percent clean electricity goal for the state, and issued an executive order establishing a new target to achieve carbon neutrality \- both by 2045. Additionally, the Governor signed bills to block new federal offshore oil drilling along California\' s coast, announced the state\' s opposition to the federal government\' s plan to expand oil drilling on public lands in California and committed to developing and eventually launching a satellite that will track climate change-causing pollutants with unprecedented precision and help the world dramatically reduce these destructive emissions. Earlier this year Governor Brown issued executive orders to improve the health of the state\' s forests and help mitigate the threat and impacts of wildfire, and get 5 million zero-emission vehicles onto California\' s roads by 2030. Last year, the Governor signed landmark legislation to extend and strengthen the state\' s cap-and-trade program and create a groundbreaking program to measure and combat air pollution at the neighborhood level. Under Governor Brown, California has established the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America; set the nation\' s toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants; and will reduce fossil fuel consumption up to 50 percent and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in buildings by 2030. The state has met its 2020 target four years early, reducing emissions 13 percent while growing the economy 26 percent. From 2015 to 2016 alone, emissions reductions were roughly equal to taking 2.4 million cars off the road, saving 1.5 billion gallons of gasol"

A group of 415 investors overseeing $32 trillion in assets have signed a letter asking governments to phase out thermal coal, set a price on carbon emissions and end fossil-fuel subsidies. The signatories, including Allianz SE, HSBC Global Asset Management and Schroders PLC, are presenting it in conjunction with the COP 24 global-climate conference in Poland. The fund managers said climate change could cause economic damage that threatens their holdings, and that government policy was key to reducing risk. Schroders estimated that if no action is taken and the world warms by 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit), that could cause $23 trillion in global economic losses over the next 80 years. ""This is permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, while continuing to escalate,"" the group said in a statement yesterday. ""Much more needs to be done by governments to accelerate the low-carbon transition."" While letters don't usually lead to immediate change, the combined efforts of asset managers have already stirred the private sector. Last week, Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it would set new public goals around cutting carbon emissions after months of pressure from some of the same investors who signed the new letter. The investor group also wrote a briefing paper for policymakers that says governments need to update and strengthen their commitments to the Paris climate accord. Among the recommendations are that nations put a price on carbon -- in effect a tax on greenhouse gas emissions -- between $38 and $100 a ton. Currently, three-quarters of emissions are covered by carbon prices of less than $10 a ton, the paper said. The COP 24 conference is in its second week and will end on Dec. 14. -- Kelly Gilblom, Bloomberg\l"

In his remarks, Senator Carper also highlighted the agreements reached at COP24, the Trump Administration's ignorance of this issue and the economic, environmental and public health consequences of inaction.Following the conclusion of COP24, Senator Carper on Saturday released a statement responding to the multilateral agreement reached to implement the Paris Climate Accord. Read that response HERE HYPERLINK https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=78D8D942-D9CD-4777-800E-BC42CB82D59E.""This agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade,"" said Senator Carper. ""Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every day...Yet, as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate change, the Trump Administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies.""Senator Carper continued, ""We don't have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up and get going. That's why, as the senior Democrat and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I'm anxious to help lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate future. If we're honest with our children and grandchildren, we don't have any other choice...""Today's speech can be viewed by visiting HYPERLINK https://youtu.be/YAdexZOGpKEhttps://youtu.be/YAdexZOGpKE""Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley to reflect on the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that concluded this past weekend in Poland. This important conference, which is better known as COP24, met there for the past two weeks as leaders from nearly 200 countries worked to reach agreement on how the world will actually implement the Paris Climate Agreement.""The stakes could not be higher. The future of our planet and the futures of our children and grandchildren hang in the balance. It was a positive step forward that the international community could come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change on a global scale by finally beginning to implement the Paris Agreement into practice. Having said that, however, this agreement is not perfect, and no one is pretending it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined, just months ago, are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade.""The entire world must be doing even more to address this problem. That includes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead. While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable.""But reaching bolder future agreements is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeavor - and that includes saving our planet. Unfortunately, our President - along with many of those within his Administration - continues to reject climate science and deny the reality of the problems we are facing.""Well, Mr. President, here's the reality. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced 16 extreme weather-related disasters that exceeded $1 billion in 2017. In the past year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges, flooding, wildfires, crop freezes and droughts - a new record!""Thirteen of our nation's leading scientific federal agencies recently reported to us in the National Climate Assessment that, if we do nothing to address our carbon emissions, today's extreme weather-related events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead.""In the future, we can continue to expect rainfalls where precipitation is measured by the foot, not in inches. We can continue to expect more wildfires out West burning areas larger than my home state of Delaware. And we can continue to expect extreme flooding to devastate small communities like Ellicott City Maryland, which has been hit by two 1,000-year-floods in the past two years alone. Think about that! Two in the past two years alone!""Mr. President, one of the most memorable lyrics from singer-songwriter Stephen Stills goes something like this, 'Something's happening here. Just what it is ain't exactly clear.' Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and it IS exactly clear.' What's also clear is that there's still time to do something about it and actually foster economic growth in the USA and beyond our borders. Climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists and from leading scientists around the world.""Let me also remind my colleagues that the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction or whim of any one person or administration. It was Congress that passed a law mandating that the National Climate Assessment be presented every four years. That law was called the Global Change Research Act of 1990. It passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush - a Republican.""Our nation's leading scientists warned us yet again - less than one month ago - that, if we fail to start seriously reducing carbon emissions now, by the end of the century, we may well be witnessing: sea-levels rising another 6 feet, resulting in an estimated $3.6 trillion in cumulative damages to U.S. coastal properties and infrastructure; annual economic losses of up to $500 billion that will impact nearly every major economic sector in our country; and, reductions in our gross domestic product by up to 10 percent - twice that of the Great Recession that brought America to its knees a decade ago.""Yet, as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate change, the Trump Administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies. The Administration is also attempting to discredit the recent science reports by pushing talking points from well-known climate deniers.""But Americans aren't falling for these tricks anymore. Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every day. And they want action. So does our business community. While this Administration sits on its hands, American businesses are stepping up in a big way to combat the effects of climate change. Many businesses stand ready to do even more.""To our international friends who are wondering where this nation is on climate change, I can tell you that the majority of Americans - including me - are with you. We support the Paris Climate Agreement. We want to reduce carbon emissions because we're convinced that doing so will enable us to save our planet.""This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue. This isn't a blue-state or red-state issue. It affects all of us. And if you think climate change hasn't reached your state just yet, the science is clear that it will. Luckily for us, young people are leading the call for action. Climate change or environmental issues are often mistakenly forgotten when we discuss domestic issues. In today's news cycle, especially under this Administration, it doesn't always make headl"

Discussions at the conference, which runs until Dec. 14, are centered around individual countries' emissions reductions pledges to achieve the goals of the accord as well as how to finance mitigation and adaptation for vulnerable nations and the overall transition to a low-carbon global economy.France said it will contribute an additional 15 million to the climate change adaptation fund and 20 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund, another UNFCCC vehicle. The country will increase its public climate funding to 5 billion per year in 2020, compared with 3 billion in 2015, the French environment ministry said, with the share devoted to climate change adaptation rising from 1 billion to 1.5 billion per year.Germany's environment ministry said it will also pour an additional 70 million into the adaptation fund, which finances projects like early warning systems for floods and heavy rainfall and measures for securing water supply. With a contribution of 240 million so far, Germany is already the largest donor to the fund, the ministry said.The U.K. announced that it would provide an extra \£3100 million to support up to 40 new renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa over the next five years, supporting developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects. The government said the funds, part of the U.K.'s commitment to invest \£35.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020, could unlock an additional \£3156 million of private finance into renewable energy in Africa by 2023.Climate finance rules still lackingAt the Paris climate negotiations in 2015, 18 developed countries pledged to leverage climate financing of $100 billion annually from 2020 to developing countries. According to climate news website Carbon Brief, a recent assessment by the U.N. found that the sum had reached $75 billion in 2016, up from $65 billion in 2015 either directly given by governments or raised from the private sector. A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, found that public climate finance alone reached $56.7 billion in 2017.But even after previous climate summits taking up the topic, rich donor countries and poorer nations on the receiving end of the funds still disagree over what counts as climate finance.""In the absence of any common accounting methodology under the UNFCCC, contributor countries have been able to decide in a vacuum what they would count as part of their commitment to mobilize $100 billion by 2020,"" Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, and Romain Weikmans, a lecturer at Universit\'e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, wrote in a blog post for the Brookings Institution, a think tank.Since contributing countries have adopted different accounting and reporting practices, it is near impossible to compare data on climate finance, the authors said. While previous COP summits have called for the development of rules to account for climate finance, ""these modalities need to be decided, so the world can get on with this,"" Roberts and Weikmans said. ""The next few days in Katowice will be crucial in redressing the current dysfunction.""European countries and the U.S. are also fighting efforts by developing countries to introduce terms on loss and damage provisions, which would detail how to compensate the most vulnerable countries for already occurring climate change effects, into all negotiating items on the table, according to news website Euractiv.Japan was the largest climate finance provider in 2015 and 2016, giving $10.3 billion per year on average, followed by Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S., according to Carbon Brief's analysis of a climate finance database collated by the OECD. The biggest recipients of the funds in those years were India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand.In 2017, the EU, its member states and the European Investment Bank together provided 20.4 billion in public climate finance for developing countries, making up over 40% of the total provided by the developed world, according to the European Commission.\l"

Chase is enabling the Polish coal industry to continue to grow even while other countries across Europe make commitments to phase out coal. The planned Ostroleka C coal-fired power plant has attracted particular controversy.Chase, already the target of a growing international climate accountability campaign due to its role as the #1 U.S. banker of extreme fossil fuels, is supporting Ostroleka C via financing for Energa, one of the two state-controlled companies behind the project. The Ostroleka C power plant is projected to burn two million tons of coal per year from 2023 to 2063, emitting six million tons of CO2 annually and causing serious public health impacts.Last year, Chase underwrote a Euros300 million bond issuance for Energa at a time when Ostroleka C was a key strategic project for the company, despite a Chase policy ruling out direct finance for new coal plants in OECD countries, including Poland. This bond issuance constituted the only private bank financing for either Energa or Enea since the adoption of the Paris climate agreement in 2015.""From a climate context, new coal power should not be happening, and Chase knows it. Yet, Chase is actively promoting the expansion of coal power in Poland by exploiting a glaring loophole in its coal policy that goes totally against its stated commitment not to fund the expansion of coal-fired power plants,"" said Jason Opena Disterhoft with Rainforest Action Network (RAN). ""Chase's financing of Ostroleka C is flatly incompatible with the Paris Agreement or supporting a 1.5 degree world.""""JPMorgan Chase should know better,"" said Kuba Gogolewski, Senior Finance Campaigner at Foundation ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO"". ""They should look beyond the very short-term interest in providing finance to the Polish coal industry. The energy system in Poland must undergo a rapid transformation, and JPMorgan Chase is slowing down this change by financing coal utilities and coal power plants.""Chase has been the target of widespread, escalating protests calling on the bank to end its massive financing of the most destructive and polluting forms of fossil fuels and to align its policies and practices with the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Agreement.The October 2018 report from the IPCC has brought unprecedented attention to the urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To meet that goal, global carbon emissions would have to fall by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, reaching zero around 2050. New Coalswarm and Greenpeace analysis has shown that OECD countries -- including Poland -- must lead the way by ending coal power by 2030. By contrast, any new coal-fired power plants are flatly incompatible with limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees. These would drive expanded extraction, when potential emissions from currently operating coal, oil and gas reserves takes the world beyond 2 C, and emissions even from currently operating oil and gas alone takes the world past 1.5 C.Shareholders, investors, financial analysts, and lawmakers increasingly recognize how financially tenuous and environmentally disastrous the Ostroleka C project--and Poland's coal industry--is. Carbon Tracker projects that the power plant, if built, would be ""permanently unprofitable,"" with a net loss of Euros1.7 billion over its lifetime. Furthermore, Ostroleka C is facing challenges in the courts. ClientEarth, a shareholder in Enea, has sued the company for approving the project, and one of Enea's trade unions has filed a parallel lawsuit.bOstroleka C is slated to be the last coal-fired power plant in Poland, and major international insurers have already stated that they will have nothing to do with the project. Chase has, to date, made no such commitment, and, on the contrary, appears to be committed to facilitating the construction of a climate-destructive coal plant in a tenuous financial situation.Copyright Targeted News ServicesTeamManager-6550923 TeamManager\l"

The meeting was convened by the new Nuclear Innovation: Clean Energy Future (NICE Future) initiative to address how innovative and advanced nuclear technologies could accelerate emissions reductions.The NICE Future initiative launched at last Mays Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) in Copenhagen, Denmark. The initiative envisions nuclear powers many uses in contributing to clean, reliable energy systems of the future. Nuclear energy is both a primary source of clean energy and an enabler of other clean energy sources. Globally, nuclear energy produces nearly one-third of the worlds emissions-free electricity.The U.S., Japan, and Canada spearheaded the NICE Future initiative. Since its start, six more countries have joined, and the initiative has engaged representatives from more than 80 organizations and individuals from more than 25 countries worldwide.As de-carbonization becomes a goal for so many, it is becoming clear that large scale power demands will require big, 24/7, clean and resilient energy sources to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply. Nuclear is that source, said Sarah Lennon, NE Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary, on behalf of the Canada, Japan, U.S. NICE Future Lead Team. Nuclear energy the clean energy workhorse, yet its often omitted from conversations about clean energy. We see a role for nuclear and renewables versus nuclear or renewables. Thats new thinking.I am pleased that during COP 24 there is also a place for discussion on nuclear energy and its role in the energy systems of the future, said Polands Minister of Energy, Krzysztof Tchrzewski, in keynote remarks. It is nuclear power that will be the main tool to reduce emissions. Poland has decided to follow this direction because nuclear power plants offer stable power generation with zero emission of air pollutants.""Speakers representing governments, research organizations, and NGOs worldwide discussed breakthrough innovative and integrated systems and applications. Of particular note are nuclear-renewable systems that enhance renewables integration into the grid and further enable both technologies. These technologies also enable combined uses of heat and power, hydrogen production, and industrial de-carbonization.OFFICE of NUCLEAR ENERGY1000 Independence Ave. SWWashington DC 20585202-586-5000\l"

Hurricanes. Four straight record-setting years of increasing temperatures. Ocean acidification. Sea-level rise. Species loss. Drought. All are made worse by climate change, fueling humanitarian crises as people are forced to flee their homes because of natural disaster or changes in their environment.""Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,"" warns the 1,656-page National Climate Assessment released Nov. 23 by the Trump administration.On Sunday, Dec. 2, representatives from United Nations member states, including government, nonprofit and faith-based organizations, will meet in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to hammer out a framework for implementing the Paris Agreement, which was reached in 2015 at the 21st conference.""Not only have all the nations of the world signed the Paris Agreement, I have seen the great religions of the world and the indigenous spiritual traditions also come together to seek the healing of the planet,"" said California Bishop Marc Andrus in an email to Episcopal News Service.""During Lambeth 2008 I listened with astonishment as bishops from India, West Africa, Australia, the United States and Sudan talked for just short of two hours about the environmental degradation and climate change effects that were already plaguing the dioceses they served,"" he said. ""Only in the last 10 minutes of the two hours allotted for conversation on two of the major issues that have been facing our church for decades did this group of bishops turn their attention to the second issue, so consumed were they by the present danger of climate change.""Andrus will lead an eight-member delegation representing Presiding Bishop Michael Curry at the Dec. 2-14 conference in Poland. This is the fourth Episcopal delegation to attend the annual conference on climate change. The Episcopal Church began attending the conference in 2015 in France, where the Paris Agreement was reached.In Paris, the Episcopal delegation made a spiritual case for climate action. At that conference, member countries, including the United States, reached a landmark agreement to set voluntary goals aimed at keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists predicted would be necessary to prevent a spiraling catastrophe of melting glaciers, rising sea levels and related weather extremes.Greenpeace stages a protest outside the UN Climate Change Conference 2016 (COP22) in Marrakech, Morocco, Nov. 18, 2016. Photo: ReutersIn Morocco in 2017, nations reaffirmed their commitment to cut carbon emissions. In Germany, in 2018, the process was thrown into doubt by President Donald Trump's pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement.The United States is the world's largest economy and its second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and make the planet warmer.It was in June 2017, as part of his ""American First"" strategy, that Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the international agreement, saying it undermines the economy and places the United States at a disadvantage.Since then, the We Are Still In movement has taken root, with more than 200 faith organizations signing on, including Episcopal churches.Still, the world is far from meeting the Paris Agreement's target, which would require reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels. In fact, emissions continue to rise.The conference in Poland is intended ""to finalize the rulebook for how the Paris Agreement will work. ... That's important because if you don't have rules, it falls apart at this level of bureaucracy,"" said Lynnaia Main, the Episcopal Church's representative to the United Nations.Scientists agree that climate change is a global threat. The World Meteorological Organization warns that, given current trends, warming could reach between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which informs U.N. policy, issued a similarly dire report.""I have quoted many times in the past decade something that was said by the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams: 'It takes a global body to deal with global problems.' An example of how this is true is the increasing crisis of environmental refugees,"" Andrus said.""Have you wondered what was the engine that drove the closely watched caravan out of Central America? According to an Oct. 30, 2018, Guardian article, in addition to violence, organized crime and systematic corruption, 'climate change in the region is exacerbating and sometimes causing a miasma of other problems, including crop failures and poverty.' The caravan comes mainly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, it crosses Mexico and seeks asylum in the United States. ... The struggle of the people in the caravan is transnational, and I would say cannot be 'solved' by any one country. We must work together for the good of all,"" Andrus said.Environmental justice is one of the church's three main priorities, along with racial reconciliation and evangelism. Over the years, General Convention has passed numerous resolutions on the issue, whether supporting federal climate action or pledging to mitigate the church's own impact on the environment.The church's 79th General Convention met in July in Austin, Texas, and passed 19 environmental resolutions, including support for a national carbon tax, carbon offsets for church-related travel, ocean health and Episcopalians' continued participation in the Paris Agreement.In 2016, the Episcopal Church was granted U.N. observer status, which allows members of the delegation to brief U.N. representatives on the Episcopal Church's General Convention climate resolutions and to attend meetings in the official zone.""The continuity fostered by our COP delegations' attendance at the annual U.N. Climate Change Conferences has a multiplier effect for our broader Episcopal and Anglican influence at the United Nations,"" said Main in a press release. ""Our actions in Katowice will strengthen a broader base of U.N. ministry that includes eradicating poverty through the Sustainable Development Goals, supporting migrants and refugees, defending indigenous peoples, mainstreaming gender and protecting rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.""Lynette Wilson is a reporter and managing editor of Episcopal News Service.\l"

In the USA there are more jobs in the solar industry alone than in generating electricity through coal, oil and gas combined. The solar industry is also creating jobs 17 times faster than the rest of the economy. Around the world there are now more than 10 million people employed in renewables with this figure rising.""Research from the London School of Economics this year showed that the amount of retraining needed to make people ready for the transition to green jobs is much lower than many realise. Their analysis showed that in the USA, 44% of workers already have the transferable skills needed to contribute to the green economy.""There has also been recent progress made in countries like Spain that have recently announced a 250m euro package to help coal miners as part of plans to phase out Spanish coal mines.Mr Adow said the developing world also had much to gain from the transition away from a carbon-based economy.""As well as tackling climate change the benefits for developing countries to leapfrog the fossil energy systems of the past to modern, clean alternatives, are clear. Trudging along the dirty development path trod by richer countries will see developing nations stuck in the past and pollute their environments while ruining efforts to limit global warming.""In order to jump straight to renewables developing countries will need finance and support from richer countries but the benefits will be felt by everyone.""Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6536239 MSTRUCK\l"

In 2017, carbon dioxide levels were the highest they have been in 3-5 million years. According to NASA, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880. And this is not a one-off: eighteen of the 19 warmest years on record have happened since 2000. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth in 2017 and sea levels are rising at the fastest recorded rate in 2,000 years. According to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the window to limit global warming to a below 2 pathway is fast closing. Moreover, not only are the consequences of a two-degree world far greater than that of a 1.5 world, but we are not on track for either.In 2017 alone disasters triggered by weather - and climate-related hazards cost the global economy US$320 billion in losses. In future these economic losses will increase and will have a bigger impact on the lives and livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable. By 2030, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030, unravelling development gains to date.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA188","WHAT THE COP24 NEEDS: A NEW EMERGING MINDSET","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","An alternative framework of international development and new forms of consumption of good/services are implicit in achieving the goals of UN climate conference recently held in Poland.With 4.3 billion persons living on $5 or less per day, we cannot expect these persons or their countries to initially participate in the cost of climate change improvement without more favorable development. The reduction of hunger and poverty are inherent in the fight for a better climate because the poor are exactly the most exposed and least protected to adverse climate change. Rather than favor the developing world, the advanced nations have encumbered them with debt and exportation of profits; the net financial flows for the developing world are negative by 26.5 trillion dollars between 1980 and 2012 (Hickel, 2017). A more radical and effective development framework is emerging as proposed by the same author in his book the Divide. Certainly it will be an uphill battle as it involves elimination of debt burdens of developing countries, more global democracy in international financial institutions, more just wages, tax justice and land security.Obviously the current Western model of production and consumption is highly individualistic, targeting through advertising our desires, by following the trails of our digital lives through almost all of our Internet apps on cell phones and other digital devices. Even our political orientation can be influenced in this way. The consumption is short-term ""sugar-high"" satisfaction, to be repeated by purchase of another product shortly thereafter. This is extremely costly to the environment, overloading us with the production, consumption and transportation of products that serve secondary needs. The capitalization of companies selling consumer discretionary goods/services is 60 per cent of the capitalization of companies in the entire consumer sector of the S&P500 companies this year (Bespoke, 2018).And this is in sharp contrast to what really makes us happy: strong social relationships. The famous Harvard Study of Adult Development has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier. Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives. Importantly, international studies on happiness indicate that happy countries have high social capital and strong friendship networks. A cross-national study of 143 countries revealed that high levels of social trust and having someone to count on in case of need are associated with more positive feelings, better life evaluations, and the absence of negative feelings in most countries of the world. Also persons who participate in volunteering activities and with a high level of social trust are more likely than their peers to have better life evaluations and more positive feelings (Calvo et al. 2012).A new model of consumption is emerging based on social experience and sharing. The experience of culture in a social setting in the form of a concert or intelligent tourism staying with local natives and guides are examples. In the future, services that enhance our sociality will grow. We also have come to realize that we can share under-utilized capacity of our basic properties such as homes and automobiles; and the sharing economy has been born. In the past everyone enjoyed owning a car or a record, instead now use is more important that ownership. This greatly reduces the number of goods that must be produced. Sociality and sharing have a much lighter ecological footprint than the continuation of individualistic consumption of goods. The long-term gains of the sharing economy in terms of better utilization of capacity have been estimated at 570 billion euro for the EU28, according to the European Parliamentary Research Service (Goudin, 2016).Developing nations should be aware of these alternatives; otherwise they will develop slowly and fall into the trap of consumerism that business is so anxious to sell, which may lock them into energy infrastructures and greenhouse gas production that they could have, at least in part, avoided. We are reminded that according the latest data 670,000 MW of coal power plant capacity is currently in planning or already under construction in 59 countries (Urgewald, 2018). We are individuals and will always require some satisfaction of individual needs beyond the basic requirements of food, shelter, health and education; but at our best we are social, and should recognize that we have let individualism go too far in consumption and international relations.References Bespoke (2018) HYPERLINK https://www.bespokepremium.com/think-big-blog/new-sp-500-sector-weightings-what-you-need-to-know/https://www.bespokepremium.com/think-big-blog/new-sp-500-sector-weightings-what-you-need-to-know/Calvo R., Zheng Y., Kumar S., Olgiati, A., Berkman L., (2012), Well-Being and Social Capital on Planet Earth: Cross-National Evidence from 142 Countries, HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0042793https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0042793Goudin, P., European Parliamentary Research Service, European Added Value Unit PE 558.777- January 2016Hickel, J.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA195","COP 24: Africans Promote Oil and Coal at Katowice Climate Summit","December 18, 2018 Tuesday 6:45 PM EST","The Heartlander","Dec 18, 2018( The Heartlander: https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/newshttps://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news Delivered by Newstex) Hecklers protested[1] the U.S. event on fossil fuels but nobody bothered the Africans when they promoted the role of oil and gas in national development. The event was led by the African Development Bank (AfDB), which earlier this year broke with the ever-green World Bank and announced that it will now fund coal-fired power projects. As AfDB put it, 'we have to use what we have' and this is true of oil and gas as well as coal. A number of African countries are rich in fossil fuel resources and they intend to develop these, in order to develop their economies and provide for their people. Mind you the Africans are also aggressively active in the Paris Agreement negotiations, which they also see as a potential source of funding for development. They are pushing hard on the finance front. But as with many developing countries, Paris lip service does not interfere with their use of coal, oil and gas. In fact since the World Bank pulled out, China has become the world leader in financing and building coal-fired electric power plants. Now the African Development Bank is also in the coal, oil and gas game. This is great news for a lot of poor people. Here is the official report of the event. Of course it is couched in terms of Paris Agreement nonsense, but the meaning is clear. We have oil and gas and we intend to use it. Managing Carbon Risks and Raising Climate Ambition New Policy Approaches for Countries with Fossil Fuels Presented by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Chatham House The side event aimed to draw attention to carbon risks across a range of policy areas, including energy, industrial, and long-term development planning. Presenters highlighted areas in policy and practice where development assistance can help countries overcome barriers to transitioning and building carbon resilience into long-term planning. Glada Lahn, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, moderated the event, and noted that the elephant in the room at COP 24 is the role of oil and gas in development in the context of the Paris Agreement. She highlighted global discussions around raising economies out of poverty via oil and gas extraction in order to spur growth and development, and stressed the risks posed by the fossil fuel market in transitioning to a low carbon economy. Sin Bradley, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, noted that there is a high expectation from countries on the role of oil and gas in their economies, highlighting a current reassessment of their value in the global economy. She underscored that the linkages between the oil and gas sector and the wider economy may deliver a shared value under Business-as-Usual, whereas they would deliver a shared risk towards the economy under a 1.5-degree goal scenario. She stressed the need to have a joint approach to carbon risks, adding that there is no point in pursuing climate solutions that undermine governance and socioeconomic stability. Chebet Maikut, Ministry of Water and Environment, Uganda, noted that Uganda has prioritized oil and gas as key sectors to spark socioeconomic development in the country. He stressed that his country needs to learn lessons from producer countries and highlighted his countrys commitment to reduce emissions from oil and gas by 22% by 2030. Rose Mwebaza, African Natural Resources Center of the AfDB, highlighted Nigeria as a good case study for including oil and gas emissions reduction measures in their Nationally Determined Contribution. She noted, however, that the NDC showed what to achieve but not how to achieve it, drawing attention to the lack of a carbon strategy to implement these reductions. She urged for the exchange of knowledge with producer countries on how to extract the resources in the least disruptive manner. In the ensuing discussion, panelists and participants discussed issues regarding: conflicts between biodiversity conservation and resource extraction, noting that Uganda's petroleum reserves overlapping with 80% of the country's protected areas; the implications of transitioning to low carbon development, considering the heavy dependence of transport systems on fossil fuels; whether subsidies for oil and gas compete with renewable energy; and the role of the insurance industry.

Sheldon Whitehouse: HYPERLINK http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov Because the government of the United States of America has fallen under the political control of the industry most responsible for this mess. American leadership was essential to forging the global consensus on carbon emissions in the original Paris Agreement. I know because I was there in Paris in 2015 as Secretary Kerry and the U.S. negotiating team worked to seal the landmark pact. What a pathetic difference a few years make. In 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would become the only country in the world to turn its back on this agreement. The U.S. abdicates its leadership just as the scientific warnings of the dangers of climate change grow clearer, and grimmer. In October came a new report from the world's scientists working through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Last month, the federal government released its own sobering news about the worsening risks climate change poses to our nation and our economy. Our National Climate Assessment warned of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses due to climate change --if we don't act to curtail carbon emissions. Trump's responded first by describing his own 'very high levels of intelligence,' but then simply denied all the science because, he said, 'I don't see it.' Well, guess what? Pope Paul V didn't 'see it' when Galileo demonstrated that the earth revolved around the sun. That didn't change the astrophysics. The climate science, laid out in black and white by Trump's own government, is that our planet is heating up due to our use of fossil fuels. The science is even more incontrovertible than when Donald Trump said it was 'incontrovertible' in 2009. Saying he now doesn't see it, is the very definition of denial. 'Willful blindness' would be another term. The takeover of our government by fossil-fuel forces is having very real consequences in U.S. emissions numbers. After years of decl"

""If we don't focus on low carbon development, we cannot continue this growth,"" Bambang Brodjonegoro, Indonesia's Minister of National Development Planning, said yesterday Dec. 10.He spoke about Indonesia's shift to a low carbon, climate-friendly development pathway at a high-level panel discussion at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (), which is currently being held in Katowice, Poland. The panel discussion was organised by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in partnership with the Ministry of National Development Planning of the Republic of Indonesia (BAPPENAS).The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns of catastrophic climatic impacts if global warming is not kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius. This will include severe impact on food production and increasing risks of climate-related disasters.But according to Brodjonegoro, the Indonesian government is taking this issue seriously. ""We are fully committed to steer our economy for low carbon development. We will mainstream a low carbon framework in our medium-term development plan,"" he said, adding that low carbon development in Indonesia would involve improving environmental quality, attaining energy efficiency, increasing agriculture productivity, improving reforestation and reducing deforestation simultaneously.There is a large scope for RE development in Indonesia, as most of its potential is unrealised as of now. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) report\'c2\~on Indonesia's RE prospects, the country has ""an estimated 716 GW of theoretical potential for renewable energy-based power generation"". But of its bioenergy potential of 32.7 GW, it has developed a mere 1.8 GW.""In order to provide the electricity for remote areas, this is a good time to promote renewable energy as this will increase the percentage of renewable energy in our energy mix,"" Brodjonegoro said. According to the minister, a key issue for scaling up RE in Indonesia lies with developing the capacity of stakeholders to meet the needs of different types of investors to access finance.Dr. Frank Rijsberman, Director General of GGGI, echoed these thoughts, stating that the critical factor for proliferating renewables in Indonesia is whether it can attract private sector investment. ""Both governments and the private sector have not fully incorporated the idea that green growth is not only nice but it is also affordable,"" he said. ""Businesses should be investing in renewable energy because there is a business opportunity."" In this regard, he said that blended finance could be a critical path where every dollar investment from donors could catalyse other investments from private sources.State Secretary for Climate and Environment in Norway Sveinung Rotevatn, was a panelist at the event. He stated that Norway is encouraged by the low carbon development in Indonesia, and is committing substantial funds to reduce deforestation there. According to Global Forest Watch, Indonesia experienced a drop in tree cover loss in 2017, including a 60 percent decl"

Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland:""The message from Katowice is that governments are committed to making the Paris Agreement work. Between the usual conflicts and new geopolitical strains, these talks could have foundered over any number of issues. The rulebook didn't come easily, and it's not perfect, but it gets the Paris Agreement off the ground.""Many hoped for stronger signals from countries about ramping up their ambition in 2020. Clearly, building the necessary political will remains our core challenge. But a functioning agreement will do more to raise ambition over the long haul than any momentary political signals. And Katowice was our best shot at getting the rules right.""Most important, the new transparency rules will make it easier to hold all countries accountable for their promises. This takes us well beyond the bifurcated system we've had until now. If the transparency system shows that everyone is in fact making a sincere effort to do their part, we'll all be in a better position to do more.""Unfortunately, parties couldn't agree on detailed rules for using market-based trading to meet country targets - which is critical for mobilizing private sector investment. It's urgent that this last remaining piece of the rulebook be completed next year.""It was clear from the start that Paris alone couldn't possibly get the job done. The real work is at home, where we have to do a much better job demonstrating not just the risks, but also the opportunities presented by climate change. We need an inclusive approach - one that taps all available technologies and deals justly with those who stand to lose the most. The challenges and choices vary from country to country.

The worlds best scientists, and nature itself, are sounding the alarm. Changes are happening sooner and faster than we expected. At the same time, the private sector and regional governments are waking up to their responsibility to lead on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. They are creating momentum and unveiling a new formula for success in ramping up global ambition.As the recent Emissions Gap report states, countries must sharply raise the ambition of their national climate targets by 2020 or the 1.5C goal under the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach. Increasing ambition at this scale is only possible if the private sector, regional and national governments work collaboratively to develop a new set of national climate targets before 2020, said Leonard.Countries left ambition on the table when they set their first climate pledges in 2015. Current national climate targets largely ignored or understated the contributions of those driving regional economies, like companies and local governments, said Leonard. That can change for the revised targets because these players are now fully bought into the process. Moreover, a growing wave of businesses and cities have made new, science-based commitments since 2015, including at the Global Climate Action Summit in September of this year.WWF is bringing leaders from new climate coalitions in Japan, Mexico, Argentina and the United States to the talks to bridge new alliances, push for stronger pre-2020 action, and to meet with national governments to advocate for strong rules to operationalize the Paris agreement. Private sector representatives in the We Are Still In coalition cite a strong transparency regime, clear and consistent approaches for setting national climate targets, and clarity around market mechanisms as key elements up for debate at these talks which are critical to their business operations.US efforts to reduce emissions will be on display in the US Climate Action Center -- located in Pavilion E and livestreamed -- December 7-10. The Center will host mayors, businesses, Congressional staff, and other climate leaders from the We Are Still In coalition and convene discussion on topics including the implications of the US midterm elections, the benefits a strong Paris regime for the private sector, and the role of natural climate solutions.WWF believes a clear set of outcomes are needed in Poland to ensure the continued momentum for climate action, called the Katowice Package. These include:Urgently scaled up climate action both before and after 2020 accompanied by financial and other support for developing countries;Finalize and adopt a comprehensive set of rules (Paris Rulebook) to guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement. These must enhance the transparency of all countries actions to address climate change, lead to greater accountability and ambition of countries individual climate plans, and clarify the roles of market mechanisms;A renewed recognition of the gap between current action and the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, and a recognition of actions that can close the gap, including better integration of nature-based climate solutions; and finally,A commitment from Parties to update and resubmit improved national climate plans (or nationally determined contributions or NDCs) by 2020.Positive momentum heading into the talks was boosted by Germanys pledge of 1.5 billion towards replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, which should help reassure especially the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries that international financial support is available for their climate actions.\l"

And yet, for two weeks in December, more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 nations converged in the Silesian capital of Katowice, Poland, to attend the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24). The conference, held from Dec. 3-14, 2018, was the latest in a series of meetings led by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to tackle the global issue of climate change. More than twenty students and researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego attended the climate talks, where they gained a nuanced understanding of the intricacies and challenges of climate policy. The team was part of UC Revelle, the observer organization representing the University of California.  It was so interesting to see how this kind of global policy is created, said Kat Montgomery, a Master of Advanced Studies student in the Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. A first-time attendee of the UN talks, Montgomery described her experience in Poland as  illuminating and said she gained a better understanding of the role of non-governmental and research organizations in the UNFCCC process.  I think the UC\' s biggest accomplishment at COP24 was being able to give so many current and future scientists a chance to attend a conference like this, where they could learn about and potentially influence global policy, said Montgomery. UC San Diego delegates at COP24 Climate Conference in Poland University of California delegates served as panelists for a discussion at the UN's Sustainable Development Goals Pavilion on the topic of investing in education for the future of sustainable energy. Scripps alumna Megan Bettilyon with Global Good (far left) moderated the discussion with participants (pictured left to right) including Scripps Ph.D. students Osinachi Ajoku and Tashiana Osborne, Yale student Holden Leslie-Bole, and Scripps postdoctoral scholar and alumnus Yassir Eddebbar. In Katowice, she and other UC delegates observed some of the complex negotiations in which nations hammered out the details of a common rulebook to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. The rulebook defines how nations will enact their climate pledges to keep global temperatures well below an increase of 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. It also provides a universal framework for measuring and reporting emissions with greater transparency and supports climate financing to poorer nations, among other things.  The negotiations were difficult, as many countries were trying to pull in different directions. However, the world came to a midpoint to implement the Paris Agreement, said Alfredo Giron, a Scripps Ph.D. student whose research focuses on fishery sustainability in the Gulf of California.  Being part of the Scripps delegation allowed me to follow up this process very closely and get involved with delegates from different countries and other observer organizations to dig into the details. In the UFO-shaped Spodek arena, the UC delegates hosted an exhibit that highlighted the ocean\' s reach on global climate. The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions.

Heartland's event, featuring two scientists and two experts on climate and energy policy in the United States and Europe, will be held at the Vienna House East Katowice from 2 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time.This event will also feature the public debut of a new 1,000-page report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) titled Climate Change Reconsidered: Fossil Fuels. It is the latest in what is now a five-volume, 4,000-plus page series stretching back to 2009 critiquing the work of the UN's IPCC.The Heartland Institute is attending COP-24 in Katowice with NGO-Observer credentials during the first week, reporting from the conference site on Monday, Tuesday morning (before Heartland's science and policy event), and Wednesday. The following statement from James Taylor, senior fellow for environment and energy policy at The Heartland Institute, may be used for attribution.""Each year the verdict becomes stronger and clearer that the scientific evidence debunks global warming alarmism. While the United Nations' Conference of the Parties frantically searches for reasons to justify its continued existence, The Heartland Institute is proud to present the science that debunks U.N. alarmism.""We will also be presenting examples of real-world evidence contradicting important U.N. climate claims. We will be delivering the truth that the only thing 'settled' about the global warming debate is that U.N. climate reports have little credibility. Skeptics present a far better scientific case.""The December 4 event at the Vienna House Katowice - just one kilometer away from the COP-24 site - will include the first public presentation of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels. That will be followed by 30-minute presentations by Dr. Idso, Dr. Ludecke, Mr. Avery, and Mr. Taylor, as well as a group discussion about the latest climate data and the goings-on at COP-24.

And sincere thanks to all of you, ministers and high-level representatives, for having accepted our invitation.The EU, Canada and China have joined forces to encourage global leadership and ambition in the fight against climate change by building momentum for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Following the successful first MOCA in Montreal last year, we have convened this opportunity for ministerial guidance on the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme and on the other key political events at COP 24.The MOCA brings together Ministers and high-level representatives from the world's largest economies and other countries from the different regional groups. In this more intimate and informal setting we hope to support but not to replace or prejudge-- the formal negotiations. As we have just heard in Berlin, achieving results at COP 24 will require us all to pick up the pace of negotiations, and to be well-prepared to send strong messages of political leadership. The agenda we have prepared reflects a subset of the key challenges that still need to be resolved.The Petersberg Climate Dialogue hosted by Germany and Poland earlier this week provided for excellent high level exchanges. We see the next two days as an opportunity for deeper and more detailed peer-to-peer conversations on the political differences that we will need to resolve if we are to ensure a successful conclusion to COP 24.COP 24 and its main deliverables, and tomorrow we will address key matters of the Paris Agreement Work Programme as it relates to action and as it relates to support. With six months between now and the closing plenary in Katowice, we must seize the opportunity of this MOCA to discuss -- openly and sincerely -- our individual asks and limitations.At COP24COP 24 should be robust enough to deliver confidence that we are on track to implementing Paris, flexible enough to reflect relevant differences in Parties' capacities, and dynamic enough to ensure that all Parties are improving their performance over time.In addition, through the Talanoa Dialogue, the High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, and the stocktake on pre-2020 action, Parties should be prepared to share our achievements and the lessons we have learned so far, and on how we can advance action and raise ambition from now into the future.These processes will set the scene for the next round of NDCs and Long term strategies.I look forward, in the plenary discussion to come, to sharing with you the details of how the EU is preparing for Katowice. This will include an update on the agreement of EU climate policies necessary for us to achieve our NDC, preparations for a new long term strategy to put us on track towards the Paris goals, and an EU Talanoa Dialogue, launched last week with the involvement of 600 stakeholders from across the EU and around the world.Last Thursday, EU negotiators agreed to increase the 2030 renewable energy target to 32% up from the original 27% target on the basis of which our at least 40% emissions reduction target in our NDC was modelled. And yesterday evening, EU negotiators agreed on a new 32,5% energy efficiency target by 2030 up from the 30% original target. EU negotiators also agreed the governance rules to meet our climate and energy targets. Both new targets would de facto mean that the European Union would be in a position to raise the level of ambition of the NDC and increase its emissions reduction target from the current 40% to slightly over 45% by 2030.Each of these recent developments in the EU shows that in addition to raising headl"

(...) Only a transition that challenges systems of exclusion and discrimination, and seeks to improve prosperity and well-being for all, can be considered a truly Just Transition."" This was one of the main messages presented by UNRISD on behalf of the Just Transition Research Collaborative to participants at the UN Climate Conference, COP24, currently under way in Katowice, Poland.This message is contained in Mapping Just Transition(s) to a Low-Carbon World, the state-of-the-art report on ways to achieve a socially equitable transition away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon development. The report was written by the Just Transition Research Collaborative, which brings together experts from academia and civil society to collectively map and analyse the different understandings and narratives of ""Just Transition"" underpinning the concept's growing popularity and uptake. Challenging the narrow interpretation of Just Transition that seeks to protect a relatively small number of affected workers, the report calls for profound change and an intersectional approach to climate justice.The Collaborative is run jointly by UNRISD and the University of London Institute in Paris, and supported by the Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung.The UNRISD lead of the Just Transition Research Collaborative, Dunja Krause, travelled (by train and bus) to Poland to launch the report at three different events during COP24, in order to maximize potential uptake. Launching the report at COP24--in the presence of governments, United Nations organizations, civil society and the private sector--is an important way of contributing to the science-policy dialogue on Just Transition and supporting policy makers to make better decisions on how to combine the environmental goal of shifting to low-carbon development with social considerations of equity and justice. The research shows that although challenging and complex, Just Transitions are possible through direct engagement with workers, and through government investment in infrastructure and social welfare programmes, among many other initiatives discussed.The findings struck a chord with many present at COP24, and resonate with the growing recognition of the need not only to respond to climate change but to respond equitably. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told world leaders at the conference, ""Climate action is not just the right thing to do--it makes social and economic sense.""Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6541218 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA217","Heartland Science Panel Brings Realism to UN Climate Conference","December 27, 2018 Thursday 7:50 AM EST","The Heartlander","Dec 27, 2018( The Heartlander: HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news Delivered by Newstex) ;; The Heartland Institute hosted an event in Katowice, Poland to advance the latest research on climate science and the high costs of government efforts to fight purported anthropogenic climate change. Heartland's event was held on December 4, 2018 during the two-week 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24), which ran from December 2 through December 14. No Science at UN Meeting COP 24 hosted no discussions of climate science. The UN delegates focused on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below the levels countries committed to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, in response to a September 2018 report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) saying carbon dioxide emissions must be net zero by 2050 to avoid global average temperatures rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius. Negotiators also discussed how to provide funding to help developing countries adapt to future climate changes. Heartland Provides Science, Economics The Heartland Institute's three-hour event, which was livestreamed and has been viewed by more than 7,000 people, presented scientific evidence indicating humans are not creating a climate crisis. Panelists also discussed the harm caused in Europe by energy policies and subsidies intended to fight purported climate change. Craig Idso, Ph.D., chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, began the session by unveiling the newest report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels (see story on page 11), of which he is a lead coauthor. The new volume, which is approximately 700 pages long, features contributions of more than 100 scientists and includes more than 2,000 citations of data from peer-reviewed scientific literature. The report says fossil fuels have brought tremendous net benefits to the United States and the world and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. IPCC 'A Political Body' The IPCC is a political body, not a scientific one, and promotes climate alarmism, says Idso. 'Climate alarmism is championed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a political body of the United Nations,' Idso said during his presentation in Poland. 'Given what is compiled in [the NIPCC] reports and the thousands of peer-reviewed articles cited therein, I can tell you with complete confidence there is absolutely no observational evidence that provides any compelling support for the contention there is something unusual, unnatural, or unprecedented about earth's current warmth.' Dennis Avery, who formerly served in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of State and is a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment ...imate News, gave a presentation documenting how warmer climate periods have historically nurtured greater global crop production and benefits for human health and welfare. Climate change has only been a negative factor regarding human health and welfare in periods of cooling, Avery said. The current modest warming, like every warming period since the dawn of human civilization, will almost certainly add to the crop gains and other benefits people have enjoyed during the past century's modest warming, Avery said. Sun, Wind, Money Horst Ludecke, Ph.D., an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Applied Sciences of the Saarland, documented how solar variability has driven temperature and climate change throughout history. Ludecke cited research strongly indicating solar activity remains the primary driver of climate change today as in the past, with human emissions of carbon dioxide playing at best only a minor role in the ongoing natural recovery from the Little Ice Age. Wolfgang Mueller, general secretary of the European Institute for Climate and Energy, discussed the impact Germany's substantial monetary and legislative support for wind power has had on electricity prices. As a result of the German government's energy policies, Germans currently pay more than triple the price of electricity in the United States, Mueller said. James Taylor, a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, wrapped up with a presentation arguing the UN's climate agenda is more about taking money and power away from individuals and sovereign nations than reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 'The UN climate agenda would strip Americans of tens of billions of dollars each year and much of our individual freedom,' Taylor said. Solidarity Joins Climate Fight After the symposium, leaders of the Polish Solidarity labor union's Silesian Region invited representatives of The Heartland Institute and the European Institute for Climate and Energy to meet with union executives in Katowice and present the scientific case for climate realism. The meeting took place at Solidarity's Katowice offices on December 5, 2018. After the scientific presentation, Solidarity invited The Heartland Institute to collaborate with the history-making Polish labor union in developing and signing a joint statement expressing skepticism toward the UN's climate narrative and its energy policy goals. 'We, speaking as one, believe in the restoration of the Scientific Method and the dismissal of ideological dogma at the United Nations. That means a healthy skepticism of data interpretation and policy conclusions and an end to the war on science and scientists by powerful state-backed forces,' the joint statement reads.

Attenborough, famous for his decades of documenting the world and its wildlife, was addressing delegates of almost 200 countries attending the COP24 UN climate change summit in Poland, designed to negotiate how to turn the 2015 Paris climate deal into reality. 'Right now we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,' Attenborough said. 'If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.' See related YouTuber cements head in microwave[2] YouTuber makes a hoverbike in his shed[3] YouTube gets a new look[4] Attenborough had been chosen to 'represent the public, by taking the 'People's Seat' at the conference', CNN[5]reports,after the UN had asked people around the globe to send in their thoughts about climate change. 'Leaders of the world you must lead,' he continued. 'The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world on which we depend is in your hands.' Attenborough also used the opportunity to plead with the United States to remain committed to fighting climate change, despite Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate deal. 'Please join the rest of the world,' he said. 'The entire rest of the world is united in trying to take action on this. The United States is a very, very powerful voice. Please, please, join us.' The Guardian[6] says that the two-week COP24 summit is the 'most important since Paris', and that the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for the summit to deliver 'firm funding agreements' to combat climate change.

We`ve already seen similar demonstrations in Europe and Australia. Tomorrow`s protests are planned in more than one hundred and thirty U.S. cities and about ninety countries worldwide. Tony Dokoupil talked with organizers about the goal of the walkout. And he joins us at the table to discuss. Good morning, Mister Dokoupil.TONY DOKOUPIL (CBS News Correspondent): Good morning. We`ve seen student walk outs for gun control, now it seems climate change is getting the same treatment. And this is expected to be a major protest, but it began with just a few teenagers on social media. They were reading about the worst- case scenarios of climate change and they came to a pretty logical conclusion--why keep going to school to prepare for a future that might not even exist.(Begin VT)(Man singing)TONY DOKOUPIL: Every Friday, as most kids hurry off to school, Alexandria Villasenor heads to the United Nations.ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR (Youth Climate Strike US Co-Founder): Since climate change will be a global problem, I decided that this would be the best place to strike.TONY DOKOUPIL: The seventh grader plays hooky in hopes of pushing adults into action against global warming.What did your mom say when you propose the idea of not going to school on Fridays?TONY DOKOUPIL: No double take at all?ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: Well, they did start laugh-crying, but I took that as a good sign.TONY DOKOUPIL: She`s been doing it for more than three months, but it won`t be a one-girl show come tomorrow.ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: All fifty states are going to be striking that day.He supported all the strikers, so.TONY DOKOUPIL: Villasenor is co-founder of Youth Climate Strike U.S., along with twelve-year-old Haven Coleman and sixteen-year-old Isra Hirsi. They`re calling for, among other things, one hundred percent renewable energy by 2030. And the three young women were inspired by a fourth.GRETA THUNBERG (Stockholm, Sweden, August, 2018; Student Activist): We`re not doing anything to fight the climate crisis.TONY DOKOUPIL: Greta Thunberg (sic) started her own Fridays for the Future strike last August outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm.GRETA THUNBERG (Katowice, Poland, December 2018): Change is coming whether you like it or not.TONY DOKOUPIL: Since then she`s taken her message directly to the United Nations known as COP24.GRETA THUNBERG: You are not mature enough to tell it like it is, even that burden you leave to us children.ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: I was amazed because she put the world leaders in their place. She really pointed out that they are acting like children.HAVEN COLEMAN (Youth Climate Strike US Co-Founder): I`ll link you into the all e-mails, okay?TONY DOKOUPIL: Haven Coleman is organizing students from her home in Colorado.HAVEN COLEMAN: It doesn`t matter if we get thousands. It doesn`t matter if we get hundreds. We are still influencing, we`re still powerful because a voice is a voice and every voice has power.TONY DOKOUPIL: A lesson you don`t always learn in a book in a fight that certainly won`t be over tomorrow.If you could teach everybody one thing about what you`ve learned about climate change, what would it be?ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: That a lot of world leaders and politicians have to start making decisions based on facts. They need to start listening to scientists, and they need to stop being bought off. TONY DOKOUPIL: And if they don`t?ALEXANDRIA VILLASENOR: If they don`t, then you can say goodbye to your life and your future. We will continue striking until the necessary actions are taken. We will not be stopping.(End VT) TONY DOKOUPIL: And while you can argue with the tactics, scientists have provided a pretty good sick note for the planet in the form of the latest international report on climate change. Yeah, no more studying history. They`re going to try to make it.JOHN DICKERSON: Right.GAYLE KING: Do we point out that most of those leaders in that package were young girls.TONY DOKOUPIL: In fact, not only here in the U.S. but around the globe most of the leaders in this movement are women. Young women.GAYLE KING: Yeah. I like that. I like her thing about laugh-crying.BIANNA GOLODRYGA: Yeah.JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.GAYLE KING: And-- and on a note that has nothing to do with the story, you know Tony Dokoupil is a good guy. Anybody who comes to work wearing his wife`s socks that are teal--TONY DOKOUPIL: They`re colorful. I picked them out in the dark. I don`t want to wake her. They`re on my feet now.BIANNA GOLODRYGA: That`s a real man.GAYLE KING: This is what you learn--TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.BIANNA GOLODRYGA: Yeah.GAYLE KING: --we can go into the Greenroom, what`s-- you`ve got on your feet there, Tony?

But African experts who met in Nairobi, Kenya at last week's Seventh Conference on Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA VII) say the rise of far-right wing and nationalist movements in the West are threatening the collapse of the agreement. The landmark Paris Agreement focuses on accelerating and intensifying actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, through greenhouse-gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology transfer among others.And as Parties struggle to complete the implementing measures needed to get the Paris regime up and running, African experts have identified the need to speak with one unified voice, saying a shift in the geopolitical landscape threatens climate negotiations.""The rise of 'the inward-looking nationalist right-wing movement and climate deniers' in the West is a signal of hardening positions in potential inaction by those largely responsible for the world's climate problems,"" Mithika Mwenda, secretary general of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance, told the gathering.Mwenda said civil society organisations were seeking collaboration with governments on the continent and stood ready to offer support as Africa seeks homegrown solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change.The 24th Conference of the Parties\'c2\~(COP 24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\'c2\~(UNFCCC) to be held in Katowice, Poland in December, is earmarked as the deadl"

The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report.  If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating, wrote Senator Carper.  This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. The Honorable Andrew Wheeler Acting Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20460 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying,  [m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis. [1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world\' s leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts \- some of which are EPA employees \- as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated  I don\' t believe it when asked about the report, adding that  we\' re at the cleanest we\' ve ever been. [2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that  We think that this is the most extreme version and it\' s not based on facts. She also said that  [I]t\' s not data-driven and that it  contradicts long established trends. [3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that  The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration  and  [G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment and  I don\' t know this for a fact  I wouldn\' t be surprised if the Obama administration told the report\' s authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report. [4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the \' worst-case\' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that,  analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity and  analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years. [8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. So that I can understand the basis for EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019: Copies of all briefing materials prepared for you or other Trump Administration EPA political officials related to the preparation and release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including but not limited to the May 2, 2018 briefing for the Office of Air and Radiation whose invited participants included Bill Wehrum and David Harlow, the May 14, 2018 briefing for the Office of Water whose invited participants included Lee Forsgren and Owen McDonough, and the May 29, 2018 briefing for the Office of Research and Development whose invited participants included Richard Yamada.

The event was led by the African Development Bank (AfDB), which earlier this year broke with the ever-green World Bank and announced that it will now fund coal-fired power projects. As AfDB put it, ""we have to use what we have"" and this is true of oil and gas as well as coal. A number of African countries are rich in fossil fuel resources and they intend to develop these, in order to develop their economies and provide for their people. Mind you the Africans are also aggressively active in the Paris Agreement negotiations, which they also see as a potential source of funding for development. They are pushing hard on the finance front. But as with many developing countries, Paris lip service does not interfere with their use of coal, oil and gas. In fact since the World Bank pulled out, China has become the world leader in financing and building coal-fired electric power plants. Now the African Development Bank is also in the coal, oil and gas game. This is great news for a lot of poor people. Here is the official report of the event. Of course it is couched in terms of Paris Agreement nonsense, but the meaning is clear. We have oil and gas and we intend to use it. Managing Carbon Risks and Raising Climate Ambition New Policy Approaches for Countries with Fossil Fuels Presented by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Chatham House The side event aimed to draw attention to carbon risks across a range of policy areas, including energy, industrial, and long-term development planning. Presenters highlighted areas in policy and practice where development assistance can help countries overcome barriers to transitioning and building carbon resilience into long-term planning. Glada Lahn, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, moderated the event, and noted that the elephant in the room at COP 24 is the role of oil and gas in development in the context of the Paris Agreement. She highlighted global discussions around raising economies out of poverty via oil and gas extraction in order to spur growth and development, and stressed the risks posed by the fossil fuel market in transitioning to a low carbon economy. Si-n Bradley, Energy, Environment, and Resources Department, Chatham House, noted that there is a high expectation from countries on the role of oil and gas in their economies, highlighting a current reassessment of their value in the global economy. She underscored that the linkages between the oil and gas sector and the wider economy may deliver a shared value under Business-as-Usual, whereas they would deliver a shared risk towards the economy under a 1.5-degree goal scenario. She stressed the need to have a joint approach to carbon risks, adding that there is no point in pursuing climate solutions that undermine governance and socioeconomic stability. Chebet Maikut, Ministry of Water and Environment, Uganda, noted that Uganda has prioritized oil and gas as key sectors to spark socioeconomic development in the country. He stressed that his country needs to learn lessons from producer countries and highlighted his countrys commitment to reduce emissions from oil and gas by 22% by 2030. Rose Mwebaza, African Natural Resources Center of the AfDB, highlighted Nigeria as a good case study for including oil and gas emissions reduction measures in their Nationally Determined Contribution. She noted, however, that the NDC showed what to achieve but not how to achieve it, drawing attention to the lack of a carbon strategy to implement these reductions. She urged for the exchange of knowledge with producer countries on how to extract the resources in the least disruptive manner. In the ensuing discussion, panelists and participants discussed issues regarding: conflicts between biodiversity conservation and resource extraction, noting that Uganda's petroleum reserves overlapping with 80% of the country's protected areas; the implications of transitioning to low carbon development, considering the heavy dependence of transport systems on fossil fuels; whether subsidies for oil and gas compete with renewable energy; and the role of the insurance industry.\l"

It is the latest in what is now a five-volume, 4,000-plus page series stretching back to 2009 critiquing the work of the UN's IPCC.What: Presentations on latest climate scienceWho: Craig Idso, Ph.D., funder, Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change; Horst-Joachim L\'fcdecke, Ph.D., Dennis Avery, director, Center for Global Food Issues; James Taylor, senior fellow, The Heartland Institute.Where: Vienna House Katowice, Ulica Sokolska 24, 40086 Katowice, PolandWhen: Tuesday, December 4, 2018 from 2:00 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. (local time)Media contact (OPEN PRESS): Jim Lakely, HYPERLINK mailto:jlakely@heartland.orgjlakely@heartland.orgThe Heartland Institute is attending COP-24 in Katowice with NGO-Observer credentials during the first week, reporting from the conference site on Monday, Tuesday morning (before Heartland's science and policy event), and Wednesday. The following statement from James Taylor, senior fellow for environment and energy policy at The Heartland Institute, may be used for attribution.""Each year the verdict becomes stronger and clearer that the scientific evidence debunks global warming alarmism. While the United Nations' Conference of the Parties frantically searches for reasons to justify its continued existence, The Heartland Institute is proud to present the science that debunks U.N. alarmism.""We will also be presenting examples of real-world evidence contradicting important U.N. climate claims. We will be delivering the truth that the only thing 'settled' about the global warming debate is that U.N. climate reports have little credibility. Skeptics present a far better scientific case.""The December 4 event at the Vienna House Katowice - just one kilometer away from the COP-24 site - will include the first public presentation of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels. That will be followed by 30-minute presentations by Dr. Idso, Dr. L\'fcdecke, Mr. Avery, and Mr. Taylor, as well as a group discussion about the latest climate data and the goings-on at COP-24. This event will be live-streamed starting at 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET).In October, NIPCC posted a draft version of the Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels, which can be reviewed here.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA228","Poland Should Welcome Activists to U.N. Climate Talks","May 9, 2018 Wednesday","US Official News","New York: Human Rights Watch Organization has issued the following news release: As this month\' s climate talks in Germany come to an end, some participants are feeling a little queasy. Environmental activists and indigenous peoples worry about their ability to actively participate in the annual UN climate talks, in Katowice, Poland in December. UN human rights experts share their concerns. Earlier this week five experts - including the special rapporteurs on environment and human rights, on freedom of assembly, and human rights defenders - raised the alarm about a new Polish law that could hamper civil society\' s involvement at the climate summit, known as the COP24. It will bring together state parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC), and thousands of experts, journalists, businesses and nongovernmental groups. The UN experts cite concerns about the ban on spontaneous assemblies in Katowice during the talks, which will make it difficult for groups to respond to developments at the negotiations. In a letter sent to the Polish government last month they said that by  curtail[ing] the possibility of spontaneously expressing views about the unfolding of the climate talks and organizing peaceful assemblies to this effect , the new law appears to go beyond the rights restrictions necessary to ensure security and safety at the conference. The UN experts also noted that the law  appears to give sweeping surveillance powers to the police and secret services to collect and process personal data about all COP24 participants . This is a serious issue for the safety of climate activists at the summit. Last month, Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the UNFCCC, acknowledged the concerns about the law in a letter to observer organizations, and committed to  engage with the COP24 Polish presidency in an effort to ensure that non-party stakeholders are able to participate in COP24 as they have in past COPs . However, her letter doesn\' t address the specific risks the law could pose to public participation. The Polish government has yet to respond to the UN rights experts. But a reply from the Polish environment minister to similar concerns raised by the Bureau of the Aarhus Convention, a regional human rights and environmental body, has done little to dispel them. The government contends that the dates of the conference are known, so that activists could  book demonstrations in advance. But at climate negotiations, events unfold quickly and progress is often not clear until the last moment. Unless nongovernmental groups can respond spontaneously and organize peaceful protests when necessary, their rights are seriously undermined. The Polish government also compares the ban to the situation in 2015 in Paris, where the terrorist attacks immediately preceding the climate conference led to a ban on demonstrations in the city. But unlike in Paris, the Polish ban is not a reaction to a concrete security threat. Similarly, the Polish government claims that the surveillance powers for the police are necessary  due to the temporary increase in terrorist, extremist and common crime threats. In addition to collecting information about anyone posing a threat to public safety and order, the new law authorizes the police to collect data about anyone registered as participants in COP24 without their consent until January 31, 2019. But, the UN experts said, providing this authority without judicial review  appears to be unwarranted and unbalanced . This is particularly true in light of the existing counterterrorism provisions in Poland that grant extraordinary surveillance powers to the Internal Security Agency for anyone suspected of terrorist activity, especially foreigners. During meetings in Bonn this week, the Polish government emphasized its commitment to work closely with civil society to confront the global climate crisis and achieve the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement. To make this a reality, Poland should urgently amend or repeal the law to ensure that non-party stakeholders can fully exercise their rights during COP24. The UNFCCC Secretariat and other governments involved in the negotiations should work with the Polish government to provide the space for a vibrant civil society at the climate talks. As the statement of the UN experts notes:  All eyes are on the Polish Government to see how, as the host and the president of , it will honour its human rights obligations and uphold its responsibility to ensure free and unfettered access for broader participation. \l"
"COP24","USA","COP24_USA229","Monitoring climate change from space","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Space Daily","Rising global temperatures and the effects of climate change are huge and environmental challenges. Satellites provide unequivocal evidence of the changes taking place and provide decision-makers with the information they need to address these complicated issues - as demonstrated in efforts underway at the COP24 summit in Poland.Representatives from almost 200 countries have gathered in Katowice, Poland for the 24th conference of the Parties () of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said, ""We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change. Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later, before it is too late.""One of most important tasks at the summit is to agree the course of action to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement - and, with the 2C target now deemed not enough, to coordinate an international effort to halt warming at 1.5C.COP24 is expected to agree and finalise the 'Katowice Rule Book' for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change.The meeting focuses on a triangle of nature, man and technology, and will investigate how they can be used to reduce climate change and mitigate its effects.Understanding the complexities of how Earth functions as a system and hard evidence of change is vital for putting forward implementation plans, especially as taking action can have financial implications for nations.So while space agencies such as ESA and environmental monitoring programmes such as Copernicus do not have a direct role in the decision-making, the information their satellites provide are key. Satellite measurements of Earth's changing temperature, sea levels, atmospheric gases, declining ice and forest cover for example, are one of the main ways of providing the scientific community with the data they need to improve our understanding of the Earth system and predict its future.In her opening speech, Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, President of the United Nations General Assembly, stressed, ""If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.""Data form the basis for policy-makers to build the most effective strategies for halting climate change.Earth's climate has always varied naturally, so the difficult task of separating natural variability from changes caused by human activity is important for confronting today's challenges.Needless to say, it is also important that satellite measurements continue over long periods of time so that changes can be monitored accurately.Through ESA's Climate Change Initiative, long-term datasets on key indicators of climate change are being systematically generated and preserved.These 'essential climate variables' - of which there are more than 50 - are core to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations dedicated programme on Global Climate Observation System.Another European contribution to the global challenge of climate comes from the Copernicus environmental monitoring programme and its dedicated family of Sentinel satellite missions built by ESA. These satellite missions offer continuity of measurements for climate research as well as for a host of operational services to improve everyday life.Copernicus with the Sentinels and their systematic observations, ESA's Climate Change Initiative, along with the contribution that ESA makes to the REDD+ deforestation and forest degradation programme are the topics showcased at ESA's stand at COP24.\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA231","Farting cows directly linked to global warming","December 25, 2018 Tuesday 10:08 AM EST","Green Prophet","Dec 25, 2018( Green Prophet: HYPERLINK http://www.greenprophet.comhttp://www.greenprophet.comCOP24 Climate Change Conference[2],being held in Katowice Poland,is bringing countries together again to try to find solutions to rising temperatures and severe weather patterns being caused by continuous dependence on fossil fuels and other human-caused factors. One under-looked cause, now being considered as no less critical than fossil fuels, is beef and dairy cow farming; especially in affluent countries like Australia, the UK and the USA. Increasing fondness for beef in the USA, for example, is raising levels of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) in the atmosphere as high as the use of fossil fuels. Thisincrease is being caused largely by a very important natural phenomena: cows fart. The unique food digestion process of a cow's 4 chambered ruminantstomach[3]actually ferments the cellular plant material it eats creating methane and other gas, including nitrogen and carbon dioxide. These gases are released from both the animal's mouth during digestion when it chews its'cud'; and afterwards expelled in even larger amounts from the large intestine and anus, causing the flatulence or farts. In a way, you might consider this process as similar to a biogas manufacturing process. So much of this natural biogas is created during the digestion process thatscientists now say that the amount involved to create just 225 grams of beef releases as much biogas into the air as the exhaust from 55 cars! The released biogas is now considered to be adefinite contributor to the 'greenhouse effect'[4] that causes global warming. A recent program produced on CNN points this out more dramatically by illustrating the cattle farming industry in the American state of Texas[5], which has the distinction of being the USA's top beef producing state. The program showed how cattle are raised there in giant feed lots and idolized by a college football team with its Big Bevo mascot: a giant longhorn steer. This particular species of cattle was once the State of Texas' prime beef producing animal; and idolizedas a colorful part of the Old West when massive herds of cattle were driven hundreds of miles overland to livestock markets in Kansas. There, they would then be shipped by rail to meat processingcenters in Chicago and other locations.According to the CNN featured program, cattle emit 10 times more greenhouse gases than other food mammals like pigs and chickens. American fondness for beef remains high, however. Reducing the greenhouse gases emitted by cattle is now considered to be a primary objective to keeping the level of global warming within the 1.5 degrees C goal of the COP 24 conference. If the global temperature levelsexceed this threshold, catastrophic consequences to the earth's environment will occur. Alternatives to naturally grown beef are currently being developed by scientists like Dr. Mark Post[6], one of the first innovators of laboratory produced 'macro meat'. Dr. Postsays that producing synthetic meat from stem cells may one day be commercially feasible and will be able to help satisfy people's desire for beef, while dramatically reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses now being emitted by cattle. It's not just beef producing cattle that are causing the greenhouse gas problem, however. large dairy cattle herds also emit the same greenhouse gases as beef cattle. With this in mind,the only plausible solution will be less production of dairy products from cow's milk, which will be much harder for most people to accept, myself included.

Sheldon Whitehouse:As-prepared for deliveryThe U.S. is technically present in the form of a small delegation, but American leadership on climate change is decidedly absent. Why? Because the government of the United States of America has fallen under the political control of the industry most responsible for this mess.American leadership was essential to forging the global consensus on carbon emissions in the original Paris Agreement. I know because I was there in Paris in 2015 as Secretary Kerry and the U.S. negotiating team worked to seal the landmark pact.What a pathetic difference a few years make. In 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would become the only country in the world to turn its back on this agreement.The U.S. abdicates its leadership just as the scientific warnings of the dangers of climate change grow clearer, and grimmer. In October came a new report from the world's scientists working through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Last month, the federal government released its own sobering news about the worsening risks climate change poses to our nation and our economy. Our National Climate Assessment warned of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses due to climate change if we don't act to curtail carbon emissions.Trump's responded first by describing his own ""very high levels of intelligence,"" but then simply denied all the science because, he said, ""I don't see it.""Well, guess what? Pope Paul V didn't ""see it"" when Galileo demonstrated that the earth revolved around the sun. That didn't change the astrophysics. The climate science, laid out in black and white by Trump's own government, is that our planet is heating up due to our use of fossil fuels. The science is even more incontrovertible than when Donald Trump said it was ""incontrovertible"" in 2009. Saying he now doesn't see it, is the very definition of denial.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA238","COP24 Brings Greatest Test of Countries' Commitment to the Paris Agreement Yet","December 1, 2018 Saturday 1:21 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","World Wildlife Fund issued the following news release:On the heels of several international reports outlining the mounting impacts and costs of climate change, negotiators at this week's UN climate talks need to finalize the rules governing how the Paris Agreement will operate going forward and ensure countries deliver a strong commitment to increase their own climate targets before 2020.The troubling gap between current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and what is needed to prevent catastrophic climate change is laid bare in three recent reports: the 2018 Emissions Gap Report, the United States' 4th National Climate Assessment, and the landmark special report on 1.5 C of global warming.""In many ways things are getting worse and worse, and better and better, faster and faster,"" said Lou Leonard, World Wildlife Fund's senior vice president for climate change and energy. ""The world's best scientists, and nature itself, are sounding the alarm. Changes are happening sooner and faster than we expected. At the same time, the private sector and regional governments are waking up to their responsibility to lead on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. They are creating momentum and unveiling a new formula for success in ramping up global ambition.""As the recent Emissions Gap report states, countries must sharply raise the ambition of their national climate targets by 2020 or the 1.5 C goal under the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach. ""Increasing ambition at this scale is only possible if the private sector, regional and national governments work collaboratively to develop a new set of national climate targets before 2020,"" said Leonard.""Countries left ambition on the table when they set their first climate pledges in 2015. Current national climate targets largely ignored or understated the contributions of those driving regional economies, like companies and local governments,"" said Leonard. ""That can change for the revised targets because these players are now fully bought into the process. Moreover, a growing wave of businesses and cities have made new, science-based commitments since 2015, including at the Global Climate Action Summit in September of this year.""WWF is bringing leaders from new climate coalitions in Japan, Mexico, Argentina and the United States to the talks to bridge new alliances, push for stronger pre-2020 action, and to meet with national governments to advocate for strong rules to operationalize the Paris agreement. Private sector representatives in the We Are Still In coalition cite a strong transparency regime, clear and consistent approaches for setting national climate targets, and clarity around market mechanisms as key elements up for debate at these talks which are critical to their business operations.US efforts to reduce emissions will be on display in the US Climate Action Center -- located in Pavilion E and livestreamed -- December 7-10. The Center will host mayors, businesses, Congressional staff, and other climate leaders from the We Are Still In coalition and convene discussion on topics including the implications of the US midterm elections, the benefits a strong Paris regime for the private sector, and the role of natural climate solutions.WWF believes a clear set of outcomes are needed in Poland to ensure the continued momentum for climate action, called the ""Katowice Package"". These include: Urgently scaled up climate action both before and after 2020 accompanied by financial and other support for developing countries; Finalize and adopt a comprehensive set of rules (""Paris Rulebook"") to guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement. These must enhance the transparency of all countries' actions to address climate change, lead to greater accountability and ambition of countries' individual climate plans, and clarify the roles of market mechanisms; A renewed recognition of the gap between current action and the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, and a recognition of actions that can close the gap, including better integration of nature-based climate solutions; and finally, A commitment from Parties to update and resubmit improved national climate plans (or nationally determined contributions or NDCs) by 2020.Positive momentum heading into the talks was boosted by Germany's pledge of EUR 1.5 billion towards replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, which should help reassure especially the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries that international financial support is available for their climate actions.Contact: Melanie Gade, 202/495-4143, HYPERLINK mailto:melanie.gade@wwfus.orgmelanie.gade@wwfus.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6541730 MSTRUCK\l"

""This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself."" The text of the letter can be found below and HERE. December 3, 2018 The Honorable Andrew Wheeler Acting Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20460 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying, ""[m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis.""[1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world's leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts some of which are EPA employees as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated ""I don't believe it"" when asked about the report, adding that ""we're at the cleanest we've ever been.""[2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that ""We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts."" She also said that ""[I]t's not data-driven"" and that it ""contradicts long established trends.""[3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that ""The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration""...and ""[G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment"" and ""I don't know this for a fact I wouldn't be surprised if the Obama administration told the report's authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report.""[4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the 'worst-case' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that, ""analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity"" and ""analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.""[8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. So that I can understand the basis for EPA's views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration's response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019:Copies of all briefing materials prepared for you or other Trump Administration EPA political officials related to the preparation and release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including but not limited to the May 2, 2018 briefing for the Office of Air and Radiation whose invited participants included Bill Wehrum and David Harlow, the May 14, 2018 briefing for the Office of Water whose invited participants included Lee Forsgren and Owen McDonough, and the May 29, 2018 briefing for the Office of Research and Development whose invited participants included Richard Yamada.Copies of all briefing or materials prepared by EPA that were sent to any other entity within the Trump Administration related to the preparation or release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment.Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including documents related to the decision to release the report the day after Thanksgiving.Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to your appearance at the November 28, 2018 Washington Post event or the EPA press release the following day.Thank you for your assistance in this matter.Load-Date:\~December 5, 2018\l"

This week, we expect ministers to no longer hide behind the inaction of the United States and Saudi Arabia, to no longer stay silent, but to speak up for both agreed rules on implementing the Paris Agreement and enhanced national action plans. This is essential to lead us towards roughly halving emissions by 2030 compared to today.""Kristen Hite, Oxfam Climate Change Policy Lead, said: ""It's unacceptable that despite the clear findings of the IPCC governments are still refusing to see the writing on the wall: preventing a world warmer than 1.5 degrees must be the benchmark for all decision making this week. There is real energy and leadership amongst from states, but how many more people need to die from drought-induced hunger or thirst before everyone agrees to limit global warming? How many more communities should burn, or drown?""Climate change is already forcing people from their land and homes. During the first week of COP24 governments adopted landmark recommendations on displacement, complementing the broader Compact on Migration which was adopted in Marrakech today. In a recent report, Oxfam found the vulnerability to extreme weather of small-scale farmers and pastoralists in the Sahel region made 24 million people reliant on humanitarian assistance this year alone.Harmeling comments: ""We welcome that governments and UN agencies now have a clear framework on how to protect the rights of people at risk of displacement from the climate crisis and ensure communities have full ownership over decisions on relocation. However, this week it is essential that developed countries also agree to commit to financing loss and damage in the Paris Rulebook, to help vulnerable people cope with the unavoidable impacts of climate change.""Oxfam and CARE are also calling on governments to agree on strict accounting rules which ensure that only dedicated funding for real climate action gets counted towards the $100 bn per year which developing countries have been promised.""There's been some really important discussions to agree a set of crucial rules that everyone should stick to when tackling climate change, but emission cuts are the high-stakes poker chips that governments are betting our lives on.

Africa is the most vulnerable continent despite contributing only about 4% to global greenhouse gas emissions but when we go to argue our case we speak in tongues and come back with no deal,"" he said.""We need to make sure that we have a unified voice as we proceed to COP24. We should showcase our own solutions to climate change; solutions that are developed and customized to fit our own situation.""He said given Africa's shared ecosystems and that natural resources know no boundaries, it was essential that 'we continue to speak in one voice to safeguard the basis of our development and seek transformative solutions'.Mr. Tobiko said the theme of this year's forum, ""Policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa"", reflects Africa's collective engagement and commitment to strengthen climate change actions in the context of its development priorities.Climate change threats, he said, however present opportunities for innovative and green investments for Africa.""This is why implementation of the Paris Agreement remains a priority for the continent in order to adapt to the inevitability of climate variability and change. It is however important to emphasize that achieving the goals of the Agreement require committed leadership from state and non-state actors,"" the Minister said.Commenting on theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 'Global Warming of 1.50C special report and its impacts in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty', Mr. Tobiko said limiting global warming to 1.50C would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.""Operationalisation implies that adequate and predictable resources be mobilised and made available to support adaptation and mitigation action in Africa and other developing world,"" he said, adding it was important that discussions and outcome of CCDA-VII contribute to build momentum towards the upcoming COP 24 and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).Local communities, women and the youth, he said, should be engaged in Africa's efforts to combat the vagaries of climate change.Mr. Tobiko shared with participants Kenya's priority climate actions and how its devolved governments were helping fight climate change.""There are numerous practical and innovative solutions at community, sub-national, national and international level that we should never ignore in Africa. Climate change affects all of us but it affects doubly the most vulnerable members of our communities so we should always engage them because they also have the knowledge and solutions,"" he said.The Minister said as part of efforts to tap into opportunities in biodiversity, Kenya will be hosting its first Sustainable Blue Economy Conference between the 26th and 28th November 2018 to promote sustainable investments in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers.The meeting has attracted over 700 participants from member States, climate researchers, academia, civil society organizations, private sector, youth, women and local government leaders, among others.

The Trump administration released new pollution rules that replace the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan with a new agenda that caters to the fossil fuel industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Trump administrations proposed regulations would increase carbon emissions, leading up to an estimated 1,400 premature deaths each year.The Presidents continued efforts to undo the progress weve made to combat the effects of climate change are threatening the health and safety of the American people, said Shaheen . Rising temperatures interrupt New Hampshires fall foliage season and maple syrup production, directly impeding our business and tourism sectors, and elevated sea levels put the homes and livelihoods of our Seacoast families at risk. It is unconscionable that the administration is knowingly pursuing a policy that puts the wellbeing of the fossil fuel industry over American lives. The Presidents actions also undermine years of work by small businesses in New Hampshire and across the nation that were incentivized under the Obama administration to prioritize technology in renewable energy and to curb carbon emissions. Im deeply concerned by the Presidents destructive efforts to unravel necessary protections that safeguard our air, water and land, and that preserve our environment and wildlife. Ill continue to oppose the administrations dangerous policies that put Americans health at risk and jeopardize the sustainability of our planet.Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris climate accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy as part of the omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2018. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the Presidents anti-environment agenda, and cosponsored legislation that would rescind President Trumps anti-climate executive order and restore our nations leadership role in the fight against global climate change.\l"

And yet, for two weeks in December, more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 nations converged in the Silesian capital of Katowice, Poland, to attend the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24).More than twenty students and researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego attended the climate talks, where they gained a nuanced understanding of the intricacies and challenges of climate policy. The team was part of UC Revelle, the observer organization representing the University of California.It was so interesting to see how this kind of global policy is created, said Kat Montgomery, a Master of Advanced Studies student in the Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. A first-time attendee of the UN talks, Montgomery described her experience in Poland as illuminating and said she gained a better understanding of the role of non-governmental and research organizations in the UNFCCC process.I think the UCs biggest accomplishment at COP24 was being able to give so many current and future scientists a chance to attend a conference like this, where they could learn about and potentially influence global policy, said Montgomery.In Katowice, she and other UC delegates observed some of the complex negotiations in which nations hammered out the details of a common rulebook to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. The rulebook defines how nations will enact their climate pledges to keep global temperatures well below an increase of 2C above pre-industrial levels. It also provides a universal framework for measuring and reporting emissions with greater transparency and supports climate financing to poorer nations, among other things.The negotiations were difficult, as many countries were trying to pull in different directions. However, the world came to a midpoint to implement the Paris Agreement, said Alfredo Giron, a Scripps Ph.D. student whose research focuses on fishery sustainability in the Gulf of California. Being part of the Scripps delegation allowed me to follow up this process very closely and get involved with delegates from different countries and other observer organizations to dig into the details.In the UFO-shaped Spodek arena, the UC delegates hosted an exhibit that highlighted the oceans reach on global climate. The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions.One meaningful interaction occurred when Tibetan delegate Zamlha Tempa Gyaltsen stopped by the UC exhibit to drop off a hand-signed letter from His Hol"

The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change. The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report.  If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating, wrote Senator Carper.  This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. The Honorable Andrew Wheeler Acting Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20460 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying,  [m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis. [1] On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world\' s leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week. The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts \- some of which are EPA employees \- as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet. Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated  I don\' t believe it when asked about the report, adding that  we\' re at the cleanest we\' ve ever been. [2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that  We think that this is the most extreme version and it\' s not based on facts. She also said that  [I]t\' s not data-driven and that it  contradicts long established trends. [3] At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that  The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration  and  [G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment and  I don\' t know this for a fact  I wouldn\' t be surprised if the Obama administration told the report\' s authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report. [4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the \' worst-case\' scenario. As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that,  analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity and  analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years. [8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9] If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn\' t an alarmist prediction. It doesn\' t come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn\' t come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation\' s leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself. So that I can understand the basis for EPA\' s views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration\' s response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019: Copies of all briefing materials prepared for you or other Trump Administration EPA political officials related to the preparation and release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including but not limited to the May 2, 2018 briefing for the Office of Air and Radiation whose invited participants included Bill Wehrum and David Harlow, the May 14, 2018 briefing for the Office of Water whose invited participants included Lee Forsgren and Owen McDonough, and the May 29, 2018 briefing for the Office of Research and Development whose invited participants included Richard Yamada. Copies of all briefing or materials prepared by EPA that were sent to any other entity within the Trump Administration related to the preparation or release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, including documents related to the decision to release the report the day after Thanksgiving. Copies of all documents, including emails, white papers, memos, briefing slides, meeting minutes, drafts of press remarks or talking points, or other materials related to your appearance at the November 28, 2018 Washington Post event or the EPA press release the following day.

He also recently launched the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, whose goal is selecting 1,000 solutions that would protect the environment in a profitable way.These solutions are to be offered to world decision makers at COP24; the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 24), which is scheduled for Dec. 3-14 in Katowice, Slaskie, Poland. The World Alliance also hopes to encourage these leaders to adopt more ambitious environmental targets and energy policies.""Bertrand Piccard pushes the boundaries of the possible with his pioneering spirit,"" said Chris Strong, NBAA senior vice president of conventions and membership. ""That pioneering spirit is among the hallmarks of the business aviation industry, and we know convention attendees will be inspired by his personal story and perspectives about what is possible in aviation and beyond.""The Solar Impulse project was created to demonstrate the abilities of renewable energies and promote energy savings. The Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and economy, bringing together protection of the environment and financial viability to show that these solutions are not expensive fixes to problems, but rather opportunities for clean economic growth.The Solar Impulse 2 solar-powered aircraft departed from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, traversed Asia, then completed its longest leg from Japan to Hawaii. On that leg, the aircraft's batteries sustained substantial damage that required repair, but the flight eventually continued from Hawaii to California, across the U.S., over the Atlantic Ocean to Spain and back to its starting point in Abu Dhabi. Solar Impulse 2 completed its 26,000-mile round-the-world mission without using a drop of fuel in July 2016.Piccard was a speaker at the opening session for the 2017 edition of the European Business Aviation Convention &#38; Exhibition (EBACE).NBAA-BACE is business aviation's most important annual event, where participants have an unequaled opportunity to view the latest business aircraft, products, technology, and services the industry offers.

President Buhari renewed his commitment Monday in Katowice, Poland, at a bilateral meeting with Swiss President Alain Berset, on the margins of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP24. The President had spent the whole day at the International Conference Centre, Katowice where he delivered his national address at the opening of the 12-day meeting of COP24, met with several world leaders and visited the impressive Nigerian pavilion at the climate summit. During his meeting with the Swiss President, the Nigerian leader thanked the Swiss Confederation for its efforts and important role as intermediaries to secure the release of some Chibok girls and assured him that the issue of the remaining kidnapped girls and other abducted persons will remain a ""key priority"" for the Nigerian government. President Buhari and his Swiss counterpart discussed joint strategies to ensure the safe return of the girls, building on the past successes of securing the release of some of the Chibok girls and other abducted persons in the North Eastern part of Nigeria. The President also welcomed the Swiss President's commitment to continue providing humanitarian assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria and to ensure the safe release of the abducted school girls. ""We will continue to make the safe release of the remaining Chibok girls a priority and will welcome any kind of support from any quarters to make this happen, "" the President said. In separate bilateral meetings with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, President Buhari commended the country for a successful outing at the opening of the COP24 meeting in Katowice. The President told his Polish counterpart that Nigeria was facing serious climate change challenges, particularly the receding Lake Chad, which is a source of livelihood to some 40 million people living in the region. ""Nigeria is totally committed to global efforts to mitigate and adapt to effects of climate change,"" President Buhari told the Polish leader, whose country is the president of COP24. In his meeting with Prime Minister Morawiecki, the President lauded the plan by the Polish Government to open a Trade Office in Lagos soon, promising that investors who look to Nigeria can be ""guaranteed"" of safe returns on their investments. ""We have a vibrant and active young population and our government is doing so much on the Nigerian economy, including diversifying to non-oil sectors. ""We welcome increased cooperation with Poland and will encourage investments in other sectors of the economy like solid minerals and information technology, "" the President said. Morawiecki told President Buhari that traditionally 96 per cent of oil imports to Poland come from Saudi Arabia and Russia, adding ""but now we are looking at importing oil from Nigeria."" The Prime Minister noted as the fastest growing economy in the European Union, Poland has identified Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa, as three top investment destinations in Africa. ""We want the hub of our investment destination to be in Nigeria,"" the Polish Prime Minister told President Buhari, welcoming the pledge by the Nigerian leader to immediately put in place a framework to encourage more Polish investments in Nigeria. Meanwhile, the President's bilateral meeting with his Austrian counterpart, Alexander Van der Bellen, focused on the challenges of Lake Chad and what was required to recharge it. Noting that the Lake faced the two challenges of technology and financing, President Buhari told the Austrian leader that enormous financial resources and technology were required to transfer water to Lake Chad from the Congo Basin. Van der Bellen, who indicated his country's interest to cooperate with Nigeria on recharging the Lake Chad, talked about climate change challenges in Austria including drought, glaciers melting, among others. President Buhari also met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and both leaders followed up on their past discussions, during their last meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, in July, which centred on trade, investments and partnerships in agriculture. The President welcomed the proposal by the Dutch Prime Minister to visit Abuja soon and promised that the Nigerian government will continue to provide a conducive business environment for existing and prospective Dutch investors.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA254","Law Professor Wirth Reflects on Environmental Negotiations","January 27, 2019 Sunday","The Heights: Boston College","In early December, the 24th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) was convened in Poland. Boston College law professor David Wirth was an official academic adviser at the meeting, which was designed to halt the impending effects of climate change.""Growing up, my father was interested in stamps and coins, and I was interested in butterflies, shells, and fish,"" Wirth said. ""I was interested in nature, and I grew up with a certain awe and respect for nature.""COP24. The conference was looking to elaborate on the Paris Rulebook, which, according to Wirth, was ""pretty detailed,"" but required further expansion. The Paris Rulebook came out of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015 by 195 countries who agreed to mitigate their greenhouse gas emission and work toward a more environmentally friendly world.Environmental issues have received greater attention in light of a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that warned of irreversible damage if corrections did not occur before 2020. The U.S. government released a report that came to the same conclusion.As of now, emissions are still increasing. Wirth warns that they must be reduced by 45 percent by 2030 to avoid the catastrophic effects that accompany dramatic climate change.COP24 made significant strides toward instituting policies that would curb emissions, but the absence of the United States, and its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, has taken the pressure off China to take significant measures to curb their emissions. Additionally, Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a climate change skeptic who has pulled out of hosting COP25.Wirth called COP24Wirth was invited to the conference because of his impressive resume and his extensive background in the field of international environmental law. He was educated at Princeton University and Harvard University, where he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry.Wirth attended Yale Law School and graduated in 1981. He then went to work as a law clerk to Judge William H. Timbers of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, before going into the field of international environmental law, which put all of his degrees to use, even though environmental law was still in its infancy stages. He has worked on the diplomatic side of climate change since 1988 and has held positions at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the State Department, among other governmental institutions. When Wirth was at the State Department, he was the only person working on international environmental law.""I got in on international environmental law when the elevator wasn't even at the ground floor-it was at the basement,"" Wirth said.Wirth then joined the BC community in 1998 and was made a permanent member of the faculty in 1999. He has taught classes on international environmental law and public international law, as well as climate change and policy.""The social justice ethos of this school is very attractive to somebody that works in my field,"" Wirth said.

It said the countries are ""determined to step up our ambition by 2020,"" including by boosting their goals under the Paris Agreement on climate change, taking more short-term actions and engaging in long-term strategies for developing low emission technologies.Ministers and other officials that signed the deal were from Argentina, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, the European Union, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Grenada, Italy, Jamaica, the Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Principality of Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Saint Lucia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.Notably missing from the pledge is Poland, which is hosting and leading the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24.However, COP24 President Micha Kurtyka of Poland and a Fiji minister on the closing day of related informal national ambition discussions known as the Talanoa Dialogue issued a Talanoa Call for Action for governments and the private sector to step up action in 2020. The year-long ambition talks concluded at COP24 on Dec. 12, three days ahead of when negotiators are hoping to hash out an implementation rulebook for the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to limit global warming ideally to 1.5 degrees C and to 2 degrees at the most.The parties to the Paris Agreement launched the Talanoa Dialogue in 2017 to begin assessing how close they are to meeting their initial pledges and thinking about increasing their goals in 2020, which is the first year in which nations will have the option to announce new targets. Under the Paris accord, countries agreed to increase their climate ambitions over time with the understanding that their initial pledges, the ones in place today, would not be enough.""Climate action is on the rise but not on the scale and speed we need,"" Kurtyka said at the closing session of the Talanoa Dialogue.Adding pressure to those discussions is a recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, that found the world effectively has until 2030, much earlier than previously thought, to significantly reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. But global emissions climbed in 2017 and are expected to have climbed again in 2018 and the U.S.'s refusal along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to endorse the IPCC report at the COP24 meetings indicates big challenges remain in getting all of the countries that signed the Paris accord to agree to ratchet up their goals in 2020.At the closing session of the Talanoa Dialogue, U.N. Secretary Ant\'f3nio Guterres challenged countries and the private sector ""to accelerate and finish the job and to raise ambition on all fronts. To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change.""Guterres has invited heads of state to attend a U.N. climate summit in New York City in September 2019 that will largely focus on stepping up ambitions in 2020 and increasing private sector participation.The Talanoa Dialogue was also the first time under the Paris Agreement in which the private sector and smaller governments were invited to participate in the discussions.\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA258","THE SECRETARY-GENERAL'S REMARK AT THE E-MOBILITY EVENT AT COP24","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 2:49 PM  EST","US Fed News","UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 4 -- The United Nations Office of the Secretary General issued the text of the following statement:Minister Kurtyka, Minister Morawiecki, Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, ladies and gentlemenIt is a pleasure to address you at this exciting event.I want to thank the Government of Poland and in-coming COP president Mr. Kurtyka and the United Kingdom for launching this initiative.This event is exciting because it is a key step towards the sustainability transition that we all know is needed.And this step is critically important for reaching the aims of the Paris Agreement - to keep global temperature rise this century to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C.Globally, transport accounted for one quarter of total emissions in 2016, a level 71% higher than what was seen in 1990.It is estimated that over 1 billion passenger cars travel the streets and roads of the world today.By 2040, the number of cars on the road across the globe is set to double to 2 billion at least.This illustrates the urgency for accelerated action to reduce emissions from transport.But the need is equally obvious when looking at air pollution.Air pollution is now the fourth-highest cause of death worldwide. Long-term exposure to air pollution contributed to the deaths of 6.1 million people in 2016.Clearly, we need to prevent this. Clearly, we need to act.Interestingly, the first electric vehicles were produced and sold at the beginning of the 1900s and sales peaked in the early 1910s.But technological developments and the discovery of large oil reserves displaced the electric vehicle in favour of the combustion engine.Now, almost 100 years later, electric vehicles are coming back and need to increasingly displace the combustion engine in favour of reducing emissions and air pollution.We need sustainable and clean transport systems. The growing awareness for clean air and climate change means that many governments around the world have begun embracing e-mobility.Many are putting in place the policy frameworks and infrastructure needed for sustainable transport.A growing number of countries and regions have announced plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles and to shift to e-mobility.Others are putting in place targets for the absolute number or overall share of electric vehicles by 2020 or 2030.And the International Energy Agency estimates that in 2017, there were already 3.5 million charging outlets for electric vehicles around the world.These policy initiatives have spurred market growth for electric vehicles.There is increasing demand and many businesses are embracing e-mobility and its new economic opportunities.By some estimates, this will displace 7.3 million barrels per day of transport fuel. This clearly shows the potential of e-mobility in contributing to climate change mitigation.Many sustainable transport strategies also have large, immediate health benefits for the majority of the world's population, and large equity benefits for vulnerable groups.But the growth in electric vehicles will have a significant impact on electricity demand - and this needs to be kept in mind.If not managed carefully, the additional demand will create challenges across all sections of the energy system, particularly at peak times.E-mobility that depends on a fossil fuel-based energy system would potentially significantly drive climate change and air pollution and not lead to the solution we want.According to IRENA, assuming all these new electric vehicles were to consume 100% renewable electricity, around 450 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year of additional renewable electricity would be required by 2030.We have the solutions at our finger tips. We have much of the technology in place. We have policies to drive and support sustainable transport. And market conditions and demand are responding positively.The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity.But the transition needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full.If we get this right, then a decarbonized transport system will be part of the solution.The ""Driving Change Together"" declaration is an essential step towards a decarbonized transport system.I applaud the Katowice Partnership for e-mobility and I urge all actors to support it.

And yet, for two weeks in December, more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 nations converged in the Silesian capital of Katowice, Poland, to attend the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24).More than twenty students and researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego attended the climate talks, where they gained a nuanced understanding of the intricacies and challenges of climate policy. The team was part of UC Revelle, the observer organization representing the University of California.""It was so interesting to see how this kind of global policy is created,"" said Kat Montgomery, a Master of Advanced Studies student in the Marine Biodiversity and Conservation program at Scripps. A first-time attendee of the UN talks, Montgomery described her experience in Poland as ""illuminating"" and said she gained a better understanding of the role of non-governmental and research organizations in the UNFCCC process.""I think the UC's biggest accomplishment at COP24 was being able to give so many current and future scientists a chance to attend a conference like this, where they could learn about and potentially influence global policy,"" said Montgomery.In Katowice, she and other UC delegates observed some of the complex negotiations in which nations hammered out the details of a common rulebook to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. The rulebook defines how nations will enact their climate pledges to keep global temperatures well below an increase of 2 C above pre-industrial levels. It also provides a universal framework for measuring and reporting emissions with greater transparency and supports climate financing to poorer nations, among other things.""The negotiations were difficult, as many countries were trying to pull in different directions. However, the world came to a midpoint to implement the Paris Agreement,"" said Alfredo Giron, a Scripps Ph.D. student whose research focuses on fishery sustainability in the Gulf of California. ""Being part of the Scripps delegation allowed me to follow up this process very closely and get involved with delegates from different countries and other observer organizations to dig into the details.""In the UFO-shaped Spodek arena, the UC delegates hosted an exhibit that highlighted the ocean's reach on global climate. The exhibit allowed Scripps students and UC affiliates to connect with delegates from around the globe and raise awareness about the importance of ocean and climate science being included in global policy decisions.One meaningful interaction occurred when Tibetan delegate Zamlha Tempa Gyaltsen stopped by the UC exhibit to drop off a hand-signed letter from His Hol"

(...) Only a transition that challenges systems of exclusion and discrimination, and seeks to improve prosperity and well-being for all, can be considered a truly Just Transition."" This was one of the main messages presented by UNRISD on behalf of the Just Transition Research Collaborative to participants at the UN Climate Conference, COP24, currently under way in Katowice, Poland.This message is contained in Mapping Just Transition(s) to a Low-Carbon World, the state-of-the-art report on ways to achieve a socially equitable transition away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon development. The report was written by the Just Transition Research Collaborative, which brings together experts from academia and civil society to collectively map and analyse the different understandings and narratives of ""Just Transition"" underpinning the concept's growing popularity and uptake. Challenging the narrow interpretation of Just Transition that seeks to protect a relatively small number of affected workers, the report calls for profound change and an intersectional approach to climate justice.The Collaborative is run jointly by UNRISD and the University of London Institute in Paris, and supported by the Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung.The UNRISD lead of the Just Transition Research Collaborative, Dunja Krause, travelled (by train and bus) to Poland to launch the report at three different events during COP24, in order to maximize potential uptake. Launching the report at COP24in the presence of governments, United Nations organizations, civil society and the private sectoris an important way of contributing to the science-policy dialogue on Just Transition and supporting policy makers to make better decisions on how to combine the environmental goal of shifting to low-carbon development with social considerations of equity and justice. The research shows that although challenging and complex, Just Transitions are possible through direct engagement with workers, and through government investment in infrastructure and social welfare programmes, among many other initiatives discussed.The findings struck a chord with many present at COP24, and resonate with the growing recognition of the need not only to respond to climate change but to respond equitably.

Carper to Wheeler as COP24 Begins: Distorting Climate Science Report Runs Afoul of Commitment You Made to Me","December 4, 2018 Tuesday 8:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The office of Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, issued the following news release:As the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) begins, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), wrote to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to express grave concerns regarding his recent public comments with respect to the Trump Administration's release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The nearly 1,700-page scientific report, congressionally-mandated and issued the day after Thanksgiving by 13 federal agencies and over 300 federal experts, highlights the devastating impacts climate change has on human health, the economy, and the environment. The report also highlights some of the vulnerabilities in communities across the country such as deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality that will leave certain areas more susceptible to the most damaging effects of climate change.The letter notes that since the report was released, comments made by President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Acting Administrator Wheeler sought to undermine its findings. In the letter, Ranking Member Carper also demanded documents that detail EPA's views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration's response to its own report.""If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating,"" wrote Senator Carper. ""This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself.""The text of the letter can be found below and HERE ( HYPERLINK https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b/c/bcef39c0-89e2-404a-8562-0b47b1019a74/F378E4D1A5E45F694730DB2DCAAA97B8.acting-admin-andrew-wheeler---12.3.18.pdfhttps://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b/c/bcef39c0-89e2-404a-8562-0b47b1019a74/F378E4D1A5E45F694730DB2DCAAA97B8.acting-admin-andrew-wheeler---12.3.18.pdf)December 3, 2018The Honorable Andrew WheelerActing AdministratorU.S. Environmental Protection Agency1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NWWashington, DC 20460Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: I write to express my grave concerns regarding the recent public comments made by you and your agency with respect to the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. These comments appear to run afoul of the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, when you committed not to distort climate science studies, saying, ""[m]y goal would be to not distort any scientific or economic analysis.""[1]On the day after Thanksgiving, thirteen federal agencies led by NOAA released the Fourth National Climate Assessment. This nearly 1,700-page, congressionally-mandated report highlighted the devastating impacts that climate change will have over the next eighty years if we do not change course now. The report was a dire warning to our nation and our planet, a warning that the world's leaders are today attempting to heed as the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins this week.The Fourth National Climate Assessment took three years to develop and write. It was written with input from more than 300 federal experts - some of which are EPA employees - as well as non-federal experts who volunteered their time. The scientific report was finalized following an extensive public outreach and interagency review process, and its conclusions are important to every person living on this planet.Since the report was released, comments made by you and other Trump Administration officials have sought to undermine the findings of the report. For example, on November 26, 2018, President Trump stated ""I don't believe it"" when asked about the report, adding that ""we're at the cleanest we've ever been.""[2] The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated at the White House press conference that ""We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts."" She also said that ""[I]t's not data-driven"" and that it ""contradicts long established trends.""[3]At a Washington Post event held on November 28, 2018, you stated that ""The drafting of this report was drafted at the direction of the Obama administration""...and ""[G]oing forward, I think we need to take a look at the modeling that used for the next assessment"" and ""I don't know this for a fact -- I wouldn't be surprised if the Obama administration told the report's authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report.""[4] The EPA then doubled down on these comments the next day, by releasing a statement[5] that purported to validate your remarks, citing an article[6] issued by The Daily Caller, a publication with a long history of issuing false statements about climate change.[7] This article greatly mischaracterized the scope of the climate report by falsely asserting that Obama Administration officials directed it to focus on the 'worst-case' scenario.As you must certainly know, the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction of any one Administration, but was directed by Congress through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, which passed the United States Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. This law requires, every four years, a report that, ""analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity"" and ""analyzes current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.""[8] The memo mischaracterized by EPA and The Daily Caller clearly states that the Fourth National Climate Assessment should use scenarios and science that are consistent with previous reports.[9]If the United States continues to ignore the dangers of climate change, the costs for all Americans will be devastating. This isn't an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization, and it doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our nation's leading scientists. We may not all agree about what to do to address these dire warnings, but it disturbs me greatly that counter to the commitment you made to me during your confirmation hearing, you seem to be actively working to undermine and distort the scientific evidence itself.So that I can understand the basis for EPA's views and involvement in shaping the Trump Administration's response to its own report, I ask that you provide me with the following materials, no later than January 15, 2019:1.

CohenCOP24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended after two weeks of negotiations with very little to show for the efforts of the thousands of participants.The 24th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended after two weeks of negotiations with very little to show for the efforts of the thousands of participants.Unprecedented RejectionCOP24 got off to a rough beginning, with delegates failing to adopt the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) October 2018 special report describing the purported pending dangers from human-caused climate change.The 2015 Paris climate agreement was predicated on the IPCC's previous report's claims global greenhouse gas emissions would have to be reduced 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050, to keep global temperatures from approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, in order to prevent a variety of disastrous consequences.IPCC's most recent report, however, claimed those cuts would be too little, too late, instead arguing the world must reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2030 and emissions of greenhouse gases must be net-zero by 2050 in order to hit the temperature targets.Historically, each new IPCC report has been ""welcomed"" at the COP meeting following its release, indicating the countries participating in the climate negotiations accepted the report as establishing the scientific background for negotiations. At COP24, however, Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States objected to the word ""welcoming,"" offering instead to ""take note"" of the report. Other countries objected to this proposal because it would not specifically endorse IPCC's findings.Because COP meetings operate on consensus, the lack of agreement meant all references to the report in the UNFCCC's rules and negotiations document had to be dropped, a first for a COP meeting. Big FailuresAfter marathon negotiations, representatives from nearly 200 countries who had gathered in Katowice, Poland from December 2 through December 14 failed to provide any additional commitments of funding for developing countries to adapt to climate change and could not tighten the required greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond what was agreed to in Paris in 2015, despite IPCC's special report saying greater cuts are necessary to avoid environmental disasters.Putting another damper on the proceedings, reports released shortly before the meetings showed greenhouse gas emissions had grown substantially over the past three years, proving governments were failing to reach the emission reduction commitments they made in the 2015 agreement.In addition, Brazil's newly elected President, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew his country's invitation to host COP25 and said he would follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead and withdraw Brazil from the 2015 Paris climate treaty.The only concrete accomplishment delegates to COP24 could claim was adoption of a 156-page ""rule book"" outlining agreed-upon methods for tracking and counting carbon dioxide emissions. Like the emission reduction commitments in the 2015 agreement, the rule book's accounting mechanisms are nonbinding.COP25 is scheduled to take place in Chile in late 2019.'Entirely About Redistributing Wealth'The UN's climate agenda is about controlling the economy and directing resources to favored people, not about saving the Earth from runaway warming, says Jay Lehr, Ph.D., science director at The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment and Climate News.""The world is beginning to wake up to the fact these COP meetings have almost nothing to do with protecting the environment or preventing climate change,"" said Lehr. ""The meetings are entirely about redistributing wealth from developed countries to elites in less-developed nations and ensuring socialism is the order of the day.""If the UN successfully eliminates fossil fuels, the predictable consequence will be the poor around the world will remain poor, because they will be denied access to affordable and reliable energy,"" Lehr said.Weeks of fuel riots in France and the removal of various political leaders over their climate stances show a widening gap between governing elites and ordinary citizens, says Craig Rucker, president of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), who attended the UN conference in Poland.""From France's 'yellow vests' to Poland's coal miners, to leaders being replaced in Australia, Ontario, and Brazil, a growing number of people are no longer willing to meekly accept what is handed down to them from on high,"" Rucker said.""The resistance is visceral, and it's not going away,"" Rucker said.Bonner R.

The finalisation of these rules was deferred at COP24 for further work in 2019 ahead of final agreement at COP25.""Access to deep, liquid and efficient international markets will be important to achieve least cost emissions abatement for many nations, including Australia. The oil and gas industry looks forward to negotiators arriving at effective outcomes during the year and that rules to underpin international trade are finalised by the end of 2019,"" Dr Roberts said.""In addition, carry-over of emission reductions from the first and second Kyoto commitment periods to Australia's 2030 emission reduction commitments has reduced Australia's abatement challenge. Such an approach has been used by all Australian Governments since 2008 and was reaffirmed at COP24.""Australia's LNG projects will deliver decades of economic growth, jobs and exports, as well as strong regional and global environmental benefits.""While the projections show the production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for export also results in greenhouse gas emissions, a conservative estimate released by the government earlier in December found Australia's LNG exports have the potential to save importing countries 130 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year.""When used instead of other traditional fuels, LNG cuts emissions by half in many cases. LNG also helps developing countries to reduce air pollution, a major cause of millions of premature deaths."" This is a key reason Australia's second largest LNG market, China, has a range of policies to increase its use of gas. Natural gas consumption in China, including from Australian LNG imports, has risen sharply as a result of strengthened action against air pollution. Together, the various policies could see natural gas consumption increase by 112 billion cubic metres (bcm) over 2016-2020[1].112 bcm represents more than Australia's expected LNG to exports to China in 2020 and highlights the way in which Australia's LNG is reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and helping developing countries to reduce air pollution.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6564004 MSTRUCK\l"

These recommendations focus on three themes: establishing more supportive regulatory environments, integrating NWS within a utility's standard operating procedures and adapting current utility procurement practices to effectively support NWS sourcing.For the past decade, regulated utilities have spent an average of $55 billion annually upgrading their distribution, transmission and generation infrastructure to meet customer needs. The largest share of this investment has been in distribution infrastructure to maintain and modernize the last-mile networks that deliver energy to homes and businesses.Using the Playbook, grid planners can improve on this approach to infrastructure investment by more systematically evaluating opportunities to deploy modular--and often lower-cost--NWS portfolios. Doing so reduces the risk that infrastructure investments based on uncertain forecasts may burden ratepayers with higher electricity bills for years to come if demand growth doesn't materialize, and provides a time-value-of-money benefit since investments can be delayed until needs are realized.""Utilities are facing new challenges to support the health of a grid that is aging, alongside new customer demands for energy choice and cleaner energy,"" Jeff Waller, a principal at RMI and one of the report's authors, said. ""The proliferation of DERs and the growing ability and confidence of grid planners to integrate them into grid operations promises to lower customer costs, cut emissions and diversify the service offerings utilities can offer their customers. We hope our Playbook can be a valuable resource to speed the delivery of these benefits through the deployment of NWS.""The Playbook also includes practical NWS implementation guidel"

The guide highlights the crucial role of scaling up climate action by integrating human settlements into national adaptation planning and processes.As over two-thirds of the global population becomes urban by 2050, it will be faced with risks from a range of potential impacts of climate change including rise in sea levels, extreme variations in climate, and other related disasters. Urgent action is required to address the inter-connected issues of poverty, governance, and climate vulnerability both in cities and at the national level. Robust and comprehensive National Adaptation Plans (NAP) are important tools in delivering the adaptation needs and priorities of nations as detailed in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Cities are a critical location to achieve these NDC targets as 113 countries have urban priorities in their NDCs, much of it focusing on adaptation.The NDC Partnership, UNDP and UN-Habitat convened participants from local and national governments and the climate finance community to discuss opportunities for connecting local climate adaptation action with national policy and planning [ HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/2BhhznJhttps://bit.ly/2BhhznJClimate Change Adaptation takes top-priority both at national level and local levels. The Mayor of Quelimane, Mozambique Manuel Araujo explains that ""city leaders are dealing with climate change daily and we need to engage with partners at national and regional levels, as well as other cities dealing with the same issues like us."" The City of Quelimane has developed a local adaptation plan which is being integrated into the National Adaptation Plan. It has thus contributed positively to national efforts along with other cities, the National Association of Municipalities of Mozambique (ANAMM) and international partners.Integrating human settlements and key stakeholders of the national urban development community into national adaptation planning will strengthen National Adaptation Plans and processes, enhance climate action and promote the process of building resilient nations.

He also recently launched the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, whose goal is selecting 1,000 solutions that would protect the environment in a profitable way.These solutions are to be offered to world decision makers at COP24; the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 24), which is scheduled for Dec. 3-14 in Katowice, Slaskie, Poland. The World Alliance also hopes to encourage these leaders to adopt more ambitious environmental targets and energy policies.Bertrand Piccard pushes the boundaries of the possible with his pioneering spirit, said Chris Strong, NBAA senior vice president of conventions and membership. That pioneering spirit is among the hallmarks of the business aviation industry, and we know convention attendees will be inspired by his personal story and perspectives about what is possible in aviation and beyond.The Solar Impulse project was created to demonstrate the abilities of renewable energies and promote energy savings. The Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and economy, bringing together protection of the environment and financial viability to show that these solutions are not expensive fixes to problems, but rather opportunities for clean economic growth.The Solar Impulse 2 solar-powered aircraft departed from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, traversed Asia, then completed its longest leg from Japan to Hawaii. On that leg, the aircrafts batteries sustained substantial damage that required repair, but the flight eventually continued from Hawaii to California, across the U.S., over the Atlantic Ocean to Spain and back to its starting point in Abu Dhabi. Solar Impulse 2 completed its 26,000-mile round-the-world mission without using a drop of fuel in July 2016.Piccard was a speaker at the opening session for the 2017 edition of the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (EBACE).NBAA-BACE is business aviations most important annual event, where participants have an unequaled opportunity to view the latest business aircraft, products, technology, and services the industry offers.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA279","COLLEGE MEETING","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Commission:Commission discusses Italy's fiscal measures, Brexit, Poland and reports on EU Visa policy and EU-U.S. privacy shieldItaly's draft budget planThe European Commission has today sent a letter to the Italian government regarding the fiscal measures set out by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Finance Minister Giovanni Tria in their letter of 18 December. On 21 November, the Commission adopted an Opinion on the revised draft budgetary plan of Italy, confirming a ""particularly serious non-compliance"" with the recommendation made by the Council of the European Union to Italy on 13 July. This was followed by a report under Article 126(3) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, concluding that an Excessive Deficit Procedure for non-compliance with the debt criterion was warranted. This conclusion was shared by the Eurogroup of 3 December, which also supported the ongoing dialogue between the Commission and the Italian authorities. Today's letter takes note of the new fiscal measures presented by the Italian government and indicates that if they are voted by the Italian parliament before the end of the year, this would allow the European Commission not to recommend the opening of an Excessive Deficit Procedure at this stageVisa liberalisationThe Commission reported on its assessment of the fulfilment of the visa liberalisation benchmarks by the Western Balkan countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia as well as the Eastern Partnership countries: Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. This annual report shows that the visa liberalisation requirements for the concerned countries continue to be met but that action in some cases immediate is required for a number of countries in specific areas to ensure this continues to be the case.Visa non-reciprocityThe Commission reported on progress made in the past 12 months towards achieving visa-reciprocity with the United States, as the only remaining case of non-reciprocity. Visa reciprocity is a fundamental principle of the European Union's common visa policy, and the Commission remains fully committed to achieving visa free travel to the United States for all EU Member States as a matter of priority. To this end, the Commission will continue to engage with the United States, in coordination with the five Member States whose citizens still need a visa to travel to the United States, in a result-oriented process.EU-U.S. Privacy ShieldThe Commission published its report on the second annual review of the functioning of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. This year's report shows that the U.S. continues to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred under the Privacy Shield from the EU to participating companies in the U.S. The steps taken by the U.S. authorities to implement the recommendations made by the Commission in last year's report have improved the functioning of the framework.However, the Commission does expect the US authorities to nominate a permanent Ombudsperson by 28 February 2019 to replace the one that is currently acting. The Ombudsperson is an important mechanism that ensures complaints concerning access to personal data by U.S. authorities are addressed.PolandFirst Vice-President Frans Timmermans debriefed the College on the infringement cases launched by the Commission against Poland, in particular following the Court order issued by the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice two days ago. Poland has until 17 January to report to the European Commission what measures it has taken in order to comply with the order. In the meantime the Commission will analyse the new law adopted by Poland to comply with the order and monitor its implementation. The First Vice-President also addressed the disciplinary measures taken against some judges who had referred preliminary rulings to the European Court of justice. He has also informed his colleagues of the outcome of the third hearing of Poland in the framework of Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union, which took place at the General Affairs Council on 11 December.United Nations Vice-President Maros ef\'c4ovi\'c4 and Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete debriefed the College on the outcome of the United Nations , in Katowice and Michel Barnier, the European Commission Chief Negotiator for Article 50 negotiations, presented to Commissioners the current situation in the United Kingdom.BrexitGiven the continued uncertainty in the UK surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, as agreed between the EU and the UK on 25 November 2018 and as announced by President Juncker following last week's call by the European Council (Article 50) to intensify preparedness work at all levels and for all outcomes the European Commission has today started implementing its ""no-deal"" Contingency Action Plan.

At COP24, however, Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States objected to the word ""welcoming,"" offering instead to \~""take note"" of the report. Other countries objected to this proposal because it would not specifically endorse IPCC's findings.Because COP meetings operate on consensus, the lack of agreement meant all references to the report in the UNFCCC's rules and negotiations document had to be dropped, a first for a COP meeting. Big FailuresAfter marathon negotiations, representatives from nearly 200 countries who had gathered in Katowice, Poland from December 2 through December 14 failed to provide any additional commitments of funding for developing countries to adapt to climate change and could not tighten the required greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond what was agreed to in Paris in 2015, despite IPCC's special report saying greater cuts are necessary to avoid environmental disasters.Putting another damper on the proceedings, reports released shortly before the meetings showed greenhouse gas emissions had grown substantially over the past three years, proving governments were failing to reach the emission reduction commitments they made in the 2015 agreement.In addition, Brazil's newly elected President, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew his country's invitation to host COP25 and said he would follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead and withdraw Brazil from the 2015 Paris climate treaty.The only concrete accomplishment delegates to COP24 could claim was adoption of a 156-page ""rule book"" outlining agreed-upon methods for tracking and counting carbon dioxide emissions. Like the emission reduction commitments in the 2015 agreement, the rule book's accounting mechanisms are nonbinding.COP25 is scheduled to take place in Chile in late 2019.'Entirely About Redistributing Wealth'The UN's climate agenda is about controlling the economy and directing resources to favored people, not about saving the Earth from runaway warming, says Jay Lehr, Ph.D., science director at The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment & Climate News.""The world is beginning to wake up to the fact these COP meetings have almost nothing to do with protecting the environment or preventing climate change,"" said Lehr. ""The meetings are entirely about redistributing wealth from developed countries to elites in less-developed nations and ensuring socialism is the order of the day.""If the UN successfully eliminates fossil fuels, the predictable consequence will be the poor around the world will remain poor, because they will be denied access to affordable and reliable energy,"" Lehr said.Weeks of fuel riots in France and the removal of various political leaders over their climate stances show a widening gap between governing elites and ordinary citizens, says Craig Rucker, president of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), who attended the UN conference in Poland.""From France's 'yellow vests' to Poland's coal miners, to leaders being replaced in Australia, Ontario, and Brazil, a growing number of people are no longer willing to meekly accept what is handed down to them from on high,"" Rucker said.""The resistance is visceral, and it's not going away,"" Rucker said.Bonner R.

The Season of Creation began as an initiative from the Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios in 1989. It has since been endorsed and recommended to the Anglican Communion by the Anglican Consultative Council; and by Pope Francis for the Roman Catholic Church. It runs from the World Day of Prayer for Creation on 1 September to the feast of St Francis of Assisi on 4 October. For the past few years, the Anglican Communion Environmental Network as teamed up with the Global Catholic Climate Movement and other agencies to provide a range of resources to help Christians around the world make the most of the season. This year\' s theme,  Walking Together has inspired the first Ecumenical Care for Creation event in the Italian town of Assisi. On the afternoon of Friday 31 August, Christians will gather in Assisi\' s Vescovado Plaza, where Saint Francis publicly renounced his father\' s wealth, for the start of two-days of prayer. Between 5 pm on 31 August and 11 am on Saturday 1 September, prayer will take place there, at the Room of Reunification, the Chapel of Saint Damian in the Basilica of Saint Clare, and at the Upper Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi. In a message inviting churches to participate in this year\' s Season of Creation, organisers said:  As the environmental crisis deepens, we Christians are urgently called to witness to our faith by taking bold action to preserve the gift we share.  During the Season of Creation, we ask ourselves: Do our actions honour the Lord as Creator? Are there ways to deepen our faith by protecting \' the least of these\' , who are most vulnerable to the consequences of environmental degradation?  During this season, we walk together towards greater stewardship of our place in creation. At the conclusion of the events in Assisi, a group of pilgrims will begin a pilgrimage to Katowice, the venue for this year\' s annual UN consultation on climate change, COP24. They will set off from St Francis\' Basilica at 11 am on 1 September and walk to Gubbio on the first leg of  The Path of Francis pilgrimage. Organisers describe the COP24 meeting as  a crucial international event for the real implementation of the Paris Agreement. Amongst those taking part in the two-day event in Assisi are Archbishop Bernard Ntahoturi, Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome; and Elizabeth Bussmann, environmental officer for the Church of England\' s Diocese in Europe.

Shot in 2015, The Standing March features 500 individual models 'united around the idea that the [Paris] conference must end up with meaningful agreements between the countries.' According to the directors[3], each subject was filmed separately and then digitally composited into a crowd shot. It was originally projected onto Paris' Assemble Nationale building. Aronofsky is an American director and screenwriter whose credits include Oscar-winning and nominated movies like Black Swan and The Wrestler. JR[4] is an anonymous French photographer who often turns his black and white portraits into street art. The Global Climate Action Summit happened in SF from September 12 through 14, co-charied by California Governor Jerry Brown and UN Executive Secretary on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa, among others.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) News Release","August 21, 2018","Congressional Documents and Publications","Washington, DC - U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) issued the following statement in response to the Trump administration's roll back of crucial power plant carbon emission standards that were implemented by the Obama administration. The Trump administration released new pollution rules that replace the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan with a new agenda that caters to the fossil fuel industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Trump administration's proposed regulations would increase carbon emissions, leading up to an estimated 1,400 premature deaths each year.""The President's continued efforts to undo the progress we've made to combat the effects of climate change are threatening the health and safety of the American people,"" said Shaheen. ""Rising temperatures interrupt New Hampshire's fall foliage season and maple syrup production, directly impeding our business and tourism sectors, and elevated sea levels put the homes and livelihoods of our Seacoast families at risk. It is unconscionable that the administration is knowingly pursuing a policy that puts the wellbeing of the fossil fuel industry over American lives. The President's actions also undermine years of work by small businesses in New Hampshire and across the nation that were incentivized under the Obama administration to prioritize technology in renewable energy and to curb carbon emissions. I'm deeply concerned by the President's destructive efforts to unravel necessary protections that safeguard our air, water and land, and that preserve our environment and wildlife. I'll continue to oppose the administration's dangerous policies that put Americans' health at risk and jeopardize the sustainability of our planet.""Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris climate accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy as part of the omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2018. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the President's anti-environment agenda, and cosponsored legislation that would rescind President Trump's anti-climate executive order and restore our nation's leadership role in the fight against global climate change.Read this original document at: HYPERLINK https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/shaheen-statement-on-trump-roll-back-of-clean-power-planhttps://www.shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/shaheen-statement-on-trump-roll-back-of-clean-power-plan\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA289","NATIONAL STATEMENT BY ISABELLA LVIN, MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION AND CLIMATE AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, AT COP24","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Government of Sweden:Check against delivery.The effects of climate change are already here. People see them with their own eyes, live the effect of them around the world. In Sweden we experienced an extremely hot summer this year, with drought and violent forest fires in the Arctic region like never before. We watch the news and we see wildfires in California, hurricanes hitting the Caribbean and the Pacific, violent torrential rains in Japan and droughts in Africa, and we can no longer ignore the disastrous consequences for this planet and all future generations if we do not take action now.Some people say we should not talk about the enormous threat of climate change because then people might lose hope. But to quote Greta Thunberg, a remarkable 15-year old climate activist from Sweden, the world does not need hope. It needs action. But when we take action hope is everywhere.The action that is needed here in Katowice is deciding on a robust, detailed, clear and stable rulebook for the Paris Agreement. A transparent rulebook that creates comparability and predictability, and also enables the necessary flexibility and crucially increased ambition over time.Every school child today knows about science. Scientific knowledge is more precise than ever. The IPCC 1.5 degree report provides abundant clarity as to the need for action. And it does not leave room for hesitation.Our leadership is called for by our children. We need to show a predictable pathway towards low-carbon economies. Our constituencies need and demand it, and luckily business increasingly echoes those sentiments.With the Fossil-free Sweden initiative, we enable dialogue between government at all levels, industry, and stakeholders. It has resulted in the industries themselves developing concrete roadmaps for fossil-free competitiveness in many sectors. From the steel, cement and aviation industries, to the forest and retail sectors, as well as many more. This shows action is possible.Low-carbon transition offers new opportunities for investments, jobs and better lives. The Swedish economy has grown substantially, by more than 60 per cent, while our emissions are down more than 25 per cent since the early 1990s.We want to, and look forward to, continue sharing our experience on policies, financing and technology with partners.We believe developed countries must lead the first step of a global transition, encouraging and supporting others to move forward. We also know climate change hits some countries and regions harder than others. The least developed countries and small island states face very real and pressing danger. Developed countries must lead the first steps of a global transition, encouraging and supporting others to move forward.Therefore, Sweden is proud to be one of the largest per capita providers of climate finance globally. I am also happy that here in Katowice we have been able to announce an additional contribution for 2018 of SEK 50 million each to the Adaptation Fund and the Least Developed Countries Fund. This is in addition to the contributions announced at COP23.Ladies and gentlemen,We warmly welcome the initiative from the United Nations Secretary-General to organise the Climate Summit in 2019. The summit will serve as an important complement to the UNFCCC process to mobilise political willingness to act and to demonstrate transformative action.We need action. The cost of inaction is monumental; impossible to quantify. Nations are disappearing, ecological systems are being damaged beyond repair. The difference between 2 degrees and 1.5 is vast: we must pursue the most ambitious outcome.And our duty as leaders is to ensure that the transition benefits all. An inclusive approach is part of the spirit of Paris and the 2030 Agenda. It requires full engagement from all stakeholders. It requires rules.\l"

Scientists found that climate change could be linked to all of the 11 heatwaves they examined and to four droughts, seven rainfall and flooding events, six storms, one wildfire and three cold weather-related events. A number of those studies examined events in the U.S.Although hurricanes and droughts are naturally occurring phenomena, scientists determined that climate change made certain events more likely to occur, increased the chance of those events happening more often, increased the intensity of those events or caused specific event-related impacts tied to climate change.""The old argument that you can't link climate change to any particular weather event is now dead, I mean that's just now wrong,"" the think tank's director, Richard Black, said in announcing the study at a side event of the 24th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, more commonly referred to as COP24, in Katowice, Poland.Meanwhile, the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society published a special report Dec. 10 consisting of multiple scientific papers on climate change, including some that linked global warming to extreme weather events in 2017 such as droughts in the U.S. northern Great Plains and east Africa, heatwaves in the European-Mediterranean region, and extreme flooding and rainfall in China, Peru and Bangladesh. The report also included a study on how water managers may want to revise their plans in light of the flooding that led to infrastructure damage around the Oroville Dam in California and flooding in Texas following Hurricane Harvey.Delegates from more than 190 countries at COP24 are in their second and final week of negotiations to create a rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. Although President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. from the Paris accord, which aims to reduce emissions enough to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees C from pre-industrial levels, Trump did send delegates to the climate talks.

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA291","AFRICAN COUNTRIES DESERVE AN ENHANCED CLIMATE AMBITION","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","African countries have been at the climate-change negotiating table for more than 20 years. The continent faces some of the most severe impacts of climate change, but questions remain over its adaptive capacity despite this engagement.African civil society organizations, trade unions and governments have advocated for three main means of implementation: climate finance for adaptation and mitigation; technology transfer; and capacity building.COP24) to the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (UNFCCC) currently taking place in Katowice, Poland from 2 to 14 December.Through the Paris Work Programme (PAWP) expected to be adopted in Poland, African countries expect that COP 24 will deliver on the continent's expectations with regards to facilitating climate resilience.Climate finance for adaptation and mitigation Climate change is impacting all economies in Africa, a continent highly dependent on agriculture. The impact is increasing the already high inequality, as resources meant for investment in social amenities are being channelled into climate-change adaptation.In this case, due to climate change related disasters like droughts and flooding, there is an adverse impact on agricultural production-namely food insecurity. Therefore, resources meant to provide other services like universal and affordable health care, expansion of infrastructure and other social services for the poor are channelled to climate change response initiatives.During the COP 16, the world's developed countries agreed to mobilize 100 billion US dollars per year by the year 2020 for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. This is still a pipe dream as only 10 billion US dollars have been mobilized so far since the establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2006 to date.Additionally, African countries continue to face difficulties in accessing the funds as they are on a perpetual treadmill of paperwork to even qualify to receive any of the funds earmarked for them. Is imperative of global social justice that this funding be fast-tracked.As countries head to Poland, African nations approach the negotiations with the hope that issues dealing with transparency and accountability on climate financing will be made clearer and smoother. Otherwise, African countries will be obliged to divert more domestic resources to meeting their commitments under their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which could affect other development priorities.If promised international funding is not forthcoming and the shortfall needs to be made up from scarce domestic resources, this can mean these resources are no longer available at national level for example for social protection measures or food security. The decision in Poland should therefore be clear on provision, transparency and accountability of climate financing.Technology transfer and capacity building Many adaptation and mitigation solutions will require technology as well as financing, for the purposes of innovation and upscaling across various sectors. Technology transfer, therefore, is critical for African countries.One of the concerns for African countries is the sheer lack of capacity to implement new technologies for climate-change responses. But Africa has the potential to also transfer technology to the north if the existing low carbon technologies that incorporate the already existing indigenous knowledge of African countries are expanded.Therefore, a provision for reverse transfer from South to North with regard to technology should also be provided. At the moment the discussion is being handled as North-South transfer only.Africa is also cautious of becoming a testing ground for new technologies. Therefore, technologies from the north should be tried and tested before being transferred to Africa-for example short-lived solar panel technologies that end up being very expensive in the long run-a key issue that needs to be part of the discussions at COP 24.Climate change needs to be tackled on a global level and in a just manner The climate-change crisis is now being felt in developed countries. As Europe and America battle wildfires amid massive heat waves over the past year, the impact in Africa is felt even stronger.The increasing frequency of droughts and flooding, and consequently increased risk of violent conflict in already volatile regions, present a major threat to livelihoods on the African continent. Looking ahead to Poland, it is the hope of African countries that these impacts will be reflected in the outcome document.Lastly, as parties move towards operationalization of the Paris Agreement, it is important to ensure that the commitments towards promoting decent work and a just transition are properly articulated in the Paris Work Programme.This is key because climate change is already having significant impacts on the world of work in Africa. Over 60 per cent of Africa's economically active population works in and lives off the agricultural sector, which is adversely affected by climate change.The transition to low-carbon economies offers great potential for green jobs creation, in areas such as the renewable-energy sector. This transition process however means that current existing jobs that do not offer sustainable production methods will be at a risk. It is important to ensure that this transition happens in a socially just and inclusive manner.Therefore, a socially and ecologically just outcome from COP 24 must take into consideration the African demands on the means of implementation (climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building) for adaptation and mitigation as well as the necessity of a just transition.For more information on the work by FES in Kenya visit the country office website and follow the official Facebook fan page.\l"

"COP24","USA","COP24_USA296","COP 24: Climate Summit Language Reveals Hidden Agenda","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Heartland Institute","People complain about UN jargon but the technical language of the Katowice climate summit is very revealing. It is all about changing the world order.Words exist because there is something important to talk about. Words also embody basic beliefs. In\~this context it is very useful that the ever-green Climate Change News has published a\~Glossary\~of the 32 technical terms they think are most important in Katowice.Analyzing this list tells us a great deal about what is really going one. To begin with, there is not one word on the list that is about climate or climate change. So calling this a climate summit is just a semantic smokescreen. These folks are designing a new world order. The primary focus is how the world will be changed and who is going to pay for it.In fact the largest group of terms is those that refer to the various political alliances at the new-order design table. There are 12 such groups, plus the term ""negotiating group"" itself. These are groups of countries that feel they share enough of a common interest to team up. Thus a full 41% of the technical terms refer to interest groups.The largest negotiating group by far is called the G77 + China. Despite the old name, this group has 134 member countries. I have no idea why China gets special mention, except it is by far the most powerful member. These are the countries that stand to benefit hugely from the new world order, because its central feature is huge, never ending payments from the so-called developed countries to the developing countries. (I say so-called because the U.S. is still developing.)Africa has its own group, since they stand to make more money per capita then any other region. The U.S. is part of something innocuously called the Umbrella Group, which includes many developed countries outside of the EU, which is a group of its own. Brexit appears not to have happened here, because the UK is not listed separately from the EU.The avowed Socialists from the western hemisphere even have their own group of 11, further demonstrating that this Katowice business is all about a new world order, not climate change. Mind you these socialists are not the only anti-capitalists at the table, far from it.The next largest language group is of 5 wealth transfer terms. The definition specifically says that this is ""a central element"" of the new world order (which it calls ""international cooperation""). One of these terms is ""climate finance"" but it is not about financing climate, whatever that might mean. It is about the developed countries paying for everything the developing countries do in the name of stopping, or at least adapting to, supposedly human caused climate change. Annual payments of $100 billion are supposed to begin in 2020, but may well rise thereafter, if developing countries decide to do more, which they no doubt would. The more they do the more money they get.But this $100 billion a year is by no means the big ticket when it comes to payments. That honor belongs to something called ""loss and damage."" This is basically all of the damage caused by climate change, which now looks to be all bad weather. Every hurricane, drought, wildfire, snowstorm and flood is now attributed to human caused climate change, not to mention sea level rise.The Paris Accord acknowledges loss and damage but stops short of requiring the developed countries to pay for it. That they do pay is certainly part of the new order agenda. The tentative figure put out by the UN is $400 billion a year, but it could easily get much bigger. There is a lot of bad weather in the world.One of the sneakier wealth transfer terms is ""technology transfer."" In the US this term is widely used to mean the licensing of new technologies to companies, who then move them from the laboratory to widespread use. At Katowice the term means something entirely different, including the unlicensing of technologies.The idea is that companies holding patents will waive them, to allow developing countries to manufacture the patented stuff free of charge. It can even mean that these companies build manufacturing facilities and train the workers, also for free. I am not making this up.Then there are various important words referring to other aspects of the new world order, as well as to specific actions to be taken along the way. Chief among these are the ""Nationally determined contributions"" (NDCs), which are what each country promises to do.The NDCs are defined as ""climate targets"" but of course they are not target climates. They are milestones on the way to the new world order. As with most of this UN summit language, ""climate"" is a code word. The NDCs are to be renewed every five years, including in 2020, so this is another hidden agenda item in Katowice.In short, what is on the table at Katowice is moving toward a new world order, in the name of dealing with supposedly human caused climate change. One of the central elements is a vast wealth transfer from the developed countries like the U.S. to the developing countries.This is something the UN has always wanted to do and the climate change scare is their grand chance, or so they think anyway. Tens of thousands of national negotiators from around the world are hard at it in Poland.\l"

Participating countries have already submitted written pledges to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, by transitioning to cleaner energy sources and by promoting energy efficiency. But rules were needed to ensure that countries could monitor each other's actions, and properly measure their impacts.""Today's agreement is a solid step in the right direction,"" said EESI Executive Director Carol Werner. ""The details still need to be ironed out, but the agreed-upon rules set the stage for the effective implementation of the commitment made in Paris to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The international community also agreed to increase its greenhouse gas reduction commitments by 2020, and to provide more financing for vulnerable nations. But does this get us to where we need to be? No. The global community has failed to seize an opportunity to take the truly decisive, urgent action we need to see. The latest U.N. climate report, Global Warming of 1.5 -C, warns that we really should be aiming to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius--not 2--and that we only have 12 years left to act if we want to avoid drastic consequences.""Shockingly, the United States joined three other major oil-producing countries--Kuwait, Russia, and Saudi Arabia--to block language that would have embraced the 1.5 C Report and called for more urgent, ambitious climate action. The Trump Administration has already indicated that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement at the earliest opportunity, in 2020. In addition, Brazil, under a new administration, blocked rules that would have helped set a carbon trading system.""The failure of the United States to lead on climate action, as it has in the past--it played a key role in getting the Paris Climate Agreement past the finish l"

But Rijsberman, who has been working in the sustainable development sector for decades, knew better. He told his son that those very same oil companies would soon go broke. And instead advised him to seek employment with renewable energy companies as they would soon be the ones making money.As head of GGGI, it is undoubtable that\'c2\~Rijsberman has expert insight into the future of the renewable energy sector. GGGI supports governments around the world transition to environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth by helping them mobilise finance for climate action and implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) i.e. country commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change.With a career spanning over 30 years, Rijsberman is one of the strongest advocates of green growth attending the 24th Conference of the Parties to the\'c2\~United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) in Katowice, Poland.\'c2\~His organisation is organising over 15 events at the conference that are focused on, among other things, how low carbon development, green finance, transparency and capacity development of countries can address climate change.Amidst his packed COP24 schedule, Rijsberman sat down with IPS for a brief interview on the state of global climate action, COP24 and the work of GGGI in attaining green growth.Excerpts from the interview follow: Inter Press Service (IPS): Climate finance has been one of the sticking points at COP24 so far. Developing countries are concerned that the developed world is shifting the role of financial contributions to the private sector. What are your thoughts on this?Dr. Frank Rijsberman (FR): Firstly, there needs to be a clean definition of the 100 billion dollars climate finance pledged to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This 100 billion shouldn't be diluted. We need this 100 billion to be clean and green. But at the same time, this is only a small part of what we need to fight climate change. We need trillions, and for that public finance is not enough. This will only come about if we get the institutional investors off the sidel"

It remains to be seen just which part of its influence will hold the most sway as world leaders again convene to try to move forward on climate action.The fractured nature of US presence here in Katowice reflects the sharply divided political climate back home, with Trump administration officials touting fossil fuel innovations and more local representatives from individual states and cities offering a patchwork of grassroots dedication to climate action. A gulf of politically charged mistrust separates these opposing camps. A third element of career officials is attempting to sidestep US politics entirely and forge ahead as active participants in these collective negotiations.On the political side, Trump administration officials on Monday held a highly visible and controversial panel that was an unapologetic promotion of coal, oil, gas, and nuclear energy, and which was interrupted part-way through by protesters offering a heated response to that message.Acting as a counterbalance to that official US stance, stands the ""We are still in"" coalition of subnational entities - states, cities, businesses, and other organizations - who are still committed to America's Paris Agreement targets. These groups aren't able to officially represent the US or negotiate on its behalf, but they're a visible presence here, reminding the world that the Trump administration represents only one segment of America, and that much of the country is continuing to work on climate mitigation.But more quietly a small US delegation is still actively participating in negotiations, helping to hammer out agreements on issues like transparency and finance as countries work to agree on a ""rulebook"" that lays out how the Paris Agreement will actively be implemented. Generally career civil servants, they're working on technical issues where the US position remains relatively unchanged and they can serve a constructive role.On the sidel"

Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, ranking Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following floor remarks on the negotiations at COP24, the 2018 Climate Change Conference, where parties are negotiating the implementation of the Paris agreement:  The Senator criticized the Trump administration for its lack of leadership on climate diplomacy, its persistent climate change denialism and its refusal to engage with the international community on this issue.""For decades, the science has yielded increasing causes for concern. Today, the connection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions -- primarily fossil fuel combustion--and climate change is undeniable.""Three major reports on the growing climate crisis have been published in the last 30 days alone.""That includes reports from the world's top climate scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN Environment Programme. That includes the National Climate Assessment, which was assembled by 13 federal agencies and 300 government experts. Our Federal agencies, our government experts.""What the scientists are telling us is that robust and immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. Changes that have already begun to affect every single American.""There's a tendency to dismiss scientific reports as abstract, as hard to understand. The President seems to simply not believe them. So let me speak plainly--the consequences of climate change are anything but abstract.""Regional food and water shortages. Inundation of island nations and coastal communities that are home to billions of people around the world. Mass migration and refugee crises.""Our own National Climate Assessment makes clear that the United States--for all of our wealth and good fortune--is far from immune from the effects of climate change. If we fail to confront this challenge, the U.S. will experience effects that will cost American lives and billions in losses to our national economy.""While we shouldn't point to any single event as evidence, the changes in trends depicting climate change's harsh reality are undeniable.""It is a fact that the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8 Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit) since 1880 and two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.""It is a fact that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in many regions of the U.S. are increasing, including conditions that heighten wildfire risks.""It is a fact that sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades, wherein 2017, global mean sea level was three inches above the 1993 average--the highest annual average in the satellite record.""None of these facts are new.
